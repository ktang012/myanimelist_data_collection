            "content": "One misconception in the anime industry is that when a show is dark and contains excessive amounts of gore. Many people automatically think the show is deep and thought provoking. The problem is that many anime studios get so hung up with making the show as badass and dark as possible that they forget about the more important problems that might plague the show, like character development and pacing. \r\nAkame Ga Kill is a great example of this problem.\r\nThe story follows Tatsumi, a countryside boy that travels to the capital to join the military and earn money to send to his village suffering from poverty.Tohim the capital is a place filled with opportunities and a happy life. But after reaching the capital he soon realizes exactly how corrupt the capital is. After certain events he is recruited by Night Raid, A group of assassins that wish to overthrow the government and end this corruption.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface Akame ga Kill does seem to be different from other shounens because of it's dark theme and excessive gore. But when you look a little bit deeper Akame ga Kill is actually pretty similar to other stereotypical shounens. You have characters always blurting out the obvious. You have the naive yet strong protagonist that powers up over time. You have almost all of the female characters fall for the protagonist. Akame ga Kill tries to be different show with it's dark theme, but looking at it closer there isn't much difference.\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the more prominent problems in Akame ga Kill is the comedy. The problem isn't in the comedy itself. (Though I admit most of the humor was stale) but rather the execution. Apparently someone thought it was a good idea to slide in a petty joke in many emotional or dramatic scenes. Probably the best example of this would be a scene where Tatsumi finds out about the corruption in the capital and mourns over his loved ones that died to this corruption. This was supposed to be a very emotional scene but then Night Raid kidnaps Tatsumi and makes petty jokes along the way. It is scenes like this that make me unable to take the show very seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are filled with problems too. Tatsumi isn't really much different from other stereotypical male leads. He's strong, kind, and has a great sense of justice. Something we see in pretty much any other male lead for a stereotypical shounen. The other characters in Night Raid don't fare much better either. You have Mine the tsundere, Bulat the \"Aniki\" type. Shelle the klutz, Leone the \"Onee-san\" type, Lubbock the perverted guy, and Akame, the cold assassin. Now considering the show has Akame's name in the title. You would expect Akame to be one of the most important characters of the show. Sadly, the only background we do get to know about Akame is her backstory. She didn't seem to have much development and emotions except for a few scenes.Almost all of the characters feel pretty one-sided and unoriginal. There are two new additions to Night Raid later on in the show. Chelsea and Susanoo. And probably out of all of the characters in Akame ga Kill, I found Chelsea to be the most memorable.Why? Because she actually feels realistic. Although Chelsea seems to be very confident and powerful. She is just like any other girl at her age. She likes to use make up, she has her own beliefs, and she felt like an actual person.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other side you have the Jaegars. A special squad led by General Esdeath which goal is to anhiliate Night Raid and any other group that resists against The Empire. The Jaegars seem to be an awkward bunch. You have Bols, who looks like a psychotic murderer with a mask. Kurome, who apparently loves to eat. Dr.Stylish, a crazy mad scientist. That doesn't mean there aren't normal people there. There is Wave who doesn't really have any special qualities and Run, who seems to be the calm and collected person in the group.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Seryuu...\\n\\n\r\nIf there was a person who could embody the word \"crazy\". Seryuu probably fits the word perfectly. Probably the most hated character in the entire show. Seryuu is a person who has a completely twisted view on justice. She believes that everything the empire does is right and that everyone who goes against the empire is evil. Now although she is indeed twisted as hell and it is a normal response to hate her guts. I find that she brings a different point of view to the word \"justice\" in the show. To her the empire is her sense of justice. This outlines the different sense of justice between the two groups and what they are fighting for. Something that the show fails to do in many other places.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Jaegar mostly seemed to be interesting to me, but lack of character development led them to be pretty underwhelming characters. An exception to this would be Esdeath. Probably the most popular character of the show. Esdeath is loved by viewers for her icy demeanor, beauty, and her love of battle. She kills only because of her lust for war and her sadistic nature. She does have a softer nature too, as can be seen when she is searching for love.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I find annoying with Akame Ga Kill is apart from the Jaegars (which mostly were pretty average). Every other villain was bland,exaggerated, and unoriginal that I couldn't help but laugh when I saw them. Most of the supporting villains are either complete psychos or are so obsessed with power that they don't even seem human. This does get better after the introduction of the Jaegars but is it really too much to ask to get a decent villain that I can take seriously?\\n\\n\r\nThe part that makes Akame ga Kill \"different\" from other average shounens is that unlike other shounens, characters die and although this is apparently what makes Akame ga Kill \"special\". This is exactly what makes Akame ga Kill fall short. The problem is that characters don't get nearly enough development before there death.It is usually give the character some screen time in the previous episode. Give them a flashback on there backstories, and send them off. Killing off characters isn't a bad thing at all. In fact, this is exactly what I want from shounens with main characters that either get revived or are invincible. But at least give the characters enough development to actually make the viewers feel something, or else the death scenes feel meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening of Akame ga Kill \"Skyreach\" is pretty average to be honest. Sure it isn't bad but the song just isn't much better than other opening songs. The second opening is a big step up from the first one with the early part sounding quiet and gentle, but slowly grows into a louder song with guitars and the chorus. Which I found to be pretty fitting to the show. Both the ending songs are pretty good,both bringing contrasts to the opening with softer, smoother tunes.The soundtrack ranged from average to pretty good. The songs in the battle scenes weren't anything special but did there jobs of increasing the tension, but the the best parts are the piano tracks for the moments of death.The piano tracks were pretty simple and weren't complex at all, but the tune the tracks carried brought out the tone perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is mostly pretty good.I guess the best word would probably be \"efficient\". Akame ga Kill looks good where it counts and it cuts back in parts that weren't that important. And I respect that. Not every anime has a gigantic budget to work on. (Unless its from KyoAni). The fight scenes looked great and although there were a few scenes that were cut back. Those scenes were mostly negligible and not very noticable.\\n\\n\r\nNow it may seem like I hate the show due to all of my criticism towards the show, but on the contrary. I did enjoy the show to a certain extent. The show isn't terrible by any means, but there were just so many places where Akame ga Kill could have improved on that I find it a shame that it wasn't adapted better. That said though, this show isn't for everyone. If you don't like excessive gore and killing then feel free to steer away from the show. But if you like dark themes and don't have a problem with watching some blood. Akame ga Kill isn't a terrible choice. (Can't say its a great one though.)",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nSometimes, Anime Companies takes the risk to try something different. It may fail or it may succeed, but sometimes, they skyrocket to amazing fame and glory, they even set the tropes for many work to come. The Impression the manga fans gave me about Akame ga Kill before it started that it is a unique and excellent shounen Manga and the Anime adaptation is very likely to be the new trope setter for future shounen works. Now that I have watched all it's episodes, here are my opinion on 2 things:\r\n1 - Do I find it unique? hmmmmmm, yeah, sort of.\r\n2 -Do I find it excellent? Absolutely NOOO. (I talking about the Anime, since this is the Anime's review and I didn't read the Manga).\\n\\n\r\nHere is why I think so:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nWell the story can be simply summarized as follows: \"Evil Government doing evil things to poor citizens so The heroes stay in the shadows and take every chance to kill the villains. After many sacrifices, good defeats evil\".\\n\\n\r\nTo be specific the story focused only on 2 things:\\n\r\n1 - \"Evil Government doing Evil things\".\\n\r\n2 - \"Many Sacrifices\".\\n\\n\r\nFirst, (about point 1) it was easy to notice since the first episode that the villains in this Anime seems to be ... Stupid. They do evil because they enjoy doing evil or they do evil because they are too retared to understand the difference between evil and good. only 3 exceptions were found but they aren't given enough screen time in order to be explored, anyway they were still as stereotypical as ever. What is worse is that the plot keep showing off how evil the villains are by making them meaninglessly do thing to show how evil they are. e.g. there was a scene where Esdeath was uselessly talking about how a flower can be used in torture.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, (about point 2) the Anime tries to force a dark tone by killing off some characters frequently. this caused a severe problem; most characters were not given enough time to show any development, thus their death had no meaning too. It was like the death of some stranger in a car accident; you may feel sorry for him but you quickly forget about him because you know little about him.\\n\\n\r\nThose characters who had enough time to develop, either didn't get enough screen time or were just too simple and stereotypical that there was nothing to explore about their personalities. All Akame ga kill characters lack character development that they can only be used as unimportant side characters for a better story.\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga kill has misused the following cliches:\\n\r\n1 - Death flags: the past of a character is usually revealed shortly before it's death. this was not emotionally effective because of the horrible lack in character development. \\n\r\n2 - Legendary Exclusive Weapons/Abilities: the Imperial Arms had a negative effect on the story. It's unexplained and suddenly revealed trump cards made the battles hard to take seriously as the tension can't be built if we know that the battle can be turned by some magical ability that is made up on the spot. And due to the huge number of Imperial Arms, they felt more of plot devices to for the author to use in twisting the plot without worrying about how logical the twist is. Everything can happen MAGICALLY.\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga kill tried to avoid the following cliches:\\n\r\n1 - Talk no Jutsu: the villains in Akame ga kill don't change sides just because they heared the sound of our protagonist's pure heart. Unfortunately, the author broke this cliche by making the character so stupid that they can't change. Due to the lack of development, the villains are evil just for the sake of evil or stupidity, so they can never change as the only aspect they have is being EVIL.\\n\r\n2 - Plot Armor: ..... Ahhhhh, I understand that the mass killing of characters was meant for making a lot of tension, but did it really kill the plot armor? I mean, how can I feel enough tension when the battles felt so stupid, Trump Card This, Trump Card That, they even had girl with guns poping out of her throat. Sometimes characters felt like they were dropping some chances to give their opponents some time to counter just for plot convenience. If the author want to keep a character alive all he need to do is to add more bizzareness to the situation so that he can slip the character out safely.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the protagonists? They were as stereotypical as ever. The main character that believes in justice and wants to protect their Nakama, the super-skilled silent one with dark past, the tsundere, the pervert, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the revealed past of the characters, they vary from the ones that are so unoriginal that I can't bear to watch them any more like Akame's  and Esdeath's, and the ones that seem interesting but are unfortunately left very vague that I can't effectively reflect them on the character's present like Chelsea's and Najenda's. And of course, there is the main protagonist's past that was just \"404: Background not found\"... No problem anyway, may be there was nothing interesting in it.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with Akame ga Kill is the wasted potential. I loved the setting so much which why sticked to it hopping for something enjoyable (I want my wasted time back T_T). Some characters has shown very good potential but it was blown in the wind like useless dust. (e.g. Esdeath contradiction in believing that it's ok for the weak to be killed and her love for Tatsumi who is obviously weaker than her, and Bols who had loving and caring side, and was self-conscious about his evil deeds, yet continued going down this path) \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Akame ga kill showed good potential but was brutally murdered by it's weakly written plot, misuse of cliches and weakly developed characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\\n\r\nthe visual side of Akame ga kill was average. while some scene were well-drawn, most action scenes were horrible. e.g. most of Akame's scene were like as if she teleported and everyone in the path between her initial and final position have been slashed. I must compliment the two final episode as the animation were much better than the whole series. the character designs were plain, generic and sometimes out of place, especially Akame who was wearing something like a school uniform in a medieval setting.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the openings and endings, and some of the background music were good but nothing really special.\\n\r\nI can't really comment on the voice acting because I'm not a Japanese speaker, but I think that they were able to give the intended emotion through their voice tone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI think this is one of those Anime shows that can be enjoyed better when you don't think much about them. I tried to use this technique to enjoy it but I couldn't, the sudden tone shift were ruining it, the action scenes were horrible, the whole series was just boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nOverall, I can't recommend it to anybody, even Bleach is more enjoyable than this IMO.",

            "content": "Produced by White Fox Studios as 24 episode series, Akame ga Kill! is the anime adaptation of an unfinished manga that follows the exploits of an assassination  group looking to overthrow the corrupt empire.  While it doesn't even have good writing or the proper foundations, there is no denying that this show takes its audience for a wild ride that is filled with bloodshed and explosions. \r\nSet in a fantasy world, Akame ga Kill! begins with a talented but rather naive swordsman named Tatsumi, arriving in Empire's capital city and dreaming of making a name for himself. He quickly finds himself being strippedof his meager savings by a certain feline-looking women called Leona but comes across a wealthy family who decides to graciously shelter him. That very same night, a group called Night Raid hits the household with the intent of assassination. Through a series of twists that exposes the family's atrocities, Tatsumi accepts the offer to join Night Raid and starts on the path towards to assassinating those who they deem to be responsible for  plaguing the Capitol with corruption. However as he and his teammates  continues their campaign against those who stand in their way, the Empire responses by creating their own unit of elite soldiers called The Jaegers to hunt down Night Raid.  \\n\\n\r\nWithin each of their own respective arsenals are incredibly powerful weapons called Imperial Arms that were forged in the early beginnings of the empire. From suits of armor to hand-held weapons and gears, the power within each of these Imperial Arms is unique and the main element to the fighting is countering each others power. Tied in with the usage of Imperial Arms, the primary feature that set Akame ga Kill! apart from other action shows is the alarming frequency in which notable characters are permanently killed. As a general rule, when two or more imperial arms users enter into a fight, at least one of them will die giving the show an huge amount of tension when battles do occur. \\n\\n\r\nWith a focus of ridding the Empire of its corruption, Akame ga Kill! is a very edgy show with that knows no bounds when it comes to displaying the appalling crimes and cruelty that exists within the series. However, the tone that is given doesn't lend itself to be a mature analysis of the mankind's darkness.  More time than not, it comes off as being cheap and I found myself laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of it all. The underlying reasons are mere context and background to the real draw of the show of how the bloody battles unfold. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\r\nFor all the horrific violence that the characters commits, the regular cast is a rather likeable bunch. Named in the title of the anime, Akame is the beautiful wielder of the Murasame, a sword that is guaranteed to kill its enemy with a single cut, and is a rather cold individual from onset. Once the series get underway, she does have some genuinely assuming moments and actually cares deeply for her friends but usually adopts a stoic demeanor during operations and for much of her downtime. Tatsumi, being the gullible and starry eye swordsman from the countryside , is the audience's introduction into the rotten and oppressive Empire and the fight bring about revolution. He starts off as fairly generic but develops into a much more powerful fighter with strong relational ties to others. Opposing Night Raid is the head of the Jeagers, General Esdeath, who is a very voluptuous and sadistic women that enjoys the thrill of the hunt. Believing in a very Darwinian principle of the strong devouring the weak, she is a very formidable foe and yet, is a little ditzy when it comes to the matters of the heart.   \\n\\n\r\nThere are too many other characters to list off and go into details but they all share the common trait of being immensely brutal in their fighting while having comical elements attached to them. They themselves are representative of the strange dichotomy where scenes of slaughter, sexual exposition, and torture are offset by their playful comradery. While they don't having the most compelling back stories or development, the cast of Akame ga Kill certainly doesn't shy away from making their presence known by any stretch of the imagination. I would like to give a particular mention to Akame's VA, Sora Amamiya, for continuing to have an astonishing start to her career. In addition to her main role in Akame ga Kill!, she has taken on no less than four main character roles in Nanatsu no Taizai, Aldnoah.Zero, One Week Friends and Tokyo Ghoul. While her time being Akame has come to an end, I look forward what other roles she can play as she moves through the anime industry. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals \\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking, Akame ga Kill! is an above average effort with a very modern style, vivid colors and a few special effects thrown in for good measure. It does rely on conventional animation when going through its action sequences so there's nothing that makes it stand out in that aspect. Otherwise, the quality remains consistent throughout the entire series which is more than I can say for other series airing at the same time. In fact, one area that Studio White Fox have done a tremendous job on improving is rendering the background. While the manga does a decent job at framing  its own surroundings, the additional detail and polish put in really elevates an aspect where the source material was lackluster. \\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nTaku Iwasaki, known for creating the soundtrack to Gatchaman Crowds, Noragami and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, is responsible the music behind Akame ga Kill!. Judging by his other works, he has been consistently  been able to produce music that a bit quirky to listen to but still be able to enhance whatever show he works on. For this series, he incorporates a variety of musical styles from jazz to  rock to orchestral music and he does a commendable job of  engaging  the audience with his music, no matter what the scene called for. I especially like the OST being played during the action scenes as a combinations of drums, tribal chanting and rock goes with perfectly with the unhindered primal violence being shown on the screen.   \\n\\n\r\nManga Adaptation\\n\\n\r\nAs with almost all adaptation from manga to the anime, some things are bound to get lost in transition and Akame ga Kill! is no exception. Character interactions that gave depth to their relationship are left out but those scenes didn't really contribute in significantly in altering the core plotline. It is only towards the latter half of Akame ga Kill! that readers of the manga will notice that that the rather straightforward adaption will suddenly veer off into the original anime ending territory that leaves behind an entire arc unanimated and takes several liberties with the story. If you are only familiar with the anime TV production, it is unlikely that you would notice much of difference other than the accelerated pacing and build up. At this point, the manga remains unfinished and if the show decided to stay its original course, it would have ended in an awkward state and would have had to wait years before additional material would be available. For a show to tell a complete story in an age where anime shows are mere primers for the source material is a rarity indeed.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Akame ga Kill! sets out what do what it promises and that is to smother the audience with super powerups, violence and death up until the very end. \\n",

            "content": "To kill or not to kill, that is the question. In the world of Akame ga Kill, it\u2019s more than just about killing as survival fits to those who wish to live for something to fight for. Sounds complicated? Not really. Akame ga Kill preys on a simple concept despite playing complexity on the tactical front. To put it into simple perspective, we have a prestigious and well developed Capital taking place as the major setting. While it looks industrialized and well functioned on the outside, there are dark secrets and corruption on the inside. The ones who fight this corruption consists of the maincharacters as an elite unit known as the Night Raid, as part of the Revolutionary Army. They don\u2019t just kill for the sake of it but for a purpose. In this show, that purpose is to rid of corruption as a young man named Tatsumi finds out the hard way.\\n\\n\r\nBased off the manga of the same name, Akame ga Kill isn\u2019t an easy show to get used to at first. From a standard perspective, it is the author\u2019s only work to date (besides a prequel based off the story). He experiments with a fantasy world cast in shadows by corruption and brings in characters as the actors in a seemingly dark age. While the show takes itself seriously with the dark fantasy premise and mature setting, one should also question about the overall delivery of the series. Controversially speaking, there are doubts at first. For the first half and parts of the second half, the show remains faithful to the material. Then, it decides to go with a route that I find it to be laughable for the wrong reasons. Still, let\u2019s get started and see what Akame ga Kill has to offer\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe few episodes wastes little time to get the point across in the AkG world. Tatsumi almost becomes a scapegoat during his journey as he himself believes that Night Raid is evil. In reality, corruption takes hold where he almost ends up being a victim. The truth is realized soon enough as the young boy faces the grim reality. However, he makes his own decision to join Night Raid and rid of the corruption that holds the Capitol and perhaps the rest of the world. Essentially, that\u2019s how it starts anyways but Tatsumi also learns more about the group of people he is allied with now that he is part of Night Raid. As such, the few episodes introduces the other members. Titular character Akame is perhaps one of the most prominent member of Night Raid as her first encounter with Tatsumi almost ends up getting the latter killed. Coming off seemingly as a cold girl with social awkwardness, she is also a skilled fighter with good intentions. The problem with Akame is that perhaps she is a bit way too focused on her motivations. Throughout the series, there\u2019s little depth we realize about herself despite some minor flashbacks between her and a sister she used to hang around with. Her actions throughout the show also seemingly include vengeance not only against the Capitol but her own dear sister. While the reason is explained vaguely, there\u2019s just not a lot we can appreciate about her role. Her relationship with Tatsumi is perhaps the strongest compared to the other members of Night Raid though. So in some ways, we can say that she is a character with a lot of potential but the show just doesn\u2019t make her a well-developed character.\\n\\n\r\nOther members of Night Raid falls under a lot of generic tropes. These include head boss Najenda, Leone (the older sister type), Mine (tsundere), Bulat (the older brother type), Lubbock (ongoing carefree dude), Shelee (quiet type), among others. Tatsumi himself is also saturated with generic tropes such as his heroic personality and to do the \u201cright thing\u201d. His motivations does have influence among other members of Night Raid as they see him as a trusting member and one who is determined to achieve his goals. Perhaps one other character in the show sees him as a bit more beyond just a warrior though. Coming from the outskirts of the Capitol is General Esdeath, a feared sadist and leader with a deadly reputation. Esdeath\u2019s debut marks the exact expectation that viewers might have her as a leader. However, her encounter with Tatsumi might rub off in the wrong way. You could call it as an infatuation or obsession, but her personality takes a 180 degrees after realizing the power of \u201clove\u201d. Rather than love though, it\u2019s more like a one-sided relationship as the world of Akame ga Kill is not pretty. If you don\u2019t believe me, then the body count might serve as a more credible evidence. Regardless if you\u2019re a member of Night Raid, Jeagers, Revolutionary Army, or the Capitol\u2019s military, the show isn\u2019t afraid to kill off characters. \\n\\n\r\nEsdeath isn\u2019t alone as an adversary of Night Raid however. Leading a group known as the \u201cJeagers\u201d, she plays a role as an anti-villain. Some of the members of Jeagers have their own morals and ideologies. Still, there\u2019s also this presence of black and white morality that is dominated throughout the series. Some characters such as Seryu (from Jeagers) kill for what they perceive as justice while others simply sees it as an order like Boris. Then, there are also misguided examples such as Wave who doesn\u2019t realize the truth revolving around the corruption of the Capitol. Nonetheless, the series makes a point clear that it controversially creates an atmosphere of ideology clash. And often or not, these result in various consequences such as extortion, torture, and death. Make no mistake though. This show isn\u2019t shy to craft violence from what it has set up.\\n\\n\r\nEven in a dark fantasy world such as AkG, there are also time to squeeze in comedy. Perhaps I imply this as underhanded but the show actually pushes that more than you might expect. Comedy is represented sometimes as generic while other times just misplaced or rather awkwardly timed. The quick precision shift between comedy and graphic violence sometimes also seems unreal to believe. In other words, one needs to be aware of the way the show is adapted when venturing into its execution. Fortunately, the series manages to rebound against this with serious elements of mature content to stay true with its premise. While the story seems quick paced at the times, Akame ga Kill also creatively build up certain points throughout the story and effectively manage it on most parts. As a reader of the manga, it pleases me to realize that they didn\u2019t forget the most important parts. It\u2019s obviously evident that there is enough material to simultaneously turn its source material into animated form and as such, I give praise to White Fox for doing just that. And when it comes to violence, this show is like a middle finger to recent series that are obstructed by censorship. (ex. Terra Formars, Tokyo Ghoul)\\n\\n\r\nWhile world building isn\u2019t a strong content of the series, the mechanics and origins is insightful. It is explained in a way that viewers should not be confused. The instance falls quickly with powerful weapons known as Teigu (in English, referred to as Imperial Arms). They are the most widely feared tools that are featured throughout the series with a variety of uses. These include but not limited to invisibility, one-shot kills, animal instinct, sharpshooting, ice manipulation, shape-shifting, pyrokinesis, and among others. The origins behind some of these Teigu are also explored. And with that, you can expect spectacular action when characters puts them to use. Well-coordinated movements, strategies, and jaw-breaking cinematic are a key to this success. Thankfully, Akame ga Kill does that in a profound way. As each Teigu is also different, the show also makes good usage of their strengths and weaknesses so you can expect some exciting duels in full throttle.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the show had a decent start with what it has done with the adaptation. But this isn\u2019t the main concern of the series in regards to fitting with characters\u2019 roles. It\u2019s the way the story is adapted later on when for some reason, the series derides from the manga. Instead, it crafts filler and makes up its story as it goes. Some of them not only have episode transitions that doesn\u2019t make sense but also ones that are seemingly too rushed. And like I said before, the show isn\u2019t shy to kill off its character cast. However, all is abrupt and devoid of development. There\u2019s little feeling that you\u2019ll feel with some of the characters killed off later on (especially beyond episode 20). It\u2019s almost like an insult for the fans hoping to see a faithful adaptation when it decides to make up its own little story.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to visual quality, White Fox is able to actually get some parts done right. They are able to take this show\u2019s animation quality to a level of what it should be \u2013 graphic and straightforward. It remains brutally honest with what it tries to accomplish such as severed limps, beheading, and torture. In short, the show isn\u2019t a fairy tale fantasy but rather make its point as a dark world of malevolence. Action is directed with strength in its movements while the world setting is credible with the backgrounds. Dangerous creatures known as the \u201cDanger Beasts\u201d are present throughout the show as well that are carefully crafted to show their animalistic brutality.  On the other hand, character designs can be an oddball. Certain characters such as Akame wear outfits that doesn\u2019t make them look like who they should be. Tatsumi\u2019s design is also blend as the main protagonist while other characters are exaggerated by their manga counterparts such as Esdeath. And the show isn\u2019t shy with fan service either so be prepared for some eye candy goggles. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not a powerhouse, soundtrack does play an efficient role. In particular, action scenes are supplemented by the OST with the intense pacing of the fighting. Emotional scenarios also exist so expect some solemn tunes to play out its purpose. However, character voice mannerisms can be a bite to the heart. Again, I have to emphasize that Tatsumi is one of the most generic characters known to mankind. His voice shifts between mature and childish in what can seem like a split second time-frame. This inadequate balance is a pain to deal with as such with some with other characters albeit with less focus. In essence, the show has moderate voice mannerisms when it comes to its cast. However, I do give praise to the VA for Akame, Sora Amamiya. She is able to play roles as soft spoken characters such as Kaori (One Week Friends) and Elizabeth (Nanatsu no Taizai) but is also able to portray Akame in this series; a cold spoken assassin. Did I also mention that she sings the OP song for the first half? Speaking of which, the theme songs conveys this show accurately with contrasting moods between the opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nTo cap this off, it\u2019s easy to say that Akame ga Kill is a show that might not be suitable for everyone. I don\u2019t say this on a graphic content perspective but rather with the whole premise and what it tries to do. In fact, the premise is solid and stays true to itself throughout the show. It\u2019s just that the direction has some crude markings when it comes to timing and balance. The way it derails from the manga adaptation makes it look like a joke. Generic characters are also something to aware of especially in the case of our dull main protagonist Tatsumi. His relationship with other characters only shines when it revolves around the main story. On the other hand, mechanics and concepts of the show deserves praise. While nothing stands out as original, the show is clever with the world setting, themes, and artificial weapons/tools. The show also does justice with the buildup and cliffhangers it creates to anticipate what\u2019s to happen next for the majority of the first half. However at the end of the day, this show is one of those sick series where it kills itself.\\n",

            "content": "A lot can be said about a show's 1st episode. It's our first encounter with the world presented, and could often be used to gauge whether or not the content on display could be something that would interest you moving forward. Of course, this isn't to say that that's always the case, but for the most part, it serves as a helpful jumping off point and is often the reason why studios place so much stock on its television pilot. And nowhere is that more evident than with Akame ga Kill! With just one episode, it manages to establish a myriad of things, all ofwhich interesting in their own right, but perhaps more entertaining when viewed as a whole. There's comedy, fanservice, ultraviolence, corrupt politics, eccentric characters, melodrama, and a sleuth of other tidbits littered throughout. All of these aspects by themselves are fine, but it's the assembly in which these ideas are presented that gives way to content that's comedically problematic.\\n\\n\r\nLike ingredients for food, it's not a matter of what you have to work with but what you choose to make out of it. In the hands of capable creators, I'm sure all the elements of Akame ga Kill could have been turned into something of high-end value, but to no one's fault but its own, what this title decides to do instead of measuring out its ingredients was to dump it all in at once with no rhyme or reason. A tasty stew in the hands of credible creators was effectively turned into a cauldron of foul witches brew. A slimy substance bubbling up, one that sees gruesome deaths followed by comedic fanservice, politics served on a platter layered in melodrama, reanimated corpses of shows prior refusing to die off, their festering lack of \"character\" like primordial ooze, desperately seeking out originality to munch down on. A Schlocky, sleazy freak of a thing, over-the-top, and violently lashing out, its drool dripping with hackneyed writing and a complete disregard for decency as it spazzes about on the floor. \\n\\n\r\nWhat we have here was a Frankenstein of lowbrow content, and boy was it entertaining!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very straightforward, if only by design. A corrupt kingdom takes advantage of their citizens through tyrannical rule, and to fight against this oppression, rebel forces send aid by hiring a band of assassins tasked with killing off high-ranking members of the capital. It's like Assassin's Creed, but with a lot more boobs and nakama power involved. Our protagonist, PussyBetaMale-kun, or Tatsumi, if you prefer, joins this hit squad. \\n\\n\r\nThe goal of these rebel forces are pretty basic; overthrow the governing body and establish a new order of equality. Seems like a simple enough story to execute right? Well, that's where you'll be sorely mistaken, with AGK, plunging your IQ down a few pegs is the only way to keep up with its scatterbrained thought process when it comes to figuring its own shit out. In substitution of a fairly paint-by-numbers plot, AGK decides to globetrot across its world, not out of a need to explore anything, no, that would be too \"smart,\" but solely for the sake of encountering as many comedically vile people as possible. And in that regard, its meandering was a success. In place of a rebel uprising, what we got in its stead was a bunch of superpowered edgelords engaging in giant cockfights to see who was the strongest. Assassin Super Bowl was in full swing, and while they were duking it out like reject members of a Mad Max film, the highborn nobles were strolling along in the background, torturing its citizens with so much glee that you can't help but root for their cartoonish villainy. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting was never explored, feeling equally perfunctory as the characters inhabiting it. Attributes of its world bullying the audience into accepting it for what it is. Wild monsters with no domestic quality to their world and flying Manta-rays; just accept it. Giant mecha in a medieval setting with no prior inclusion of advanced technology; just accept it. Macroeconomics that's impossible to exist when the aristocratic class torture and kill their citizens, effectively crippling its economy's breadwinners; just accept it. Supernatural occurrences that happen at one minute to simply be forgotten by the next; you get the drill, just accept that shit.\\n\\n\r\nThey didn't even bother to properly flesh out the city or corresponding areas that our characters navigated across. Deciding to only let it serve as a backdrop for the Assassin Super Bowl to play out seemed to be the unified thought process that the creative team all collectively arrived at. And when that isn't enough to keep the viewer's interest, the show places a character's neck on its Guillatine chopping block, where it turns these Mad Max rejects into blood-splattered firework displays to keep things entertaining. All you end up remembering them for was their deaths and not who they were as people. But who got time to worry about proper characterization or decent writing? Fuck it! On with the show! More shocking deaths, more blood, more ultraviolence, more more more! \\n\\n\r\nCrimson blood-spray animated with such vigor that it makes it readily apparent that the people behind this project are having as much fun slaughtering their cast as we as viewers get from watching them die. In a way, it's like this show's animators were a part of the noble class themselves, as they hyper-fixate on bringing these death sequences to life. Sadly, when no one is being turned into blood confetti, the actual quality of the animation drops off significantly. Stiff body motion. Lazily panning across flat landscapes. Shading devoid of effort or care. Scene compositions setup with zero creative foresight; all of it expressed with complete apathy. As if it was an impatient child twiddling its thumbs waiting for the director to give it the green-light for the next fight sequence or public execution to occur. \\n\\n\r\nThe same also applied to the soundtrack which was painfully uninspired. Tunes humming along without an inkling of interest shining through. A type of \"pretending to care\" in the way the orchestrations felt oddly familiar-sounding to many things heard in the past. But unlike the animation department, the disinterest expressed here was actually surprising once you discuss the person responsible for the bringing it together. Taku Iwasaki is not an amateur. This is a man with years under his belt. Why this wasn't audibly expressed was a bit perplexing, but then again, this is coming from a show named \"Akame\" ga Kill, where the titular character only gets 5 episodes worth of screentime. They must have been fans of The Legend of \"Zelda\" games to come up with such an absurd name choice. \\n\\n\r\nThe moment you start trying to \"figure out\" AGK's issues is the moment you're \"doing it wrong,\" so let's proceed to dispell that idea right now by asking the impossible question: what the \"purpose\" behind this wonderful work of artistic vandalism was. \\n\\n\r\nSo what was it about? An active effort to discuss subserviency in society? The oppressive consequence that occurs when \"absolute power corrupts absolutely?\" A tale of personal ideals clashing, resulting in bloody politics? A sobering story of discrimination?... Well, honestly speaking, no. It was about none of that. Overthinking anything that AGK does would be no different than waxing philosophical for the reason behind Patrick Star's Hawaiian shorts. There's no pretense behind AGK's actions, and as long as the viewer doesn't graft any grandiose ideas onto it, it could be enjoyed for what it truly is: schlocky, over-the-top deaths with shounen characters that had the stylistic sensibilities of a seinen but the emotional authority of a 15-year-old's wet dream. \\n\\n\r\nAnd you know what? That's just fine. I sure had fun watching it. A silly thing, flailing about with no sense of purpose or integrity. A good ole dumb time to be had, IQ-reducing, but worth every popped brain cell.",

            "content": "Warning, this review is full of spoilers so you have been warned!\r\nAkame ga Kill..............Start the review, no seriously I have nothing else to say, just start this review.  Introducing Akame ga Kill is like showing elementary schoolers pornography Just start the damn review already.\r\nAkame ga Kill is produced by studio White Fox who brought us good anime like Steins;Gate and Katanagatari......   It is directed by a man named Kobayashi, Tomoki and consists of 24 episodes airing from July 7 2014 to December 15 2014.  So is the anime any good? I'm gonna be straight up honest to you all I thinkthis anime is the reincarnation of Hitler.  But if you like it, that's fine!  I mean to get no hate from this video, I simply want to convey to you all the reasoning on why this show is bad but if you like it, that's fine.  You're listening to someone who enjoyed Mirai Nikki and gave it a high 3/10 so if that's not credible that I can enjoy things that even aren't critically good I don't know what is.  Also I am not hating on this show because it is popular, I am actually going to give proper reasons  on why I think the show is bad rather than some people who'll say the show is bad because it's popular.  And last but not least I am spoiling everything\\n\r\nso beware!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story for Akame ga Kill follows the main protagonist Tatsumi who journeys to the capitol in order to gain money for his poor starving village.  Tatsumi, after failing to enlist in the army and getting all of his money stolen gets picked up by a noble family who claims that they will take care of him, but they hide evil intentions like Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch Case, but anyways. After figuring out their evil intentions to torture and ultimately kill him, Tatsumi is rescued by a group of highly qualified assassins called Night Raid who wants to fight in a rebellion to stop the corruption within the government.  The people in Night Raid all own imperial arms which are specialized weapons with overwhelming powerful weapons ranging from swords to guns.  The group members include Akame, Sheele, Mine, Bulat, Lubbock, Leone and Najenda, together with Tatsumi they go on a mission to kill those of higher power who are responsible for the crime and corruption in the government.\\n\\n\r\nSounds like a great premise right? Wrong, the story of this anime is worse than having sex with the toothed vagina from the movie teeth.  I honestly can't see why anyone can say this show has great story telling when it is more flawed than Joe Biden's Face.  Let me explain why starting off with the tone.\\n\\n\r\nThe tone consistency of Akame ga Kill is executed terribly right from episode 1.  The story tries to be serious yet the serious tone is completely obliterated by comedic moments in the show that take you out of the tone and atmosphere that they are trying to present.  Let me give you an example from episode 1. Tatsumi sees his friends straight up die right in front of him, his friends that he has known for quite some time, then in the same exact sequence of scenes we see him flailing around in a comedic fashion and Bulat says something that completely goes against the dark tone that the anime tried to set.  Flailing around in a comedic fashion right after your friends are killed is not a good thing if you want to keep up with tone consistency, plus it's highly unbelievable.  What I think the problem is, is that they place comedic characters into a serious setting which does not work for the type of edgy show this is trying to be.  The goofy/serious tone does not work for this anime because it doesn't feel blended, it feels out of place and feels more random than a butterfly porking a frog.  Anime like Black Lagoon did it great!  But here it feels really mismatched and in the wrong place at the wrong time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story also has a terrible problem with executing its character deaths, like I said I don't care about spoilers for this review so I am about to release some big spoilers in 3. 2. 1.  Right from the get go audiences were wowed by how Akame ga Kill was not afraid to kill of characters starting off with episode 6 with Sheele's death.  We only get 1 episode of backstory for her and you expect me to feel sympathetic for Sheele's death?  Hell No!  How am I supposed to feel for a character that we just got introduced to and I know nothing about her.  They try to guilt trip us with flashbacks right before she dies like we knew her for a long time, but that's like if I were to kill off Lisa from Zankyou no Terror in lets say episode 4.  Would you feel anything? No, because you dont know the character a lot, thats why when that girl in episode 3 of Sword Art Online from the Black Cats Guild died I didnt feel anything because I didnt know her.  Kurome's death I felt nothing because we never got any development out of her or even knew who she \\n\r\nreally was!  Heck, even when we did get to know characters the death scenes were poor and I didnt feel any emotion due to terrible characterization.  Susano barely had any screentime so his death was more laughable than anything.  Also we literally knew nothing about Chelsea, sure she may have had more screentime than some of the other cast, but we barely ever got to know her as a person and get attached to her until they through a guilt trip of flashbacks and apologies 1 minute before she dies.  The characters are all there but since they keep on killing off characters left and right you don't get any time to like them or grow on them thus making their deaths feel meaningless.  Would you cry over a man you met for 2 minutes then a week later heard died in a newspaper from a car accident, or would you cry over a friend you've known for a few years who died from the same cause?  If you wouldn't cry for example one, then there is no reason to feel for the characters here!\\n\\n\r\nTo counteract this statement you could say that this show is great because of the lack of plot armor,  but that's untrue because like I said, killing off characters left and right with a lack of development makes the death of the characters have less meaning than the first time you dropped the soap and allowed a black man to grab your love handles in\\n\r\nthe shower room.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the lack of focus this anime has on actually maintaining some shred of a plot.  For the whole middle section of this show there was really no story that they were going off of, it was just random fight scenes, pointless deaths, and a lot of going around in circles following the formula, character death, fight villain, moving on, character death, fighting villain, moving on.  The story never focuses on one thing, which is its problem because then you have more of a clusterfuck than the amount of sperm\\n\r\nand love juices left behind on Sora and Shiros bed because, because you know brothers and sisters that close have to get it on at some point, incest for the wincest!  But the multiple side stories between Akame's sister, Esdeath's romance with Tatsumi, and much much more are never fully explored.  Seriously people, did you all forget the reason why Tatsumi went to the capital in first place?  TO GET MONEY FOR HIS VILLAGE, and the only other time they go back to this is in the last freaking episode.  Seriously, if\\n\r\nthat was the first main objective of our protagonist was to gain more money for his poverty stricken village shouldn't he be concerned about his village more?  Instead this story is lost in a clusterfuck of other stories that are then lost in more clusterfucks of stories.  There is just way too much going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe logic is thrown out of the window in this anime as well, and I do understand that since this is an anime not all logic applies but lets go back to episode 6 shall we. The characters all lack something that even Al queda has, and it's called common sense.  Lets give an example with episode 6.  Sheele had the intent to kill Seryu, but yet chose only to slash off her arms instead of chopping off her head, then for the next 20 seconds Seryu tells his imperial arms dog to power up and go in beserk mode, within these 20 seconds, and dont worry I counted, Sheele had time to chop off her head but did she do that? No, because these characters all lack a brain or because the story writer wanted an excuse to make a cool fight scene dragged out longer than it should be.  Plus this leads to the logic which this anime does not have, a bitch shoots a gun from her mouth, and I'm not talking about any gun, I'm talking about a gun lodged in the back of her throat.  First off how would she breathe?  Second off how could she aim with it and the third one is wouldn't the recoil throw her off, hurt her throat, and be able to miss the shot.  People could combat this statement with, this is an anime there shouldnt be any logic or true science in it.  This would only be true if the world took the time to explain that their science and their laws of physics were different from our, I actually looked at the scene multiple times when Seryu shot the gun and hit Sheele and THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECOIL IN THIS WORLD, you want to know why? Newton's 3rd Law!  For every action there is an equal and opposite re-action meaning that for every force there is a reaction force that is equal in size, but opposite in direction. That is to say that whenever an object pushes another object it gets pushed back in the opposite direction equally hard.  Sheele was pushed forward when shot by the bullet meaning that there should have been an equal amount of force pushing back on Seryu's throat meaning the bullet should have been off thus showing us how the author truly thought that on paper it looked cool and exciting but didn't care about any logic behind it. If this were to to happen in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure it would be a completely different story because 1. The anime is self aware, and 2 because they actually take the time to explain the powers and how characters do things, in Akame ga Kill they don't. So until they explain things how am I supposed to believe anything that happens in this anime, plausibility is lost within this show!  They do this on multiple occasions, even in the last episode when Leone gets shot\\n\r\nmultiple times and is still at full strength without her powers only because she was \"born in the slums so her body is strong\", that's a complete asspull!  Black people who grow up in the ghetto get shot once and they're dead!  But in here they're fine if they get shot 5 times as a normal human being?  That's bullshit, I want that power, I dont want to be shot by a Florida police officer!\\n\\n\r\nLets get into the motivations which I can wholeheartedly say are more dumb and irrational than the content Anita Sarkesian produces.   The enemies range from evil to being evil just to be evil, there is nothing else to say.  Syura was hyped up since episode 12 as being a crazy, powerful and mysterious villain which was disappointing when we found out that motivation for being evil is just to get power?  That is completely cliche and is totally just a waste of a potential villain.  There is is nothing interesting about a character whose only motivation to be evil is just for power or to be evil.  The best villains are the ones that you can understand why they're evil, like Lord Desler from Space Battleship Yamato 2199 who is seen as the villain but you can totally understand his motivations and they make sense which is actually interesting instead of the black and white cliche motivations in Akame ga Kill.  Esdeath's motivations were more screwed up then the Monopoly man cheating on the hungry hungry hippo to seduce the Operation man.  She is supposed to be seen as a sadistic villain, who everyone bows down to and feels afraid of.  How can I feel afraid of an enemy who is supposed to be sadistic yet wants to find romance which she\\n\r\nfinds in Tatsumi's small stiffy.  It's the complete polar opposite of how she should be seen, and it makes the lighthearted side of her far outweigh the cold hearted female that the anime tries to portray her as.  How can I see her as being an enemy if her ideals of romance are constantly lunged in my face like titties in high school of the dead, it's terrible.  The only times when villains with evil just to be evil or stupid motivations work is if the show doesn't take itself seriously, like Ragyo for an example worked in Kill la Kill because all the show wanted to be was dumb fun and action.  Here it doesn't work because the show is trying to be serious.  Would you rather have villains that will kill you because why the hell not, your uglier than Marilyn Manson or a villain who kills because his motives are for the greater good of his people, or because its for a loved one and he has no other choice.  If you pick answer number 1 then you my friend need to watch actual good anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of asspulls in this anime is ridiculous as well leaving the story open for plot holes.  They bring out random powers at the right times without explanation making the random powers there as a plot convenience that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  Akame slices herself with her own poisonous sword and the gains massive amounts of power without dying is an asspull that is never full explained.  Mine pulls out a final powerful attack that shoots at a Laxus from Fairy Tail ripoff is an asspull because they never fully give an explanation on where all that power came from.  Najenda's power just so happens to have the power to resurrect Susanno just when the plot needs him and her power is kinda explained but not fully.  Esdeath's ability to freeze time is a plot hole within itself seeing how she could use that at any time during the anime to defeat her foes.  Syura is magically able to mark anywhere within his area including the air, that's kinda never explained and he can create a pocket dimension and gain more power from a potion which is never explained.  A girl gets her neck sliced, falls down, gets back up, stabs Lubbock, talks even though her vocal cords are fucked, and falls back down which is a complete asspull the the writer made as an excuse to weaken Lubbock.  Wait, so how the fuck did Tatsumi turn into a Digimon?  Is this explained? Nope.  Like I said, the whole gun mouth thing is never properly explained.  What's with all of these weapons, this dude is the human swiss army knife, asspulls everywhere.  There are many more asspulls I can mention but for the sake of this review I'm going to stop here. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least I want to get into the setting and world building which I found to be executed poorly, more poor than an African village that extend their necks to look like a human pez stick. Seriously, the food would expire by the time it reaches their stomach.  But the setting is never fully explored.  I understand it's a fantasy world but the fantasy world is full of guns, not just any guns, actual normal guns.  And if they have guns, suits and ties, and other stuff of the sorts shouldn't they have better technology than horses and lanterns.  I shouldn't be confused about this, Akame ga Kill is like a bad social studies teacher telling you Guam is a country but not explaining where the fuck it is. People who say that its an anime don't worry about it, well, how would you feel if I put a vibrator in Claymore?  Would it make sense? NO it wouldn't, therefore it wouldn't be able to make sense here.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good part I can say about the story is the pacing, it knows how to pace itself well and doesn't try to go too fast nor too slow.  The pacing is not really the problem, it's the content that is the problem.  All and all Akame ga Kill's Narrative Structure is abysmal, the tone consistency is terrible, and all around Akame ga Kill's story suffers from an overabundance of asspulls and lack of logic that has plagued shounen anime since Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nAkame ga Kills's characters are more underdeveloped than Selena Gomez's rack, I mean seriously seeing her in a bikini is borderline child porn.  I wont go into that much detail\\n\r\nbut I'll give you a general idea of who they are and their role in the plot.  Also I'll tell you if they die because as stated SPOILERS and to emphasize a repeated pattern in this show\\n\\n\r\nLets start with Night Raid\\n\\n\r\nTatsumi is just a generic shounen protagonist who wants to become stronger.  Sure he's a kind hearted person and sees what he is doing as JUSTICE for the greater good but that's all he really is!  He's no different than most stereotypical characters in anime making him highly unmemorable.  He dies after becoming a Digimon with little development.\\n\\n\r\nLeone is there for boob service, she's a Holo ripoff with bigger boobs than Holo, she's constantly on screen as the older sister type stereotype but how am I supposed to take her seriously when she talks with her boobs instead of her mouth, unless the crack between her double Ds is her mouth.  But in all seriousness she's the same character from the beginning to the end of the anime.  She dies with no development after bleeding out in a alleyway after being shot about 5 times hours prior to her death.  Damn it took her a while to bleed out, was it to create more drama? If so it was a poor job.\\n\\n\r\nMine is there as the romantic interest and speaking of that, the romance in this show felt highly underdeveloped and random.  All of a sudden Mine starts to show affection for Tatsumi out of nowhere, it feels like the romance between Superman and Lois Lane in Man of Steel.  There's no buildup to the romance making it just feel plain awkward.  She actually changed a tad bit throughout the series though, she starts out like a tsundere but even though the romance felt out of place for that one moment she broke out of her archetype before dying.  Still doesnt excuse her lack of development though throughout the rest of the series!  Also she dies from unknown causes, most likely over exertion of energy which is never fully explained, with little to no development.\\n\\n\r\nSheele is a plot device with a giant pair of scissors that can cut through anything yet is so dumb that she can't cut a girl's head off properly that is sitting down immobile for a full 20 seconds.  Her only purpose for the plot was to show that PEOPLE DIE WHEN THEY ARE KILLED and that there is danger in this show.  This is not a good thing because her development suffers from being put into the role of this plot device.  She likes to scissor I guess, that's all we get to really see about her other than her really \"tragic back story\" that we get to see one episode of before her sad death.  She died after being shot and torn in half by a giant crackhead snoopy, dies without development.\\n\\n\r\nBulat, the man with the armor named Incursio that he gives Tatsumi after his death.  He was a badass older brother type of character who loved to comb his hair like Space Dandy.  We  We only got to see a bit into his back story but it wasn't enough for him to be developed at all, instead he is there to serve only the purpose of progressing the plot by giving Incursio to Tatsumi, that's it.  He dies from poision with little to no development.\\n\\n\r\nLubbock, the man who pulls the strings is a really lame character.  He appears initially in the first few episodes but didn't say much but after throughout the final quarter of the series we got to see his personality, and his back story with Najenda.  But that's about it, he doesn't really change, he starts out the same way he ends off making him have little to no development or change whatsoever.  He would've been more useful making bondage whips from his string rather than work for Night Raid, we really don't get a full chance to see who he really is.  He dies from spears penetrating his penis worse than that of the penis being penetrated by a dildo in Kids in the Sandbox on LOLshock.\\n\\n\r\nNajenda, the leader of Night Raid, I don't know anything about her from the beginning to the end.  She's always been this mystery box that nobody knows about, which can add a sense of mystery I guess but it doesn't help us get to know her, her motivations, her personality, or anything of the sorts.  She's just there to play the role of Night Raid's leader nothing more nothing less.  She's got imperial arms that are never fully explained and that hurts her character more than helps it.  All and all a waste of screen time, highly underutilized and underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nChelsea, the girl with the makeup comes into the anime halfway into the show only to be killed off a few episodes later without letting the audience get attached to her.  She wanted head from Tatsumi and she died most likely due to decapitation seeing how her head was left on a stake.  Ironically she turned into the lolipop she was always sucking on, practice makes perfect for sucking am I riggghhhhtttt Chelsea.  And When I say suck, I mean as a character and not in terms of blowjobs you perverts watching this.  She died with no development, she was just there to serve as another big sis figure to our main protagonist, nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nSusanoo, the human imperial arms was introduced in the same episode as Chelsea yet has half of her screen time.  We barely get to see him and most of the time I forgot about his existence which is bad if you want me to feel something for his character once he kicks the budget.  His motivations are never really shown and lacks a personality.  For the most part his very existence was unneeded in the anime for he did nothing to add to the plot at all.  He caries around a giant tampon on a stick as I like to call it and In the end he dies after fighting Esdeath he gets no development from doing so.  \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least we have Akame, I mean she has to be the best, she has to!  Her name is in the title right? Wrong.  Her name may be in the title but she is hardly seen or shown in the anime.  It's like naming Attack on Titan Attack on Marco or Code Geass, Code Shirley She plays no huge role in this anime at all, she lacks emotion and personality though we get to see some sort of emotion in her here and there. But that does not make up for her poor development in the beginning of the show.  She was boring, bland, and uninteresting which reminded me of the time I received food from a KKK run restaurant, the just gave me cardboard, and that's all Akame is.  Though I must admit by the end of the anime we see a slight change in her and she has some sort of motivation that she is going off but throughout the whole anime she is underused, and has a lack of screen time which in turn hurts her development more than a Morman father recycles their wives.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm gonna try to explain the opposing side, the Jaegers.\\n\r\nWave is basically a more interesting version of Tatsumi but his character development is next to nothing seeing how he gets a lack of proper screentime and because his true motivations are highly unclear.\\n\\n\r\nKurome, Akame's Sister, could have been an interesting character because of her back story with Akame and how they split up but this means nothing when her character has no screen time to the point where I forgot she was even a part of the show.  I mean really, how can I feel for a character that I don't even know, she doesn't properly get screen time and her development is next to nothing because of this.  By the end of the show I literally knew nothing about her except for some of the stuff about her past that was told from Akame's perspective and not her.  All and all her character was just a waste of screentime that could have been used for another character.\\n\\n\r\nBols, or as I like to call him Banepool, was the most human character in this show.  He had a family and kids which is something that could have truly made him stand out among the crowd.  But once again, the screen time kills his development and the family and kids thing he had going almost felt more like a guilt trip rather than something to feel bad about for his death.\\n\\n\r\nRun's character actually has a motivation which is discussed in the second to last episode.  But this does not excuse his lack of any development throughout the series because  he only had about less than an episode of screen time altogether and most of the time he was just talking with someone else, he wasn't doing anything interesting or that could have progressed his development.  Even though we do get that motivation in the second to last episode I hardly ever cared for his character because of the lack of screen time therefore his character was plain irrelevant in my eyes.  Honestly he was pretty much useless to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSeryuu's character was really annoying, though she did have probably the best death scene in this show I still found her character to be highly annoying when on screen.  We literally knew nothing about her other than her corrupted viewpoint of justice and the fact that she loves bestiality.  She had more proper screen time than the other characters but still she gets a lack of any good development before she dies.\\n\\n\r\nDr Stylish who is basically gay steins;gate was just there to have a battle that was completely irrelevant to the plot.  Raise of hands for how many people remembered his character was a thing before I mentioned him.  He only had literally 2 episodes before he died, he was truly a bad character with no development whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nI could be missing a character or 2 but I want to get into the main villain now whose name is Esdeath Listen, you can say she's the best girl, but she's everything but a good villain.  She started out being hyped up as a sadistic leader with amazing ice powers but then suddenly she falls in love with Tatsumi.  Yes the villain falls in love with Tatsumi, this could have been handled in a great way but instead it all got flushed down the toilet.  The way she falls in love with Tatsumi is not with development but it's on the superficial level like \"Hey I just met you, and this is crazy, I love your abs, so fondle me maybe\".  She doesn't understand love and by the end of the show I doubt she still did because the amount of times her and Tatsumi talked were far apart and it wasn't about trying to develop the romance because Tatsumi would always try to escape while Esdeath would try to sexually assault or come on to him.  This makes her true motivations very jumbled up.  We barely see a change in her character throughout the whole series, because most of the time we see her it's about her wanting to chomp on Tatsumi's meat stick.  Also her powers make no sense either because she can freeze time, that's not the bad part though, the bad part is that she could have literally froze time at any point in the show to either help a fellow comrade, or stopped Tatsumi from running away at any given point and she would have still been able to have power left over.  This is a plot hole until they explain why she couldn't have done it at any of those given points.  Esdeath as a villain is really bad and as a character, though better than most of the jaegers, falls flat on her face because of poor characterization, a poor motivation, and poor development throughout the series minus her breast size.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to mention any more characters at this moment, sorry Jesus Hentai Christ, but as you all can see the reason why Akame ga Kill's characters fall flat is not only because of their cut and paste personalities.  It's because of a lack of screentime, poor motivations, lack of backstories, and poorer than Ethiopia development.  They hold a lack of memorability that even when watching you forget that some of the characters are even a thing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\r\nThe art and animation for Akame ga kill is a mixed bag ranging from abysmail to decent but never OMG WHAT IS THIS THE GARDEN OF WORDS?!??! Type level.  The backgrounds are very generic and brings nothing new to the table.  The general detail of the anime is more bipolar than Amanda Todd.  Sometimes the characters appear to be half drawn, the blood effects look like MS paint especially in the second to last episode, and overall the show just looks below average.  The character designs do not work well with the setting nor the tone either.  It's kinda like putting Lucky Star character designs in Death Note and when I say that I mean that the character designs break the dark tone.  The character models are too bright and flashy to be taken seriously and the neon colored outfits make Night Raid look like walking Las Vegas.  Don't get me wrong, some of the designs look really cool but they don't fit in well with this anime.  On the other hand some of the designs look really uninspired and lame.  I will admit though, Akame ga Kill uses some animated still frames that look really pleasing to the eye, but then again these scenes are few and too far between.  The art style at one point actually changed for 2 minutes in the second to last episode and I was like damn, if the show looked like this it could have been a whole lot better in terms of art.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Akame ga Kill is below average, not the worst but certainly not great either.  The last episode is the best the show has to offer in terms of animation but other than that animation is mehhhhh.  There are a lot of choppy scenes in the anime and that happens sometimes during battles or when the backgrounds are moving.  The cinematography of this show feels very standard with no animated sequences that stand out among the rest.  There were some scenes that were animated terribly like this whole scene with the robot blowing up.  Character movements are standard, not the best but at least you can tolerate it.  I remember in one scene during the episode where Bulat was fighting on the boat with Tatsumi against 3 imperial arms users that instead of using animation they just showed sparks appearing out of nowhere which really looked bad for the anime, and the anime uses certain choices on how to animate their fight scenes that makes the anime look like it was animated on Flash.  But I will admit as much as I don't like the animation for almost all of the anime, some of the fight scenes were fun to watch and enjoy, nothing special but some were fun.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all the art and animation is very below average in the way it presents itself to the audience.\\n\\n\\n\r\n SOUND\\n\r\nThe sound of Akame ga Kill is also not all that good either.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is alright for the most part but no stand out performances.  The sound effects were there and they did the job but they weren't at all fantastic.  The overall ost felt uninspired as well even though I love the song Liar Mask for the second opening.  The ost was highly unmemorable for the most part and I just dismissed it as white noise which for an anime is not a good thing to do because it is supposed to enhance the experience, adds sprinkles to the cake, add flavor to your marriage, adds some KY jelly to your pee pee, that is what music in a show is supposed to do and in this show, a shounen like this, it should have had a nice ost but it didn't.  I, while I am typing this script am listening to some of the songs and even I can't remember these things playing which in my opinion is kinda embarrassing for an ost if you ask me.  \\n\\n\r\nSo all and all, is Akame ga Kill worth the watch?  No, but if you watch it I won't hold it against you.  Watching it with friends is suggested because honestly if you watch it with a friend the show automatically becomes a comedy even if the show itself is a joke.  And remember, if you like the show and found enjoyment out of it it's fine!\\n\\n\r\nSo lets get to the scoring\\n\\n\r\nSo giving the story a 3.7\\n\r\nThe characters a 2.8\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation a 4\\n\r\nThe sound a 4.35\\n\r\nPlus my enjoyment of a 2.5\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill get a score of a 3.47 giving it a reccomendation to classify this anime as a disease rather than an actual show.  Really guys, if you like this anime I respect your opinion but damn, in my mind this show was really bad and severely over hyped.  If someone asks me to recommend a show I'd give them School Days over this because at least School Days was decent enough to be short but this show had little to no redeemable qualities and I can truly call this anime worse than having sandpaper hands if your a guy or allergic to latex if you're a female.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nQuestion: What do you get when you try to make an action-comedy based around the brutal torture, rape, and mutilation of innocent people? Apparently, you get Akame Ga Kill. It\u2019s a blood bath, but it\u2019s also light-hearted. It has deathly serious themes such as the loss of close friends, but it also has frequent fanservice. It has characters with tortured pasts seeking retribution, but they also have slice-of-life comedy personalities. \u2026Have you noticed the problem with the show yet? Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting one of the most hyped anime of the year: Akame Ga Kill (By the way: no. I haven\u2019t read themanga and I don\u2019t care if \u201ceverything is better!\u201d in it; this review is of the adaptation and the adaptation alone).\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: A boy named Tatsumi sets out on a journey for \u201cThe Capitol\u201d in order to earn money for his starving village. However, when he arrives, he only finds a world full of unimaginable corruption. People are murdered, tortured, and manipulated on a daily basis for no discernable reason other than the fact that the government is super evil. After seeing this corruption, Tatsumi joins the \u201cNight Raid\u201d: a group of assassins dedicated to eliminating the corruption throughout The Capitol by mercilessly killing those responsible.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several problems with AGK\u2019s plot, and all of them are related to the very core foundation of how the show was written, making them absolutely crippling. The first issue is that its style is completely unrelated to its substance. This anime can\u2019t decide if it wants to be an edgy, dark, violent action show or a light, upbeat, comedy-action shounen with lots of fanservice. Since it can\u2019t decide, it tries to be both at the same time. This, of course, results in it being neither. AGK has absolutely NO concept of tone what so ever. In fact, the first episode contains arguably the worst writing decision in a TV show I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life. \\n\\n\r\nWe see Tatsumi, our protagonist, witness one of the most traumatic and devastating things imaginable. It\u2019s very graphic and the viewers are prepared for Tatsumi to absolutely break down. You know what happens instead? He mourns for about 10 seconds and then gets comedically dragged away for more fanservice and jokes with the other characters as he becomes visibly unfazed by the incident. There isn\u2019t so much as a second allowed for a transition between comedy and tragedy. Oh, but that\u2019s not where the joke stops; for the remainder of the series, our intelligence is insulted to the point that the show tries to constantly remind us how \u201cdevastating\u201d this event was for Tatsumi; you know, the devastation that never happened. He supposedly has nightmares about this event frequently and TONS of his characterization is based upon the effect that this event has on him. Well, great job AGK: you managed to entirely kill the most integral character motivation in your entire show before the very first episode was even over. It\u2019s not like this is the only instance of AGK\u2019s incompetent tone either; there are many, MANY more examples. This show treats serious themes such as rape and torture like they are one big joke; they are used only to over-exaggerate the \u201cevilness\u201d of the antagonists to the point that questions of \u201cgood vs. evil\u201d couldn\u2019t be any more black and white in a traditional, clich\u00e9 shounen fashion. Speaking of clich\u00e9s, let\u2019s touch on the characters:\\n\\n\r\nAGK\u2019s characters fail to stand out in any way what so ever. Not even slightly. The entire cast is full of tired archetypes from a harem comedy that somehow found their way into the wrong genre of anime (much like Higurashi, but in a bad way). Seriously: you\u2019ve got the na\u00efve, personality-less male protagonist (Tatsumi), the airhead (Sheele), the tsundere (Mine), the outgoing/sexual one with giant boobs (Leone), the blunt/emotionless one (Akame), etc. I mean come the fuck on! I AM watching a harem, aren\u2019t I? You can probably imagine how badly this cast clashes with the antagonists, who are the most obviously evil, stereotyped, motivation-less, cardboard cut-out \u201ccharacters\u201d you could ever imagine. They rape, they torture, they manipulate, they do the most morally awful things that the writer\u2019s mind could physically dream up. Why? \u2026Just because they\u2019re evil. Even everybody's FAVORITE character (Esdeath) is completely worthless; she has no damn motivations what so ever people! Every time they \"try\" to give the villains development, it is painfully rushed and short-lived, making it essentially useless. This is one of the cheapest writing tactics in the book and it\u2019s just the icing on the cake to a cast of characters that lacks a single ounce of originality or any depth at all. As a result of the poor cast, nobody cares whenever something happens to any of the characters. This, predictably, takes a massive element of the show away entirely.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Akame Ga Kill is a trainwreck. It has some good ideas and can be decently suspenseful at times, but complete lack of direction makes it borderline unwatchable unless you can completely shut off your brain. From its horribly confused plot to its inane characters, this show never presents us with a single, solitary reason to tune in to the stereotype parade they have created. I do not recommend Akame Ga Kill to anyone.",

            "content": "When I first heard of Akame Ga Kill I was rather hyped It sounded like it'd be the new fullmetal alchemist a shonen with a great mix of comedy drama and action the similarities are there in in both shows a Boy Is coming from a village to a city to become a military dog of sorts both for different reasons The start admittedly had potential Then right when the first death of a main character happened the show began to fall apart\r\nStory(3/10) The story is quite generic a typical boy coming to a big city to join Military  the so He can earnmoney to send to his village Little does he know how corrupt the capital is after some events occur he ends up being recruited by the assassin group night raid that wish to overthrow the government a rebellion of sorts Sounds pretty cool right? \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately Immediately after the first Dramatic scene of the show one that should be effecting Tatsumi on an emotional level to develop his character the Writers thought it would be a good idea to have a comedic moment less then 30 seconds after And that is one of Akame Ga Kill's major faults is there is no tone to it whatsoever, Not to mention The humor is bland as hell almost all of it could just be cut out and you wouldn't even notice It makes it hard to take the show seriously story\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (3/10) Where to even start with this... Akame tries desperately to make us care for these characters they are killing off but the show kills Characters off so frequently The Characters don't get nearly As enough development as they should of The deaths of each characters is treated as a 3 step process. 1 Give the Character some screen time In the previous episode 2 Give them some sort of backstory and flashbacks Then finally 3 Send them off to some fight and watch them die It sounds like I'm being harsh on it but that is what it is the only death that was unpredictable was in the final episodes and that Didn't even happen in the Manga. I don't have an issue with Character Deaths but Atleast develop The Characters due to a lack of Characterization  It just made their deaths feel meaningless As for The Characters themselves they are pretty generic But I still for some Reason Liked most of them Especially Bulat Because of how Entertaining and funny He was and Sheele Who I Only like Because I have a fetish for Glasses And Purple Hair Some of The Characters felt Completely useless Mainly The Night Raid Leader Najenda You would expect Her to be badass and important But sadly She Really didn't do anything for the entire show Even though She has potential to be a badass and capable Female Character The Show just didn't Use any of the Potential The Characters Had\\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10) The Animation for the Show While it looked Nice it Just looked  kind of Standard Nothing To Special in it However The Action Was nice as Expected  But There is a lot of Still Images  and Movements The only real issue I have is there is so much blood coming out From The Characters it feels so unrealistic because I doubt there is even that much blood in a Human Body.\\n\\n\r\nSounds (510)The Music was pretty Average The Openings were decent and fit the Show Nicely but there was nothing Distinct about it For Instance If you Listen to Any song from the Sound Track of a show like Death Note It should be instantly Identifiable You could tell what Anime its from because it has its Own Style Akame doesn't have this it sounds like it was from any other anime. Its not a bad OST Just not Worth a Download.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (510) It was Entertaining at times But The Lack of a Consistent Tone For the Show just Took Me out of the Mood Its Nothing Thought Provoking at All But the action is entertaining for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10) This Show is a Shonen trying to be a Seinen it thinks if they kill Characters off for no Logical Reason its dark and edgy If They would of Developed some of the Characters it would of been a Much Better show It does nothing New for the Shonen Or Action Genre But It does have a Decent Premise and it Stays True to itself The Entire show If you like Watching entertaining Action Scenes and Characters being Treated like Sheep Being sent to the Slaughter House There's a Chance You'd Enjoy this But if You Enjoy Thought Provoking Well Written Shows look Somewhere Else Final Score\\n\\n\r\n(",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nThere's an implication drawn from war that, no matter how much we desire it to be false, people will get hurt. Now, this isn't strictly between countries. \"War\" in this context encompasses all battles. Mental turmoil, physical skirmishes, and verbal bashing are simple examples of such altercations. In some way, shape, or form, the people involved will not leave entirely unscathed. And depending on the severity of the situation, death is a possibility. Akame ga Kill! is all about such death, but is not much more than violence without substance.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe journey starts with Tatsumi, a young village boywho moves to the Capitol in search of his fellow companions. What he finds within the city leads him to join Night Raid, an assassin-filled group whose goal is grand in scope but simple in nature: overthrow the kingdom.\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill! relies on the notion of emotional appeal. Death is rampant within the show, meaning no characters are safe. Akame, Tatsumi, Sheele, literally everyone attributed to the anime are at risk of being eliminated. In order for this to work, Akame ga Kill! requires that the audience become invested in the characters themselves. This is the first problem the anime encounters. Most of the characters are, at times, given their moment of spotlight. Usually involving a single episode or so, much of the cast is given some slight background in order to provide insight about who he or she is and where he or she came from. But there's a rift in this story-telling. For a vast majority of the characters, the appeal mentioned earlier either isn't enough or is hastily thrown in. This creates a disconnect that causes a loss in the show's intended effect. More specifically, the anime has too many characters with too little time to make the deaths meaningful or impactful enough.\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill! also suffers an identity crisis. It constantly reverberates between being a serious, \"dramatic\" battle shounen and a comical, light-hearted romp. The show demonstrates time and again how brutal many of the situations can get. But when it is interspersed with funny jabs or quips to lighten the mood, it doesn't add anything. Rather, it portrays a lack of focus. Then, when the show slides back towards its more serious self, the same issue arises again. Thinking about both aspects, the show shines brighter when it is following the more serious tones. This is mainly due in part to the more \"adult\" subject matter of murder, espionage, and torture. Sadly, the show doesn't stick to this thinking until the final few episodes. Meaning, one must wade through the entirety of the show's lack of direction.\\n\\n\r\nA glaring issue that Akame ga Kill! also harbors is in what actually occurs. Much of what happens has little or zero consequence on future scenarios. The goal behind Night Raid is to topple the current government. They say that what they do along the way is striving towards that goal, but it never comes off that way. Instead, each fight is standalone. Destroying the lab monsters, getting rid of a high officer, or killing a member of the Jaegers doesn't directly affect the group's ultimate dream. In this way, every episode isn't a step towards a resolution, but is instead just another time slot dedicated to potentially killing off another cast member.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill! tends to do well in this department, regardless of the awful story.\\n\\n\r\nBeginning with the art style, the show is, more or less, generic. Forests, safe havens, and inner city towns provide some variety, but are usually not detailed too extremely. The character designs, on the other hand, are actually quite pleasant. While most stick to a \"this is my color\" formula, the designs are done in such a way as to express that character's personality. Akame appears mysterious and foreboding with her jet-black, straight hair and red eyes, while Lubbock seems energetic his disheveled attire. This applies to both the good and the bad guys. It's easy to see that much attention was paid to make them stand out.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, the show does above average. The fight scenes are both large and small in scale, with many opportunities to show off its prowess. Examples include a flurry of swords between duelists or a massive explosion as the byproduct of an Imperial Arm. Since most of the show is steeped in fighting, and the quality of the fights never seems to falter too much, the show should at least be credited for this.\\n\\n\r\nOne last note. The show incorporates some rather impressive shots that are more paintings than drawings. These occur usually once per episode. They don't do much other than show case a heavily detailed scene, but they're a nice addition to provide the animators involved a chance to showcase their talent.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most difficult category. Again, Akame ga Kill! requires a big investment towards the characters involved. Some may argue that this is true for all shows. And to an extent, they are correct. However, this one makes it paramount that such a bond is established. Since death is the name of the game, if the death doesn't matter, than neither does the character. To avoid spoilers, I'll focus on my personal favorites.\\n\\n\r\nHaving an anime titled after you is no easy feat. Akame, the sort of \"poster child\" for Night Raid, is an assassin known for her unmatched swordplay. Resolute, quiet, and unusually hungry, she takes it upon herself to remember the foes of her past in order to provide strength for her future. Despite being in the title, she is relegated to the sideline for a good portion of the show. Character background is given for her, but it comes too little too late. It's strange, to say the least. In the beginning, when she is first introduced, it seems as if her role will be quite huge in the context of the story. But that is not the case. Instead, Tatsumi takes this position, leaving Akame on the wayside. Seeing as Tatsumi is a rather lame protagonist, I think this decision was a poor one.\\n\\n\r\nMost girls like to dress up and put on make-up, and Chelsea is no different. Her flowing orange hair and signature candy sucker make her not only attractive but also \"human.\" That is, among everyone, she seems the most out of place within the fantastical world. Her personality is upbeat, and often clashes with Mine. However, her cheerfulness should not be mistaken for passiveness. Chelsea's main problem is that her inclusion serves no larger purpose. She's pretty much just there. While she may be a confident and fun young lady, she brings almost nothing to the table.\\n\\n\r\nEsdeath, and Akame ga Kill!'s \"best girl,\" is technically not the main antagonist. However, her presence on the battlefield certainly makes it so. Icy and cold, like the Imperial Arm she wields, Esdeath is the epitome of war. Her beauty is striking and so are her skills. Throughout the show, it becomes apparent just how unstoppable a force she really is. Yet, behind her cool demeanor lies a gentler side that she can't quite seem to understand. Her motivations are simple (she just loves to kill and fight), making her a rather plain villain. However, her decision making is not without reason and her personality, despite her torturous ways, makes her adored by all.\\n\\n\r\nObjectively speaking, I find Seryuu Ubiquitous (what a last name! :P) to be the strongest character. Absolutely staunch in her convictions, she aims to bring justice upon the evil-doers of the land. She is quite two-faced, acting bubbly and happy by day but ferocious and insane by night. Her ideals rival that of Night Raid. That is to say, while what she is doing seems wrong, to her she believes that her actions are just. That what she is doing is for the good of the Capitol. Out of the entire cast, she seems to provide the most insight: sometimes, it's important to take a step back and truly think about what you are doing.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is either largely forgettable or doesn't do much to make a lasting impression. They may have their moments here or there, but there just isn't enough character development or attachment to any of them to make them worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP follows a rock-n-roll approach, with hard guitar and drum beats. The vocals involved are quite tame in comparison. The song itself is okay, with the best portion coming through in the end with the final guitar riff.\\n\r\nThe second OP is a step up from the first. It's very gradual, starting almost as a lullaby, but picking up tempo with the guitar and choir singing. Once again, the final guitar pieces take the cake, but accompanied with even more of the choir singing, it makes it all feel quite strong.\\n\\n\r\nThe first of the EDs is very gentle, contrasting well with the show's overall atmosphere. The violin playing adds to this, as does the slow drum beat. Vocally, the singer does a nice job, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe last ED follows its counterpart, being rather gentle in nature. The multiple voices singing in harmony give a rather pleasant feeling. In fact, the visuals provide a lot of the sensation; it feels as if the song flows like rippling water.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack doesn't have anything particularly amazing. If there was anything, I usually enjoyed the sound effect of Akame clashing or slicing through someone. It's a distinct \"whoosh!\" sound effect that always sounded pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, there are no stand out performances to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the fun for this one derives from the fights themselves. It was usually awesome to see the varying Imperial Arms at work and how they would clash with one another. In particular, the final duel is quite impressive, both in its length, the variety of moves, and the ultimate, final technique.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the bad guys that pop up throughout the anime are really quite lame. They are just there to be evil and killed off. Meaning, I was never really fazed by anyone that Night Raid had to encounter, because they never added their own spice or originality. This is obviously not true for the Jaegers, but before their introduction (and even during their time), the rest of the villains are nothing more than boring fodder.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Akame ga Kill! is an anime that really doesn't do much. The characters are very hit or miss and the story is nonsensical. However, if someone is looking to have a semi-enjoyable time, wondering who will prevail after all is said and done, this wouldn't be a bad place to start.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, disconnected, doesn't know what it wants to be, no purpose\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, nice character designs, above average actual animation, picture-esque still frames\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, fun cast, but the majority are non-memorable\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, mix of okay and good OPs and EDs, forgettable soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, action and death galore\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "To say the shonen action genre needs to move on from DBZ is like saying that Taylor Swift should never rap ever again. Everyone knows this, and yet nothing is done to fix the problem and we continue to expose ourselves to it, basically telling the producers that we want more of this shit. We want more lazy ridiculous action with worse choreography than Lethal Weapon 4. We want unironic humor with less wit than Lethal Weapon 4. We want our shows to go on for more than one-cour because the longer the better, and whilst the details are a little different, guess what productiondecisions were made that caused one of the worst fourth entries in action series history to exist?\\n\\n\r\nAnd it says alot about the genre when all it takes is one new thing to stand out and suddenly we jump on it like a Marvel fanboy who discovered that Thanos would be in the newest Avenger movie. Now don't get me wrong, I've always rolled my eyes at the fact that people could partake in duels that send you flying and cut off limbs and yet nobody dies in the end. But I never felt the stairway scene in The Protector would have been much better if we saw those goons getting their heads kicked off, because at the end of the day, I'm watching action stuff for the action, and anything else that comes with the territory either supports the stuff or comes off as a natural consequence. Akame ga Kill doesn't do either of those things though. Instead, it does everything Lethal Weapon 4 did wrong, and it proceeded to drag that pain out for more than six times the length.\\n\\n\r\nBut before we get into that, let's talk about what Akame ga Kill is about. Well, it's about how many shonen stereotypes you can fit into your standard fantasy setting and still expect to be taken seriously, is what it is. Despite not having his name in the title - and said titular girl having less importance than Zelda did in her own franchise - our main protagonist is Tatsumi, your typical village idiot who ends up digging himself into deep shit when he ends up befriending a cheerful girl who is actually EVIL. And believe me when I say she isn't the only one. There's a lot of characters in this show who act like rejected Pokemon characters until you give them a reason to kill you, in which case they turn into Dennis Hopper impersonators.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, his life is saved from this EVIL girl by a bunch of assassins called Night Raid, who wear their title about as well as Epic Movie does due to being about as sneaky and dangerous as Black Star, and he ends up joining their ranks in order to take revenge for some throwaway friends the story forgets about within six episodes. Once in, he must deal with the harsh life of being an assassin such as uncovering the true nature of these EVIL characters, gaining the resolve to kill them for justice, coping with the loss of teammates, and fighting off an Ilsa reject who has the hots for him because he's the main character.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that Akame ga Kill is made by White Fox, whose record in terms of fight scenes is worse than Jon Favreau if he had the shakes. They also have a bad record in terms of animation quality, with the decently animated stuff being reserved for KyoAni-level light hearted entries and the horrendously awful-looking stuff reserved for everything else. And boy does that apply with this show, because it looks it was made in the late 90s by people who don't grasp the notion of shading and color schemes. Even more unfortunately, it's not just the visuals that are washed-out. I've seen JC Staff shows that have had more imaginative character designs and action scenes than this crap and whoever thought them up deserves to be sent back to whatever art school they graduated from. Just compare the Milky Holmes finales (the good ones I mean) to this show's \"target one spot and use stills for the finishing blow\" and prepare to not go blind from visual whiplash. Or alternatively, watch Terra Formars at the same time and see which can bore you more in terms of ruining visceral impact.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's not just the bad action that the studio brought with them in terms of adapting the manga. They also brought their usual pacing problems along with them. The one thing that stands out about the show - the fact that characters die - ends up working against it because the author uses it less as a way to lend gravitas to the plot and more in the way of padding things out in order to get a two-cour length out of this thing. Only the non plot-important characters ever get the axe and because the show always gives you (shallow) background information on them right before they die, it's hard to really summon any enthusiasm for when said axe is swung, especially when they keep introducing new unimportant characters to get killed off shortly after to the point that the formula becomes more repetitive than each installment of a first-party Nintendo franchise. The actual plot-related characters barely push things forward, and when they do, it comes in the form of tired shenanigans like being trapped on a deserted island or running away entirely, just preventing anything from getting done.\\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn't help that none of the characters - main or extra - have any flavor to them whatsoever. All of them are defined by one trait and it never evolves into anything even remotely resembling complexity. I've heard a lot of people talk up Esdeath prior to watching this, but her utter devotion to her masters along with her one-sided love for Tatsumi and handling powers that no human being should be able to handle makes her more the perfect wife for Tatsuya from Mahouka rather than someone I'd want on my side if she wasn't trying to kill me. Jet Li didn't even talk much in Lethal Weapon 4 and yet he had more charisma in one shitty movie than the entire cast throughout this two-cour trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just to turn up the heat on this burnt-out mess, there's the issue of the show's ending. Now Akame ga Kill's manga wasn't finished by the time the show was put into production and thus the studio had to take some liberties with the actual source. Now whilst I'm all for removing the clowns and changing source material altogether, this only works if the changes have some creativity put into them. Not only is a giant immobile mecha shooting up the city incredibly boring to watch, the finale is more rushed than a university student trying to prepare for his exam two hours prior whilst constipated. Combine that with the flat characters and you've got one of the most underwhelming auto-piloted endings to a revolution I've ever seen in fiction. Say what you want about Episode III. At least the destruction of the Jedi was done in an epic way.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the big question I have regarding this show before I end this sea of paragraphs: why was it ever popular to begin with? It adds nothing new to the shonen action genre and whatever potential new thing it could have added is lost in a sea of tired cliches and production problems. I tried looking at a few anonymous forums to see what all the hype was about, but I got turned off by people stating \"they kept this rape scene in. Awesome!\" or \"I was so scared that Leone was going to die because of this show's 'no one is safe' atmosphere\". Yeah, because I was so scared for a character who never had her origins explained and whose apparent \"deaths\" were severely lacking in drama compared to everyone else's.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the people wishing for an army of John Wayne Gacys to show up and do their thing, what the fuck is wrong with you? There's liking violence and then there's just being plain psychotic. And you enter the latter territory the moment you purchase the newest Grand Theft Auto over the newest Saints Row willingly.",

            "content": "Ah, Akame ga Kill, a show hyped up immensely for the Fall of 2014. To be honest, I was really looking forward to watching the show when it was first announced. I have read the manga, and I thought it was at least decent, if nothing else, and it should\u2019ve been decent as anime material as well, but no, it wasn\u2019t.\r\nInstead what we got was a messily-written, poorly adapted mess of a show that killed itself by the end of it all.\r\nNow, before I start this review, let me just note, that even though I\u2019ve read the manga, I will be judging this show basedon its own merits. There\u2019s also a TL;DR at the end for anyone who doesn\u2019t want to read so much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:- 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Akame ga Kill revolves around a young boy, Tatsumi, from a village who sets out to join the military in the capital in order to gain money for his village. Unfortunately, once he does reach the capital, he realizes that the capital is in fact, a corrupt place which was all caused by the person who manipulates a young emperor to his whim, the Prime Minister. Later, through a strange course of events, he is semi-forced to join a group, named Night Raid, which is in fact a band of assassins who are attempting the break the empire.\\n\\n\r\nSeems good doesn\u2019t it? Well, yes. The premise is a pretty good setup. But don\u2019t let that fool you. The show starts off pretty good, especially the first 2 episodes, but after that it\u2019s all downhill.\\n\\n\r\nThe main praise that the story of Akame ga Kill gets is the praise that it had the guts to kill off its own characters. While that may be, you barely get to know anything about the character before they die, meaning that, the character deaths never got to me at an \u201cemotional scale\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has very weird pacing, one episode a main character could\u2019ve died, while in the next, the rest of the characters are on a beach laughing and playing. The story keeps jumping around, and at times it became incomprehensible. The show also has a harem aspect, which at times, got really annoying since it was completely unnecessary and it just wasted time.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with this, there\u2019s also the fact that the story feels very rushed. There were a lot of things that were left unanswered, and while I won\u2019t specify anything, the last 5 episodes were completely asinine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Akame ga Kill was done by White Fox, a studio known for such works like Steins; Gate and Jormungand. Unfortunately, this is definitely not their best work. The most I can say about the animation is that it\u2019s very bland. The lack of attention to detail is, quite frankly, disgusting. The only real thing that stands out in the show\u2019s animation is its average quality, and that is not what I look for in an animation studio.\\n\\n\r\nThough, there are two positives to the animation, those are, the well done fight sequences, and the excess of blood shown, something that a lot of recent anime seem to avoid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the animation of the show isn\u2019t bad, it\u2019s nothing great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:- 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMoving away from the art, we have the music, which is just as average as the art, if not worse. The soundtrack of the show is so bland, that I had to go re-watch a few episodes just to see how good or bad the soundtrack was, and now, I still can\u2019t remember how it was.\\n\\n\r\nBoth openings of the show were pretty decent, and the second ending was also good, the first ending though, didn\u2019t do that much for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut now we arrive at the voice actors. Oh god, these voice actors. This show provided me with some of the absolute most clich\u00e9d voices  I\u2019ve heard in anime for some time. If someone\u2019s and antagonist, then their voice just shouts \u201cI\u2019M THE BAD GUY!\u201d, and if someone was a protagonist, their voice shouted \u201cI\u2019M THE GOOD GUY!\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:- 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the section where this anime, like many others before it, falls flat on its face. But this one doesn\u2019t just fall; it falls into a bottomless pit, never to be seen again.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just say it flat out. The characters in Akame ga Kill, are the most clich\u00e9d, stereotypical and straight up least developed characters I\u2019ve ever seen. Even some terrible shows, like Pupa, had more interesting characters that had some kind of depth to them, and I\u2019m not kidding.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just spell out the stereotypes for you. \\n\r\nTatsumi is the young hero who wants to become strong. Akame is the classic case of a cold uncaring assassin, who also happens to be a food junkie. Leone is the Onee-San, who loves to make sexual references to the youngest in the group, in this case, Tatsumi. Lubbock is the perverted guy who\u2019s actually nice-hearted, but still tries to sneak in a peek at some ladies. Sheele is the airhead. Bulat is the strong dependable older brother of the show, to whom Tatsumi looks up to. *cough*Kamina*cough*.\\n\\n\r\nChelsea and Najenda were the only two characters who I actually cared for, not because they were developed, but because they were the only characters who were even remotely realistic. \\n\\n\r\nThe we have the most classic case of Mine. Mine is a tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nWhat? You expected more? Well tough shit, there is nothing more. That\u2019s it, she\u2019s a pure Tsundere with no effort put into her character.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have the ever so popular Esdeath for you Yandere-lovers out there. She\u2019s a Yandere, and a sadistic one at that. Again, there\u2019s nothing more to her character.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, I did care for a certain group of characters, the rivals of Night Raid, who are the assassins for the empire, the Jaegers. This group was a bit more interesting and entertaining in comparison to the shit-fest that was Night Raid.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end Akame ga Kill, has one or two decent characters, but the negatives completely outweigh the positives in this section.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:- 7/10\\n\r\nThis is the best part of this anime. Regardless of its numerous flaws, I enjoyed watching the anime, even if it wasn\u2019t exactly enjoyable for the right reasons. In the first half of the show I enjoyed watching the anime without noticing its flaws. Towards the middle, that enjoyment turned to distaste as I watched while noticing most of its flaws. By the end I was laughing my ass off as to how hilariously bad the show had become.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-A good premise\\n\r\n-Average animation\\n\r\n-Decent action\\n\r\n-Good openings and endings\\n\r\n-Slightly enjoyable\\n\r\n-There wasn\u2019t any censorship\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Terrible execution of story\\n\r\n-Horribly written characters\\n\r\n-Forgettable soundtrack\\n\r\n-Poorly adapted(For manga readers)\\n\r\n-The ending was awful\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR :- Overall, Akame ga Kill, was a poorly adapted show. It had a decent premise which went wrong. In its technical department it could not have been more average, and the characters are stereotypical, bland and underdeveloped to no extent.  The show starts off as a dark and gritty shounen that could've become a seinen, but eventually it just devolved into a generic shounen that was as average as average can be.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:  4.4/10",

            "content": "Akame Ga Kill should have been called Akame Ga Controversy. \r\nWith it deviating from the plot of the manga, loads of the original fans were outraged and called for White Fox's head. But as someone who hasn't read the manga, and probably won't for a while, I'd like to call Akame Ga Kill a small success. It succeeds in it's small niche of being the Game of Thrones of anime, and if you watched this while it was airing and didn't get any spoilers --- tell me your secrets, as this review will be completely spoiler free. \r\nStory(6/10): The story begins as a young swordsmennamed Tatsumi leaves the village he grew up in in order to send some money or support back to it. He plans to join the Imperial army when he is intercepted by a busty blonde that tricks him out of his money(that he was flaunting). Eventually, he has to sleep on the streets when a young, wealthy lady offers him a place to stay, which he accepts. Later on, you realize that people with even the kindest of demeanors and looks can be the wickedest, and this is when Tatsumi meets the infamous Night Raid, a group of assassins that specializes in the elimination of evil and corrupt denizens. He joins them on their mission to better the world as he is violently thrust into the world of fighting, bloodshed, and loss. \\n\\n\r\nIn Akame Ga Kill, there are weapons known as \"Imperial Arms\" that are age old tools that were created to help balance the world. They're extremely powerful weapons of destruction that are present throughout the anime, and all Night Raid members have one in their possession, as well as the Jaegers, introduced later as the main force that will oppose Night Raid in the story until the brutal end. But as lavish as this all sounds, it falls short of anything really spectacular or even above average. The story/plot is just good enough to propel the whole anime forward, but it has problems throughout, such as it going for too much shock value, and trying to force watchers to feel emotions that just aren't there. But in all, the plot was pretty decent. \\n\\n\r\nArt(10/10): If there's one thing Akame Ga Controversy does right, it's the art. Not even manga readers should be able to talk smack about it. It's vibrant, colorful, and remarkably fluid, including the animation. It's an eye orgy the whole time, and its probably the best thing about Akame Ga Kill. \\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10): I'm going to be honest. I didn't always notice the music playing in the background, if there even was any. There were moments when it definitely amplified the moment, but most of the time the whole soundtrack was pretty forgettable. Though at the same time, it's nothing to talk down on either. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7/10): The characters, a lot like the art style, were unique and likable. This connection of liking, or even loving for some, is essential to how the anime toys with your feelings and emotions, as it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that characters will die, and a lot will suffer before hand. However, for more than a few of the characters, I thought they didn't get nearly as much development as they should have, and it made their deaths much less impactful than they should have been. Other times, the death flags were so obvious that you just start crying even before they die. An extra 2 episodes to make 26 for character devlopement would have gone a long way\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10): I'm a pretty nit picky person, but surprisingly, there wasn't much to nit pick at in this anime. Everything just clicks and works fine from start to finish. Although I will say this is probably the simplest anime of the year and offered no depth whatsoever, but at the same time, that's not what Akame Ga Kill aimed to be. This isn't Serial Experiments Lain. This is your standard over-the-top Action anime, up there with Seven Deadly Sins and Bleach. And Akame Ga Kill excels perfectly in this area, and I didn't struggle at all with watching any of it. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (8/10): \\n\r\nAkame Ga Kill is a contender for anime of the year in my book, but still has serious competition to compete with. If you read the manga, you probably won't like this adaptation at all, and will give it a poor score. Should I read the manga to see how much better it is? Maybe. But as it is right now, Akame Ga Kill was a fun, spoiler-ridden ride that'll be hard to forget. Although the Story and Sound is subpar, it makes up for it with excellent attention to Art, and a nice and colorful cast of characters. If you're debating whether to watch or read this, I'd say to definitely watch it first so you don't end up hating it while you watch it. And I probably would have liked this anime a bit more if I wasn't spoiled every day, but you my lucky reader, who hasn't seen the anime, probably won't have it as bad as when it was airing. \\n\\n\r\nIn all, Akame Ga Kill is a fun ride if you're willing to excuse some bumps along the track. It's not a master piece by any means, but if you look at it at just the right angel, you might find something I did not.",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill is not the worst anime ever made, but it sure is one of the least genuine. The writing pieces together mismatched elements of shonen adventure and gives them a screwball seriousness about death until the word \u2018death\u2019 has lost all meaning. The script is oversaturated with character introductions and sensationalized death scenes that feel simply slimy. The grubbiness that Akame ga Kill exhibits come right from the very bottom of the medium complete with unexplained power ups, an impossibly simplistic corrupt fantasy setting, and hundreds upon hundreds of flat characters.\r\n\tThe amount of fried chicken consumed in this anime is painful. The PrimeMinister\u2019s beloved son dies? It\u2019s time for fried chicken. Akame is on stakeout? It\u2019s time for fried chicken. Wallowing in sadness about the death of a main character? It\u2019s time for fried chicken. The fried chicken gag is indicative of the narrative depth here. It doesn\u2019t go deeper than visual indulgence. There are no subtleties in Akame ga Kill. The good guys simply move on without meditation on death, and the bad guys are simply bad without any logical reason. The protagonists are protagonists because the show needed them scripted like that, and the antagonists are the same way. Even with the introduction of the Jaegers (why a German name?) and Tatsumi\u2019s foil (more like clone) the show simply ramps up the stakes. The bad guys get bigger as the good guys get stronger and they keep introducing new characters that are \u201cstronger\u201d and occasionally an old face is replaced with a new face (Bulat becomes Susanoo). \\n\\n\r\n\tAkame ga Kill manages to create a cast of both heroes and villains with no positive traits. Seryuu Ubiquitious as an example, is a character that exists solely to be an antagonist. She has catchphrases, she has special moves, and she has \u201cmoral values\u201d that contradict our protagonists. Except none of the characters ever make any sense. Why does she want to Kill Tatsumi? It\u2019s her job to eradicate all evil no matter what it is? It doesn\u2019t make any sense on a literal level and it doesn\u2019t make any sense on a realistic level. I\u2019m not saying anime characters moral codes should be realistic, but then shouldn\u2019t they serve a greater thematic purpose? Having to hear about why Akame needs to be the one to kill her sister makes for some of the stupidest monologues not because it\u2019s a flawed idea at its base but because there is no basis for her needing to kill her sister to begin with. And when the show moves towards characters like Esdeath and her talk about love it feels as if the largest and most blunt plot device starts pressing harder and harder on the script. Akame ga Kill is serious about a whole lot of nothing other than reaching its embarrassing (near direct Madoka rip-off) anime original ending. \\n\\n\r\n\tHow did someone come up with the character designs and fantasy setting for Akame ga Kill? Just like Shingeki no Kyojin, it is some sort of walled city with a corrupt government. Except our protagonists are a pink haired goth-loli, a schoolgirl with a sword that instantly causes death,  a generic guy, a green haired steam punk dude, a gay guy, a Japanese god-turned-golem and a buxom cyborg-like leader. The bad guys are a dog that turns into a full arsenal, another generic guy, another schoolgirl, another gay guy, another buxom leader, and a man in a gas mask with a flamethrower. None of these things even follow a design scheme! It\u2019s like a party with the most interesting people in the world who all leave before you can ask them how they managed to get to there. Where Shingeki no Kyojin can get by with flat and often ridiculous characters sadly Akame ga Kill does not have the production value. Visually it\u2019s bland and static, with very few dynamic camera angles and often whole fight scenes skipped or scratched for reasons beyond explanation. My favorite was a scene where a series of \u201cdanger beasts\u201d \u2013 almost forgot about these - approach Tatsumi out of nowhere and he announces that it\u2019s going to be a tough fight. Immediately the scene cuts and he is sheathing his sword, and announces that it was indeed a tough fight. For an action and adventure show, how could you have the brass to write that? There are show\u2019s that are plucky enough to get away with it, like the entirety of episode 4 of Katanagatari, but Akame ga Kill is not that smart. You wouldn\u2019t realize how stupid Akame ga Kill is if it wasn\u2019t this loud.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe show is a mistake from beginning to end, but it\u2019s not without entertainment. And that\u2019s the whole hook of it. You\u2019ve seen this show hundreds of times before but maybe never this simple. It really is the mindless violence action anime of 2014, whatever that title means to you. I do not recommend it over anything but if you want mindlessness you have it's essence distilled right here. I look at Akame ga Kill as a failed version of Shingeki no Kyojin because it is even more indulgent in terms of gore and has less of a mystery element. This anime is mighty popular, but you are not missing anything by not watching it. The ancient relics have no boundaries in terms of power scope, and the bad guy is named Prime Minister Honest. I can\u2019t believe someone wrote this.",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill! is probably one of the biggest train wrecks of 2014. That's really the only way to describe it. It is a train wreck. In the beginning, the train began running. In the middle, it began to waver a little. By the end, it's crashed into the lake. That, of course, is Akame ga Kill! right there.\r\nDo note that this review will refer to the anime and only the anime, so there will be little to no mention of the manga.\r\nSTORY:\r\nAs the summary says, the story of Akame ga Kill! is basically about the main character, Tatsumi, being roped into an organization calledNight Raid dedicated to taking down the corruption within the Capitol, said corruption stemming from the evil Prime Minister who controls the young king like a puppet. It's nothing ground-breaking, but it works. At least, the premise does, anyway. See, some problems with Akame ga Kill! stem from sounding good on paper and then turning out to be lacking in execution, like the aforementioned premise. To name an example, there's the decision to introduce a rival organization called the Jaegers that works under the Capitol to fight Night Raid, and though it's a little cheesy to have a \"good team vs. bad team\" in a vein similar to the Super Friends vs. The Legion of Doom, but it would have been nice, considering the story spends some time focusing on the characters within the Jaegers and establishing character relationships in it like in Night Raid. Another concept that sounded cool on paper was the fact that the majority of the cast is not protected by plot armor, so truly, anyone could die at any moment. This is one concept that probably drew in many people who were tired of anime or manga where characters kept being resurrected, like say Naruto and Dragon Ball. However, the fatal flaw for both of these examples, if not a half-assed execution, would be lack of characterization that makes you care for what happens to anyone, but we'll get to characters later.\\n\\n\r\nFor the world, there's very little to say about it. The only thing you can say about it is \"it's a medieval-esque fantasy world.\" It looks like it's straight out of a Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, or Legend of Zelda game, what with the towns and exotic monsters, except it doesn't have nearly as much thought put into the world-building, so the setting essentially doesn't contribute much to anything either.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say for the rest of the story is, well, it's a train wreck. It completely jumps the gun sometime in the later half, stops caring about anything, and starts going all Urobuchi on the characters who are still alive at this point. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing much to say in the Art department. The art style is generic and somewhat uninspired, but it works, if nothing else. The designs are simple but varied enough, whether it be for the monsters, weapons, etc. The animation is standard fare; the characters look shaded well enough and the fights can be fun at times, but nothing really sticks out but it's not necessarily bad either, except for whenever they'd keep showing still-shots like this was a PowerPoint presentation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nLike the art, there's really not much to say here in my opinion. The voice acting is okay, and the screams are even delicious to listen to (if that makes any sense), but I wouldn't be giving out any awards. As for the soundtrack, there also aren't any songs that really stick out, though if there's one highlight, it would be the first opening, \"Skyreach,\" by Sora Amamiya. While the second opening, \"LIAR MASK,\" by Rika Mayama, was also good in its own right, as were the endings, I probably won't remember them tomorrow, so that's that.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't noteworthy at all. Like, any of them. At all. It's difficult to go into more detail because there's frankly not much more to go into more detail about. There's the main character Tatsumi, but he's ultimately bland and unmemorable in terms of personality. He's brave, somewhat heroic, and determined, like millions of other fictional protagonists out there. That's really all there is to describe him. There's also Akame, who despite having her name in the title, has little to do with the plot. In the beginning, she's introduced as arguably the best killer in Night Raid, and as for personality, she's depicted as somewhat gluttonous and insensitive, but ultimately very caring, but eventually, most of these traits fail to develop or completely disappear. There's also side characters like Leone, the hot older sister type, Lubbock, the perverted laid-back guy, Bulat, the cool older brother type, Sheele, the cute ditz (for the most part), Mine, the tsundere loli-esque girl, and many others. Most of these characters also lack notable depth and come with their own sad backstories that are mentioned once and then never again. Speaking of things that are mentioned once and never brought up again, let me tell you one thing, they handle the deaths of their friends and loved ones really, really well. Well enough to smile carelessly the very next episode.\\n\\n\r\nLike the protagonists, the antagonists lack memorability and depth. The majority of them and their motivations can just be described as \"they're evil!\" and it's left at that. It doesn't really help that their evil nature are brought to the extreme; anyone who doesn't agree with the protagonists, the \"good guys,\" are all depicted as sadistic and love nothing more than torturing and slaughtering people. Really, the only notable villain is General Esdeath, and that's because she's the best girl, of course, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nLack of ample characterization really did hurt this show. If the characters were better developed or had at least thirty minutes of screen time, maybe their deaths would have mattered and have had more impact to the audience, but we're not dealing with \"would have\" thinking, hence the characters are probably the weakest aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've called Akame ga Kill! a train wreck, but I'll be damned if it wasn't a really entertaining train wreck. At least near the end anyway where, as I mentioned earlier, it just stopped caring. But for the majority of the show, I had serious mixed feelings. I had fun during the fights and whatnot, but there were a few things that threw me off, like the inconsistent tone (\"My friends died? Well, okay. I'll just be sad about it for like five minutes and then get into a comedic / romantic misunderstanding with one of the girls.\"), the overall edginess, for a lack of better word, and subplots that really didn't lead anywhere (an episode dedicated to introducing a small group of villains kills most of them off by the end of the same episode). Overall, it was a mess, but it was a fun mess.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nWas Akame ga Kill! doomed from the start? Well, probably not. It could have been a good show if the writing was better, but, well, this isn't a good show, plain and simple. With bad execution, lackluster art & sound, cardboard cutout characters, and a later third that completely jumps the shark, the only way to enjoy this show is to turn off your brain and have some popcorn to go with it, but if you're looking for a piece of work that's actually good, look somewhere else.",

            "content": "*spoilers for Akame ga Kill*\r\nAkame ga Kill is an endearing case of stupidity and an inability to take itself seriously when it needs to while taking itself seriously when it shouldn't. It's far too edgy for its own good, and it's a riot to indulge in, thanks in no small part to its incompetence, blatant spelling out of already black and white matters, and it's tonal incoherence...or at least it starts that way. It then grows into a more generic and edgy anime that tries and largely fails to wring intended emotions out of us with mostly generic and bad characters, equally badly inserted humor,and improper backstory dumps that are either too early and never reinforced or too late and never reinforced. Alright so, just how bad can it really be with all of that said? Is it some part of Akame ga Kill's plan to kill our brain cells until all we can say is \"ga\"? Well, with that little conspiracy theory out of the way, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nThere is something to be said when your first episode is so rushed, edgy, and tonally incomprehensible, that it automatically informs you that this show is not gonna be pleasant. I mean, the first episode is schlock at its finest, hence my accusations at the preamble. I mean, it doesn't even name a single location, and in fact, not a single location in this series has a proper name, which really sells how horrific the world-building for this show really is. After Tatsumi is roped into joining Night Raid, episodes 2-8 are, for most part, asshole of the week type episodes, at least until two of its members die: Sheele in episode 6, and Bulat in episode 8. It is here that we encounter a few more problems (one of which sorta surfaced in episode 1 but could've been rectified). \\n\\n\r\nFirst, the Danger Beasts. We know not of much of the species present here, and there are no real defined danger tiers. They're just there for people to kill while being acknowledged as powerful beings. Second, and thankfully this goes away, but this section of the series is so blatant about being black and white that when a terrible person is having a villain monologue, the anime decides to visualize them as literal monsters, because the audience of gore and boob-loving 14-year-olds apparently needs to be blatantly told that these awful people are monsters.  Subtlety; it's what this series rarely has. Thirdly, the goddamn tone-shift comedy moments. Episode 1 is a major example of this, with the show constantly cutting its serious or even sad mood short in order for a quick, unfunny gag, and then it cuts back. It's really jarring and tonally incomprehensible at times. Finally, and this is the most pervasive and problem-encompassing of the issues, the Imperial arms. \\n\\n\r\nThere are 48 of them (yet we never see even half of them), and for some reason, none of these can be recreated with modern day AGK technology and magic (because of course a magic gun can't be manufactured; that would make sense) and they each have hidden abilities that are often conveniently pulled out of a character's ass (especially Akame's from episode 24 (which somehow doesn't poison her like it does for anyone else who gets cut), Esdeath's from episode 21 which freezes time for an unknown amount of time for the will of the writers to screw her or someone else over, and Tatsumi's golden Incursio form from episode 23). Don't get me started on Mine's \"Pumpkin Pinch\" which almost always occurs when she decides that she's in a pinch without actually being in one (because outnumbered automatically equals pinch). Also, the Imperial Arms are only compatible with a user if said user has a great first impression of it, which is insanely dumb since that means the only way for it to choose you is for you to geek out over it, and nothing else. And, if you allow me to jump ahead for a bit, episode 23 introduces an asspull in which there were this secret Divine Imperial Arms all along, jacking up the count from 48 to 49, and being strong enough to fuck over the unnamed city (you heard me). We'll return to this travesty moment in a bit since we gotta move on with the actual plot of the series, which is also a travesty.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 9-19 are effectively part 2 of the show, with part 1 being what i described earlier and part 3 being...we'll get there. This new part brings out a new organization by this evil empire that Night Raid has fought against, called the Jaegers, comprising of 7 powerful members of the Capital, most notably, the brutal ice wielder, Esdeath. Tatsumi gets his ass captured, escapes, and then Dr. Stylish (like an Idiot), leads an assault on Night Raid with his bio army, not even informing or bringing along the other Jaegers like a smart member would do, and of course, after Susanoo is introduced  to fight alongside Night Raid, Stylish gets his ass killed by Akame. Then, after Chelsea comes in and both she and Susanoo are indoctrinated into the group, and Tatsumi and Esdeath are teleported to and back from an island, we get Kurome's ability to revive fallen members and danger beasts (and she could've brought Chelsea and Bulat back to really hamstring our heroes but she isn't that smart), and both Bols and Chelsea die. Then, the 4 Kouken Temple Rakshasa demons, 3 of which are killed by Lubbock in the exact same episode they're introduced, which is just plain pathetic. I mean, the Garou Knights from Fairy Tail were a more credible threat than these guys; at least the Garou Knights lasted for more than one episode. The final demon member gets killed by Tatsumi really easily in the next episode (in the anime, not in the manga), and Seryuu is killed. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the final 5 episodes: the anime original episodes. Here, both groups are brought down to 2 living members, with the deaths of everyone except: Akame, Najenda, Wave, and Run. Even main character Tatsumi dies, which is rare. That guy who teleported Tatsumi and Esdeath (his name is Shura) and Lubbock kill each other after a Night Raid Plan goes wrong and Tatsumi is captured by Budou (who kills and is killed by Mine), and Susanoo sacrifices himself against Esdeath to get everyone (including Tatsumi) out of a wrecked colosseum. Akame and Kurome duke it out (Kurome apparently is slowly dying from the drugs she was injected in when she was a kid, and she still didn't try to summon anyone from Night Raid to really torment Akame in battle like a smart wielder of her weapon would do in her situation), and then that new Imperial Arms appears with the young boy emperor using it to wreck everything in episode 23, where the story takes one final plunge from awful to rock bottom. Then, Akame and Esdeath duke it out with asspulls aplenty, and then we actually...get a satisfying finale. \\n\\n\r\nI mean it when I say that the finale to this series is genuinely good, at least the second half of it, after the whole Akame vs Esdeath fiasco. The horrible prime minister who made the empire toxic ended up getting his head smashed by Leone (who get shot a bunch of times by him), Leone says goodbye, goes back to her now happy city (or something, we don't know the name or even if it's a city, town, or village) and the dies there while knowing the difference her and her group's efforts made, and the empire gets a new mode of government, with both main groups (Jaegers and Night Raid, or what's left of them) dissolve and join together (except Akame) and Najenda says one last goodbye to the already dead Lubbock, carrying his headband. Despite the idiotic final fight and the edgy and even more idiotic nature of the series, the finale is genuinely satisfying and sweet, which is far more than I can say for any anime of or near Akame ga Kill's admittedly low caliber.\\n\\n\r\nA majority of the characters in Akame ga Kill barely do anything to avoid being totally one-dimensional, especially our protagonists, and a lot of them do incredibly stupid things, including my Dr.Stylish and Kurome examples from earlier. Another problem with these characters is that backstories are handled horrendously. They are often used as death flags like with Bulat and Bols (in which they die either the same episode or the next episode afterwards) almost never actually animated (since we either see them explain it with no flashback footage or they're so short that they only last up to 25 with little animation) with the only exceptions being Sheele's, Akame's, Kurome's, Najenda's and Esdeath's backstories, 2 of which are mainly done in the episode Kurome dies where the backstories of both her and Akame are fully shown instead of partially shown, and the rest, barring Najenda's, never really being reinforced except at one key moment, with no better example than MIne's generic \"raised and bullied in the slums\" backstory that has  no remote elaboration on anything like why she joined Night Raid. It's bad enough that one of these backstories are used for \"episode I die in\" scenarios in which we never really got to connect with a character and see many facets of him/her, and it's bad enough that some of them (like Wave and Lubbock) don't even have backstories, but some are down with literally no provocation or narrative reason, like Leone's and Mine's (until MIne's gets reinforced in episode 19 so that she can kill Seryuu). In fact, I can't even remember Leone's backstory, just the fact that she has one.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists of the series (Night Raid) are pretty terrible and largely generic, and it's pretty sad when most of the notable villains are better written and more likable than them. Let's start with Tatsumi. In the beginning, he an unlikeable and pompous idiot, and through development, he becomes a very, very generic protagonist. Bulat, his \"bro\", has 2 traits: manly, and gay; that's all there is to him aside from his death flag backstory. The two have this Simon and Kamina dynamic, and it lasts an eerily similar amount of time as Simon's and Kamina's, with eerily similar impacts to the surviving protagonists, except Simon and Kamina are legendary characters while these two just suck. Akame is one of the better protagonist, though all she amounts to is an edgier, discount Saber with a twisted poison weapon. Lubbock is a generic badass pervert who manages to get the most amount of important kills next to Akame now that I think about it. Sheele is a typical hot, clumsy who is more interesting due to her also being a savant in killing people, and Leone is the energetic, fan-service tease. Now, Mine...where do we begin with this bitch...\\n\\n\r\nMine is the my most hated character in this show by a gigantic margin, one of the worst Tsunderes in history, and one of my most hated characters in fiction, up there with the likes of Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass and Shin Asuka from Gundam SEED Destiny; I am not kidding here. Her levels of hypocrisy are unmatched in this show, her bitchy and even lethal attitude and actions towards Tatsumi is infuriating to the point where I nearly dropped the show because of her on multiple occasions, and by the end, she just becomes a by the numbers tsundere in all aspects. There is literally nothing good I can say about this character except that I'm glad the show killed her off. Fuck Mine and everything about her!\\n\\n\r\nChelsea, conversely, is my favorite character, in large part due to how she manages to aggravate Mine, and the fact that she has lollipops. She's a bit harder for me to define in a singular characteristic, but she's very playful, cold, and somber all at once, thanks in no small part due to her backstory (that is unseen) of her previous team dying in front of her. Susanoo is very picky about details and is simply the stoic cool guy that has literally every single convenient housekeeping trait a woman wants in a man: the perfect husbando, if you will, which is the antithesis of Sheele's character. Najenda is simply a military leader who kicks the ass of anyone who offends her. That wraps up the Night Raid members; now for the Jaegers...and everyone else...shit.\\n\\n\r\nEsdeath is a hot, powerful yandere sadist who has this \"survival of the fittest\" mentality. Refreshingly, she also feels great pity for any comrade who dies, and often leaves a few people alive in hopes that they'll get stronger in order to provide a greater challenge for her since she's a blood knight. Unfortunately, the filler episodes betray her character big time by making her only the bare bones version of what I described with none of the added remorse and ill-intended mercy I mentioned prior. Wave is basically Tatsumi, but better in every way imaginable, including fashion sense, hair, and Imperial Arms, so we don't really need to go over him and his lack of backstory. Kurome is a more crazed likelier than Akame is, and she also really, really wants to be the one to kill her. SHe's also dying from the drugs injected into her in her backstory that made her a better assassin, which wasn't brought up or remotely hinted at until episode 20. Run was a teacher until his students died in which he decided to take the Suzaku Kururugi route of trying to change the government without actually doing anything other than becoming a soldier in their ranks, and he's a very suspicious and uninteresting character. I can't really remember much about him other than his backstory, methods, and angel wing Imperial Arms. Skipping Dr.Stylish because all he is, is a crazed and stupid mad scientist who really likes when things are \"stylish\". Bols is probably the best of the bunch. His intimidating mask is to cover up how he is insanely shy to the point of not wanting to show his face until Esdeath takes the mask off and makes him eat with the very welcoming Jaegers in probably the most heartwarming scene of the show. He even has a wife and kid whom he communicates within an adorable and actually real manner. He basically carries the more human and successfully emotional side of Akame ga Kill, and while the show tries to hard to be emotions, it rarely works and I'll explain why later. Still, while Chelsea is my favorite character here, Bols is easily the best written, even if that doesn't really mean much here.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure I'm in a minority when I say that I don't hate Seryuu Ubiquitous. That doesn't mean that she's a good character, but she easily could've been. Plus, I have a bias for anyone who manages to hurt or aggravate Mine consistently, except Tatsumi 'cuz he's lame. They try to make us emotional for Seryuu and put her in a more sympathetic light despite her hypocritical, knight templar tendencies, but they fail miserably. They either do it too early or too late, and no better example than with the death of Dr.Stylish. She didn't interact much with him but then we see her cry over his grave and have a backstory moment about how he was her patron and that he gave her multiple gun implants. If this series was written better, we would've seen them have a really strong, established connection like with Tatsumi & Bulat. Her violent side is also cartoonish as hell to the point where I can't hate her; reason being, I can never take her seriously with those facial expressions that make Code Geass wince. I mean, shark teeth? This is supposed to be taken seriously yet her face becomes the kind of expressive that feels like she belongs in a Saturday morning cartoon. But enough about her and why I can't take her seriously; let's discuss the other people!\\n\\n\r\nPrime Minister Honest (why?) is a manipulative, fat, gluttonous, greedy monster, as if he was the poster-boy for his archetype. Though his dinner interactions with the child emperor (who doesn't even have a name despite being important, especially in episode 23) are genuine-feeling and nice. Shura is a typical complete monster, treating people's lives like toys and Budou is a general who randomly shows up in episode 20 while also being talked about in some of the middle episodes, and he's just an OP general dude, nothing more than that. Plus, he, a being who is supposedly stronger than even Esdeath, is killed by Mine...wow. I already mentioned the 4 demon guys, and I'm literally not even gonna mention any of the minor characters from episode 1-8 or any of the guys summoned by Kurome; they're not worth mentioning whatsoever and have dreadfully dull characterization at the best of times.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is not as well animated as say, Steins;Gate, Studio White Fox still did a pretty good job with a lot of the animation and set-pieces of Akame ga Kill, even if their trademark White Fox eyes are unfortunately missing. There are some great looking set-pieces, like the destroyed Imperial Arms used in the background of the Akame vs Esdeath fight. There is also insanely minimal CGI which is a rarity in anime nowadays. The fights are often well animated and the different fighting styles of the weapons are all in full display, from swords to gunplay to strings and what have you. Even the danger beasts look interesting to a decent extent. This isn't Fate/Zero or Unlimited Blade Works or anything, but it still looks pretty good, especially the Akame vs Kurome fight, even if a lot of the earlier fights use the bad DBZ spam thing of characters pulling off an insanely unrealistic amount of hits with things.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is pretty decent, with some really standout tracks like the amazing catchy Hindi track \"Sakaba\", the rustic-feeling \"Kinpaku\", or the amazing and most notable track of all: \"Le chant de Roma\". Also, the emotional \"Sheele OST\" and \"Yume Monogatari\" are just beautiful, even if the show doesn't do as well in making the emotional moments work as well narratively. OP1 \"Skyreach\" by Sora Amamiya, is a mostly generic OP but I always like the part right before the chorus, and the final 13 or so seconds. OP2, \"LIAR MASK\" by Rika Mayama, is bloody amazing and if used for a better anime that was long enough for it to feel like a journey, would honestly be really gratifying and tear-jerking; it is that amazing, even if this show is unworthy of it. Both EDs are mainly generic and not noteworthy despite trying to be emotional. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is pretty bad. I cannot recognize a single person in the cast list, so I guess this was to be expected. Some voices work well and make certain insignificant moments better, but the voices of Akame and Esdeath in particular are really not working for the characters, and Akame's often sounds flat as sin, and some emotional moments are even ruined by the dub script and voices. Stick to sub for this one.\\n\\n\r\nInevitably I was going to be really harsh on Akame ga Kill, since it's a pretty terrible show in and of itself. It manages to cycle through almost every single kind of bad you can think of, but I could never bring myself to hate or, or even truly dislike it. You'd think that I would since it has given me almost every reason to, but I simply can't. The first two episodes were hilarious in how bad they were while 3 and 4 were infuriating (and guess which character made them that way and nearly made me drop the show because of it). Then, with aggravating and hilarious exceptions, this show put me in this serene trance of mild boredom. I was never all that angry but never all that entertained, just, at peace in my mind while watching this show. I could've never predicted that from a show like this, and it's because of that, that I'm not angry at it or showing no mercy, even if the way I tackled the plot and characters may make you think otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill is an edgy, silly show that tries way too hard to be cool and shocking while simultaneously trying way too hard to be emotional, despite the script failing to make it work. It fails to establish a strong enough and compelling enough connection between a lot of its characters for their deaths to wring out the emotions they should, like with the death of Sheele, even if the music is just begging you to cry. It beseeches you to feel for these generic shounen characters in this fake seinen world but it just doesn't know how to build anything up properly, nor does it even use its shounen elements properly. It's an absolute mess that was simply blessed with a good animation studio and some good music. It tries and fails at almost every opportunity, rarely earning anything, even if there are subtleties and sweet moments worth defending. Well, with all that said, this has easily been the hardest review I've ever had to do by a gigantic margin, so, thank you for reading, and I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "(Potentially Spoilerific)I began watching Akame ga kill recently, after a long hiatus from anime in general caused mostly by the trials and tribulations of adult life. My time is more precious than it's ever been and I have a limited amount of time for BS. Akame ga kill is BS. This is simply one of the worst shows I've ever seen, the only reason I stuck it out to the end was because I wanted to see how horribly bad it could get. \r\nFrom the get-go, the show is confused, it doesn't know whether it's telling a serious and meaningful story or whether it's justmaking fun of itself. A number of moments in the show that are supposed to be heart-wrenching or intended to leave a lasting impression are cheapened by silly one liners, tropes, and awful humour. \\n\\n\r\nThe shows humour isn't even original, don't come here if you're after comedy. The same old recycled cliches are thrown at you. \\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill isn't afraid to kill of its main characters - this is usually a good thing, but in akame ga kill it's almost a testament to how awful the show really is. The show fails to form a connection between the viewer and the characters. Summarily, they'll die and you won't care because they're such one dimensional recycled clones.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's \"unique\" blend of humour and violence is almost disturbing. As is their glorification of what are essentially terrorists. Issues like this aren't black and white though, there is rarely an \"entirely evil empire\" and an \"entirely good group of assassins\" the first few episodes really cement this paradigm as the various members of Night Raid confront one dimensional power rangers baddy X Y and Z before being given a bunch of Night Raid clones to fight against.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of action, the battles are unbelievable and badly choreographed. Although the show kills its characters it does not maintain a shred of credibility when it comes to how strong people are, or how they fare against one another, it's all quite random. It's the sort of thing you'd spoon feed to a 3 year old making airplane noises and expect them to swallow. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to end this review now and throw up. I really feel like throwing up now, that's how bad this is.",

            "content": "#REPOST.\r\nThere is no secret that 2014 in retrospect was a great year for anime. It was the year that great modern classics like Haikyuu, Black Butler Book of Circus, Barakamon, Shirobako, Yona of The Dawn, Parasyte and Ping Pong the Animation.\r\nIt was also the year that gave underrated gems like Selector WIXOSS, World Trigger and Yuki Yuna is a Hero. It was the year that I generally liked despite having a few stinkers.\r\nHowever, even though I liked 2014 as a whole there was one craze that annoyed me that was the rise of edgy anime. Despite 2014 only having two edgy series being Tokyo Ghouland Akame Ga Kill these two not only bring back other edgy series back to relevance like Elfen Lied, Future Diary, Gantz and Deadman Wonderland where anime causals who liked Tokyo Ghoul and Akame Ga Kill would often check them out but it also spawned more edgy anime in the following years. \\n\r\nThankfully in recent time, the edgy craze has died down a lot as most anime fans including causals seemed to finally got the message that ''being dark and edgy doesn't equal good''. Because of this, every edgy show that came out since then were was dead on arrival.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul re: (anime), Magical Girl Site and The King's Game are all complete abominations.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does this have to do with Akame Ga Kill you may ask? Well to say that Akame Ga Kill is an awful anime is a fast understatement. I'm not exaggerating when I say that Akame Ga Kill is not only the worst anime of 2014 but it's also one of the worst anime to come out from the past 4 years.\\n\\n\r\nSay all you want about Pupa being the worst anime of 2014 but least that train-wreck was short o.  Akame Ga Kill is 24 episode dumpster fire that has some of the worst writing, directing and characters I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a young man named Tatsumi who sets out for the capital to earn money for his starving village and finds a world of unimaginable corruption, all spreading from the depraved Prime Minister who controls the child Emperor's ear. After nearly becoming a victim of this corruption himself.\\n\r\nTatsumi is recruited by Night Raid, a group of assassins dedicated to eliminating the corruption plaguing the Capitol by mercilessly killing those responsible.\\n\\n\r\nSaying that the story of Akame ga Kill is well written it's like saying the plot of Star Wars Battlefront 2 on the PS4/Xbox One was engaging. The story is a poorly written mess that struggles to do basic storytelling elements correctly.\\n\r\nLet's start with this shows tone consistently which is absolutely appalling. It tries to this dark serious series that it's filled with depth however the tone completely destroys it with its out-of-place comedic moments that had. Episode 1 is the prime example of this. Tasumi sees his friend die in front of him then in a scene later we see flailing out in a comedic fashion completely destroy the mood and tension of the scene. It was insulting to see him flailing him like a child in a very serious moment that deals with the theme of grief. One of the main problems with Akame Ga Kill that you will start is how it loves to put childish and comedic characters in a serious setting that deals with serious and provoking themes and topics. It didn't work for the type of show that Akame Ga Kill is trying to be in a long run and as a result, the series ends up being this pretentious mess that has no idea of what it's doing.\\n\r\nThe one thing that you start to easily notice about Akame Ga Kill is how it tires be grey with motivations of the characters leading to questions about they true ideas but the writing in Akame ga Kill was so bad that any attempts of establishing character ideals just ends up being Black and White and this is ultimately showcased with the Emperor and the Prime Minister.\\n\r\nThe Prime Minister is clearly an evil scumbag based on his words and actions that was shown to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime goes too far greater heights to prove this by making him a manipulative, fat, sadistic and a heartless pig in general. As for the Emperor himself well he's just a walking cute little boy on the screen which has no personality whatsoever. Our villain's ladies and gentleman... This is what we want for villains for a dark fantasy anime. Akame Ga Kill no. \\n\r\nAkame ga Kill's horrible black and white writing were only made worse by the horrendously executed character deaths. Now Akame Ga Kill was advertised as this plot armour free dark fantasy shounen where all the characters in the show could at any moment however the execution at horrendous thanks to its awful writing and directing. From the first death in episode 6, I was extremely appealed of how the show uses the concept of death and doesn't even respect it in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers Ahead)\\n\\n\r\nAs much I enjoyed the character Mine her death was just dumb contrived beyond belief was she died due to lack of energy left even though she got hit once throughout the entire fight against Budou and she didn't bleed for shit. Her death ended being nothing but a plot contrivance shit show.\\n\r\nThe most outrageous character death in Akame Ga Kill which had me facepalm was with Leone Death where after being shot five times by the prime-minister gun as well ultimately killing him by smashing his face to oblivion Leone had more of enough time to ask for medical help to treat her wounds however she doesn't say anything to anyone including her night raid comrades as she dies in the middle of the alleyway. How shit is the writing here that it had a real opportunity to keep one of the main characters alive but didn't due to the 12-year-old writer decided to kill her off because say it with me ''People die when they are killed''... BULLSHIT.\\n\\n\r\nThe absolute worst death in the series was with Sheele aka plot device husk girl. She had lots of opportunities to take down Seryu from stabbing her heart with the edge of her scissors after losing her arms. Slicing her head in the ground but no. She as an assassin leaves her out of the open alive and runs off to help Mine.\\n\r\nThere's one thing to help your friend from danger, but there's being an incompetent assassin who leaves a target alive. If she was a pacifist than I would have sort of understand then again she could have brought pacifist type gear to paralyze or sleep the enemy but the writing and directing is so abysmal she leaves her. So dumb...\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Akame Ga Kill has a tone of asspulls is a massive understatement. Almost every single fight and I mean almost every single fight ends with set characters asspulling they way to victory. Not only the fights in Akame Ga Kill ended up a chore to watch thanks to predictability but it really destroys any tension and suspense that the fight could have in a long run.\\n\r\nSome of the asspulling in Akame Ga Kill include Mine being able to pull her final ultimate attack against one of the strongest characters in the series at full power even though she barely had energy left.\\n\r\nAkame slicing her neck with her cursed sword and instead of dying she gets a powerful power up. Another example happens in episode 20 where after the girl was sliced in cold blood she gets up stabs Lubbock, talks normally even though her vocal cords are screwed due to the blow, and falls back to the ground dead.\\n\r\nThe most insulting asspull by far was when Tasumi Incursio transformed into rejected concept art Digimon where thanks to the power of Nakama I mean friendship he was able to defeat the Emperor. Bullshit.\\n\r\n(End Of Spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nOh, if you guys haven't noticed by now Akame Ga Kill is a poorly directed piece of shit and it's not in the same tier as Future Dairy, Goblin Slayer and Tokyo Ghoul re: in terms of directing it's still just a pathetic directed series that insults your intelligence.\\n\r\nOh, if you guys haven't noticed by now Akame Ga Kill is a poorly directed piece of shit and it's not in the same tier as Future Dairy, Goblin Slayer and Tokyo Ghoul re: in terms of directing it's still just a pathetic directed series that insults your intelligence.\\n\r\nSome examples include a scene when Tasumi in a ship looking for the people that he's going to assassinate then out of nowhere we get a backstory of Kamina I mean Bulat. He doesn't go up to Tasumi at all to tell his backstory to him the series just magically decides to tell the backstory to Bulat. \\n\r\nAnother great example is how the anime has a random close up ass shot of a corpse that got stabbed in the back. I want to repeat it again the anime had a random close up ass shot of a corpse that got stabbed in the back. There's being a pretentious and there's completely insulting the viewer's intelligence by showing ass of a corpse expecting us to get hard on and guess what it doesn't work...\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite example of this shows horseshit direction happens at the end of episode 1. After Night Raid takes Tasumi they all fly off to the ground. So why is one part of the city is fully in black? I don't know about you guys but I never have seen a show that is so cheap and incompetent in my life in terms of direction. They could have easily had a close up still shot of Tasumi saying his thoughts or even better have someone create a gadget that let's then fly but no night raid just falls into the void. Did the anime staff even watch the whole anime before putting it on air? The is just absurd in every level possible and it really shows how shit the production is. Unbelievable.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing about Akame Ga Kill by far the worldbuilding. This show has by far the worst worldbuilding I have ever seen in any anime. Not only does a horrendous job at establishing it's fantasy setting where it's for labelling nations, location establishment, country name, political tides etc. but it incredibly inconsistent. One of the best examples of this happens in episode 13 where a character named Lubbock goes over his backstory.\\n\r\nTo keep in mind Akame Ga Kill is set in a fantasy setting where there are horses being used for transport. So tell why there's not only modern football that belongs in the present time but an actual modern rich school in a fantasy setting,\\n\r\nSeriously it's like the series creator doesn't understand the concept of worldbuilding. The incompetence doesn't stop there as the series loves to have awkward and pathetic shots about relevant locations that bore the viewer to death due to how uninspired the world looks.\\n\\n\r\nThe final nail in the coffin of Akame Ga Kill was the final 4 episodes. Outside of theses episodes competently diverting from the manga in a horrible way the series devolves into this contrived kill them all narrative where every singly characters minus a few expectations are dead. Overall the story of Akame Ga Kill is horrendous. This is easily one of the worst told stories I have ever had the displeasure of watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Akame Ga Kill are nothing more but a bunch of generic anime stereotypes that you all seen before.\\n\\n\r\nTatsumi himself is an uninspired generic protagonist who wants to get stronger because of reasons? I usually don't mind the generic main protagonist as long as they are fun, charming and entertaining that overthrown they generic status but Tasumi is anything but fun, charing and entertaining as he goes beyond the generic status by not only being annoying in the personality department but also lacking any depth or development. In many ways, he's no different to an empty husk.\\n\r\nAkame, despite her name being in the title, is shockingly the most forgetful character in the series. Minus the final 3 episodes where she quote ''developed'', she barely did anything in the overall plot. It doesn't help that very wooden in the personality department.\\n\r\nLeone is the typical upbeat fanservice character that you all seen before. She's trying to be this older sister archetype for the group but ends up failing misery thanks to most of her dialogue being about sex/bob jokes. She doesn't develop as a character at all as she remains to be the same character from episode 1.\\n\r\nLubbock is your typical badass pervert who just seemed to be lacking the personality department. Yeah, he may get a good number of kills in the series, but it doesn't mean shit if your personality is shit.\\n\r\nBulat is a plot device more than a character. Apart from being your generic badass older brother type for Tatsumi he only serves of progressing the plot by giving Incursio to Tatsumi that's it. \\n\r\nIf there was a character that I liked from Night Raid, it would be Mine. Sure she may be your typical Tsundere characters that we all seen before however what separates her from the rest of the characters was her backstory as well her development was decently executed. Not only that but her character interaction was spot on and at times generally funny.\\n\r\nIt's such a shame that she dies in the most contrived way possible... Seriously that was one of the most pointless deaths I have ever seen from this medium.\\n\r\nWhen I was creating my review script for Akame Ga Kill, I would always think twice about calling Sheele an actual character. Why because Sheele is literally a walking device for the narrative as well being that serving as a token death for the series. Outside of being a plot device, she is an empty character where the only trait that she has going for is she is clumsy and caring... What a total waste of a character.\\n\r\nChiesa is a character that joins night raid later on and no surprise she is just as forgettable as the rest of the characters in Night Raid. She could have been an interesting fun character to add to the night raid crew but the poor direction destroys her character before she can even truly shine.\\n\r\nAs for Susanoo well, all I can is that less than I talk about him the better because he's just a doormat that exists to be generic and die.\\n\r\nFinally, we have Najenda who is your generic leader of the group who just orders peoples around. That's all I can say about her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo that's wraps up Night Raid now let's talk about the other chararters who are for the most part somehow even worse.\\n\r\nI believe it's unfair to the word horrendous to have it compared to the villains in Akame Ga Kill. These are easily the worst villains I have ever seen in an anime. Not only they are disgustingly generic to the eye thanks evil for the sake of being evil, but they are simply downright incompetent being villains. Many of the villains would either spat out generic villainous dialogue all over the place without any point whatsoever or they would actively tell the opponents about the powers in great detail fully which allows the heroes to kill them. How pathetic!!!\\n\r\nFinally, we have Anti Night Raid aka the Jagers who are all garbage. Almost all the characters from the Jagers are straight out copycats of Night Raid such as Kurome who is basically Akame if she was a loli, Waver who is a flatter Tatsumi, and the rest of them are just as bland and uninspired.\\n\r\nBefore I talk about Esdeath let's quickly talk about Seryu or as I like to call Annoying Justice Hag. I loathed Seryu I really do. Not only she was annoying twat who preaches about justice 24/7, but she's also an inconsistent dipshit who has a serious personality disorder.\\n\r\nOn first glance, she appears to be your typical justice freak however as the series goes on you will start to see her true colours as this annoying justice freak who switches personalities in the hat of a dime from happy to psychotic.\\n\r\nOn top of being one dimensional in the kingdom come, she has no character development to speak off. In fact, I go as far that she devolves as a character where she absolutely refuses to take any criticism about her ideas by replying its nonsense. Fuck Seryu and everything that she stands for.\\n\r\nThen we have Esdeath who is by far my favourite character in the show as well being the most wasted potential character. All the characters that I have talked about so far were nothing more but bland anime stereotypes Esdeath the only character that was quote ''interesting''.\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series, she was a sadist leader who lacked empathy for people of whom she deemed weak, due to her father's philosophy. Before a certain event of the series, she was sort of an interesting character who has decent character depth. However, after a certain event her character slowly falls apart and by a final couple of episodes, she sadly devolves into a typical one-dimensional overpowered villian who has an unhealthy relationship with Tatsumi.\\n\r\nWhat makes Esdeath the most wasted potential character is that she's simply in this show. If she was in any other fantasy that she would be the most complex villain in set series but because she's in Akame Ga Kill a show that plagued with bad writing and directing her motivations and ideals were either simplified or worst butchered.\\n\r\nSo that's all the characters in Akame Ga Kill and they are downright awful!!! Apart from Mine and Esdeath, the characters are infested with bland characters, shallow personality, pathetic writing and laughable motivations if it even exists.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nFor a shounen anime that was released in 2014, it is very underwhelming in both the art and animation departments. The character designs were awful as not only they are generally badly designed but they all don't seem to fit in the world of Akame ga Kill. Some examples of bad character designs include Tatsumi, Bals, Chisea, Najenda, Mine and Lubbock. It's like the characters designs for this anime accidentally put these modern looking characters into a fantasy setting. That's terrible. The background scenery is not much better as the series just uses a collection of bland fantasy background scenery.\\n\r\nThe art consistently is also not very good as keep going off model left and right. Yes, there was a couple of good-looking art every now and then especially in the final 2 episodes but it ultimately doesn't save the shows subpar art production. \\n\r\nThe animation itself is for the most part below average as it loves to budget cuts all over the place. Still, frames, stock footage, choppy movement, weak fight choreography, lack of visual flair and I could go on and on. Like with the art itself the series does have some good animation every now and then especially in the final 2 episodes but those moments come far between as this show animation is overall shallow.\\n\r\n3.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nIf there was anything good about Akame Ga Kill is the soundtrack. The soundtrack while not the great was still very good. I could go as far that the soundtrack has more substance than the anime itself thanks to the soundtrack competent direction and timing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme Skyreach by Sora Amamiya is your typical action opening theme.\\n\r\nThe first ending theme Konna Sekai, Shiritakunakatta by Miku Sawai is a pretty good ending theme that closes an episode of Akame Ga Kill very well thanks to its slow relaxing beat.\\n\r\nThe second opening theme Liar Mask by Rika Mayama is a kickass opening theme that fits well with the nature of the second half.\\n\r\nThe second ending theme Tsuki Akari by Sora Amamiya is a forgetful ending theme despite having decent ending visuals that showcase the bond of Kurome and Akame.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for Sub or Dub.\\n\r\nThe sub was competent for the most part, but there were no standout performances.\\n\r\nThe English dub done by Sentai Filmworks was decent at best. It's not a great dub by any means but at the same time, it could have been a lot worse especially with Sentai Filmworks hit and miss track record when it comes to English Dub.\\n\r\nSo if you had the opinion go with personal preference.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nI honestly cannot say that this show was a success at all. The narrative and series direction was abysmal, The worldbuilding was broken along with the characterization. The visuals were shockingly subpar as the series loves to use budget cuts left and right as well featuring awful character designs and scenery The only redeeming thing about Akame Ga Kill is the soundtrack which was very good and that alone saved it for getting a 1/10 or even a 0.5/10 from me.\\n\r\nThe most baffling part of Akame Ga Kill is how the series even got popular in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nI usually don't mind shows that don't like getting popular like Re:Zero, Erased, Tokyo Ghoul, Sword Art Online, Blue Exorcist and even Darling in the Franxx, however, Akame ga Kill was the one of the few shows that I would say ''How in the hell did this shit even got popular''. If it wasn't for the edge factor the anime community would have forgotten this crapheap of a show in two months or less. Needless to say, Akame Ga Kill is a horrendous series that highlights the worst of modern anime to a degree and you should avoid it like the plague. If you see a DVD/Blu Ray copy at your local store hide it or even better if you have the guts destroy it on site so no anime fan both casual and elite would suffer watching this poorly constructed train-wreck.\\n\r\nFinal Score 2/10",

            "content": "*Spoiler-free review*\r\nI'm not sure why it was panned by a lot of reviewers, but I actually enjoyed Akame Ga Kill.  It's certainly not perfect but it did some things that were executed fairly well in my opinion.\r\nI can see why people had a problem with how a lot of humor was written in the episodes as it can mess with the pace.  I saw the random bits of comedy as just that, comic relief.  I did find some of it distracting or just simply drawing out the episodes, and at some point, the series started to really feel like it was justdragging.\\n\\n\r\nOther issues that I had was it has the makings of a harem anime (which I generally despise).  I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nSo the low down on each category:\\n\r\nStory: It seemed simple at first.  Then it becomes convoluted as most stories go, and at some points it becomes predictable.  My biggest peeve is that the story wants to go one direction and builds up to it, just to get COMPLETELY quashed leaving the viewer wondering what just happened and why.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem I had is that it's called \"AKAME ga kill,\" not Tatsumi.  The story focuses primarily on Tatsumi, while granted is far more interesting than Akame's very plain yet sometimes quirky demeanor.  But the show tries to keep reminding you that it's about Akame, but you never really know why.\\n\\n\r\nThe story flatlines about 10 episodes in, picks up, then flatlines again.  So if you watch this show for the story, don't expect anything mind-blowing or innovative.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I had no problem with the pacing (apparently a lot of people said it went all over the place, I on the other hand thought Kill La Kill was much more all over the place), the mood does change a lot and sometimes you're not sure if they're about to insert a gag or not.\\n\\n\r\nArt - I really enjoyed the character designs and the costumes.  Yes, there's fan service, women are generally very well-endowed and the animators have little shame in showing off their assets as well as practically a few mandatory skimpy scenes, but again, at least they don't have entire episodes devoted to bikinis and swimming.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes I thought were animated well.  They're not absurdly lengthy and not many instances that I noticed of recycled shots.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Nothing to really write home about but I enjoyed most of the voice acting (especially Leone's), the first intro song Skyreach was great, the music is generic background music to match the mood of the show.  Nothing much else.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - They built this story around a bunch of tragic characters for the most part and let their stories unfold as needed.  It gave the viewer a reason to care about almost every character in the show, even the antagonists.  They even take the time to flesh out the antagonists and really humanizing every character and why they became who they were.  By the end, if you invest in the show a little bit, you might find yourself caring about the antagonists as well.  This is where I thought the show actually did shine and kept me watching.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I actually liked the comic relief bits.  It does ease up towards the end of the show and becomes less distracting but all-in-all, I thought it was good enough.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion. don't expect knock-your-socks-off action or deep storylines, but if you watch the show as-is with no expectations and keeping an open mind to random acts of silliness, you might enjoy the show as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nI could still do with less Tatsumi.",

            "content": "Akame ga kill; it is a hit or miss completely. Either people like it or people want to write as many complaints to the author asap. I personally loved the plot and how they animation company was following the story so very well until the last five episodes. That's where everything went wrong; they anime veered a different direction than the manga. Akame ga kill is supposed to be dark and have it's light comedy to ease the viewer so they can enjoy the bitter sweetness of it. They problem with this anime and manga is that the target audience wasn't clear. It had laughsand enjoyable fight scenes that would make it seem like a shounen anime. But the darkness of it (which is seen in the first few episodes) was taken out completely by the anime company due to the fact that the anime was meant for younger audience which made it rather bland and took out the uniqueness of this anime. Since it had so much gore, it didn't do well in Japan and they had to come up with some other alternate ending which I found terrible. Those who have watched the anime without the manga, you are lucky yet unlucky. People who've watched the anime without reading would not understand how bad the ending actually is and will only see the anime as \"the anime with a few good plot twists and amazing character development\" those who read would only see how tragic this anime with such a well crafted plot which had potential to be a masterpiece, had turned to shit. Overall, in the perspective of the non readers, it's something worth killing your time on, and if you're curious to how the story should have went or want to see the potential it had to be a masterpiece, read the manga.",

            "content": "Of all the anime to air in 2014, I think Akame ga Kill was the most dissapointing. Not because it was the worst, but because unlike the other overhyped shows of 2014, Akame ga Kill was actually \"good\" up until the last couple episodes. It's yet another reminder, along with Claymore and Guilty Crown, of how a bad enough ending can ruin an entire anime. However I tend to be more forgiving than many here on MAL and look at the whole content. I don't feel the slew of reviews giving this anime a 3 are fair. \r\nLet's begin with the bad\r\nThe worst thing aboutAgK is the anticlimactic conclusion. I could expand on the absurdity of the anime-original ending and compare it to the manga in terms of character development and story, but it would alienate the anime-only viewers and become a comparison rather than a review. \\n\\n\r\nSo aside from a botched ending, the entire anime suffers from under-developed main characters and a lack of purpose from the evil prime minister who is despicable for the sake of being despicable. The show is called Akame ga Kill so you'd expect Akame to be a real standout character right? Wrong! Akame has very little to no depth and gets ridiculously little screentime for a \"main character\". Although there are hints about her past (maybe the author's way of saying \"go read AgK Zero\"?). Anyways, the \"bad\" here is that she wasn't the real main character. That position went to Tatsumi! He's far less interesting than the under-developed supporting characters and I feel the whole series would have been better off without him. That's not to say I hate him, I just feel very indifferent towards him (even his design is bland). \\n\\n\r\nThe other major problem are the (frequent) death scenes in the anime. If there is something anime taught me, it's that you don't need a highly developed character to make a death scene emotional. I don't think the issue in AgK was that the supporting character weren't developed enough, but rather the execution of their death's was poorly done. With the exception of a few (I will not spoil who).\\n\\n\r\nSo what's good about Akame ga Kill? After all I'm giving it a 7/10 so there are good things I want to point out. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part (original ending excluded), the anime has real good pacing. Things happen chronologically and smoothly enough that you want to watch what happens next. The supporting characters, despite being too numerous to develop, are enjoyable to watch whether it be for their personalities or for their respective imperial arms (some being pretty awesome). This one may be subjective, but Esdeath is a major asset to the anime whether or not you like her. Her introduction propelled the show to higher ground and of all the characters she was by far the most developed. Plus I can't really think of any anime character that is comparable to Esdeath in terms of personality and presence. Lastly, the anime did a great job making the opposing faction \"The Jaegers\" likeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is ok, but could be a lot better. The intense and eye-candy colors almost make up for the animation\\n\r\nThe OST is surprisingly good with a handful of them being remarkable: \"Yume Monogatari\", \"I\u2019ve got to go home\", \"Meeting with Everyone\", \"Le chant de Roma\", \"Friend's Feelings\"\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill had a lot of potential which fell short. It successfully built up to a climax and then lost the audience. Nonetheless it was a very fun ride with unpredictablility at every corner. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "One misconception in the anime industry is that when a show is dark and contains excessive amounts of gore. Many people automatically think the show is deep and thought provoking. The problem is that many anime studios get so hung up with making the show as badass and dark as possible that they forget about the more important problems that might plague the show, like character development and pacing. \r\nAkame Ga Kill is a great example of this problem.\r\nThe story follows Tatsumi, a countryside boy that travels to the capital to join the military and earn money to send to his village suffering from poverty.Tohim the capital is a place filled with opportunities and a happy life. But after reaching the capital he soon realizes exactly how corrupt the capital is. After certain events he is recruited by Night Raid, A group of assassins that wish to overthrow the government and end this corruption.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface Akame ga Kill does seem to be different from other shounens because of it's dark theme and excessive gore. But when you look a little bit deeper Akame ga Kill is actually pretty similar to other stereotypical shounens. You have characters always blurting out the obvious. You have the naive yet strong protagonist that powers up over time. You have almost all of the female characters fall for the protagonist. Akame ga Kill tries to be different show with it's dark theme, but looking at it closer there isn't much difference.\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the more prominent problems in Akame ga Kill is the comedy. The problem isn't in the comedy itself. (Though I admit most of the humor was stale) but rather the execution. Apparently someone thought it was a good idea to slide in a petty joke in many emotional or dramatic scenes. Probably the best example of this would be a scene where Tatsumi finds out about the corruption in the capital and mourns over his loved ones that died to this corruption. This was supposed to be a very emotional scene but then Night Raid kidnaps Tatsumi and makes petty jokes along the way. It is scenes like this that make me unable to take the show very seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are filled with problems too. Tatsumi isn't really much different from other stereotypical male leads. He's strong, kind, and has a great sense of justice. Something we see in pretty much any other male lead for a stereotypical shounen. The other characters in Night Raid don't fare much better either. You have Mine the tsundere, Bulat the \"Aniki\" type. Shelle the klutz, Leone the \"Onee-san\" type, Lubbock the perverted guy, and Akame, the cold assassin. Now considering the show has Akame's name in the title. You would expect Akame to be one of the most important characters of the show. Sadly, the only background we do get to know about Akame is her backstory. She didn't seem to have much development and emotions except for a few scenes.Almost all of the characters feel pretty one-sided and unoriginal. There are two new additions to Night Raid later on in the show. Chelsea and Susanoo. And probably out of all of the characters in Akame ga Kill, I found Chelsea to be the most memorable.Why? Because she actually feels realistic. Although Chelsea seems to be very confident and powerful. She is just like any other girl at her age. She likes to use make up, she has her own beliefs, and she felt like an actual person.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other side you have the Jaegars. A special squad led by General Esdeath which goal is to anhiliate Night Raid and any other group that resists against The Empire. The Jaegars seem to be an awkward bunch. You have Bols, who looks like a psychotic murderer with a mask. Kurome, who apparently loves to eat. Dr.Stylish, a crazy mad scientist. That doesn't mean there aren't normal people there. There is Wave who doesn't really have any special qualities and Run, who seems to be the calm and collected person in the group.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Seryuu...\\n\\n\r\nIf there was a person who could embody the word \"crazy\". Seryuu probably fits the word perfectly. Probably the most hated character in the entire show. Seryuu is a person who has a completely twisted view on justice. She believes that everything the empire does is right and that everyone who goes against the empire is evil. Now although she is indeed twisted as hell and it is a normal response to hate her guts. I find that she brings a different point of view to the word \"justice\" in the show. To her the empire is her sense of justice. This outlines the different sense of justice between the two groups and what they are fighting for. Something that the show fails to do in many other places.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Jaegar mostly seemed to be interesting to me, but lack of character development led them to be pretty underwhelming characters. An exception to this would be Esdeath. Probably the most popular character of the show. Esdeath is loved by viewers for her icy demeanor, beauty, and her love of battle. She kills only because of her lust for war and her sadistic nature. She does have a softer nature too, as can be seen when she is searching for love.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I find annoying with Akame Ga Kill is apart from the Jaegars (which mostly were pretty average). Every other villain was bland,exaggerated, and unoriginal that I couldn't help but laugh when I saw them. Most of the supporting villains are either complete psychos or are so obsessed with power that they don't even seem human. This does get better after the introduction of the Jaegars but is it really too much to ask to get a decent villain that I can take seriously?\\n\\n\r\nThe part that makes Akame ga Kill \"different\" from other average shounens is that unlike other shounens, characters die and although this is apparently what makes Akame ga Kill \"special\". This is exactly what makes Akame ga Kill fall short. The problem is that characters don't get nearly enough development before there death.It is usually give the character some screen time in the previous episode. Give them a flashback on there backstories, and send them off. Killing off characters isn't a bad thing at all. In fact, this is exactly what I want from shounens with main characters that either get revived or are invincible. But at least give the characters enough development to actually make the viewers feel something, or else the death scenes feel meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening of Akame ga Kill \"Skyreach\" is pretty average to be honest. Sure it isn't bad but the song just isn't much better than other opening songs. The second opening is a big step up from the first one with the early part sounding quiet and gentle, but slowly grows into a louder song with guitars and the chorus. Which I found to be pretty fitting to the show. Both the ending songs are pretty good,both bringing contrasts to the opening with softer, smoother tunes.The soundtrack ranged from average to pretty good. The songs in the battle scenes weren't anything special but did there jobs of increasing the tension, but the the best parts are the piano tracks for the moments of death.The piano tracks were pretty simple and weren't complex at all, but the tune the tracks carried brought out the tone perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is mostly pretty good.I guess the best word would probably be \"efficient\". Akame ga Kill looks good where it counts and it cuts back in parts that weren't that important. And I respect that. Not every anime has a gigantic budget to work on. (Unless its from KyoAni). The fight scenes looked great and although there were a few scenes that were cut back. Those scenes were mostly negligible and not very noticable.\\n\\n\r\nNow it may seem like I hate the show due to all of my criticism towards the show, but on the contrary. I did enjoy the show to a certain extent. The show isn't terrible by any means, but there were just so many places where Akame ga Kill could have improved on that I find it a shame that it wasn't adapted better. That said though, this show isn't for everyone. If you don't like excessive gore and killing then feel free to steer away from the show. But if you like dark themes and don't have a problem with watching some blood. Akame ga Kill isn't a terrible choice. (Can't say its a great one though.)",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nSometimes, Anime Companies takes the risk to try something different. It may fail or it may succeed, but sometimes, they skyrocket to amazing fame and glory, they even set the tropes for many work to come. The Impression the manga fans gave me about Akame ga Kill before it started that it is a unique and excellent shounen Manga and the Anime adaptation is very likely to be the new trope setter for future shounen works. Now that I have watched all it's episodes, here are my opinion on 2 things:\r\n1 - Do I find it unique? hmmmmmm, yeah, sort of.\r\n2 -Do I find it excellent? Absolutely NOOO. (I talking about the Anime, since this is the Anime's review and I didn't read the Manga).\\n\\n\r\nHere is why I think so:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nWell the story can be simply summarized as follows: \"Evil Government doing evil things to poor citizens so The heroes stay in the shadows and take every chance to kill the villains. After many sacrifices, good defeats evil\".\\n\\n\r\nTo be specific the story focused only on 2 things:\\n\r\n1 - \"Evil Government doing Evil things\".\\n\r\n2 - \"Many Sacrifices\".\\n\\n\r\nFirst, (about point 1) it was easy to notice since the first episode that the villains in this Anime seems to be ... Stupid. They do evil because they enjoy doing evil or they do evil because they are too retared to understand the difference between evil and good. only 3 exceptions were found but they aren't given enough screen time in order to be explored, anyway they were still as stereotypical as ever. What is worse is that the plot keep showing off how evil the villains are by making them meaninglessly do thing to show how evil they are. e.g. there was a scene where Esdeath was uselessly talking about how a flower can be used in torture.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, (about point 2) the Anime tries to force a dark tone by killing off some characters frequently. this caused a severe problem; most characters were not given enough time to show any development, thus their death had no meaning too. It was like the death of some stranger in a car accident; you may feel sorry for him but you quickly forget about him because you know little about him.\\n\\n\r\nThose characters who had enough time to develop, either didn't get enough screen time or were just too simple and stereotypical that there was nothing to explore about their personalities. All Akame ga kill characters lack character development that they can only be used as unimportant side characters for a better story.\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga kill has misused the following cliches:\\n\r\n1 - Death flags: the past of a character is usually revealed shortly before it's death. this was not emotionally effective because of the horrible lack in character development. \\n\r\n2 - Legendary Exclusive Weapons/Abilities: the Imperial Arms had a negative effect on the story. It's unexplained and suddenly revealed trump cards made the battles hard to take seriously as the tension can't be built if we know that the battle can be turned by some magical ability that is made up on the spot. And due to the huge number of Imperial Arms, they felt more of plot devices to for the author to use in twisting the plot without worrying about how logical the twist is. Everything can happen MAGICALLY.\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga kill tried to avoid the following cliches:\\n\r\n1 - Talk no Jutsu: the villains in Akame ga kill don't change sides just because they heared the sound of our protagonist's pure heart. Unfortunately, the author broke this cliche by making the character so stupid that they can't change. Due to the lack of development, the villains are evil just for the sake of evil or stupidity, so they can never change as the only aspect they have is being EVIL.\\n\r\n2 - Plot Armor: ..... Ahhhhh, I understand that the mass killing of characters was meant for making a lot of tension, but did it really kill the plot armor? I mean, how can I feel enough tension when the battles felt so stupid, Trump Card This, Trump Card That, they even had girl with guns poping out of her throat. Sometimes characters felt like they were dropping some chances to give their opponents some time to counter just for plot convenience. If the author want to keep a character alive all he need to do is to add more bizzareness to the situation so that he can slip the character out safely.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the protagonists? They were as stereotypical as ever. The main character that believes in justice and wants to protect their Nakama, the super-skilled silent one with dark past, the tsundere, the pervert, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the revealed past of the characters, they vary from the ones that are so unoriginal that I can't bear to watch them any more like Akame's  and Esdeath's, and the ones that seem interesting but are unfortunately left very vague that I can't effectively reflect them on the character's present like Chelsea's and Najenda's. And of course, there is the main protagonist's past that was just \"404: Background not found\"... No problem anyway, may be there was nothing interesting in it.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with Akame ga Kill is the wasted potential. I loved the setting so much which why sticked to it hopping for something enjoyable (I want my wasted time back T_T). Some characters has shown very good potential but it was blown in the wind like useless dust. (e.g. Esdeath contradiction in believing that it's ok for the weak to be killed and her love for Tatsumi who is obviously weaker than her, and Bols who had loving and caring side, and was self-conscious about his evil deeds, yet continued going down this path) \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Akame ga kill showed good potential but was brutally murdered by it's weakly written plot, misuse of cliches and weakly developed characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\\n\r\nthe visual side of Akame ga kill was average. while some scene were well-drawn, most action scenes were horrible. e.g. most of Akame's scene were like as if she teleported and everyone in the path between her initial and final position have been slashed. I must compliment the two final episode as the animation were much better than the whole series. the character designs were plain, generic and sometimes out of place, especially Akame who was wearing something like a school uniform in a medieval setting.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the openings and endings, and some of the background music were good but nothing really special.\\n\r\nI can't really comment on the voice acting because I'm not a Japanese speaker, but I think that they were able to give the intended emotion through their voice tone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI think this is one of those Anime shows that can be enjoyed better when you don't think much about them. I tried to use this technique to enjoy it but I couldn't, the sudden tone shift were ruining it, the action scenes were horrible, the whole series was just boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nOverall, I can't recommend it to anybody, even Bleach is more enjoyable than this IMO.",

            "content": "Produced by White Fox Studios as 24 episode series, Akame ga Kill! is the anime adaptation of an unfinished manga that follows the exploits of an assassination  group looking to overthrow the corrupt empire.  While it doesn't even have good writing or the proper foundations, there is no denying that this show takes its audience for a wild ride that is filled with bloodshed and explosions. \r\nSet in a fantasy world, Akame ga Kill! begins with a talented but rather naive swordsman named Tatsumi, arriving in Empire's capital city and dreaming of making a name for himself. He quickly finds himself being strippedof his meager savings by a certain feline-looking women called Leona but comes across a wealthy family who decides to graciously shelter him. That very same night, a group called Night Raid hits the household with the intent of assassination. Through a series of twists that exposes the family's atrocities, Tatsumi accepts the offer to join Night Raid and starts on the path towards to assassinating those who they deem to be responsible for  plaguing the Capitol with corruption. However as he and his teammates  continues their campaign against those who stand in their way, the Empire responses by creating their own unit of elite soldiers called The Jaegers to hunt down Night Raid.  \\n\\n\r\nWithin each of their own respective arsenals are incredibly powerful weapons called Imperial Arms that were forged in the early beginnings of the empire. From suits of armor to hand-held weapons and gears, the power within each of these Imperial Arms is unique and the main element to the fighting is countering each others power. Tied in with the usage of Imperial Arms, the primary feature that set Akame ga Kill! apart from other action shows is the alarming frequency in which notable characters are permanently killed. As a general rule, when two or more imperial arms users enter into a fight, at least one of them will die giving the show an huge amount of tension when battles do occur. \\n\\n\r\nWith a focus of ridding the Empire of its corruption, Akame ga Kill! is a very edgy show with that knows no bounds when it comes to displaying the appalling crimes and cruelty that exists within the series. However, the tone that is given doesn't lend itself to be a mature analysis of the mankind's darkness.  More time than not, it comes off as being cheap and I found myself laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of it all. The underlying reasons are mere context and background to the real draw of the show of how the bloody battles unfold. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\r\nFor all the horrific violence that the characters commits, the regular cast is a rather likeable bunch. Named in the title of the anime, Akame is the beautiful wielder of the Murasame, a sword that is guaranteed to kill its enemy with a single cut, and is a rather cold individual from onset. Once the series get underway, she does have some genuinely assuming moments and actually cares deeply for her friends but usually adopts a stoic demeanor during operations and for much of her downtime. Tatsumi, being the gullible and starry eye swordsman from the countryside , is the audience's introduction into the rotten and oppressive Empire and the fight bring about revolution. He starts off as fairly generic but develops into a much more powerful fighter with strong relational ties to others. Opposing Night Raid is the head of the Jeagers, General Esdeath, who is a very voluptuous and sadistic women that enjoys the thrill of the hunt. Believing in a very Darwinian principle of the strong devouring the weak, she is a very formidable foe and yet, is a little ditzy when it comes to the matters of the heart.   \\n\\n\r\nThere are too many other characters to list off and go into details but they all share the common trait of being immensely brutal in their fighting while having comical elements attached to them. They themselves are representative of the strange dichotomy where scenes of slaughter, sexual exposition, and torture are offset by their playful comradery. While they don't having the most compelling back stories or development, the cast of Akame ga Kill certainly doesn't shy away from making their presence known by any stretch of the imagination. I would like to give a particular mention to Akame's VA, Sora Amamiya, for continuing to have an astonishing start to her career. In addition to her main role in Akame ga Kill!, she has taken on no less than four main character roles in Nanatsu no Taizai, Aldnoah.Zero, One Week Friends and Tokyo Ghoul. While her time being Akame has come to an end, I look forward what other roles she can play as she moves through the anime industry. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals \\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking, Akame ga Kill! is an above average effort with a very modern style, vivid colors and a few special effects thrown in for good measure. It does rely on conventional animation when going through its action sequences so there's nothing that makes it stand out in that aspect. Otherwise, the quality remains consistent throughout the entire series which is more than I can say for other series airing at the same time. In fact, one area that Studio White Fox have done a tremendous job on improving is rendering the background. While the manga does a decent job at framing  its own surroundings, the additional detail and polish put in really elevates an aspect where the source material was lackluster. \\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nTaku Iwasaki, known for creating the soundtrack to Gatchaman Crowds, Noragami and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, is responsible the music behind Akame ga Kill!. Judging by his other works, he has been consistently  been able to produce music that a bit quirky to listen to but still be able to enhance whatever show he works on. For this series, he incorporates a variety of musical styles from jazz to  rock to orchestral music and he does a commendable job of  engaging  the audience with his music, no matter what the scene called for. I especially like the OST being played during the action scenes as a combinations of drums, tribal chanting and rock goes with perfectly with the unhindered primal violence being shown on the screen.   \\n\\n\r\nManga Adaptation\\n\\n\r\nAs with almost all adaptation from manga to the anime, some things are bound to get lost in transition and Akame ga Kill! is no exception. Character interactions that gave depth to their relationship are left out but those scenes didn't really contribute in significantly in altering the core plotline. It is only towards the latter half of Akame ga Kill! that readers of the manga will notice that that the rather straightforward adaption will suddenly veer off into the original anime ending territory that leaves behind an entire arc unanimated and takes several liberties with the story. If you are only familiar with the anime TV production, it is unlikely that you would notice much of difference other than the accelerated pacing and build up. At this point, the manga remains unfinished and if the show decided to stay its original course, it would have ended in an awkward state and would have had to wait years before additional material would be available. For a show to tell a complete story in an age where anime shows are mere primers for the source material is a rarity indeed.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Akame ga Kill! sets out what do what it promises and that is to smother the audience with super powerups, violence and death up until the very end. \\n",

            "content": "To kill or not to kill, that is the question. In the world of Akame ga Kill, it\u2019s more than just about killing as survival fits to those who wish to live for something to fight for. Sounds complicated? Not really. Akame ga Kill preys on a simple concept despite playing complexity on the tactical front. To put it into simple perspective, we have a prestigious and well developed Capital taking place as the major setting. While it looks industrialized and well functioned on the outside, there are dark secrets and corruption on the inside. The ones who fight this corruption consists of the maincharacters as an elite unit known as the Night Raid, as part of the Revolutionary Army. They don\u2019t just kill for the sake of it but for a purpose. In this show, that purpose is to rid of corruption as a young man named Tatsumi finds out the hard way.\\n\\n\r\nBased off the manga of the same name, Akame ga Kill isn\u2019t an easy show to get used to at first. From a standard perspective, it is the author\u2019s only work to date (besides a prequel based off the story). He experiments with a fantasy world cast in shadows by corruption and brings in characters as the actors in a seemingly dark age. While the show takes itself seriously with the dark fantasy premise and mature setting, one should also question about the overall delivery of the series. Controversially speaking, there are doubts at first. For the first half and parts of the second half, the show remains faithful to the material. Then, it decides to go with a route that I find it to be laughable for the wrong reasons. Still, let\u2019s get started and see what Akame ga Kill has to offer\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe few episodes wastes little time to get the point across in the AkG world. Tatsumi almost becomes a scapegoat during his journey as he himself believes that Night Raid is evil. In reality, corruption takes hold where he almost ends up being a victim. The truth is realized soon enough as the young boy faces the grim reality. However, he makes his own decision to join Night Raid and rid of the corruption that holds the Capitol and perhaps the rest of the world. Essentially, that\u2019s how it starts anyways but Tatsumi also learns more about the group of people he is allied with now that he is part of Night Raid. As such, the few episodes introduces the other members. Titular character Akame is perhaps one of the most prominent member of Night Raid as her first encounter with Tatsumi almost ends up getting the latter killed. Coming off seemingly as a cold girl with social awkwardness, she is also a skilled fighter with good intentions. The problem with Akame is that perhaps she is a bit way too focused on her motivations. Throughout the series, there\u2019s little depth we realize about herself despite some minor flashbacks between her and a sister she used to hang around with. Her actions throughout the show also seemingly include vengeance not only against the Capitol but her own dear sister. While the reason is explained vaguely, there\u2019s just not a lot we can appreciate about her role. Her relationship with Tatsumi is perhaps the strongest compared to the other members of Night Raid though. So in some ways, we can say that she is a character with a lot of potential but the show just doesn\u2019t make her a well-developed character.\\n\\n\r\nOther members of Night Raid falls under a lot of generic tropes. These include head boss Najenda, Leone (the older sister type), Mine (tsundere), Bulat (the older brother type), Lubbock (ongoing carefree dude), Shelee (quiet type), among others. Tatsumi himself is also saturated with generic tropes such as his heroic personality and to do the \u201cright thing\u201d. His motivations does have influence among other members of Night Raid as they see him as a trusting member and one who is determined to achieve his goals. Perhaps one other character in the show sees him as a bit more beyond just a warrior though. Coming from the outskirts of the Capitol is General Esdeath, a feared sadist and leader with a deadly reputation. Esdeath\u2019s debut marks the exact expectation that viewers might have her as a leader. However, her encounter with Tatsumi might rub off in the wrong way. You could call it as an infatuation or obsession, but her personality takes a 180 degrees after realizing the power of \u201clove\u201d. Rather than love though, it\u2019s more like a one-sided relationship as the world of Akame ga Kill is not pretty. If you don\u2019t believe me, then the body count might serve as a more credible evidence. Regardless if you\u2019re a member of Night Raid, Jeagers, Revolutionary Army, or the Capitol\u2019s military, the show isn\u2019t afraid to kill off characters. \\n\\n\r\nEsdeath isn\u2019t alone as an adversary of Night Raid however. Leading a group known as the \u201cJeagers\u201d, she plays a role as an anti-villain. Some of the members of Jeagers have their own morals and ideologies. Still, there\u2019s also this presence of black and white morality that is dominated throughout the series. Some characters such as Seryu (from Jeagers) kill for what they perceive as justice while others simply sees it as an order like Boris. Then, there are also misguided examples such as Wave who doesn\u2019t realize the truth revolving around the corruption of the Capitol. Nonetheless, the series makes a point clear that it controversially creates an atmosphere of ideology clash. And often or not, these result in various consequences such as extortion, torture, and death. Make no mistake though. This show isn\u2019t shy to craft violence from what it has set up.\\n\\n\r\nEven in a dark fantasy world such as AkG, there are also time to squeeze in comedy. Perhaps I imply this as underhanded but the show actually pushes that more than you might expect. Comedy is represented sometimes as generic while other times just misplaced or rather awkwardly timed. The quick precision shift between comedy and graphic violence sometimes also seems unreal to believe. In other words, one needs to be aware of the way the show is adapted when venturing into its execution. Fortunately, the series manages to rebound against this with serious elements of mature content to stay true with its premise. While the story seems quick paced at the times, Akame ga Kill also creatively build up certain points throughout the story and effectively manage it on most parts. As a reader of the manga, it pleases me to realize that they didn\u2019t forget the most important parts. It\u2019s obviously evident that there is enough material to simultaneously turn its source material into animated form and as such, I give praise to White Fox for doing just that. And when it comes to violence, this show is like a middle finger to recent series that are obstructed by censorship. (ex. Terra Formars, Tokyo Ghoul)\\n\\n\r\nWhile world building isn\u2019t a strong content of the series, the mechanics and origins is insightful. It is explained in a way that viewers should not be confused. The instance falls quickly with powerful weapons known as Teigu (in English, referred to as Imperial Arms). They are the most widely feared tools that are featured throughout the series with a variety of uses. These include but not limited to invisibility, one-shot kills, animal instinct, sharpshooting, ice manipulation, shape-shifting, pyrokinesis, and among others. The origins behind some of these Teigu are also explored. And with that, you can expect spectacular action when characters puts them to use. Well-coordinated movements, strategies, and jaw-breaking cinematic are a key to this success. Thankfully, Akame ga Kill does that in a profound way. As each Teigu is also different, the show also makes good usage of their strengths and weaknesses so you can expect some exciting duels in full throttle.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the show had a decent start with what it has done with the adaptation. But this isn\u2019t the main concern of the series in regards to fitting with characters\u2019 roles. It\u2019s the way the story is adapted later on when for some reason, the series derides from the manga. Instead, it crafts filler and makes up its story as it goes. Some of them not only have episode transitions that doesn\u2019t make sense but also ones that are seemingly too rushed. And like I said before, the show isn\u2019t shy to kill off its character cast. However, all is abrupt and devoid of development. There\u2019s little feeling that you\u2019ll feel with some of the characters killed off later on (especially beyond episode 20). It\u2019s almost like an insult for the fans hoping to see a faithful adaptation when it decides to make up its own little story.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to visual quality, White Fox is able to actually get some parts done right. They are able to take this show\u2019s animation quality to a level of what it should be \u2013 graphic and straightforward. It remains brutally honest with what it tries to accomplish such as severed limps, beheading, and torture. In short, the show isn\u2019t a fairy tale fantasy but rather make its point as a dark world of malevolence. Action is directed with strength in its movements while the world setting is credible with the backgrounds. Dangerous creatures known as the \u201cDanger Beasts\u201d are present throughout the show as well that are carefully crafted to show their animalistic brutality.  On the other hand, character designs can be an oddball. Certain characters such as Akame wear outfits that doesn\u2019t make them look like who they should be. Tatsumi\u2019s design is also blend as the main protagonist while other characters are exaggerated by their manga counterparts such as Esdeath. And the show isn\u2019t shy with fan service either so be prepared for some eye candy goggles. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not a powerhouse, soundtrack does play an efficient role. In particular, action scenes are supplemented by the OST with the intense pacing of the fighting. Emotional scenarios also exist so expect some solemn tunes to play out its purpose. However, character voice mannerisms can be a bite to the heart. Again, I have to emphasize that Tatsumi is one of the most generic characters known to mankind. His voice shifts between mature and childish in what can seem like a split second time-frame. This inadequate balance is a pain to deal with as such with some with other characters albeit with less focus. In essence, the show has moderate voice mannerisms when it comes to its cast. However, I do give praise to the VA for Akame, Sora Amamiya. She is able to play roles as soft spoken characters such as Kaori (One Week Friends) and Elizabeth (Nanatsu no Taizai) but is also able to portray Akame in this series; a cold spoken assassin. Did I also mention that she sings the OP song for the first half? Speaking of which, the theme songs conveys this show accurately with contrasting moods between the opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nTo cap this off, it\u2019s easy to say that Akame ga Kill is a show that might not be suitable for everyone. I don\u2019t say this on a graphic content perspective but rather with the whole premise and what it tries to do. In fact, the premise is solid and stays true to itself throughout the show. It\u2019s just that the direction has some crude markings when it comes to timing and balance. The way it derails from the manga adaptation makes it look like a joke. Generic characters are also something to aware of especially in the case of our dull main protagonist Tatsumi. His relationship with other characters only shines when it revolves around the main story. On the other hand, mechanics and concepts of the show deserves praise. While nothing stands out as original, the show is clever with the world setting, themes, and artificial weapons/tools. The show also does justice with the buildup and cliffhangers it creates to anticipate what\u2019s to happen next for the majority of the first half. However at the end of the day, this show is one of those sick series where it kills itself.\\n",

            "content": "A lot can be said about a show's 1st episode. It's our first encounter with the world presented, and could often be used to gauge whether or not the content on display could be something that would interest you moving forward. Of course, this isn't to say that that's always the case, but for the most part, it serves as a helpful jumping off point and is often the reason why studios place so much stock on its television pilot. And nowhere is that more evident than with Akame ga Kill! With just one episode, it manages to establish a myriad of things, all ofwhich interesting in their own right, but perhaps more entertaining when viewed as a whole. There's comedy, fanservice, ultraviolence, corrupt politics, eccentric characters, melodrama, and a sleuth of other tidbits littered throughout. All of these aspects by themselves are fine, but it's the assembly in which these ideas are presented that gives way to content that's comedically problematic.\\n\\n\r\nLike ingredients for food, it's not a matter of what you have to work with but what you choose to make out of it. In the hands of capable creators, I'm sure all the elements of Akame ga Kill could have been turned into something of high-end value, but to no one's fault but its own, what this title decides to do instead of measuring out its ingredients was to dump it all in at once with no rhyme or reason. A tasty stew in the hands of credible creators was effectively turned into a cauldron of foul witches brew. A slimy substance bubbling up, one that sees gruesome deaths followed by comedic fanservice, politics served on a platter layered in melodrama, reanimated corpses of shows prior refusing to die off, their festering lack of \"character\" like primordial ooze, desperately seeking out originality to munch down on. A Schlocky, sleazy freak of a thing, over-the-top, and violently lashing out, its drool dripping with hackneyed writing and a complete disregard for decency as it spazzes about on the floor. \\n\\n\r\nWhat we have here was a Frankenstein of lowbrow content, and boy was it entertaining!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very straightforward, if only by design. A corrupt kingdom takes advantage of their citizens through tyrannical rule, and to fight against this oppression, rebel forces send aid by hiring a band of assassins tasked with killing off high-ranking members of the capital. It's like Assassin's Creed, but with a lot more boobs and nakama power involved. Our protagonist, PussyBetaMale-kun, or Tatsumi, if you prefer, joins this hit squad. \\n\\n\r\nThe goal of these rebel forces are pretty basic; overthrow the governing body and establish a new order of equality. Seems like a simple enough story to execute right? Well, that's where you'll be sorely mistaken, with AGK, plunging your IQ down a few pegs is the only way to keep up with its scatterbrained thought process when it comes to figuring its own shit out. In substitution of a fairly paint-by-numbers plot, AGK decides to globetrot across its world, not out of a need to explore anything, no, that would be too \"smart,\" but solely for the sake of encountering as many comedically vile people as possible. And in that regard, its meandering was a success. In place of a rebel uprising, what we got in its stead was a bunch of superpowered edgelords engaging in giant cockfights to see who was the strongest. Assassin Super Bowl was in full swing, and while they were duking it out like reject members of a Mad Max film, the highborn nobles were strolling along in the background, torturing its citizens with so much glee that you can't help but root for their cartoonish villainy. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting was never explored, feeling equally perfunctory as the characters inhabiting it. Attributes of its world bullying the audience into accepting it for what it is. Wild monsters with no domestic quality to their world and flying Manta-rays; just accept it. Giant mecha in a medieval setting with no prior inclusion of advanced technology; just accept it. Macroeconomics that's impossible to exist when the aristocratic class torture and kill their citizens, effectively crippling its economy's breadwinners; just accept it. Supernatural occurrences that happen at one minute to simply be forgotten by the next; you get the drill, just accept that shit.\\n\\n\r\nThey didn't even bother to properly flesh out the city or corresponding areas that our characters navigated across. Deciding to only let it serve as a backdrop for the Assassin Super Bowl to play out seemed to be the unified thought process that the creative team all collectively arrived at. And when that isn't enough to keep the viewer's interest, the show places a character's neck on its Guillatine chopping block, where it turns these Mad Max rejects into blood-splattered firework displays to keep things entertaining. All you end up remembering them for was their deaths and not who they were as people. But who got time to worry about proper characterization or decent writing? Fuck it! On with the show! More shocking deaths, more blood, more ultraviolence, more more more! \\n\\n\r\nCrimson blood-spray animated with such vigor that it makes it readily apparent that the people behind this project are having as much fun slaughtering their cast as we as viewers get from watching them die. In a way, it's like this show's animators were a part of the noble class themselves, as they hyper-fixate on bringing these death sequences to life. Sadly, when no one is being turned into blood confetti, the actual quality of the animation drops off significantly. Stiff body motion. Lazily panning across flat landscapes. Shading devoid of effort or care. Scene compositions setup with zero creative foresight; all of it expressed with complete apathy. As if it was an impatient child twiddling its thumbs waiting for the director to give it the green-light for the next fight sequence or public execution to occur. \\n\\n\r\nThe same also applied to the soundtrack which was painfully uninspired. Tunes humming along without an inkling of interest shining through. A type of \"pretending to care\" in the way the orchestrations felt oddly familiar-sounding to many things heard in the past. But unlike the animation department, the disinterest expressed here was actually surprising once you discuss the person responsible for the bringing it together. Taku Iwasaki is not an amateur. This is a man with years under his belt. Why this wasn't audibly expressed was a bit perplexing, but then again, this is coming from a show named \"Akame\" ga Kill, where the titular character only gets 5 episodes worth of screentime. They must have been fans of The Legend of \"Zelda\" games to come up with such an absurd name choice. \\n\\n\r\nThe moment you start trying to \"figure out\" AGK's issues is the moment you're \"doing it wrong,\" so let's proceed to dispell that idea right now by asking the impossible question: what the \"purpose\" behind this wonderful work of artistic vandalism was. \\n\\n\r\nSo what was it about? An active effort to discuss subserviency in society? The oppressive consequence that occurs when \"absolute power corrupts absolutely?\" A tale of personal ideals clashing, resulting in bloody politics? A sobering story of discrimination?... Well, honestly speaking, no. It was about none of that. Overthinking anything that AGK does would be no different than waxing philosophical for the reason behind Patrick Star's Hawaiian shorts. There's no pretense behind AGK's actions, and as long as the viewer doesn't graft any grandiose ideas onto it, it could be enjoyed for what it truly is: schlocky, over-the-top deaths with shounen characters that had the stylistic sensibilities of a seinen but the emotional authority of a 15-year-old's wet dream. \\n\\n\r\nAnd you know what? That's just fine. I sure had fun watching it. A silly thing, flailing about with no sense of purpose or integrity. A good ole dumb time to be had, IQ-reducing, but worth every popped brain cell.",

            "content": "Warning, this review is full of spoilers so you have been warned!\r\nAkame ga Kill..............Start the review, no seriously I have nothing else to say, just start this review.  Introducing Akame ga Kill is like showing elementary schoolers pornography Just start the damn review already.\r\nAkame ga Kill is produced by studio White Fox who brought us good anime like Steins;Gate and Katanagatari......   It is directed by a man named Kobayashi, Tomoki and consists of 24 episodes airing from July 7 2014 to December 15 2014.  So is the anime any good? I'm gonna be straight up honest to you all I thinkthis anime is the reincarnation of Hitler.  But if you like it, that's fine!  I mean to get no hate from this video, I simply want to convey to you all the reasoning on why this show is bad but if you like it, that's fine.  You're listening to someone who enjoyed Mirai Nikki and gave it a high 3/10 so if that's not credible that I can enjoy things that even aren't critically good I don't know what is.  Also I am not hating on this show because it is popular, I am actually going to give proper reasons  on why I think the show is bad rather than some people who'll say the show is bad because it's popular.  And last but not least I am spoiling everything\\n\r\nso beware!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story for Akame ga Kill follows the main protagonist Tatsumi who journeys to the capitol in order to gain money for his poor starving village.  Tatsumi, after failing to enlist in the army and getting all of his money stolen gets picked up by a noble family who claims that they will take care of him, but they hide evil intentions like Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch Case, but anyways. After figuring out their evil intentions to torture and ultimately kill him, Tatsumi is rescued by a group of highly qualified assassins called Night Raid who wants to fight in a rebellion to stop the corruption within the government.  The people in Night Raid all own imperial arms which are specialized weapons with overwhelming powerful weapons ranging from swords to guns.  The group members include Akame, Sheele, Mine, Bulat, Lubbock, Leone and Najenda, together with Tatsumi they go on a mission to kill those of higher power who are responsible for the crime and corruption in the government.\\n\\n\r\nSounds like a great premise right? Wrong, the story of this anime is worse than having sex with the toothed vagina from the movie teeth.  I honestly can't see why anyone can say this show has great story telling when it is more flawed than Joe Biden's Face.  Let me explain why starting off with the tone.\\n\\n\r\nThe tone consistency of Akame ga Kill is executed terribly right from episode 1.  The story tries to be serious yet the serious tone is completely obliterated by comedic moments in the show that take you out of the tone and atmosphere that they are trying to present.  Let me give you an example from episode 1. Tatsumi sees his friends straight up die right in front of him, his friends that he has known for quite some time, then in the same exact sequence of scenes we see him flailing around in a comedic fashion and Bulat says something that completely goes against the dark tone that the anime tried to set.  Flailing around in a comedic fashion right after your friends are killed is not a good thing if you want to keep up with tone consistency, plus it's highly unbelievable.  What I think the problem is, is that they place comedic characters into a serious setting which does not work for the type of edgy show this is trying to be.  The goofy/serious tone does not work for this anime because it doesn't feel blended, it feels out of place and feels more random than a butterfly porking a frog.  Anime like Black Lagoon did it great!  But here it feels really mismatched and in the wrong place at the wrong time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story also has a terrible problem with executing its character deaths, like I said I don't care about spoilers for this review so I am about to release some big spoilers in 3. 2. 1.  Right from the get go audiences were wowed by how Akame ga Kill was not afraid to kill of characters starting off with episode 6 with Sheele's death.  We only get 1 episode of backstory for her and you expect me to feel sympathetic for Sheele's death?  Hell No!  How am I supposed to feel for a character that we just got introduced to and I know nothing about her.  They try to guilt trip us with flashbacks right before she dies like we knew her for a long time, but that's like if I were to kill off Lisa from Zankyou no Terror in lets say episode 4.  Would you feel anything? No, because you dont know the character a lot, thats why when that girl in episode 3 of Sword Art Online from the Black Cats Guild died I didnt feel anything because I didnt know her.  Kurome's death I felt nothing because we never got any development out of her or even knew who she \\n\r\nreally was!  Heck, even when we did get to know characters the death scenes were poor and I didnt feel any emotion due to terrible characterization.  Susano barely had any screentime so his death was more laughable than anything.  Also we literally knew nothing about Chelsea, sure she may have had more screentime than some of the other cast, but we barely ever got to know her as a person and get attached to her until they through a guilt trip of flashbacks and apologies 1 minute before she dies.  The characters are all there but since they keep on killing off characters left and right you don't get any time to like them or grow on them thus making their deaths feel meaningless.  Would you cry over a man you met for 2 minutes then a week later heard died in a newspaper from a car accident, or would you cry over a friend you've known for a few years who died from the same cause?  If you wouldn't cry for example one, then there is no reason to feel for the characters here!\\n\\n\r\nTo counteract this statement you could say that this show is great because of the lack of plot armor,  but that's untrue because like I said, killing off characters left and right with a lack of development makes the death of the characters have less meaning than the first time you dropped the soap and allowed a black man to grab your love handles in\\n\r\nthe shower room.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the lack of focus this anime has on actually maintaining some shred of a plot.  For the whole middle section of this show there was really no story that they were going off of, it was just random fight scenes, pointless deaths, and a lot of going around in circles following the formula, character death, fight villain, moving on, character death, fighting villain, moving on.  The story never focuses on one thing, which is its problem because then you have more of a clusterfuck than the amount of sperm\\n\r\nand love juices left behind on Sora and Shiros bed because, because you know brothers and sisters that close have to get it on at some point, incest for the wincest!  But the multiple side stories between Akame's sister, Esdeath's romance with Tatsumi, and much much more are never fully explored.  Seriously people, did you all forget the reason why Tatsumi went to the capital in first place?  TO GET MONEY FOR HIS VILLAGE, and the only other time they go back to this is in the last freaking episode.  Seriously, if\\n\r\nthat was the first main objective of our protagonist was to gain more money for his poverty stricken village shouldn't he be concerned about his village more?  Instead this story is lost in a clusterfuck of other stories that are then lost in more clusterfucks of stories.  There is just way too much going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe logic is thrown out of the window in this anime as well, and I do understand that since this is an anime not all logic applies but lets go back to episode 6 shall we. The characters all lack something that even Al queda has, and it's called common sense.  Lets give an example with episode 6.  Sheele had the intent to kill Seryu, but yet chose only to slash off her arms instead of chopping off her head, then for the next 20 seconds Seryu tells his imperial arms dog to power up and go in beserk mode, within these 20 seconds, and dont worry I counted, Sheele had time to chop off her head but did she do that? No, because these characters all lack a brain or because the story writer wanted an excuse to make a cool fight scene dragged out longer than it should be.  Plus this leads to the logic which this anime does not have, a bitch shoots a gun from her mouth, and I'm not talking about any gun, I'm talking about a gun lodged in the back of her throat.  First off how would she breathe?  Second off how could she aim with it and the third one is wouldn't the recoil throw her off, hurt her throat, and be able to miss the shot.  People could combat this statement with, this is an anime there shouldnt be any logic or true science in it.  This would only be true if the world took the time to explain that their science and their laws of physics were different from our, I actually looked at the scene multiple times when Seryu shot the gun and hit Sheele and THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECOIL IN THIS WORLD, you want to know why? Newton's 3rd Law!  For every action there is an equal and opposite re-action meaning that for every force there is a reaction force that is equal in size, but opposite in direction. That is to say that whenever an object pushes another object it gets pushed back in the opposite direction equally hard.  Sheele was pushed forward when shot by the bullet meaning that there should have been an equal amount of force pushing back on Seryu's throat meaning the bullet should have been off thus showing us how the author truly thought that on paper it looked cool and exciting but didn't care about any logic behind it. If this were to to happen in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure it would be a completely different story because 1. The anime is self aware, and 2 because they actually take the time to explain the powers and how characters do things, in Akame ga Kill they don't. So until they explain things how am I supposed to believe anything that happens in this anime, plausibility is lost within this show!  They do this on multiple occasions, even in the last episode when Leone gets shot\\n\r\nmultiple times and is still at full strength without her powers only because she was \"born in the slums so her body is strong\", that's a complete asspull!  Black people who grow up in the ghetto get shot once and they're dead!  But in here they're fine if they get shot 5 times as a normal human being?  That's bullshit, I want that power, I dont want to be shot by a Florida police officer!\\n\\n\r\nLets get into the motivations which I can wholeheartedly say are more dumb and irrational than the content Anita Sarkesian produces.   The enemies range from evil to being evil just to be evil, there is nothing else to say.  Syura was hyped up since episode 12 as being a crazy, powerful and mysterious villain which was disappointing when we found out that motivation for being evil is just to get power?  That is completely cliche and is totally just a waste of a potential villain.  There is is nothing interesting about a character whose only motivation to be evil is just for power or to be evil.  The best villains are the ones that you can understand why they're evil, like Lord Desler from Space Battleship Yamato 2199 who is seen as the villain but you can totally understand his motivations and they make sense which is actually interesting instead of the black and white cliche motivations in Akame ga Kill.  Esdeath's motivations were more screwed up then the Monopoly man cheating on the hungry hungry hippo to seduce the Operation man.  She is supposed to be seen as a sadistic villain, who everyone bows down to and feels afraid of.  How can I feel afraid of an enemy who is supposed to be sadistic yet wants to find romance which she\\n\r\nfinds in Tatsumi's small stiffy.  It's the complete polar opposite of how she should be seen, and it makes the lighthearted side of her far outweigh the cold hearted female that the anime tries to portray her as.  How can I see her as being an enemy if her ideals of romance are constantly lunged in my face like titties in high school of the dead, it's terrible.  The only times when villains with evil just to be evil or stupid motivations work is if the show doesn't take itself seriously, like Ragyo for an example worked in Kill la Kill because all the show wanted to be was dumb fun and action.  Here it doesn't work because the show is trying to be serious.  Would you rather have villains that will kill you because why the hell not, your uglier than Marilyn Manson or a villain who kills because his motives are for the greater good of his people, or because its for a loved one and he has no other choice.  If you pick answer number 1 then you my friend need to watch actual good anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of asspulls in this anime is ridiculous as well leaving the story open for plot holes.  They bring out random powers at the right times without explanation making the random powers there as a plot convenience that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  Akame slices herself with her own poisonous sword and the gains massive amounts of power without dying is an asspull that is never full explained.  Mine pulls out a final powerful attack that shoots at a Laxus from Fairy Tail ripoff is an asspull because they never fully give an explanation on where all that power came from.  Najenda's power just so happens to have the power to resurrect Susanno just when the plot needs him and her power is kinda explained but not fully.  Esdeath's ability to freeze time is a plot hole within itself seeing how she could use that at any time during the anime to defeat her foes.  Syura is magically able to mark anywhere within his area including the air, that's kinda never explained and he can create a pocket dimension and gain more power from a potion which is never explained.  A girl gets her neck sliced, falls down, gets back up, stabs Lubbock, talks even though her vocal cords are fucked, and falls back down which is a complete asspull the the writer made as an excuse to weaken Lubbock.  Wait, so how the fuck did Tatsumi turn into a Digimon?  Is this explained? Nope.  Like I said, the whole gun mouth thing is never properly explained.  What's with all of these weapons, this dude is the human swiss army knife, asspulls everywhere.  There are many more asspulls I can mention but for the sake of this review I'm going to stop here. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least I want to get into the setting and world building which I found to be executed poorly, more poor than an African village that extend their necks to look like a human pez stick. Seriously, the food would expire by the time it reaches their stomach.  But the setting is never fully explored.  I understand it's a fantasy world but the fantasy world is full of guns, not just any guns, actual normal guns.  And if they have guns, suits and ties, and other stuff of the sorts shouldn't they have better technology than horses and lanterns.  I shouldn't be confused about this, Akame ga Kill is like a bad social studies teacher telling you Guam is a country but not explaining where the fuck it is. People who say that its an anime don't worry about it, well, how would you feel if I put a vibrator in Claymore?  Would it make sense? NO it wouldn't, therefore it wouldn't be able to make sense here.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good part I can say about the story is the pacing, it knows how to pace itself well and doesn't try to go too fast nor too slow.  The pacing is not really the problem, it's the content that is the problem.  All and all Akame ga Kill's Narrative Structure is abysmal, the tone consistency is terrible, and all around Akame ga Kill's story suffers from an overabundance of asspulls and lack of logic that has plagued shounen anime since Fairy Tail.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nAkame ga Kills's characters are more underdeveloped than Selena Gomez's rack, I mean seriously seeing her in a bikini is borderline child porn.  I wont go into that much detail\\n\r\nbut I'll give you a general idea of who they are and their role in the plot.  Also I'll tell you if they die because as stated SPOILERS and to emphasize a repeated pattern in this show\\n\\n\r\nLets start with Night Raid\\n\\n\r\nTatsumi is just a generic shounen protagonist who wants to become stronger.  Sure he's a kind hearted person and sees what he is doing as JUSTICE for the greater good but that's all he really is!  He's no different than most stereotypical characters in anime making him highly unmemorable.  He dies after becoming a Digimon with little development.\\n\\n\r\nLeone is there for boob service, she's a Holo ripoff with bigger boobs than Holo, she's constantly on screen as the older sister type stereotype but how am I supposed to take her seriously when she talks with her boobs instead of her mouth, unless the crack between her double Ds is her mouth.  But in all seriousness she's the same character from the beginning to the end of the anime.  She dies with no development after bleeding out in a alleyway after being shot about 5 times hours prior to her death.  Damn it took her a while to bleed out, was it to create more drama? If so it was a poor job.\\n\\n\r\nMine is there as the romantic interest and speaking of that, the romance in this show felt highly underdeveloped and random.  All of a sudden Mine starts to show affection for Tatsumi out of nowhere, it feels like the romance between Superman and Lois Lane in Man of Steel.  There's no buildup to the romance making it just feel plain awkward.  She actually changed a tad bit throughout the series though, she starts out like a tsundere but even though the romance felt out of place for that one moment she broke out of her archetype before dying.  Still doesnt excuse her lack of development though throughout the rest of the series!  Also she dies from unknown causes, most likely over exertion of energy which is never fully explained, with little to no development.\\n\\n\r\nSheele is a plot device with a giant pair of scissors that can cut through anything yet is so dumb that she can't cut a girl's head off properly that is sitting down immobile for a full 20 seconds.  Her only purpose for the plot was to show that PEOPLE DIE WHEN THEY ARE KILLED and that there is danger in this show.  This is not a good thing because her development suffers from being put into the role of this plot device.  She likes to scissor I guess, that's all we get to really see about her other than her really \"tragic back story\" that we get to see one episode of before her sad death.  She died after being shot and torn in half by a giant crackhead snoopy, dies without development.\\n\\n\r\nBulat, the man with the armor named Incursio that he gives Tatsumi after his death.  He was a badass older brother type of character who loved to comb his hair like Space Dandy.  We  We only got to see a bit into his back story but it wasn't enough for him to be developed at all, instead he is there to serve only the purpose of progressing the plot by giving Incursio to Tatsumi, that's it.  He dies from poision with little to no development.\\n\\n\r\nLubbock, the man who pulls the strings is a really lame character.  He appears initially in the first few episodes but didn't say much but after throughout the final quarter of the series we got to see his personality, and his back story with Najenda.  But that's about it, he doesn't really change, he starts out the same way he ends off making him have little to no development or change whatsoever.  He would've been more useful making bondage whips from his string rather than work for Night Raid, we really don't get a full chance to see who he really is.  He dies from spears penetrating his penis worse than that of the penis being penetrated by a dildo in Kids in the Sandbox on LOLshock.\\n\\n\r\nNajenda, the leader of Night Raid, I don't know anything about her from the beginning to the end.  She's always been this mystery box that nobody knows about, which can add a sense of mystery I guess but it doesn't help us get to know her, her motivations, her personality, or anything of the sorts.  She's just there to play the role of Night Raid's leader nothing more nothing less.  She's got imperial arms that are never fully explained and that hurts her character more than helps it.  All and all a waste of screen time, highly underutilized and underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nChelsea, the girl with the makeup comes into the anime halfway into the show only to be killed off a few episodes later without letting the audience get attached to her.  She wanted head from Tatsumi and she died most likely due to decapitation seeing how her head was left on a stake.  Ironically she turned into the lolipop she was always sucking on, practice makes perfect for sucking am I riggghhhhtttt Chelsea.  And When I say suck, I mean as a character and not in terms of blowjobs you perverts watching this.  She died with no development, she was just there to serve as another big sis figure to our main protagonist, nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nSusanoo, the human imperial arms was introduced in the same episode as Chelsea yet has half of her screen time.  We barely get to see him and most of the time I forgot about his existence which is bad if you want me to feel something for his character once he kicks the budget.  His motivations are never really shown and lacks a personality.  For the most part his very existence was unneeded in the anime for he did nothing to add to the plot at all.  He caries around a giant tampon on a stick as I like to call it and In the end he dies after fighting Esdeath he gets no development from doing so.  \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least we have Akame, I mean she has to be the best, she has to!  Her name is in the title right? Wrong.  Her name may be in the title but she is hardly seen or shown in the anime.  It's like naming Attack on Titan Attack on Marco or Code Geass, Code Shirley She plays no huge role in this anime at all, she lacks emotion and personality though we get to see some sort of emotion in her here and there. But that does not make up for her poor development in the beginning of the show.  She was boring, bland, and uninteresting which reminded me of the time I received food from a KKK run restaurant, the just gave me cardboard, and that's all Akame is.  Though I must admit by the end of the anime we see a slight change in her and she has some sort of motivation that she is going off but throughout the whole anime she is underused, and has a lack of screen time which in turn hurts her development more than a Morman father recycles their wives.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm gonna try to explain the opposing side, the Jaegers.\\n\r\nWave is basically a more interesting version of Tatsumi but his character development is next to nothing seeing how he gets a lack of proper screentime and because his true motivations are highly unclear.\\n\\n\r\nKurome, Akame's Sister, could have been an interesting character because of her back story with Akame and how they split up but this means nothing when her character has no screen time to the point where I forgot she was even a part of the show.  I mean really, how can I feel for a character that I don't even know, she doesn't properly get screen time and her development is next to nothing because of this.  By the end of the show I literally knew nothing about her except for some of the stuff about her past that was told from Akame's perspective and not her.  All and all her character was just a waste of screentime that could have been used for another character.\\n\\n\r\nBols, or as I like to call him Banepool, was the most human character in this show.  He had a family and kids which is something that could have truly made him stand out among the crowd.  But once again, the screen time kills his development and the family and kids thing he had going almost felt more like a guilt trip rather than something to feel bad about for his death.\\n\\n\r\nRun's character actually has a motivation which is discussed in the second to last episode.  But this does not excuse his lack of any development throughout the series because  he only had about less than an episode of screen time altogether and most of the time he was just talking with someone else, he wasn't doing anything interesting or that could have progressed his development.  Even though we do get that motivation in the second to last episode I hardly ever cared for his character because of the lack of screen time therefore his character was plain irrelevant in my eyes.  Honestly he was pretty much useless to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSeryuu's character was really annoying, though she did have probably the best death scene in this show I still found her character to be highly annoying when on screen.  We literally knew nothing about her other than her corrupted viewpoint of justice and the fact that she loves bestiality.  She had more proper screen time than the other characters but still she gets a lack of any good development before she dies.\\n\\n\r\nDr Stylish who is basically gay steins;gate was just there to have a battle that was completely irrelevant to the plot.  Raise of hands for how many people remembered his character was a thing before I mentioned him.  He only had literally 2 episodes before he died, he was truly a bad character with no development whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nI could be missing a character or 2 but I want to get into the main villain now whose name is Esdeath Listen, you can say she's the best girl, but she's everything but a good villain.  She started out being hyped up as a sadistic leader with amazing ice powers but then suddenly she falls in love with Tatsumi.  Yes the villain falls in love with Tatsumi, this could have been handled in a great way but instead it all got flushed down the toilet.  The way she falls in love with Tatsumi is not with development but it's on the superficial level like \"Hey I just met you, and this is crazy, I love your abs, so fondle me maybe\".  She doesn't understand love and by the end of the show I doubt she still did because the amount of times her and Tatsumi talked were far apart and it wasn't about trying to develop the romance because Tatsumi would always try to escape while Esdeath would try to sexually assault or come on to him.  This makes her true motivations very jumbled up.  We barely see a change in her character throughout the whole series, because most of the time we see her it's about her wanting to chomp on Tatsumi's meat stick.  Also her powers make no sense either because she can freeze time, that's not the bad part though, the bad part is that she could have literally froze time at any point in the show to either help a fellow comrade, or stopped Tatsumi from running away at any given point and she would have still been able to have power left over.  This is a plot hole until they explain why she couldn't have done it at any of those given points.  Esdeath as a villain is really bad and as a character, though better than most of the jaegers, falls flat on her face because of poor characterization, a poor motivation, and poor development throughout the series minus her breast size.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to mention any more characters at this moment, sorry Jesus Hentai Christ, but as you all can see the reason why Akame ga Kill's characters fall flat is not only because of their cut and paste personalities.  It's because of a lack of screentime, poor motivations, lack of backstories, and poorer than Ethiopia development.  They hold a lack of memorability that even when watching you forget that some of the characters are even a thing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\r\nThe art and animation for Akame ga kill is a mixed bag ranging from abysmail to decent but never OMG WHAT IS THIS THE GARDEN OF WORDS?!??! Type level.  The backgrounds are very generic and brings nothing new to the table.  The general detail of the anime is more bipolar than Amanda Todd.  Sometimes the characters appear to be half drawn, the blood effects look like MS paint especially in the second to last episode, and overall the show just looks below average.  The character designs do not work well with the setting nor the tone either.  It's kinda like putting Lucky Star character designs in Death Note and when I say that I mean that the character designs break the dark tone.  The character models are too bright and flashy to be taken seriously and the neon colored outfits make Night Raid look like walking Las Vegas.  Don't get me wrong, some of the designs look really cool but they don't fit in well with this anime.  On the other hand some of the designs look really uninspired and lame.  I will admit though, Akame ga Kill uses some animated still frames that look really pleasing to the eye, but then again these scenes are few and too far between.  The art style at one point actually changed for 2 minutes in the second to last episode and I was like damn, if the show looked like this it could have been a whole lot better in terms of art.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Akame ga Kill is below average, not the worst but certainly not great either.  The last episode is the best the show has to offer in terms of animation but other than that animation is mehhhhh.  There are a lot of choppy scenes in the anime and that happens sometimes during battles or when the backgrounds are moving.  The cinematography of this show feels very standard with no animated sequences that stand out among the rest.  There were some scenes that were animated terribly like this whole scene with the robot blowing up.  Character movements are standard, not the best but at least you can tolerate it.  I remember in one scene during the episode where Bulat was fighting on the boat with Tatsumi against 3 imperial arms users that instead of using animation they just showed sparks appearing out of nowhere which really looked bad for the anime, and the anime uses certain choices on how to animate their fight scenes that makes the anime look like it was animated on Flash.  But I will admit as much as I don't like the animation for almost all of the anime, some of the fight scenes were fun to watch and enjoy, nothing special but some were fun.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all the art and animation is very below average in the way it presents itself to the audience.\\n\\n\\n\r\n SOUND\\n\r\nThe sound of Akame ga Kill is also not all that good either.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is alright for the most part but no stand out performances.  The sound effects were there and they did the job but they weren't at all fantastic.  The overall ost felt uninspired as well even though I love the song Liar Mask for the second opening.  The ost was highly unmemorable for the most part and I just dismissed it as white noise which for an anime is not a good thing to do because it is supposed to enhance the experience, adds sprinkles to the cake, add flavor to your marriage, adds some KY jelly to your pee pee, that is what music in a show is supposed to do and in this show, a shounen like this, it should have had a nice ost but it didn't.  I, while I am typing this script am listening to some of the songs and even I can't remember these things playing which in my opinion is kinda embarrassing for an ost if you ask me.  \\n\\n\r\nSo all and all, is Akame ga Kill worth the watch?  No, but if you watch it I won't hold it against you.  Watching it with friends is suggested because honestly if you watch it with a friend the show automatically becomes a comedy even if the show itself is a joke.  And remember, if you like the show and found enjoyment out of it it's fine!\\n\\n\r\nSo lets get to the scoring\\n\\n\r\nSo giving the story a 3.7\\n\r\nThe characters a 2.8\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation a 4\\n\r\nThe sound a 4.35\\n\r\nPlus my enjoyment of a 2.5\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill get a score of a 3.47 giving it a reccomendation to classify this anime as a disease rather than an actual show.  Really guys, if you like this anime I respect your opinion but damn, in my mind this show was really bad and severely over hyped.  If someone asks me to recommend a show I'd give them School Days over this because at least School Days was decent enough to be short but this show had little to no redeemable qualities and I can truly call this anime worse than having sandpaper hands if your a guy or allergic to latex if you're a female.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nQuestion: What do you get when you try to make an action-comedy based around the brutal torture, rape, and mutilation of innocent people? Apparently, you get Akame Ga Kill. It\u2019s a blood bath, but it\u2019s also light-hearted. It has deathly serious themes such as the loss of close friends, but it also has frequent fanservice. It has characters with tortured pasts seeking retribution, but they also have slice-of-life comedy personalities. \u2026Have you noticed the problem with the show yet? Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting one of the most hyped anime of the year: Akame Ga Kill (By the way: no. I haven\u2019t read themanga and I don\u2019t care if \u201ceverything is better!\u201d in it; this review is of the adaptation and the adaptation alone).\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: A boy named Tatsumi sets out on a journey for \u201cThe Capitol\u201d in order to earn money for his starving village. However, when he arrives, he only finds a world full of unimaginable corruption. People are murdered, tortured, and manipulated on a daily basis for no discernable reason other than the fact that the government is super evil. After seeing this corruption, Tatsumi joins the \u201cNight Raid\u201d: a group of assassins dedicated to eliminating the corruption throughout The Capitol by mercilessly killing those responsible.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several problems with AGK\u2019s plot, and all of them are related to the very core foundation of how the show was written, making them absolutely crippling. The first issue is that its style is completely unrelated to its substance. This anime can\u2019t decide if it wants to be an edgy, dark, violent action show or a light, upbeat, comedy-action shounen with lots of fanservice. Since it can\u2019t decide, it tries to be both at the same time. This, of course, results in it being neither. AGK has absolutely NO concept of tone what so ever. In fact, the first episode contains arguably the worst writing decision in a TV show I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life. \\n\\n\r\nWe see Tatsumi, our protagonist, witness one of the most traumatic and devastating things imaginable. It\u2019s very graphic and the viewers are prepared for Tatsumi to absolutely break down. You know what happens instead? He mourns for about 10 seconds and then gets comedically dragged away for more fanservice and jokes with the other characters as he becomes visibly unfazed by the incident. There isn\u2019t so much as a second allowed for a transition between comedy and tragedy. Oh, but that\u2019s not where the joke stops; for the remainder of the series, our intelligence is insulted to the point that the show tries to constantly remind us how \u201cdevastating\u201d this event was for Tatsumi; you know, the devastation that never happened. He supposedly has nightmares about this event frequently and TONS of his characterization is based upon the effect that this event has on him. Well, great job AGK: you managed to entirely kill the most integral character motivation in your entire show before the very first episode was even over. It\u2019s not like this is the only instance of AGK\u2019s incompetent tone either; there are many, MANY more examples. This show treats serious themes such as rape and torture like they are one big joke; they are used only to over-exaggerate the \u201cevilness\u201d of the antagonists to the point that questions of \u201cgood vs. evil\u201d couldn\u2019t be any more black and white in a traditional, clich\u00e9 shounen fashion. Speaking of clich\u00e9s, let\u2019s touch on the characters:\\n\\n\r\nAGK\u2019s characters fail to stand out in any way what so ever. Not even slightly. The entire cast is full of tired archetypes from a harem comedy that somehow found their way into the wrong genre of anime (much like Higurashi, but in a bad way). Seriously: you\u2019ve got the na\u00efve, personality-less male protagonist (Tatsumi), the airhead (Sheele), the tsundere (Mine), the outgoing/sexual one with giant boobs (Leone), the blunt/emotionless one (Akame), etc. I mean come the fuck on! I AM watching a harem, aren\u2019t I? You can probably imagine how badly this cast clashes with the antagonists, who are the most obviously evil, stereotyped, motivation-less, cardboard cut-out \u201ccharacters\u201d you could ever imagine. They rape, they torture, they manipulate, they do the most morally awful things that the writer\u2019s mind could physically dream up. Why? \u2026Just because they\u2019re evil. Even everybody's FAVORITE character (Esdeath) is completely worthless; she has no damn motivations what so ever people! Every time they \"try\" to give the villains development, it is painfully rushed and short-lived, making it essentially useless. This is one of the cheapest writing tactics in the book and it\u2019s just the icing on the cake to a cast of characters that lacks a single ounce of originality or any depth at all. As a result of the poor cast, nobody cares whenever something happens to any of the characters. This, predictably, takes a massive element of the show away entirely.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Akame Ga Kill is a trainwreck. It has some good ideas and can be decently suspenseful at times, but complete lack of direction makes it borderline unwatchable unless you can completely shut off your brain. From its horribly confused plot to its inane characters, this show never presents us with a single, solitary reason to tune in to the stereotype parade they have created. I do not recommend Akame Ga Kill to anyone.",

            "content": "When I first heard of Akame Ga Kill I was rather hyped It sounded like it'd be the new fullmetal alchemist a shonen with a great mix of comedy drama and action the similarities are there in in both shows a Boy Is coming from a village to a city to become a military dog of sorts both for different reasons The start admittedly had potential Then right when the first death of a main character happened the show began to fall apart\r\nStory(3/10) The story is quite generic a typical boy coming to a big city to join Military  the so He can earnmoney to send to his village Little does he know how corrupt the capital is after some events occur he ends up being recruited by the assassin group night raid that wish to overthrow the government a rebellion of sorts Sounds pretty cool right? \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately Immediately after the first Dramatic scene of the show one that should be effecting Tatsumi on an emotional level to develop his character the Writers thought it would be a good idea to have a comedic moment less then 30 seconds after And that is one of Akame Ga Kill's major faults is there is no tone to it whatsoever, Not to mention The humor is bland as hell almost all of it could just be cut out and you wouldn't even notice It makes it hard to take the show seriously story\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (3/10) Where to even start with this... Akame tries desperately to make us care for these characters they are killing off but the show kills Characters off so frequently The Characters don't get nearly As enough development as they should of The deaths of each characters is treated as a 3 step process. 1 Give the Character some screen time In the previous episode 2 Give them some sort of backstory and flashbacks Then finally 3 Send them off to some fight and watch them die It sounds like I'm being harsh on it but that is what it is the only death that was unpredictable was in the final episodes and that Didn't even happen in the Manga. I don't have an issue with Character Deaths but Atleast develop The Characters due to a lack of Characterization  It just made their deaths feel meaningless As for The Characters themselves they are pretty generic But I still for some Reason Liked most of them Especially Bulat Because of how Entertaining and funny He was and Sheele Who I Only like Because I have a fetish for Glasses And Purple Hair Some of The Characters felt Completely useless Mainly The Night Raid Leader Najenda You would expect Her to be badass and important But sadly She Really didn't do anything for the entire show Even though She has potential to be a badass and capable Female Character The Show just didn't Use any of the Potential The Characters Had\\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10) The Animation for the Show While it looked Nice it Just looked  kind of Standard Nothing To Special in it However The Action Was nice as Expected  But There is a lot of Still Images  and Movements The only real issue I have is there is so much blood coming out From The Characters it feels so unrealistic because I doubt there is even that much blood in a Human Body.\\n\\n\r\nSounds (510)The Music was pretty Average The Openings were decent and fit the Show Nicely but there was nothing Distinct about it For Instance If you Listen to Any song from the Sound Track of a show like Death Note It should be instantly Identifiable You could tell what Anime its from because it has its Own Style Akame doesn't have this it sounds like it was from any other anime. Its not a bad OST Just not Worth a Download.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (510) It was Entertaining at times But The Lack of a Consistent Tone For the Show just Took Me out of the Mood Its Nothing Thought Provoking at All But the action is entertaining for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10) This Show is a Shonen trying to be a Seinen it thinks if they kill Characters off for no Logical Reason its dark and edgy If They would of Developed some of the Characters it would of been a Much Better show It does nothing New for the Shonen Or Action Genre But It does have a Decent Premise and it Stays True to itself The Entire show If you like Watching entertaining Action Scenes and Characters being Treated like Sheep Being sent to the Slaughter House There's a Chance You'd Enjoy this But if You Enjoy Thought Provoking Well Written Shows look Somewhere Else Final Score\\n\\n\r\n(",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nThere's an implication drawn from war that, no matter how much we desire it to be false, people will get hurt. Now, this isn't strictly between countries. \"War\" in this context encompasses all battles. Mental turmoil, physical skirmishes, and verbal bashing are simple examples of such altercations. In some way, shape, or form, the people involved will not leave entirely unscathed. And depending on the severity of the situation, death is a possibility. Akame ga Kill! is all about such death, but is not much more than violence without substance.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe journey starts with Tatsumi, a young village boywho moves to the Capitol in search of his fellow companions. What he finds within the city leads him to join Night Raid, an assassin-filled group whose goal is grand in scope but simple in nature: overthrow the kingdom.\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill! relies on the notion of emotional appeal. Death is rampant within the show, meaning no characters are safe. Akame, Tatsumi, Sheele, literally everyone attributed to the anime are at risk of being eliminated. In order for this to work, Akame ga Kill! requires that the audience become invested in the characters themselves. This is the first problem the anime encounters. Most of the characters are, at times, given their moment of spotlight. Usually involving a single episode or so, much of the cast is given some slight background in order to provide insight about who he or she is and where he or she came from. But there's a rift in this story-telling. For a vast majority of the characters, the appeal mentioned earlier either isn't enough or is hastily thrown in. This creates a disconnect that causes a loss in the show's intended effect. More specifically, the anime has too many characters with too little time to make the deaths meaningful or impactful enough.\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill! also suffers an identity crisis. It constantly reverberates between being a serious, \"dramatic\" battle shounen and a comical, light-hearted romp. The show demonstrates time and again how brutal many of the situations can get. But when it is interspersed with funny jabs or quips to lighten the mood, it doesn't add anything. Rather, it portrays a lack of focus. Then, when the show slides back towards its more serious self, the same issue arises again. Thinking about both aspects, the show shines brighter when it is following the more serious tones. This is mainly due in part to the more \"adult\" subject matter of murder, espionage, and torture. Sadly, the show doesn't stick to this thinking until the final few episodes. Meaning, one must wade through the entirety of the show's lack of direction.\\n\\n\r\nA glaring issue that Akame ga Kill! also harbors is in what actually occurs. Much of what happens has little or zero consequence on future scenarios. The goal behind Night Raid is to topple the current government. They say that what they do along the way is striving towards that goal, but it never comes off that way. Instead, each fight is standalone. Destroying the lab monsters, getting rid of a high officer, or killing a member of the Jaegers doesn't directly affect the group's ultimate dream. In this way, every episode isn't a step towards a resolution, but is instead just another time slot dedicated to potentially killing off another cast member.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill! tends to do well in this department, regardless of the awful story.\\n\\n\r\nBeginning with the art style, the show is, more or less, generic. Forests, safe havens, and inner city towns provide some variety, but are usually not detailed too extremely. The character designs, on the other hand, are actually quite pleasant. While most stick to a \"this is my color\" formula, the designs are done in such a way as to express that character's personality. Akame appears mysterious and foreboding with her jet-black, straight hair and red eyes, while Lubbock seems energetic his disheveled attire. This applies to both the good and the bad guys. It's easy to see that much attention was paid to make them stand out.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, the show does above average. The fight scenes are both large and small in scale, with many opportunities to show off its prowess. Examples include a flurry of swords between duelists or a massive explosion as the byproduct of an Imperial Arm. Since most of the show is steeped in fighting, and the quality of the fights never seems to falter too much, the show should at least be credited for this.\\n\\n\r\nOne last note. The show incorporates some rather impressive shots that are more paintings than drawings. These occur usually once per episode. They don't do much other than show case a heavily detailed scene, but they're a nice addition to provide the animators involved a chance to showcase their talent.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most difficult category. Again, Akame ga Kill! requires a big investment towards the characters involved. Some may argue that this is true for all shows. And to an extent, they are correct. However, this one makes it paramount that such a bond is established. Since death is the name of the game, if the death doesn't matter, than neither does the character. To avoid spoilers, I'll focus on my personal favorites.\\n\\n\r\nHaving an anime titled after you is no easy feat. Akame, the sort of \"poster child\" for Night Raid, is an assassin known for her unmatched swordplay. Resolute, quiet, and unusually hungry, she takes it upon herself to remember the foes of her past in order to provide strength for her future. Despite being in the title, she is relegated to the sideline for a good portion of the show. Character background is given for her, but it comes too little too late. It's strange, to say the least. In the beginning, when she is first introduced, it seems as if her role will be quite huge in the context of the story. But that is not the case. Instead, Tatsumi takes this position, leaving Akame on the wayside. Seeing as Tatsumi is a rather lame protagonist, I think this decision was a poor one.\\n\\n\r\nMost girls like to dress up and put on make-up, and Chelsea is no different. Her flowing orange hair and signature candy sucker make her not only attractive but also \"human.\" That is, among everyone, she seems the most out of place within the fantastical world. Her personality is upbeat, and often clashes with Mine. However, her cheerfulness should not be mistaken for passiveness. Chelsea's main problem is that her inclusion serves no larger purpose. She's pretty much just there. While she may be a confident and fun young lady, she brings almost nothing to the table.\\n\\n\r\nEsdeath, and Akame ga Kill!'s \"best girl,\" is technically not the main antagonist. However, her presence on the battlefield certainly makes it so. Icy and cold, like the Imperial Arm she wields, Esdeath is the epitome of war. Her beauty is striking and so are her skills. Throughout the show, it becomes apparent just how unstoppable a force she really is. Yet, behind her cool demeanor lies a gentler side that she can't quite seem to understand. Her motivations are simple (she just loves to kill and fight), making her a rather plain villain. However, her decision making is not without reason and her personality, despite her torturous ways, makes her adored by all.\\n\\n\r\nObjectively speaking, I find Seryuu Ubiquitous (what a last name! :P) to be the strongest character. Absolutely staunch in her convictions, she aims to bring justice upon the evil-doers of the land. She is quite two-faced, acting bubbly and happy by day but ferocious and insane by night. Her ideals rival that of Night Raid. That is to say, while what she is doing seems wrong, to her she believes that her actions are just. That what she is doing is for the good of the Capitol. Out of the entire cast, she seems to provide the most insight: sometimes, it's important to take a step back and truly think about what you are doing.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is either largely forgettable or doesn't do much to make a lasting impression. They may have their moments here or there, but there just isn't enough character development or attachment to any of them to make them worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP follows a rock-n-roll approach, with hard guitar and drum beats. The vocals involved are quite tame in comparison. The song itself is okay, with the best portion coming through in the end with the final guitar riff.\\n\r\nThe second OP is a step up from the first. It's very gradual, starting almost as a lullaby, but picking up tempo with the guitar and choir singing. Once again, the final guitar pieces take the cake, but accompanied with even more of the choir singing, it makes it all feel quite strong.\\n\\n\r\nThe first of the EDs is very gentle, contrasting well with the show's overall atmosphere. The violin playing adds to this, as does the slow drum beat. Vocally, the singer does a nice job, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe last ED follows its counterpart, being rather gentle in nature. The multiple voices singing in harmony give a rather pleasant feeling. In fact, the visuals provide a lot of the sensation; it feels as if the song flows like rippling water.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack doesn't have anything particularly amazing. If there was anything, I usually enjoyed the sound effect of Akame clashing or slicing through someone. It's a distinct \"whoosh!\" sound effect that always sounded pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, there are no stand out performances to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the fun for this one derives from the fights themselves. It was usually awesome to see the varying Imperial Arms at work and how they would clash with one another. In particular, the final duel is quite impressive, both in its length, the variety of moves, and the ultimate, final technique.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the bad guys that pop up throughout the anime are really quite lame. They are just there to be evil and killed off. Meaning, I was never really fazed by anyone that Night Raid had to encounter, because they never added their own spice or originality. This is obviously not true for the Jaegers, but before their introduction (and even during their time), the rest of the villains are nothing more than boring fodder.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Akame ga Kill! is an anime that really doesn't do much. The characters are very hit or miss and the story is nonsensical. However, if someone is looking to have a semi-enjoyable time, wondering who will prevail after all is said and done, this wouldn't be a bad place to start.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, disconnected, doesn't know what it wants to be, no purpose\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, nice character designs, above average actual animation, picture-esque still frames\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, fun cast, but the majority are non-memorable\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, mix of okay and good OPs and EDs, forgettable soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, action and death galore\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "To say the shonen action genre needs to move on from DBZ is like saying that Taylor Swift should never rap ever again. Everyone knows this, and yet nothing is done to fix the problem and we continue to expose ourselves to it, basically telling the producers that we want more of this shit. We want more lazy ridiculous action with worse choreography than Lethal Weapon 4. We want unironic humor with less wit than Lethal Weapon 4. We want our shows to go on for more than one-cour because the longer the better, and whilst the details are a little different, guess what productiondecisions were made that caused one of the worst fourth entries in action series history to exist?\\n\\n\r\nAnd it says alot about the genre when all it takes is one new thing to stand out and suddenly we jump on it like a Marvel fanboy who discovered that Thanos would be in the newest Avenger movie. Now don't get me wrong, I've always rolled my eyes at the fact that people could partake in duels that send you flying and cut off limbs and yet nobody dies in the end. But I never felt the stairway scene in The Protector would have been much better if we saw those goons getting their heads kicked off, because at the end of the day, I'm watching action stuff for the action, and anything else that comes with the territory either supports the stuff or comes off as a natural consequence. Akame ga Kill doesn't do either of those things though. Instead, it does everything Lethal Weapon 4 did wrong, and it proceeded to drag that pain out for more than six times the length.\\n\\n\r\nBut before we get into that, let's talk about what Akame ga Kill is about. Well, it's about how many shonen stereotypes you can fit into your standard fantasy setting and still expect to be taken seriously, is what it is. Despite not having his name in the title - and said titular girl having less importance than Zelda did in her own franchise - our main protagonist is Tatsumi, your typical village idiot who ends up digging himself into deep shit when he ends up befriending a cheerful girl who is actually EVIL. And believe me when I say she isn't the only one. There's a lot of characters in this show who act like rejected Pokemon characters until you give them a reason to kill you, in which case they turn into Dennis Hopper impersonators.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, his life is saved from this EVIL girl by a bunch of assassins called Night Raid, who wear their title about as well as Epic Movie does due to being about as sneaky and dangerous as Black Star, and he ends up joining their ranks in order to take revenge for some throwaway friends the story forgets about within six episodes. Once in, he must deal with the harsh life of being an assassin such as uncovering the true nature of these EVIL characters, gaining the resolve to kill them for justice, coping with the loss of teammates, and fighting off an Ilsa reject who has the hots for him because he's the main character.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that Akame ga Kill is made by White Fox, whose record in terms of fight scenes is worse than Jon Favreau if he had the shakes. They also have a bad record in terms of animation quality, with the decently animated stuff being reserved for KyoAni-level light hearted entries and the horrendously awful-looking stuff reserved for everything else. And boy does that apply with this show, because it looks it was made in the late 90s by people who don't grasp the notion of shading and color schemes. Even more unfortunately, it's not just the visuals that are washed-out. I've seen JC Staff shows that have had more imaginative character designs and action scenes than this crap and whoever thought them up deserves to be sent back to whatever art school they graduated from. Just compare the Milky Holmes finales (the good ones I mean) to this show's \"target one spot and use stills for the finishing blow\" and prepare to not go blind from visual whiplash. Or alternatively, watch Terra Formars at the same time and see which can bore you more in terms of ruining visceral impact.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's not just the bad action that the studio brought with them in terms of adapting the manga. They also brought their usual pacing problems along with them. The one thing that stands out about the show - the fact that characters die - ends up working against it because the author uses it less as a way to lend gravitas to the plot and more in the way of padding things out in order to get a two-cour length out of this thing. Only the non plot-important characters ever get the axe and because the show always gives you (shallow) background information on them right before they die, it's hard to really summon any enthusiasm for when said axe is swung, especially when they keep introducing new unimportant characters to get killed off shortly after to the point that the formula becomes more repetitive than each installment of a first-party Nintendo franchise. The actual plot-related characters barely push things forward, and when they do, it comes in the form of tired shenanigans like being trapped on a deserted island or running away entirely, just preventing anything from getting done.\\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn't help that none of the characters - main or extra - have any flavor to them whatsoever. All of them are defined by one trait and it never evolves into anything even remotely resembling complexity. I've heard a lot of people talk up Esdeath prior to watching this, but her utter devotion to her masters along with her one-sided love for Tatsumi and handling powers that no human being should be able to handle makes her more the perfect wife for Tatsuya from Mahouka rather than someone I'd want on my side if she wasn't trying to kill me. Jet Li didn't even talk much in Lethal Weapon 4 and yet he had more charisma in one shitty movie than the entire cast throughout this two-cour trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just to turn up the heat on this burnt-out mess, there's the issue of the show's ending. Now Akame ga Kill's manga wasn't finished by the time the show was put into production and thus the studio had to take some liberties with the actual source. Now whilst I'm all for removing the clowns and changing source material altogether, this only works if the changes have some creativity put into them. Not only is a giant immobile mecha shooting up the city incredibly boring to watch, the finale is more rushed than a university student trying to prepare for his exam two hours prior whilst constipated. Combine that with the flat characters and you've got one of the most underwhelming auto-piloted endings to a revolution I've ever seen in fiction. Say what you want about Episode III. At least the destruction of the Jedi was done in an epic way.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the big question I have regarding this show before I end this sea of paragraphs: why was it ever popular to begin with? It adds nothing new to the shonen action genre and whatever potential new thing it could have added is lost in a sea of tired cliches and production problems. I tried looking at a few anonymous forums to see what all the hype was about, but I got turned off by people stating \"they kept this rape scene in. Awesome!\" or \"I was so scared that Leone was going to die because of this show's 'no one is safe' atmosphere\". Yeah, because I was so scared for a character who never had her origins explained and whose apparent \"deaths\" were severely lacking in drama compared to everyone else's.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the people wishing for an army of John Wayne Gacys to show up and do their thing, what the fuck is wrong with you? There's liking violence and then there's just being plain psychotic. And you enter the latter territory the moment you purchase the newest Grand Theft Auto over the newest Saints Row willingly.",

            "content": "Ah, Akame ga Kill, a show hyped up immensely for the Fall of 2014. To be honest, I was really looking forward to watching the show when it was first announced. I have read the manga, and I thought it was at least decent, if nothing else, and it should\u2019ve been decent as anime material as well, but no, it wasn\u2019t.\r\nInstead what we got was a messily-written, poorly adapted mess of a show that killed itself by the end of it all.\r\nNow, before I start this review, let me just note, that even though I\u2019ve read the manga, I will be judging this show basedon its own merits. There\u2019s also a TL;DR at the end for anyone who doesn\u2019t want to read so much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:- 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Akame ga Kill revolves around a young boy, Tatsumi, from a village who sets out to join the military in the capital in order to gain money for his village. Unfortunately, once he does reach the capital, he realizes that the capital is in fact, a corrupt place which was all caused by the person who manipulates a young emperor to his whim, the Prime Minister. Later, through a strange course of events, he is semi-forced to join a group, named Night Raid, which is in fact a band of assassins who are attempting the break the empire.\\n\\n\r\nSeems good doesn\u2019t it? Well, yes. The premise is a pretty good setup. But don\u2019t let that fool you. The show starts off pretty good, especially the first 2 episodes, but after that it\u2019s all downhill.\\n\\n\r\nThe main praise that the story of Akame ga Kill gets is the praise that it had the guts to kill off its own characters. While that may be, you barely get to know anything about the character before they die, meaning that, the character deaths never got to me at an \u201cemotional scale\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has very weird pacing, one episode a main character could\u2019ve died, while in the next, the rest of the characters are on a beach laughing and playing. The story keeps jumping around, and at times it became incomprehensible. The show also has a harem aspect, which at times, got really annoying since it was completely unnecessary and it just wasted time.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with this, there\u2019s also the fact that the story feels very rushed. There were a lot of things that were left unanswered, and while I won\u2019t specify anything, the last 5 episodes were completely asinine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Akame ga Kill was done by White Fox, a studio known for such works like Steins; Gate and Jormungand. Unfortunately, this is definitely not their best work. The most I can say about the animation is that it\u2019s very bland. The lack of attention to detail is, quite frankly, disgusting. The only real thing that stands out in the show\u2019s animation is its average quality, and that is not what I look for in an animation studio.\\n\\n\r\nThough, there are two positives to the animation, those are, the well done fight sequences, and the excess of blood shown, something that a lot of recent anime seem to avoid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the animation of the show isn\u2019t bad, it\u2019s nothing great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:- 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMoving away from the art, we have the music, which is just as average as the art, if not worse. The soundtrack of the show is so bland, that I had to go re-watch a few episodes just to see how good or bad the soundtrack was, and now, I still can\u2019t remember how it was.\\n\\n\r\nBoth openings of the show were pretty decent, and the second ending was also good, the first ending though, didn\u2019t do that much for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut now we arrive at the voice actors. Oh god, these voice actors. This show provided me with some of the absolute most clich\u00e9d voices  I\u2019ve heard in anime for some time. If someone\u2019s and antagonist, then their voice just shouts \u201cI\u2019M THE BAD GUY!\u201d, and if someone was a protagonist, their voice shouted \u201cI\u2019M THE GOOD GUY!\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:- 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the section where this anime, like many others before it, falls flat on its face. But this one doesn\u2019t just fall; it falls into a bottomless pit, never to be seen again.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just say it flat out. The characters in Akame ga Kill, are the most clich\u00e9d, stereotypical and straight up least developed characters I\u2019ve ever seen. Even some terrible shows, like Pupa, had more interesting characters that had some kind of depth to them, and I\u2019m not kidding.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just spell out the stereotypes for you. \\n\r\nTatsumi is the young hero who wants to become strong. Akame is the classic case of a cold uncaring assassin, who also happens to be a food junkie. Leone is the Onee-San, who loves to make sexual references to the youngest in the group, in this case, Tatsumi. Lubbock is the perverted guy who\u2019s actually nice-hearted, but still tries to sneak in a peek at some ladies. Sheele is the airhead. Bulat is the strong dependable older brother of the show, to whom Tatsumi looks up to. *cough*Kamina*cough*.\\n\\n\r\nChelsea and Najenda were the only two characters who I actually cared for, not because they were developed, but because they were the only characters who were even remotely realistic. \\n\\n\r\nThe we have the most classic case of Mine. Mine is a tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nWhat? You expected more? Well tough shit, there is nothing more. That\u2019s it, she\u2019s a pure Tsundere with no effort put into her character.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have the ever so popular Esdeath for you Yandere-lovers out there. She\u2019s a Yandere, and a sadistic one at that. Again, there\u2019s nothing more to her character.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, I did care for a certain group of characters, the rivals of Night Raid, who are the assassins for the empire, the Jaegers. This group was a bit more interesting and entertaining in comparison to the shit-fest that was Night Raid.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end Akame ga Kill, has one or two decent characters, but the negatives completely outweigh the positives in this section.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:- 7/10\\n\r\nThis is the best part of this anime. Regardless of its numerous flaws, I enjoyed watching the anime, even if it wasn\u2019t exactly enjoyable for the right reasons. In the first half of the show I enjoyed watching the anime without noticing its flaws. Towards the middle, that enjoyment turned to distaste as I watched while noticing most of its flaws. By the end I was laughing my ass off as to how hilariously bad the show had become.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-A good premise\\n\r\n-Average animation\\n\r\n-Decent action\\n\r\n-Good openings and endings\\n\r\n-Slightly enjoyable\\n\r\n-There wasn\u2019t any censorship\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Terrible execution of story\\n\r\n-Horribly written characters\\n\r\n-Forgettable soundtrack\\n\r\n-Poorly adapted(For manga readers)\\n\r\n-The ending was awful\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR :- Overall, Akame ga Kill, was a poorly adapted show. It had a decent premise which went wrong. In its technical department it could not have been more average, and the characters are stereotypical, bland and underdeveloped to no extent.  The show starts off as a dark and gritty shounen that could've become a seinen, but eventually it just devolved into a generic shounen that was as average as average can be.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:  4.4/10",

            "content": "Akame Ga Kill should have been called Akame Ga Controversy. \r\nWith it deviating from the plot of the manga, loads of the original fans were outraged and called for White Fox's head. But as someone who hasn't read the manga, and probably won't for a while, I'd like to call Akame Ga Kill a small success. It succeeds in it's small niche of being the Game of Thrones of anime, and if you watched this while it was airing and didn't get any spoilers --- tell me your secrets, as this review will be completely spoiler free. \r\nStory(6/10): The story begins as a young swordsmennamed Tatsumi leaves the village he grew up in in order to send some money or support back to it. He plans to join the Imperial army when he is intercepted by a busty blonde that tricks him out of his money(that he was flaunting). Eventually, he has to sleep on the streets when a young, wealthy lady offers him a place to stay, which he accepts. Later on, you realize that people with even the kindest of demeanors and looks can be the wickedest, and this is when Tatsumi meets the infamous Night Raid, a group of assassins that specializes in the elimination of evil and corrupt denizens. He joins them on their mission to better the world as he is violently thrust into the world of fighting, bloodshed, and loss. \\n\\n\r\nIn Akame Ga Kill, there are weapons known as \"Imperial Arms\" that are age old tools that were created to help balance the world. They're extremely powerful weapons of destruction that are present throughout the anime, and all Night Raid members have one in their possession, as well as the Jaegers, introduced later as the main force that will oppose Night Raid in the story until the brutal end. But as lavish as this all sounds, it falls short of anything really spectacular or even above average. The story/plot is just good enough to propel the whole anime forward, but it has problems throughout, such as it going for too much shock value, and trying to force watchers to feel emotions that just aren't there. But in all, the plot was pretty decent. \\n\\n\r\nArt(10/10): If there's one thing Akame Ga Controversy does right, it's the art. Not even manga readers should be able to talk smack about it. It's vibrant, colorful, and remarkably fluid, including the animation. It's an eye orgy the whole time, and its probably the best thing about Akame Ga Kill. \\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10): I'm going to be honest. I didn't always notice the music playing in the background, if there even was any. There were moments when it definitely amplified the moment, but most of the time the whole soundtrack was pretty forgettable. Though at the same time, it's nothing to talk down on either. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7/10): The characters, a lot like the art style, were unique and likable. This connection of liking, or even loving for some, is essential to how the anime toys with your feelings and emotions, as it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that characters will die, and a lot will suffer before hand. However, for more than a few of the characters, I thought they didn't get nearly as much development as they should have, and it made their deaths much less impactful than they should have been. Other times, the death flags were so obvious that you just start crying even before they die. An extra 2 episodes to make 26 for character devlopement would have gone a long way\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10): I'm a pretty nit picky person, but surprisingly, there wasn't much to nit pick at in this anime. Everything just clicks and works fine from start to finish. Although I will say this is probably the simplest anime of the year and offered no depth whatsoever, but at the same time, that's not what Akame Ga Kill aimed to be. This isn't Serial Experiments Lain. This is your standard over-the-top Action anime, up there with Seven Deadly Sins and Bleach. And Akame Ga Kill excels perfectly in this area, and I didn't struggle at all with watching any of it. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (8/10): \\n\r\nAkame Ga Kill is a contender for anime of the year in my book, but still has serious competition to compete with. If you read the manga, you probably won't like this adaptation at all, and will give it a poor score. Should I read the manga to see how much better it is? Maybe. But as it is right now, Akame Ga Kill was a fun, spoiler-ridden ride that'll be hard to forget. Although the Story and Sound is subpar, it makes up for it with excellent attention to Art, and a nice and colorful cast of characters. If you're debating whether to watch or read this, I'd say to definitely watch it first so you don't end up hating it while you watch it. And I probably would have liked this anime a bit more if I wasn't spoiled every day, but you my lucky reader, who hasn't seen the anime, probably won't have it as bad as when it was airing. \\n\\n\r\nIn all, Akame Ga Kill is a fun ride if you're willing to excuse some bumps along the track. It's not a master piece by any means, but if you look at it at just the right angel, you might find something I did not.",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill is not the worst anime ever made, but it sure is one of the least genuine. The writing pieces together mismatched elements of shonen adventure and gives them a screwball seriousness about death until the word \u2018death\u2019 has lost all meaning. The script is oversaturated with character introductions and sensationalized death scenes that feel simply slimy. The grubbiness that Akame ga Kill exhibits come right from the very bottom of the medium complete with unexplained power ups, an impossibly simplistic corrupt fantasy setting, and hundreds upon hundreds of flat characters.\r\n\tThe amount of fried chicken consumed in this anime is painful. The PrimeMinister\u2019s beloved son dies? It\u2019s time for fried chicken. Akame is on stakeout? It\u2019s time for fried chicken. Wallowing in sadness about the death of a main character? It\u2019s time for fried chicken. The fried chicken gag is indicative of the narrative depth here. It doesn\u2019t go deeper than visual indulgence. There are no subtleties in Akame ga Kill. The good guys simply move on without meditation on death, and the bad guys are simply bad without any logical reason. The protagonists are protagonists because the show needed them scripted like that, and the antagonists are the same way. Even with the introduction of the Jaegers (why a German name?) and Tatsumi\u2019s foil (more like clone) the show simply ramps up the stakes. The bad guys get bigger as the good guys get stronger and they keep introducing new characters that are \u201cstronger\u201d and occasionally an old face is replaced with a new face (Bulat becomes Susanoo). \\n\\n\r\n\tAkame ga Kill manages to create a cast of both heroes and villains with no positive traits. Seryuu Ubiquitious as an example, is a character that exists solely to be an antagonist. She has catchphrases, she has special moves, and she has \u201cmoral values\u201d that contradict our protagonists. Except none of the characters ever make any sense. Why does she want to Kill Tatsumi? It\u2019s her job to eradicate all evil no matter what it is? It doesn\u2019t make any sense on a literal level and it doesn\u2019t make any sense on a realistic level. I\u2019m not saying anime characters moral codes should be realistic, but then shouldn\u2019t they serve a greater thematic purpose? Having to hear about why Akame needs to be the one to kill her sister makes for some of the stupidest monologues not because it\u2019s a flawed idea at its base but because there is no basis for her needing to kill her sister to begin with. And when the show moves towards characters like Esdeath and her talk about love it feels as if the largest and most blunt plot device starts pressing harder and harder on the script. Akame ga Kill is serious about a whole lot of nothing other than reaching its embarrassing (near direct Madoka rip-off) anime original ending. \\n\\n\r\n\tHow did someone come up with the character designs and fantasy setting for Akame ga Kill? Just like Shingeki no Kyojin, it is some sort of walled city with a corrupt government. Except our protagonists are a pink haired goth-loli, a schoolgirl with a sword that instantly causes death,  a generic guy, a green haired steam punk dude, a gay guy, a Japanese god-turned-golem and a buxom cyborg-like leader. The bad guys are a dog that turns into a full arsenal, another generic guy, another schoolgirl, another gay guy, another buxom leader, and a man in a gas mask with a flamethrower. None of these things even follow a design scheme! It\u2019s like a party with the most interesting people in the world who all leave before you can ask them how they managed to get to there. Where Shingeki no Kyojin can get by with flat and often ridiculous characters sadly Akame ga Kill does not have the production value. Visually it\u2019s bland and static, with very few dynamic camera angles and often whole fight scenes skipped or scratched for reasons beyond explanation. My favorite was a scene where a series of \u201cdanger beasts\u201d \u2013 almost forgot about these - approach Tatsumi out of nowhere and he announces that it\u2019s going to be a tough fight. Immediately the scene cuts and he is sheathing his sword, and announces that it was indeed a tough fight. For an action and adventure show, how could you have the brass to write that? There are show\u2019s that are plucky enough to get away with it, like the entirety of episode 4 of Katanagatari, but Akame ga Kill is not that smart. You wouldn\u2019t realize how stupid Akame ga Kill is if it wasn\u2019t this loud.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe show is a mistake from beginning to end, but it\u2019s not without entertainment. And that\u2019s the whole hook of it. You\u2019ve seen this show hundreds of times before but maybe never this simple. It really is the mindless violence action anime of 2014, whatever that title means to you. I do not recommend it over anything but if you want mindlessness you have it's essence distilled right here. I look at Akame ga Kill as a failed version of Shingeki no Kyojin because it is even more indulgent in terms of gore and has less of a mystery element. This anime is mighty popular, but you are not missing anything by not watching it. The ancient relics have no boundaries in terms of power scope, and the bad guy is named Prime Minister Honest. I can\u2019t believe someone wrote this.",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill! is probably one of the biggest train wrecks of 2014. That's really the only way to describe it. It is a train wreck. In the beginning, the train began running. In the middle, it began to waver a little. By the end, it's crashed into the lake. That, of course, is Akame ga Kill! right there.\r\nDo note that this review will refer to the anime and only the anime, so there will be little to no mention of the manga.\r\nSTORY:\r\nAs the summary says, the story of Akame ga Kill! is basically about the main character, Tatsumi, being roped into an organization calledNight Raid dedicated to taking down the corruption within the Capitol, said corruption stemming from the evil Prime Minister who controls the young king like a puppet. It's nothing ground-breaking, but it works. At least, the premise does, anyway. See, some problems with Akame ga Kill! stem from sounding good on paper and then turning out to be lacking in execution, like the aforementioned premise. To name an example, there's the decision to introduce a rival organization called the Jaegers that works under the Capitol to fight Night Raid, and though it's a little cheesy to have a \"good team vs. bad team\" in a vein similar to the Super Friends vs. The Legion of Doom, but it would have been nice, considering the story spends some time focusing on the characters within the Jaegers and establishing character relationships in it like in Night Raid. Another concept that sounded cool on paper was the fact that the majority of the cast is not protected by plot armor, so truly, anyone could die at any moment. This is one concept that probably drew in many people who were tired of anime or manga where characters kept being resurrected, like say Naruto and Dragon Ball. However, the fatal flaw for both of these examples, if not a half-assed execution, would be lack of characterization that makes you care for what happens to anyone, but we'll get to characters later.\\n\\n\r\nFor the world, there's very little to say about it. The only thing you can say about it is \"it's a medieval-esque fantasy world.\" It looks like it's straight out of a Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, or Legend of Zelda game, what with the towns and exotic monsters, except it doesn't have nearly as much thought put into the world-building, so the setting essentially doesn't contribute much to anything either.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say for the rest of the story is, well, it's a train wreck. It completely jumps the gun sometime in the later half, stops caring about anything, and starts going all Urobuchi on the characters who are still alive at this point. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing much to say in the Art department. The art style is generic and somewhat uninspired, but it works, if nothing else. The designs are simple but varied enough, whether it be for the monsters, weapons, etc. The animation is standard fare; the characters look shaded well enough and the fights can be fun at times, but nothing really sticks out but it's not necessarily bad either, except for whenever they'd keep showing still-shots like this was a PowerPoint presentation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nLike the art, there's really not much to say here in my opinion. The voice acting is okay, and the screams are even delicious to listen to (if that makes any sense), but I wouldn't be giving out any awards. As for the soundtrack, there also aren't any songs that really stick out, though if there's one highlight, it would be the first opening, \"Skyreach,\" by Sora Amamiya. While the second opening, \"LIAR MASK,\" by Rika Mayama, was also good in its own right, as were the endings, I probably won't remember them tomorrow, so that's that.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't noteworthy at all. Like, any of them. At all. It's difficult to go into more detail because there's frankly not much more to go into more detail about. There's the main character Tatsumi, but he's ultimately bland and unmemorable in terms of personality. He's brave, somewhat heroic, and determined, like millions of other fictional protagonists out there. That's really all there is to describe him. There's also Akame, who despite having her name in the title, has little to do with the plot. In the beginning, she's introduced as arguably the best killer in Night Raid, and as for personality, she's depicted as somewhat gluttonous and insensitive, but ultimately very caring, but eventually, most of these traits fail to develop or completely disappear. There's also side characters like Leone, the hot older sister type, Lubbock, the perverted laid-back guy, Bulat, the cool older brother type, Sheele, the cute ditz (for the most part), Mine, the tsundere loli-esque girl, and many others. Most of these characters also lack notable depth and come with their own sad backstories that are mentioned once and then never again. Speaking of things that are mentioned once and never brought up again, let me tell you one thing, they handle the deaths of their friends and loved ones really, really well. Well enough to smile carelessly the very next episode.\\n\\n\r\nLike the protagonists, the antagonists lack memorability and depth. The majority of them and their motivations can just be described as \"they're evil!\" and it's left at that. It doesn't really help that their evil nature are brought to the extreme; anyone who doesn't agree with the protagonists, the \"good guys,\" are all depicted as sadistic and love nothing more than torturing and slaughtering people. Really, the only notable villain is General Esdeath, and that's because she's the best girl, of course, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nLack of ample characterization really did hurt this show. If the characters were better developed or had at least thirty minutes of screen time, maybe their deaths would have mattered and have had more impact to the audience, but we're not dealing with \"would have\" thinking, hence the characters are probably the weakest aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've called Akame ga Kill! a train wreck, but I'll be damned if it wasn't a really entertaining train wreck. At least near the end anyway where, as I mentioned earlier, it just stopped caring. But for the majority of the show, I had serious mixed feelings. I had fun during the fights and whatnot, but there were a few things that threw me off, like the inconsistent tone (\"My friends died? Well, okay. I'll just be sad about it for like five minutes and then get into a comedic / romantic misunderstanding with one of the girls.\"), the overall edginess, for a lack of better word, and subplots that really didn't lead anywhere (an episode dedicated to introducing a small group of villains kills most of them off by the end of the same episode). Overall, it was a mess, but it was a fun mess.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nWas Akame ga Kill! doomed from the start? Well, probably not. It could have been a good show if the writing was better, but, well, this isn't a good show, plain and simple. With bad execution, lackluster art & sound, cardboard cutout characters, and a later third that completely jumps the shark, the only way to enjoy this show is to turn off your brain and have some popcorn to go with it, but if you're looking for a piece of work that's actually good, look somewhere else.",

            "content": "*spoilers for Akame ga Kill*\r\nAkame ga Kill is an endearing case of stupidity and an inability to take itself seriously when it needs to while taking itself seriously when it shouldn't. It's far too edgy for its own good, and it's a riot to indulge in, thanks in no small part to its incompetence, blatant spelling out of already black and white matters, and it's tonal incoherence...or at least it starts that way. It then grows into a more generic and edgy anime that tries and largely fails to wring intended emotions out of us with mostly generic and bad characters, equally badly inserted humor,and improper backstory dumps that are either too early and never reinforced or too late and never reinforced. Alright so, just how bad can it really be with all of that said? Is it some part of Akame ga Kill's plan to kill our brain cells until all we can say is \"ga\"? Well, with that little conspiracy theory out of the way, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nThere is something to be said when your first episode is so rushed, edgy, and tonally incomprehensible, that it automatically informs you that this show is not gonna be pleasant. I mean, the first episode is schlock at its finest, hence my accusations at the preamble. I mean, it doesn't even name a single location, and in fact, not a single location in this series has a proper name, which really sells how horrific the world-building for this show really is. After Tatsumi is roped into joining Night Raid, episodes 2-8 are, for most part, asshole of the week type episodes, at least until two of its members die: Sheele in episode 6, and Bulat in episode 8. It is here that we encounter a few more problems (one of which sorta surfaced in episode 1 but could've been rectified). \\n\\n\r\nFirst, the Danger Beasts. We know not of much of the species present here, and there are no real defined danger tiers. They're just there for people to kill while being acknowledged as powerful beings. Second, and thankfully this goes away, but this section of the series is so blatant about being black and white that when a terrible person is having a villain monologue, the anime decides to visualize them as literal monsters, because the audience of gore and boob-loving 14-year-olds apparently needs to be blatantly told that these awful people are monsters.  Subtlety; it's what this series rarely has. Thirdly, the goddamn tone-shift comedy moments. Episode 1 is a major example of this, with the show constantly cutting its serious or even sad mood short in order for a quick, unfunny gag, and then it cuts back. It's really jarring and tonally incomprehensible at times. Finally, and this is the most pervasive and problem-encompassing of the issues, the Imperial arms. \\n\\n\r\nThere are 48 of them (yet we never see even half of them), and for some reason, none of these can be recreated with modern day AGK technology and magic (because of course a magic gun can't be manufactured; that would make sense) and they each have hidden abilities that are often conveniently pulled out of a character's ass (especially Akame's from episode 24 (which somehow doesn't poison her like it does for anyone else who gets cut), Esdeath's from episode 21 which freezes time for an unknown amount of time for the will of the writers to screw her or someone else over, and Tatsumi's golden Incursio form from episode 23). Don't get me started on Mine's \"Pumpkin Pinch\" which almost always occurs when she decides that she's in a pinch without actually being in one (because outnumbered automatically equals pinch). Also, the Imperial Arms are only compatible with a user if said user has a great first impression of it, which is insanely dumb since that means the only way for it to choose you is for you to geek out over it, and nothing else. And, if you allow me to jump ahead for a bit, episode 23 introduces an asspull in which there were this secret Divine Imperial Arms all along, jacking up the count from 48 to 49, and being strong enough to fuck over the unnamed city (you heard me). We'll return to this travesty moment in a bit since we gotta move on with the actual plot of the series, which is also a travesty.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 9-19 are effectively part 2 of the show, with part 1 being what i described earlier and part 3 being...we'll get there. This new part brings out a new organization by this evil empire that Night Raid has fought against, called the Jaegers, comprising of 7 powerful members of the Capital, most notably, the brutal ice wielder, Esdeath. Tatsumi gets his ass captured, escapes, and then Dr. Stylish (like an Idiot), leads an assault on Night Raid with his bio army, not even informing or bringing along the other Jaegers like a smart member would do, and of course, after Susanoo is introduced  to fight alongside Night Raid, Stylish gets his ass killed by Akame. Then, after Chelsea comes in and both she and Susanoo are indoctrinated into the group, and Tatsumi and Esdeath are teleported to and back from an island, we get Kurome's ability to revive fallen members and danger beasts (and she could've brought Chelsea and Bulat back to really hamstring our heroes but she isn't that smart), and both Bols and Chelsea die. Then, the 4 Kouken Temple Rakshasa demons, 3 of which are killed by Lubbock in the exact same episode they're introduced, which is just plain pathetic. I mean, the Garou Knights from Fairy Tail were a more credible threat than these guys; at least the Garou Knights lasted for more than one episode. The final demon member gets killed by Tatsumi really easily in the next episode (in the anime, not in the manga), and Seryuu is killed. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the final 5 episodes: the anime original episodes. Here, both groups are brought down to 2 living members, with the deaths of everyone except: Akame, Najenda, Wave, and Run. Even main character Tatsumi dies, which is rare. That guy who teleported Tatsumi and Esdeath (his name is Shura) and Lubbock kill each other after a Night Raid Plan goes wrong and Tatsumi is captured by Budou (who kills and is killed by Mine), and Susanoo sacrifices himself against Esdeath to get everyone (including Tatsumi) out of a wrecked colosseum. Akame and Kurome duke it out (Kurome apparently is slowly dying from the drugs she was injected in when she was a kid, and she still didn't try to summon anyone from Night Raid to really torment Akame in battle like a smart wielder of her weapon would do in her situation), and then that new Imperial Arms appears with the young boy emperor using it to wreck everything in episode 23, where the story takes one final plunge from awful to rock bottom. Then, Akame and Esdeath duke it out with asspulls aplenty, and then we actually...get a satisfying finale. \\n\\n\r\nI mean it when I say that the finale to this series is genuinely good, at least the second half of it, after the whole Akame vs Esdeath fiasco. The horrible prime minister who made the empire toxic ended up getting his head smashed by Leone (who get shot a bunch of times by him), Leone says goodbye, goes back to her now happy city (or something, we don't know the name or even if it's a city, town, or village) and the dies there while knowing the difference her and her group's efforts made, and the empire gets a new mode of government, with both main groups (Jaegers and Night Raid, or what's left of them) dissolve and join together (except Akame) and Najenda says one last goodbye to the already dead Lubbock, carrying his headband. Despite the idiotic final fight and the edgy and even more idiotic nature of the series, the finale is genuinely satisfying and sweet, which is far more than I can say for any anime of or near Akame ga Kill's admittedly low caliber.\\n\\n\r\nA majority of the characters in Akame ga Kill barely do anything to avoid being totally one-dimensional, especially our protagonists, and a lot of them do incredibly stupid things, including my Dr.Stylish and Kurome examples from earlier. Another problem with these characters is that backstories are handled horrendously. They are often used as death flags like with Bulat and Bols (in which they die either the same episode or the next episode afterwards) almost never actually animated (since we either see them explain it with no flashback footage or they're so short that they only last up to 25 with little animation) with the only exceptions being Sheele's, Akame's, Kurome's, Najenda's and Esdeath's backstories, 2 of which are mainly done in the episode Kurome dies where the backstories of both her and Akame are fully shown instead of partially shown, and the rest, barring Najenda's, never really being reinforced except at one key moment, with no better example than MIne's generic \"raised and bullied in the slums\" backstory that has  no remote elaboration on anything like why she joined Night Raid. It's bad enough that one of these backstories are used for \"episode I die in\" scenarios in which we never really got to connect with a character and see many facets of him/her, and it's bad enough that some of them (like Wave and Lubbock) don't even have backstories, but some are down with literally no provocation or narrative reason, like Leone's and Mine's (until MIne's gets reinforced in episode 19 so that she can kill Seryuu). In fact, I can't even remember Leone's backstory, just the fact that she has one.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists of the series (Night Raid) are pretty terrible and largely generic, and it's pretty sad when most of the notable villains are better written and more likable than them. Let's start with Tatsumi. In the beginning, he an unlikeable and pompous idiot, and through development, he becomes a very, very generic protagonist. Bulat, his \"bro\", has 2 traits: manly, and gay; that's all there is to him aside from his death flag backstory. The two have this Simon and Kamina dynamic, and it lasts an eerily similar amount of time as Simon's and Kamina's, with eerily similar impacts to the surviving protagonists, except Simon and Kamina are legendary characters while these two just suck. Akame is one of the better protagonist, though all she amounts to is an edgier, discount Saber with a twisted poison weapon. Lubbock is a generic badass pervert who manages to get the most amount of important kills next to Akame now that I think about it. Sheele is a typical hot, clumsy who is more interesting due to her also being a savant in killing people, and Leone is the energetic, fan-service tease. Now, Mine...where do we begin with this bitch...\\n\\n\r\nMine is the my most hated character in this show by a gigantic margin, one of the worst Tsunderes in history, and one of my most hated characters in fiction, up there with the likes of Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass and Shin Asuka from Gundam SEED Destiny; I am not kidding here. Her levels of hypocrisy are unmatched in this show, her bitchy and even lethal attitude and actions towards Tatsumi is infuriating to the point where I nearly dropped the show because of her on multiple occasions, and by the end, she just becomes a by the numbers tsundere in all aspects. There is literally nothing good I can say about this character except that I'm glad the show killed her off. Fuck Mine and everything about her!\\n\\n\r\nChelsea, conversely, is my favorite character, in large part due to how she manages to aggravate Mine, and the fact that she has lollipops. She's a bit harder for me to define in a singular characteristic, but she's very playful, cold, and somber all at once, thanks in no small part due to her backstory (that is unseen) of her previous team dying in front of her. Susanoo is very picky about details and is simply the stoic cool guy that has literally every single convenient housekeeping trait a woman wants in a man: the perfect husbando, if you will, which is the antithesis of Sheele's character. Najenda is simply a military leader who kicks the ass of anyone who offends her. That wraps up the Night Raid members; now for the Jaegers...and everyone else...shit.\\n\\n\r\nEsdeath is a hot, powerful yandere sadist who has this \"survival of the fittest\" mentality. Refreshingly, she also feels great pity for any comrade who dies, and often leaves a few people alive in hopes that they'll get stronger in order to provide a greater challenge for her since she's a blood knight. Unfortunately, the filler episodes betray her character big time by making her only the bare bones version of what I described with none of the added remorse and ill-intended mercy I mentioned prior. Wave is basically Tatsumi, but better in every way imaginable, including fashion sense, hair, and Imperial Arms, so we don't really need to go over him and his lack of backstory. Kurome is a more crazed likelier than Akame is, and she also really, really wants to be the one to kill her. SHe's also dying from the drugs injected into her in her backstory that made her a better assassin, which wasn't brought up or remotely hinted at until episode 20. Run was a teacher until his students died in which he decided to take the Suzaku Kururugi route of trying to change the government without actually doing anything other than becoming a soldier in their ranks, and he's a very suspicious and uninteresting character. I can't really remember much about him other than his backstory, methods, and angel wing Imperial Arms. Skipping Dr.Stylish because all he is, is a crazed and stupid mad scientist who really likes when things are \"stylish\". Bols is probably the best of the bunch. His intimidating mask is to cover up how he is insanely shy to the point of not wanting to show his face until Esdeath takes the mask off and makes him eat with the very welcoming Jaegers in probably the most heartwarming scene of the show. He even has a wife and kid whom he communicates within an adorable and actually real manner. He basically carries the more human and successfully emotional side of Akame ga Kill, and while the show tries to hard to be emotions, it rarely works and I'll explain why later. Still, while Chelsea is my favorite character here, Bols is easily the best written, even if that doesn't really mean much here.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure I'm in a minority when I say that I don't hate Seryuu Ubiquitous. That doesn't mean that she's a good character, but she easily could've been. Plus, I have a bias for anyone who manages to hurt or aggravate Mine consistently, except Tatsumi 'cuz he's lame. They try to make us emotional for Seryuu and put her in a more sympathetic light despite her hypocritical, knight templar tendencies, but they fail miserably. They either do it too early or too late, and no better example than with the death of Dr.Stylish. She didn't interact much with him but then we see her cry over his grave and have a backstory moment about how he was her patron and that he gave her multiple gun implants. If this series was written better, we would've seen them have a really strong, established connection like with Tatsumi & Bulat. Her violent side is also cartoonish as hell to the point where I can't hate her; reason being, I can never take her seriously with those facial expressions that make Code Geass wince. I mean, shark teeth? This is supposed to be taken seriously yet her face becomes the kind of expressive that feels like she belongs in a Saturday morning cartoon. But enough about her and why I can't take her seriously; let's discuss the other people!\\n\\n\r\nPrime Minister Honest (why?) is a manipulative, fat, gluttonous, greedy monster, as if he was the poster-boy for his archetype. Though his dinner interactions with the child emperor (who doesn't even have a name despite being important, especially in episode 23) are genuine-feeling and nice. Shura is a typical complete monster, treating people's lives like toys and Budou is a general who randomly shows up in episode 20 while also being talked about in some of the middle episodes, and he's just an OP general dude, nothing more than that. Plus, he, a being who is supposedly stronger than even Esdeath, is killed by Mine...wow. I already mentioned the 4 demon guys, and I'm literally not even gonna mention any of the minor characters from episode 1-8 or any of the guys summoned by Kurome; they're not worth mentioning whatsoever and have dreadfully dull characterization at the best of times.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is not as well animated as say, Steins;Gate, Studio White Fox still did a pretty good job with a lot of the animation and set-pieces of Akame ga Kill, even if their trademark White Fox eyes are unfortunately missing. There are some great looking set-pieces, like the destroyed Imperial Arms used in the background of the Akame vs Esdeath fight. There is also insanely minimal CGI which is a rarity in anime nowadays. The fights are often well animated and the different fighting styles of the weapons are all in full display, from swords to gunplay to strings and what have you. Even the danger beasts look interesting to a decent extent. This isn't Fate/Zero or Unlimited Blade Works or anything, but it still looks pretty good, especially the Akame vs Kurome fight, even if a lot of the earlier fights use the bad DBZ spam thing of characters pulling off an insanely unrealistic amount of hits with things.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is pretty decent, with some really standout tracks like the amazing catchy Hindi track \"Sakaba\", the rustic-feeling \"Kinpaku\", or the amazing and most notable track of all: \"Le chant de Roma\". Also, the emotional \"Sheele OST\" and \"Yume Monogatari\" are just beautiful, even if the show doesn't do as well in making the emotional moments work as well narratively. OP1 \"Skyreach\" by Sora Amamiya, is a mostly generic OP but I always like the part right before the chorus, and the final 13 or so seconds. OP2, \"LIAR MASK\" by Rika Mayama, is bloody amazing and if used for a better anime that was long enough for it to feel like a journey, would honestly be really gratifying and tear-jerking; it is that amazing, even if this show is unworthy of it. Both EDs are mainly generic and not noteworthy despite trying to be emotional. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is pretty bad. I cannot recognize a single person in the cast list, so I guess this was to be expected. Some voices work well and make certain insignificant moments better, but the voices of Akame and Esdeath in particular are really not working for the characters, and Akame's often sounds flat as sin, and some emotional moments are even ruined by the dub script and voices. Stick to sub for this one.\\n\\n\r\nInevitably I was going to be really harsh on Akame ga Kill, since it's a pretty terrible show in and of itself. It manages to cycle through almost every single kind of bad you can think of, but I could never bring myself to hate or, or even truly dislike it. You'd think that I would since it has given me almost every reason to, but I simply can't. The first two episodes were hilarious in how bad they were while 3 and 4 were infuriating (and guess which character made them that way and nearly made me drop the show because of it). Then, with aggravating and hilarious exceptions, this show put me in this serene trance of mild boredom. I was never all that angry but never all that entertained, just, at peace in my mind while watching this show. I could've never predicted that from a show like this, and it's because of that, that I'm not angry at it or showing no mercy, even if the way I tackled the plot and characters may make you think otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill is an edgy, silly show that tries way too hard to be cool and shocking while simultaneously trying way too hard to be emotional, despite the script failing to make it work. It fails to establish a strong enough and compelling enough connection between a lot of its characters for their deaths to wring out the emotions they should, like with the death of Sheele, even if the music is just begging you to cry. It beseeches you to feel for these generic shounen characters in this fake seinen world but it just doesn't know how to build anything up properly, nor does it even use its shounen elements properly. It's an absolute mess that was simply blessed with a good animation studio and some good music. It tries and fails at almost every opportunity, rarely earning anything, even if there are subtleties and sweet moments worth defending. Well, with all that said, this has easily been the hardest review I've ever had to do by a gigantic margin, so, thank you for reading, and I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "(Potentially Spoilerific)I began watching Akame ga kill recently, after a long hiatus from anime in general caused mostly by the trials and tribulations of adult life. My time is more precious than it's ever been and I have a limited amount of time for BS. Akame ga kill is BS. This is simply one of the worst shows I've ever seen, the only reason I stuck it out to the end was because I wanted to see how horribly bad it could get. \r\nFrom the get-go, the show is confused, it doesn't know whether it's telling a serious and meaningful story or whether it's justmaking fun of itself. A number of moments in the show that are supposed to be heart-wrenching or intended to leave a lasting impression are cheapened by silly one liners, tropes, and awful humour. \\n\\n\r\nThe shows humour isn't even original, don't come here if you're after comedy. The same old recycled cliches are thrown at you. \\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill isn't afraid to kill of its main characters - this is usually a good thing, but in akame ga kill it's almost a testament to how awful the show really is. The show fails to form a connection between the viewer and the characters. Summarily, they'll die and you won't care because they're such one dimensional recycled clones.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's \"unique\" blend of humour and violence is almost disturbing. As is their glorification of what are essentially terrorists. Issues like this aren't black and white though, there is rarely an \"entirely evil empire\" and an \"entirely good group of assassins\" the first few episodes really cement this paradigm as the various members of Night Raid confront one dimensional power rangers baddy X Y and Z before being given a bunch of Night Raid clones to fight against.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of action, the battles are unbelievable and badly choreographed. Although the show kills its characters it does not maintain a shred of credibility when it comes to how strong people are, or how they fare against one another, it's all quite random. It's the sort of thing you'd spoon feed to a 3 year old making airplane noises and expect them to swallow. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to end this review now and throw up. I really feel like throwing up now, that's how bad this is.",

            "content": "#REPOST.\r\nThere is no secret that 2014 in retrospect was a great year for anime. It was the year that great modern classics like Haikyuu, Black Butler Book of Circus, Barakamon, Shirobako, Yona of The Dawn, Parasyte and Ping Pong the Animation.\r\nIt was also the year that gave underrated gems like Selector WIXOSS, World Trigger and Yuki Yuna is a Hero. It was the year that I generally liked despite having a few stinkers.\r\nHowever, even though I liked 2014 as a whole there was one craze that annoyed me that was the rise of edgy anime. Despite 2014 only having two edgy series being Tokyo Ghouland Akame Ga Kill these two not only bring back other edgy series back to relevance like Elfen Lied, Future Diary, Gantz and Deadman Wonderland where anime causals who liked Tokyo Ghoul and Akame Ga Kill would often check them out but it also spawned more edgy anime in the following years. \\n\r\nThankfully in recent time, the edgy craze has died down a lot as most anime fans including causals seemed to finally got the message that ''being dark and edgy doesn't equal good''. Because of this, every edgy show that came out since then were was dead on arrival.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul re: (anime), Magical Girl Site and The King's Game are all complete abominations.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does this have to do with Akame Ga Kill you may ask? Well to say that Akame Ga Kill is an awful anime is a fast understatement. I'm not exaggerating when I say that Akame Ga Kill is not only the worst anime of 2014 but it's also one of the worst anime to come out from the past 4 years.\\n\\n\r\nSay all you want about Pupa being the worst anime of 2014 but least that train-wreck was short o.  Akame Ga Kill is 24 episode dumpster fire that has some of the worst writing, directing and characters I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a young man named Tatsumi who sets out for the capital to earn money for his starving village and finds a world of unimaginable corruption, all spreading from the depraved Prime Minister who controls the child Emperor's ear. After nearly becoming a victim of this corruption himself.\\n\r\nTatsumi is recruited by Night Raid, a group of assassins dedicated to eliminating the corruption plaguing the Capitol by mercilessly killing those responsible.\\n\\n\r\nSaying that the story of Akame ga Kill is well written it's like saying the plot of Star Wars Battlefront 2 on the PS4/Xbox One was engaging. The story is a poorly written mess that struggles to do basic storytelling elements correctly.\\n\r\nLet's start with this shows tone consistently which is absolutely appalling. It tries to this dark serious series that it's filled with depth however the tone completely destroys it with its out-of-place comedic moments that had. Episode 1 is the prime example of this. Tasumi sees his friend die in front of him then in a scene later we see flailing out in a comedic fashion completely destroy the mood and tension of the scene. It was insulting to see him flailing him like a child in a very serious moment that deals with the theme of grief. One of the main problems with Akame Ga Kill that you will start is how it loves to put childish and comedic characters in a serious setting that deals with serious and provoking themes and topics. It didn't work for the type of show that Akame Ga Kill is trying to be in a long run and as a result, the series ends up being this pretentious mess that has no idea of what it's doing.\\n\r\nThe one thing that you start to easily notice about Akame Ga Kill is how it tires be grey with motivations of the characters leading to questions about they true ideas but the writing in Akame ga Kill was so bad that any attempts of establishing character ideals just ends up being Black and White and this is ultimately showcased with the Emperor and the Prime Minister.\\n\r\nThe Prime Minister is clearly an evil scumbag based on his words and actions that was shown to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime goes too far greater heights to prove this by making him a manipulative, fat, sadistic and a heartless pig in general. As for the Emperor himself well he's just a walking cute little boy on the screen which has no personality whatsoever. Our villain's ladies and gentleman... This is what we want for villains for a dark fantasy anime. Akame Ga Kill no. \\n\r\nAkame ga Kill's horrible black and white writing were only made worse by the horrendously executed character deaths. Now Akame Ga Kill was advertised as this plot armour free dark fantasy shounen where all the characters in the show could at any moment however the execution at horrendous thanks to its awful writing and directing. From the first death in episode 6, I was extremely appealed of how the show uses the concept of death and doesn't even respect it in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers Ahead)\\n\\n\r\nAs much I enjoyed the character Mine her death was just dumb contrived beyond belief was she died due to lack of energy left even though she got hit once throughout the entire fight against Budou and she didn't bleed for shit. Her death ended being nothing but a plot contrivance shit show.\\n\r\nThe most outrageous character death in Akame Ga Kill which had me facepalm was with Leone Death where after being shot five times by the prime-minister gun as well ultimately killing him by smashing his face to oblivion Leone had more of enough time to ask for medical help to treat her wounds however she doesn't say anything to anyone including her night raid comrades as she dies in the middle of the alleyway. How shit is the writing here that it had a real opportunity to keep one of the main characters alive but didn't due to the 12-year-old writer decided to kill her off because say it with me ''People die when they are killed''... BULLSHIT.\\n\\n\r\nThe absolute worst death in the series was with Sheele aka plot device husk girl. She had lots of opportunities to take down Seryu from stabbing her heart with the edge of her scissors after losing her arms. Slicing her head in the ground but no. She as an assassin leaves her out of the open alive and runs off to help Mine.\\n\r\nThere's one thing to help your friend from danger, but there's being an incompetent assassin who leaves a target alive. If she was a pacifist than I would have sort of understand then again she could have brought pacifist type gear to paralyze or sleep the enemy but the writing and directing is so abysmal she leaves her. So dumb...\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Akame Ga Kill has a tone of asspulls is a massive understatement. Almost every single fight and I mean almost every single fight ends with set characters asspulling they way to victory. Not only the fights in Akame Ga Kill ended up a chore to watch thanks to predictability but it really destroys any tension and suspense that the fight could have in a long run.\\n\r\nSome of the asspulling in Akame Ga Kill include Mine being able to pull her final ultimate attack against one of the strongest characters in the series at full power even though she barely had energy left.\\n\r\nAkame slicing her neck with her cursed sword and instead of dying she gets a powerful power up. Another example happens in episode 20 where after the girl was sliced in cold blood she gets up stabs Lubbock, talks normally even though her vocal cords are screwed due to the blow, and falls back to the ground dead.\\n\r\nThe most insulting asspull by far was when Tasumi Incursio transformed into rejected concept art Digimon where thanks to the power of Nakama I mean friendship he was able to defeat the Emperor. Bullshit.\\n\r\n(End Of Spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nOh, if you guys haven't noticed by now Akame Ga Kill is a poorly directed piece of shit and it's not in the same tier as Future Dairy, Goblin Slayer and Tokyo Ghoul re: in terms of directing it's still just a pathetic directed series that insults your intelligence.\\n\r\nOh, if you guys haven't noticed by now Akame Ga Kill is a poorly directed piece of shit and it's not in the same tier as Future Dairy, Goblin Slayer and Tokyo Ghoul re: in terms of directing it's still just a pathetic directed series that insults your intelligence.\\n\r\nSome examples include a scene when Tasumi in a ship looking for the people that he's going to assassinate then out of nowhere we get a backstory of Kamina I mean Bulat. He doesn't go up to Tasumi at all to tell his backstory to him the series just magically decides to tell the backstory to Bulat. \\n\r\nAnother great example is how the anime has a random close up ass shot of a corpse that got stabbed in the back. I want to repeat it again the anime had a random close up ass shot of a corpse that got stabbed in the back. There's being a pretentious and there's completely insulting the viewer's intelligence by showing ass of a corpse expecting us to get hard on and guess what it doesn't work...\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite example of this shows horseshit direction happens at the end of episode 1. After Night Raid takes Tasumi they all fly off to the ground. So why is one part of the city is fully in black? I don't know about you guys but I never have seen a show that is so cheap and incompetent in my life in terms of direction. They could have easily had a close up still shot of Tasumi saying his thoughts or even better have someone create a gadget that let's then fly but no night raid just falls into the void. Did the anime staff even watch the whole anime before putting it on air? The is just absurd in every level possible and it really shows how shit the production is. Unbelievable.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing about Akame Ga Kill by far the worldbuilding. This show has by far the worst worldbuilding I have ever seen in any anime. Not only does a horrendous job at establishing it's fantasy setting where it's for labelling nations, location establishment, country name, political tides etc. but it incredibly inconsistent. One of the best examples of this happens in episode 13 where a character named Lubbock goes over his backstory.\\n\r\nTo keep in mind Akame Ga Kill is set in a fantasy setting where there are horses being used for transport. So tell why there's not only modern football that belongs in the present time but an actual modern rich school in a fantasy setting,\\n\r\nSeriously it's like the series creator doesn't understand the concept of worldbuilding. The incompetence doesn't stop there as the series loves to have awkward and pathetic shots about relevant locations that bore the viewer to death due to how uninspired the world looks.\\n\\n\r\nThe final nail in the coffin of Akame Ga Kill was the final 4 episodes. Outside of theses episodes competently diverting from the manga in a horrible way the series devolves into this contrived kill them all narrative where every singly characters minus a few expectations are dead. Overall the story of Akame Ga Kill is horrendous. This is easily one of the worst told stories I have ever had the displeasure of watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Akame Ga Kill are nothing more but a bunch of generic anime stereotypes that you all seen before.\\n\\n\r\nTatsumi himself is an uninspired generic protagonist who wants to get stronger because of reasons? I usually don't mind the generic main protagonist as long as they are fun, charming and entertaining that overthrown they generic status but Tasumi is anything but fun, charing and entertaining as he goes beyond the generic status by not only being annoying in the personality department but also lacking any depth or development. In many ways, he's no different to an empty husk.\\n\r\nAkame, despite her name being in the title, is shockingly the most forgetful character in the series. Minus the final 3 episodes where she quote ''developed'', she barely did anything in the overall plot. It doesn't help that very wooden in the personality department.\\n\r\nLeone is the typical upbeat fanservice character that you all seen before. She's trying to be this older sister archetype for the group but ends up failing misery thanks to most of her dialogue being about sex/bob jokes. She doesn't develop as a character at all as she remains to be the same character from episode 1.\\n\r\nLubbock is your typical badass pervert who just seemed to be lacking the personality department. Yeah, he may get a good number of kills in the series, but it doesn't mean shit if your personality is shit.\\n\r\nBulat is a plot device more than a character. Apart from being your generic badass older brother type for Tatsumi he only serves of progressing the plot by giving Incursio to Tatsumi that's it. \\n\r\nIf there was a character that I liked from Night Raid, it would be Mine. Sure she may be your typical Tsundere characters that we all seen before however what separates her from the rest of the characters was her backstory as well her development was decently executed. Not only that but her character interaction was spot on and at times generally funny.\\n\r\nIt's such a shame that she dies in the most contrived way possible... Seriously that was one of the most pointless deaths I have ever seen from this medium.\\n\r\nWhen I was creating my review script for Akame Ga Kill, I would always think twice about calling Sheele an actual character. Why because Sheele is literally a walking device for the narrative as well being that serving as a token death for the series. Outside of being a plot device, she is an empty character where the only trait that she has going for is she is clumsy and caring... What a total waste of a character.\\n\r\nChiesa is a character that joins night raid later on and no surprise she is just as forgettable as the rest of the characters in Night Raid. She could have been an interesting fun character to add to the night raid crew but the poor direction destroys her character before she can even truly shine.\\n\r\nAs for Susanoo well, all I can is that less than I talk about him the better because he's just a doormat that exists to be generic and die.\\n\r\nFinally, we have Najenda who is your generic leader of the group who just orders peoples around. That's all I can say about her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo that's wraps up Night Raid now let's talk about the other chararters who are for the most part somehow even worse.\\n\r\nI believe it's unfair to the word horrendous to have it compared to the villains in Akame Ga Kill. These are easily the worst villains I have ever seen in an anime. Not only they are disgustingly generic to the eye thanks evil for the sake of being evil, but they are simply downright incompetent being villains. Many of the villains would either spat out generic villainous dialogue all over the place without any point whatsoever or they would actively tell the opponents about the powers in great detail fully which allows the heroes to kill them. How pathetic!!!\\n\r\nFinally, we have Anti Night Raid aka the Jagers who are all garbage. Almost all the characters from the Jagers are straight out copycats of Night Raid such as Kurome who is basically Akame if she was a loli, Waver who is a flatter Tatsumi, and the rest of them are just as bland and uninspired.\\n\r\nBefore I talk about Esdeath let's quickly talk about Seryu or as I like to call Annoying Justice Hag. I loathed Seryu I really do. Not only she was annoying twat who preaches about justice 24/7, but she's also an inconsistent dipshit who has a serious personality disorder.\\n\r\nOn first glance, she appears to be your typical justice freak however as the series goes on you will start to see her true colours as this annoying justice freak who switches personalities in the hat of a dime from happy to psychotic.\\n\r\nOn top of being one dimensional in the kingdom come, she has no character development to speak off. In fact, I go as far that she devolves as a character where she absolutely refuses to take any criticism about her ideas by replying its nonsense. Fuck Seryu and everything that she stands for.\\n\r\nThen we have Esdeath who is by far my favourite character in the show as well being the most wasted potential character. All the characters that I have talked about so far were nothing more but bland anime stereotypes Esdeath the only character that was quote ''interesting''.\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series, she was a sadist leader who lacked empathy for people of whom she deemed weak, due to her father's philosophy. Before a certain event of the series, she was sort of an interesting character who has decent character depth. However, after a certain event her character slowly falls apart and by a final couple of episodes, she sadly devolves into a typical one-dimensional overpowered villian who has an unhealthy relationship with Tatsumi.\\n\r\nWhat makes Esdeath the most wasted potential character is that she's simply in this show. If she was in any other fantasy that she would be the most complex villain in set series but because she's in Akame Ga Kill a show that plagued with bad writing and directing her motivations and ideals were either simplified or worst butchered.\\n\r\nSo that's all the characters in Akame Ga Kill and they are downright awful!!! Apart from Mine and Esdeath, the characters are infested with bland characters, shallow personality, pathetic writing and laughable motivations if it even exists.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nFor a shounen anime that was released in 2014, it is very underwhelming in both the art and animation departments. The character designs were awful as not only they are generally badly designed but they all don't seem to fit in the world of Akame ga Kill. Some examples of bad character designs include Tatsumi, Bals, Chisea, Najenda, Mine and Lubbock. It's like the characters designs for this anime accidentally put these modern looking characters into a fantasy setting. That's terrible. The background scenery is not much better as the series just uses a collection of bland fantasy background scenery.\\n\r\nThe art consistently is also not very good as keep going off model left and right. Yes, there was a couple of good-looking art every now and then especially in the final 2 episodes but it ultimately doesn't save the shows subpar art production. \\n\r\nThe animation itself is for the most part below average as it loves to budget cuts all over the place. Still, frames, stock footage, choppy movement, weak fight choreography, lack of visual flair and I could go on and on. Like with the art itself the series does have some good animation every now and then especially in the final 2 episodes but those moments come far between as this show animation is overall shallow.\\n\r\n3.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nIf there was anything good about Akame Ga Kill is the soundtrack. The soundtrack while not the great was still very good. I could go as far that the soundtrack has more substance than the anime itself thanks to the soundtrack competent direction and timing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme Skyreach by Sora Amamiya is your typical action opening theme.\\n\r\nThe first ending theme Konna Sekai, Shiritakunakatta by Miku Sawai is a pretty good ending theme that closes an episode of Akame Ga Kill very well thanks to its slow relaxing beat.\\n\r\nThe second opening theme Liar Mask by Rika Mayama is a kickass opening theme that fits well with the nature of the second half.\\n\r\nThe second ending theme Tsuki Akari by Sora Amamiya is a forgetful ending theme despite having decent ending visuals that showcase the bond of Kurome and Akame.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for Sub or Dub.\\n\r\nThe sub was competent for the most part, but there were no standout performances.\\n\r\nThe English dub done by Sentai Filmworks was decent at best. It's not a great dub by any means but at the same time, it could have been a lot worse especially with Sentai Filmworks hit and miss track record when it comes to English Dub.\\n\r\nSo if you had the opinion go with personal preference.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nI honestly cannot say that this show was a success at all. The narrative and series direction was abysmal, The worldbuilding was broken along with the characterization. The visuals were shockingly subpar as the series loves to use budget cuts left and right as well featuring awful character designs and scenery The only redeeming thing about Akame Ga Kill is the soundtrack which was very good and that alone saved it for getting a 1/10 or even a 0.5/10 from me.\\n\r\nThe most baffling part of Akame Ga Kill is how the series even got popular in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nI usually don't mind shows that don't like getting popular like Re:Zero, Erased, Tokyo Ghoul, Sword Art Online, Blue Exorcist and even Darling in the Franxx, however, Akame ga Kill was the one of the few shows that I would say ''How in the hell did this shit even got popular''. If it wasn't for the edge factor the anime community would have forgotten this crapheap of a show in two months or less. Needless to say, Akame Ga Kill is a horrendous series that highlights the worst of modern anime to a degree and you should avoid it like the plague. If you see a DVD/Blu Ray copy at your local store hide it or even better if you have the guts destroy it on site so no anime fan both casual and elite would suffer watching this poorly constructed train-wreck.\\n\r\nFinal Score 2/10",

            "content": "*Spoiler-free review*\r\nI'm not sure why it was panned by a lot of reviewers, but I actually enjoyed Akame Ga Kill.  It's certainly not perfect but it did some things that were executed fairly well in my opinion.\r\nI can see why people had a problem with how a lot of humor was written in the episodes as it can mess with the pace.  I saw the random bits of comedy as just that, comic relief.  I did find some of it distracting or just simply drawing out the episodes, and at some point, the series started to really feel like it was justdragging.\\n\\n\r\nOther issues that I had was it has the makings of a harem anime (which I generally despise).  I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nSo the low down on each category:\\n\r\nStory: It seemed simple at first.  Then it becomes convoluted as most stories go, and at some points it becomes predictable.  My biggest peeve is that the story wants to go one direction and builds up to it, just to get COMPLETELY quashed leaving the viewer wondering what just happened and why.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem I had is that it's called \"AKAME ga kill,\" not Tatsumi.  The story focuses primarily on Tatsumi, while granted is far more interesting than Akame's very plain yet sometimes quirky demeanor.  But the show tries to keep reminding you that it's about Akame, but you never really know why.\\n\\n\r\nThe story flatlines about 10 episodes in, picks up, then flatlines again.  So if you watch this show for the story, don't expect anything mind-blowing or innovative.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I had no problem with the pacing (apparently a lot of people said it went all over the place, I on the other hand thought Kill La Kill was much more all over the place), the mood does change a lot and sometimes you're not sure if they're about to insert a gag or not.\\n\\n\r\nArt - I really enjoyed the character designs and the costumes.  Yes, there's fan service, women are generally very well-endowed and the animators have little shame in showing off their assets as well as practically a few mandatory skimpy scenes, but again, at least they don't have entire episodes devoted to bikinis and swimming.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes I thought were animated well.  They're not absurdly lengthy and not many instances that I noticed of recycled shots.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Nothing to really write home about but I enjoyed most of the voice acting (especially Leone's), the first intro song Skyreach was great, the music is generic background music to match the mood of the show.  Nothing much else.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - They built this story around a bunch of tragic characters for the most part and let their stories unfold as needed.  It gave the viewer a reason to care about almost every character in the show, even the antagonists.  They even take the time to flesh out the antagonists and really humanizing every character and why they became who they were.  By the end, if you invest in the show a little bit, you might find yourself caring about the antagonists as well.  This is where I thought the show actually did shine and kept me watching.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I actually liked the comic relief bits.  It does ease up towards the end of the show and becomes less distracting but all-in-all, I thought it was good enough.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion. don't expect knock-your-socks-off action or deep storylines, but if you watch the show as-is with no expectations and keeping an open mind to random acts of silliness, you might enjoy the show as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nI could still do with less Tatsumi.",

            "content": "Akame ga kill; it is a hit or miss completely. Either people like it or people want to write as many complaints to the author asap. I personally loved the plot and how they animation company was following the story so very well until the last five episodes. That's where everything went wrong; they anime veered a different direction than the manga. Akame ga kill is supposed to be dark and have it's light comedy to ease the viewer so they can enjoy the bitter sweetness of it. They problem with this anime and manga is that the target audience wasn't clear. It had laughsand enjoyable fight scenes that would make it seem like a shounen anime. But the darkness of it (which is seen in the first few episodes) was taken out completely by the anime company due to the fact that the anime was meant for younger audience which made it rather bland and took out the uniqueness of this anime. Since it had so much gore, it didn't do well in Japan and they had to come up with some other alternate ending which I found terrible. Those who have watched the anime without the manga, you are lucky yet unlucky. People who've watched the anime without reading would not understand how bad the ending actually is and will only see the anime as \"the anime with a few good plot twists and amazing character development\" those who read would only see how tragic this anime with such a well crafted plot which had potential to be a masterpiece, had turned to shit. Overall, in the perspective of the non readers, it's something worth killing your time on, and if you're curious to how the story should have went or want to see the potential it had to be a masterpiece, read the manga.",

            "content": "Of all the anime to air in 2014, I think Akame ga Kill was the most dissapointing. Not because it was the worst, but because unlike the other overhyped shows of 2014, Akame ga Kill was actually \"good\" up until the last couple episodes. It's yet another reminder, along with Claymore and Guilty Crown, of how a bad enough ending can ruin an entire anime. However I tend to be more forgiving than many here on MAL and look at the whole content. I don't feel the slew of reviews giving this anime a 3 are fair. \r\nLet's begin with the bad\r\nThe worst thing aboutAgK is the anticlimactic conclusion. I could expand on the absurdity of the anime-original ending and compare it to the manga in terms of character development and story, but it would alienate the anime-only viewers and become a comparison rather than a review. \\n\\n\r\nSo aside from a botched ending, the entire anime suffers from under-developed main characters and a lack of purpose from the evil prime minister who is despicable for the sake of being despicable. The show is called Akame ga Kill so you'd expect Akame to be a real standout character right? Wrong! Akame has very little to no depth and gets ridiculously little screentime for a \"main character\". Although there are hints about her past (maybe the author's way of saying \"go read AgK Zero\"?). Anyways, the \"bad\" here is that she wasn't the real main character. That position went to Tatsumi! He's far less interesting than the under-developed supporting characters and I feel the whole series would have been better off without him. That's not to say I hate him, I just feel very indifferent towards him (even his design is bland). \\n\\n\r\nThe other major problem are the (frequent) death scenes in the anime. If there is something anime taught me, it's that you don't need a highly developed character to make a death scene emotional. I don't think the issue in AgK was that the supporting character weren't developed enough, but rather the execution of their death's was poorly done. With the exception of a few (I will not spoil who).\\n\\n\r\nSo what's good about Akame ga Kill? After all I'm giving it a 7/10 so there are good things I want to point out. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part (original ending excluded), the anime has real good pacing. Things happen chronologically and smoothly enough that you want to watch what happens next. The supporting characters, despite being too numerous to develop, are enjoyable to watch whether it be for their personalities or for their respective imperial arms (some being pretty awesome). This one may be subjective, but Esdeath is a major asset to the anime whether or not you like her. Her introduction propelled the show to higher ground and of all the characters she was by far the most developed. Plus I can't really think of any anime character that is comparable to Esdeath in terms of personality and presence. Lastly, the anime did a great job making the opposing faction \"The Jaegers\" likeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is ok, but could be a lot better. The intense and eye-candy colors almost make up for the animation\\n\r\nThe OST is surprisingly good with a handful of them being remarkable: \"Yume Monogatari\", \"I\u2019ve got to go home\", \"Meeting with Everyone\", \"Le chant de Roma\", \"Friend's Feelings\"\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill had a lot of potential which fell short. It successfully built up to a climax and then lost the audience. Nonetheless it was a very fun ride with unpredictablility at every corner. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

A stupid and naive main character is recruited into a group and gradually learns lessons and becomes stronger. Meh. I felt like the writer tried too hard to make the world seem dark and unforgiving.

            "content": "Yeah okay, I get it. I\u2019m about two years late to the party. I had just joined MAL when Akame Ga Kill ended, and I thought the flood of reviews for it was never going to stop, so I just kept sitting on this review and never published it. Then I went on the Maury show and they determined that the previous statement was a lie, and that I\u2019m also the father of 18 month old Jimbob. Thanks a lot Maury, you jerk! \r\nNo, I finished Akame recently, and while I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s exactly deserving of all the praise that was heaped onit in late 2014, neither does it warrant the Sword Art level of hatred it got in due time. It is what it is, and it\u2019s not what it isn\u2019t\u2026 and it isn\u2019t a whole lot of things- namely very good.\\n\r\nAkame takes influences from a lot of different anime- Dragon Ball Z, Neon Genesis Evangelion (Leone does the exact same animation for drinking her beer as Misato, and Allison Keith voices both, even!), Naruto, Inuyasha, a healthy dose of Sword Art Online, a dash of Kill La Kill, and basically every other shonen series in existence. In particular though, I find that Akame borrows heavily from Blood+, as well as Mirai Nikki and Fullmetal Alchemist. In fact, you could say that Akame Ga Kill is what would happen if Mirai Nikki and FMA had a baby- it would come out with a weird deformity, really wacky, tonally inconsistent, and with a few extra chromosomes\u2026 which is exactly what AGK is. \\n\\n\r\n\tNow, I could probably talk for 10 hours about how many issues this show has with tone and characterization\u2026 but I\u2019m gonna try to do it in 9. \\n\r\nIf I were to describe AGK in just a few words, I would say \u201cFMA lite with Mirai Nikki\u2019s direction and characters.\u201d It has similar tonal shifts to FMA; from dead serious (very literally) to stupid chibi comedy in the span of 10 seconds. A character crucial to the plot might die, and someone will drop a line like \u201coh well, it was a fair trade off- one of ours for one of theirs\u201d, and then continue their meal\u2026 like someone\u2019s death means absolutely nothing- despite the fact that most characters in the series have some major qualm about the moral righteousness of their killing duties as assassins. Also like FMA, everyone is given a very shallow, tragic backstory, but given the size of the cast and the length of the show, there\u2019s just not enough runtime to flesh anyone out, which minimizes the impacts of deaths even further 95% of the time. \\n\\n\r\n\tComing back to tonal consistency; the tone in AGK is like very roughly shredded cheese on top of a dumpster salad- that is, pieces of trash bags, used toilet paper, and paper plates with old pizza cheese (and maybe another kind of cheese) stuck to it for the leaves of the lettuce. For a tastier, but perhaps less colorful simile: imagine Ergo Proxy was put into a blender: it came out nice and smooth, and homogenous. It carries the same dark and foreboding tone throughout its runtime. Akame is said dumpster salad- about as heterogeneously mixed tonally as they come; and a good ladle full of dumpster juice dressing on top for good measure. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters may be the best part of the show\u2026 and like the lack of stupid teenagers with superpowers in Spice and Wolf, it may be more of that lack of something in the show that\u2019s good about it. That\u2019s not to say the characters are good or anything, but that they could have been a whole lot worse. Nowhere in Akame do you have THAT character\u2026 you know, the loli character with huge boobs that exists only for fanservice and self insert pleasure? In fact, Akame is relatively low on fanservice in the usual sense- the fanservice is in the violence, but more on that later.\\n\\n\r\nAkame herself isn\u2019t even much of a character- particularly for a title character. Her presence is really only felt in the first handful of episodes, and then again at the end when the writer just outright stole Blood+\u2019s climactic swordfight, but sans the meaningful drama, and tangible tension buildup between two characters we watched develop for the preceding 40 some odd episodes. She\u2019s just kind of \u201cthere\u201d for the bulk of the series, but this is a positive, in all honesty. Thankfully though, we never have to hear some half-baked sap pie about how she\u2019s in love with the MC and talk about her future and what he means to her or how she\u2019s feeling after having murdered thousands of people, or anything like that. Nah, she just kinda hangs out and eats\u2026 a lot. In fact, that\u2019s basically how you can define the character: she kills people when necessary, and eats a lot. There were a lot of moments when I wanted the show to switch from \\n\r\n\u30a2\u30ab\u30e1\u201c\u304c\u201d\u65ac\u308b to \u30a2\u30ab\u30e1\u201d\u306f\u201d\u65ac\u308b\u3002Japanese speakers- ayyyooooo. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe, hands down, two best characters in the show are easily General Esdeath (oh my, Satsuki has grown up, dyed her hair, and found a hobby in torture and murder) and Seryu Ubiquitous, who wins the LawlMartz Anime Award for \u201cMost Anime Name\u201d. Seriously, Esdeath is probably the second campiest character in the show, after Dr. Stylish, but her ridiculous character traits can be summed up as: \u201cviolent, but determined loving attachment\u201d, and \u201cmurderous\u201d. In fact, she says herself that she has only three interests: \u201cmurder, torture, and finding new methods of torture\u201d. She adds a fourth later- the aforementioned love. This is the sum total of Esdeath, and boy does she ever live up to it. These are literally the only four things she does in the show! 10/10 characterization, positive development, and staying true to her ideals! What a woman!\\n\r\n\tIf anyone could be more hardline than the infinitely badass, reskinned Satsuki Kiryuuin of AGK, it would be Seryu Ubiquitous, who somehow escaped banishment from the Shadow Realm and into an entirely new show. Honestly, Seryu Ubiquitous (yes, I\u2019m going to keep typing her name out because it\u2019s just THAT cool) would have been the best Yugioh villain, ever, period. She exists for one purpose: GREAT JUSTAAAAACE! She even has a chibi pet justice dog that morphs into a hulking steroid beast that eats people, and she also has all manner of gun implants inside her body, including in her stomach that she can hock up and somehow fire while talking. It\u2019s truly a sight to behold how ridiculously over the top this character is- and on top of that, Kira Vincent-Davis absolutely MURDERS this role with a performance appropriately hammed up and oh so campy, darling on the level of Kurtwood Smith in Robocop, Tim Curry in Rocky Horror, and Nick Cage in\u2026 well, anything. Also Pegasus J Crawford. Don Patch. And DIOOOOOOO BRANDO!\\n\\n\r\n\tPlot-wise, there\u2019s not a whole lot to say but EDGY ALERT! You might cut your eyes on this one. The action stills and reaction shots that look like high res concept art are cool, and so are the hyper-detailed death shots, but these are highlights in an otherwise pretty dreary anime full of unimaginative, banal action. Think about that trainwreck Koutetsujou no Kabaneri, and you\u2019ve got something close. It\u2019s almost as though Akame Ga Kill doesn\u2019t have an original thought in its entire body- as almost everything in it is lifted from some other anime. It\u2019s basically a collection of setpieces, character archetypes, weapons, and scenes that were all cool or good ideas in another show and just rammed together (more of that dumpster salad. Sprinkle a little toejam on it, some dirty socks, and some moldy food for flavor). Indeed, I find that Mirai Nikki is probably the closest comparison to Akame with its completely nonsensical, crazy plot and equally absurd cast of characters. You\u2019ve got the weirdo BDSM NiceGuy\u2122, siblings who are trying to murder each other, a very scary lady who is super ultra strong and she\u2019s in love with your MC, a gay dude, a gay scientist, an MC analogue who\u2019s there to try and make you feel empathy for the bad guys, Scar from FMA, women with eyepatches, including a girl with a boob eyepatch, beast girl (for those animal fetishes), and other campy, themed villains who usually come in trios or quartets. \\n\\n\r\n\tHowever, Akame prides itself on one thing, and one thing above all else: gratuitous bloody violence. Oh, and character deaths, like it\u2019s Game of Thrones or something, but I talked about that before. Yes, Akame loves its jelly blood slowmo closeups. There are more dismemberments than Ninja Scroll, and disembowelments, decapitations, dissections, bisections, vivisections, bootlicking, cutting, snaring, crushing, slashing, slicing, whippings, beatings (including a hilarious beatdown of the MC with a plastic recorder), shootings, stabbings, and shankings galore. Yeah, that was a lot of adjectives. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, gory, envelope pushing violence and grotesque imagery a story does not make. If you could rate quality in the amount of blood spilled, this would be an easy 10, but given the complete mess of tone from the first episode to the end, the punchless character deaths, and obsessive need to try and manipulate the audience into feeling something brings it down considerably. At least the last two episodes make up for it a little bit; they subverted my expectations almost entirely, and I was honestly rather satisfied by the ending, because it\u2019s not something you see in every shonen battle series. \\n\\n\r\nSo, tl;dr \\n\\n\r\nArt: Solid effort from White Fox, has some very pretty, high res stills and shots.\\n\r\nSound: Kira Vincent Davis. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say.\\n\r\nCharacters: Transplant half of Mirai Nikki\u2019s cast, a few from Blood+, and FMA, and you\u2019ve got Akame Ga Kill\\n\r\nStory: A lot of people die in bloody messes.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Much like Mirai Nikki before it, Akame is juuust far enough out there to be enjoyable if you turn your brain off and just go with the crazy.\\n\r\nNew Chromosomes: 7\\n",

            "content": "Akame ga kill Review\r\nStory\r\nThe story starts off with our hero Tatsumi. A country boy from a poor village who sets out with his two friends to join the capitals military so they can send back money to their poor village. While traveling to the capital they get attacked by a group of bandits and are separated. Tatsumi reaches the capital alone, but immediately gets scammed and is left homeless. But luckily a sweet young lady spots him and invites him to stay at her place for the night. But things quickly take a turn for the worst when a group of assassin\u2019s know as nightraid who possess special super weapons know as imperial arms or teigu attack. One of the members is the woman who scammed him and because she feels like she owes him saves him from dead and reveal that the noble young lady and her family are actually sadistic psychopaths. He sees one of his friends hanging dead from torture and the other one barely alive. He immediately kills the woman. And his other friend dies in his arms. Although this ending to episode 1 was done purely for shock value to make the viewers want to watch the next episode I didn\u2019t really mind that, but what happens afterwards I do mind. It\u2019s one of the shows major flaws. Transitioning between seriousness and comedy. Immediately after his friend dies in his arms he literally gets pulled by night raid and is forced to join them in a comedic fashion and were supposed to laugh. I don\u2019t know about you but when I\u2019m sad I\u2019m not in the mood to laugh. It\u2019s just common sense and it isn\u2019t done very well. If not for that moment this first episode could\u2019ve been a great start. \\n\r\nThe show relies heavily on shock value, blood and violence to keep the viewers interested which I don\u2019t mind I\u2019m all for mindless fun, but the problem I had with this one was that it takes itself way too serious. Which makes it hard to just enjoy. It tries really hard to emphasis the darkness off the capital. But it does it so much that you just want them to stop. We get it the capital is evil, there is no hope, there is no salvation everything is bad. The problem with the darkness of the capital is that the evil is just too black and white making the capital really shallow. And the way they show it isn\u2019t really done that well either most of the time it\u2019s just people getting killed. We don\u2019t really see the people suffering that much we don\u2019t really get to see how bad it is only that people die in horrible ways not saying that isn\u2019t bad, but it could be more than that. The show also doesn\u2019t really give you a valid reason to actually take it seriously. For example they skinn people alive. Behead them while begging for mercy to show that this show is dark and mature while it\u2019s only there to serve as shock value while not adding anything to the story. There really isn\u2019t any reason for it to be in there beyond that. (The manga is an even worse offender of that with rape clowns and kids getting there limps broken and raped by dogs. I seriously think there is something wrong with the writer). \\n\r\nAs most of you probably know there are a looooooot of deaths in this show. Which I really like because when everyone can die it makes every fight much more exciting. Although the last nigh raid dead felt really unnecessary. (it was just killing a character for the sake of killing a character). But It was actually done in a pretty good way. I just loved that no one had plot armor, but it also made it hard to care about characters since you knew that their probability of surviving the end of the show was basically 50-50.\\n\r\nNow to the part which most people even manga fans didn\u2019t like about this series was the last filler episodes starting from epi 20-24 (and well part of 19 if you want). Although I\u2019d say that epi 20 and 21 weren\u2019t anything really special I did think it was very much in the style of akame ga kill and the episodes themselves weren\u2019t that bad at all. The episodes 22-24 were actually the best episodes of the whole series. I was a bit skeptical at episode 22 because the series didn\u2019t really have a clear indication as to where it was going with its final, but it actually did it in a very good and surprisingly akame ga kill way.\\n\r\nThe reason I think the filler episodes were the best episodes of the entire show was because I think\\n\r\nthe director actually knew more about what akame ga kill was then the actual mangaka. Just simple bloody fun. It be better if the series itself knew that. If it actually wanted to be something more it could done something with maybe the clich\u00e9 of evil fighting evil. Now onto the reason why I think most people hated the ending was (minor spoiler) that almost everyone died. But let\u2019s be honest here did you really think akame ga kill was going to end with everyone living happily ever after? I\u2019m pretty sure the manga is going to end very similarly. One more thing I want to mention is the suspension of disbelieve. In anime there are a lot of things you just need to accept, like there being teenage boys saving the world, there being magic and mystical creatures. But when we have someone with a gun in there fucking mouth it raises so many questions for example how does that person eat, how the fuck can she even breath and how do you even reload etc. and then we also have the gun hand in case someone conveniently slices of your arms just at the right spot so you can use the guns installed in your arms. There is even more they added to this character but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe main cast consist of the night raid members, the jaegers and honest (just a one dimensional douchebag don\u2019t really need to know anything more about him). The night raid members are also all pretty one dimensional. They all have one unique trait like drinking, loving meat, being clumsy at everything etc. and there isn\u2019t much more to them. They all have a \u2018\u2019sad\u2019\u2019 backstory, but the backstory\u2019s are really rushed and feel more like an insincere summary of why they will keep on fighting no matter what. Backstory\u2019s are supposed to make sympathize with the characters and are supposed to give the character some more depth to them, but here they are just a quick summary and it just feels like it\u2019s kind of there without adding anything. It\u2019s portrayed in a way that shows they put no effort into it and that\u2019s a real shame because when people keep dying one after another (And they will) you just don\u2019t care. The only 2 characters who get a bit of development are Mine and Tatsumi. The good thing I can say about Tatsumi is that he\u2019s an above average shounen hero since unlike other shounen protagonist he isn\u2019t as na\u00efve. Like for example he won\u2019t just say that he\u2019ll protect the girls of night raid just because they\u2019re girls and can\u2019t protect themselves, he believes in them and the consequences of him believing in them are shown (not in an attack on titan bad way). The villains are all pretty one dimension psychopath who have no redeemable traits. The only noteworthy villains are the jeagers. The group meant to hunt down nightraid. Unlike the other villains they actually have a layer of depth to them and are actually more likeable than night raid. I\u2019d like to go more in-depth into the Jeagers since they are easily the most likeable characters in this show, but this review is already pretty long, so I\u2019ll just wrap this section up. What I did like about the characters is that in the end whether they were good or bad when they died they stayed true to their convictions.  Now what I don\u2019t necessarily considered a flaw, but think could\u2019ve given the characters especially the one from night raid a little depth is if they made the brutal killings actually effect the characters and give them some moral choices and make them actually change the characters instead of the mindless blood spilling.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe animation was done by studio white fox who have also done the animation for steins gate and the devil is a part-timer and for most part the animation was consistently good, but nothing really impressive. The battle scene\u2019s weren\u2019t always that well animated and it has this annoying thing that I\u2019m just going to call still frame where they stop the animation and make it look real? It was really out of place and annoying and it happened in (Almost) every episode. The last episodes is probably where they spend most of their budget because those episodes where really well animated the battles looked very smooth and overall it was just really well done.The show is really bloody with a lot of gore so I\u2019m at least glad they did the censoring to a minimum.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nthe ost wasn\u2019t anything noteworthy, I don\u2019t even remember some of the songs actually being used, but The ones that I did remember weren\u2019t bad but they weren\u2019t good either they were just okay. The two opening both fit the show really well and I don\u2019t really have anything else to say about them.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment\\n\r\nIn the end what it all comes down to is did I enjoy this anime? And the answer to that is surprisingly yes. The show was fun. Sure it had a lot of issues and the show took itself way to seriously, but I did enjoy watching it. It wasn\u2019t anything amazing or something I haven\u2019t seen before, but it was just some mindless bloody fun. \\n\r\nIf you\u2019re wondering why even though this series isn\u2019t that good especially critically it\u2019s pretty popular it\u2019s probably because it looks like a mature shounen where everyone can be killed. But for me it\u2019s more so because it reminded me of a similar story that I wanted to write in the past.\\n\\n\r\nThe score \\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nAnimation: 5\\n\r\nsound: 5\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nWith the final score being a 5,2 meaning average and me recommending you to not watch it unless you want to watch a show with a lot of deaths and blood.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked this show and you want to watch something similar I\u2019d recommend attack on titan and Tokyo Ghoul. They are both bloody series and actually more mature shounen. Although the Tokyo ghoul anime is pretty rushed.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who\u2019ve not seen it it\u2019s available on crunchyroll and if you really liked it and want to own the physical copy sentai filmworks has liscensed it so it will be available sometime in the future.",

            "content": "Takes the cake for the best anime I have ever seen. The art and action were one thing, but the main reason this was such a good show was because it was actually thought-provoking. The perfection of the inevitable death for the cause of good was highlighted at many points throughout the show. SPOILER: Many people didn't enjoy the death of most of the main characters by the end, but I think the ending helped cement this show's message - death will always happen in the struggle for good. It hurts to think of how all the show's characters - people with a genuine willfor doing good - die without any recognition of their efforts to the public. Seeing Akame walk off into the distance, doing even more good for the kingdom she worked so hard to build, lightens the tragedy you feel beginning in episode 1, but it is not enough to console your thoughts. Why couldn't everyone had stayed alive? Why couldn't we have made the bad guys - some of them people with good hearts - see reason and prevent bloodshed? END SPOILER: This story was the definition of bittersweet, although it did leave an empty feeling which makes it lean towards the bitter side of things. So many questions are left to be answered by the end of the series. To sum this show up in two words - tragic nostalgia. It's impossible to do the show justice with words - you have to see it to feel it.",

            "content": "Well note to everyone, just started to write written reviews on anime series, so this is the second time I do so. Now a note, this is basically my personal opinion on the manner about the anime series. I understand some people despise the show, some likes it. But to me, its kind of simple to explain in a term. \"I enjoyed it, but it doesn't actually mean that it's a great anime show.\"\r\nAkame ga Kill or let's say Red-Eye Killer is an anime made in 2014 of Summer and ended in the fall season. Now, does it go to the hype? well technically noit doesn't live to the expectations I was actually hoping for. But can it be watched? it depends on the person's view of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's get into the scores.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I don't find the story that bad neither that good either. It had its iffs and goes but its main problem would be its execution with the story along with a lack of explanation of the weapons. If they could have taken the time to at least back in the day when it was first made to actually add some information or more regarding on the power of the Imperial Arms and knowing more about it, it would be considered decent. Another problem with the show would be the comedy so to speak in the anime, as comedy is subjective, sometimes some of the comedy tends to tick me off and ask \"what the flip is going on?\" and sometimes I can tend to giggle. But some of its comedy could destroy a moment. But I've seen worse. Lastly its the rushed pacing. Yeah, my personal opinion is just that the last couple of episodes felt very rushed, its ending was alright but then again it doesn't take away the fact that the show was just average to begin with. It had a good premise but then it just went down below for me to give it a five at least.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can agree the animation doesn't look that great, the very least personally I find it decent. Not that out standing or shining bright type of animation like other shows who have made very marvelous jobs with the animation, but its not that ground breaking either. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNow personally I just find the sound half lose during the show at times, and half the time the soundtrack can be heard throughout some cases in each scenario. However my personal thought its just average soundtrack as it doesn't go and brightly shine up around the show. As for the Openings and Endings Songs since it had 24 episodes, I like the second Opening rather than its first Opening and I find the First Ending for me than the Second Ending.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Voice Acting I really don't have complains about the voice acting. Each voice fits for its characters so its not that much to say about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this would sound stupid, why a 5/10 instead of higher or lower? Well to clarify firstly, the characters for me needed development, there was way too lacking of development of these characters however, for some odd reasons I find some of its characters quite funny or those that I actually like throughout the show. Just basically some, not the whole cast. So to answer my question. I can't give it higher because they needed some character development and I can't give them lower because I find some of its characters quite entertaining at times when I watched the episodes. They're nothing special around but I just find them quite entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile it does have its train wreck, I find some of its comedy, the fights and some bits of its character moments quite entertaining and quite funny saying this. But hey, the show would be entertaining but it doesn't make it a good show personally.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 5.4/10\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch it? well its a hit or a miss in the anime series. It just depends on how you look at it. If you want to watch it, go right on ahead.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime was a killer, I what meant by it is up to your imagination, so without further adieu, I'n gonna make my review of this 24 episode anime,pls be informed that my review is only for this anime and  tbh I have yet to go with the manga.\r\nStory\r\nThe story was basically one of your run of the mill freedom fighters who were out to dispenses justice from a corrupt government plot, when it has that dark element where blood an gore are present. It also has the usual harem, comedy, action element that one would find in any anime/manga with such content, itreally doesn't differ at all in a general context, in fact in can be compared to any  equipment where the parts are the same only how they're arrange is different. On the lighter side how the plot has played use where we expect such arc where it would be a Tatsumi X Akame arc turns out as not to what we expected and seeing as to how the climax has add some level of excitement, I would give the story a 6.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe setting suggest that it is during the post renaissance, but the character's wardrobe are more like a combination from the 50's, 60's and some rather unusual attire like Leone who dresses like a stripper / whore, Mine who dons something that makes her look like a granny, Shelee who looks like a Chinese whore and of course there is Akame, Chesea, Esdeath and Kurume who were the usual eye candies, frankly as much I would love to give this part a high score, I'm just gonna go with number 5 as in mediocre since the 4 were just the run of the mill eye candies.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nOk, I like the opening, I like the VA who did Akame's voice and so as Esdeath's voice as well. In fact I like the VA's who did most of the female cast voices, so it's 7 for the sound. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis may sound weird, but I'm actually rooting for the antagonist rather than the  protagonist of this anime, in fact whenever I watch this anime I always find enjoyable seeing how each of the members of the \"Night Raid\" die one by one, then again seeing them antagonist die horribly also did provide me with some amusement. Frankly, if there is any antagonist that I like best, it would be Esdeath, co'z she is good combination of being a nice bad woman, that one would like, in fact this is one anime where one would like an antagonist like those Jagers rather than the protagonist like the \"Night Raid\". Now on Akame, she is pretty much the kind of protagonist that I love to hate, though, she with the good guys I was kinda hoping that she dies in the hands of Esdeath but unfortunately that didn't happen, but then again I like the way that Esdeath has deny her of having Tatsumi's body. Tatsumi, on the other hand, eeeeeeewwwww, he is another character I love to hate due to his stupidity, if Wave would take him on, I would be rooting for Wave. There is also Leone.....now having to take 5 shots in her abdomen and still give the fat guy a deadly blow was just too damned stupid, if it were me I would have had her strangle the fat guy to death while she bleeds out, such move would have been good instead of her being able to walk around and die like a dog , frankly her dead was just simply too stupid to say the least, so for this part, I would give it a 7 since 2 of the Jagers were still alive while \"Night Raid\" is only left with one and the leader, Najenda doesn't count.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 7, since seeing how the member of the Night Raid dies was for me very enjoyable, and I will say no more...so sue me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving a 5 for the following reason:\\n\\n\r\n-It follows the usual run of the mill plot where a small band of people fighting for injustice.\\n\\n\r\n-It maintains a usual double standard where the main character has some form of exception and I'm referring to Akame's katana, where it is implied that even the welder can die if he/she cuts him/herself or at least that's what should happen to Akame when she cuts herself to let out her trump card, but no, she lives and continues fighting on Esdeath.\\n\\n\r\n-Where the title of the anime/ manga, as usual, doesn't corresponds to what the anime/ manga is. Let's not forget that this anime's title is \"Akame ga kill\" when translated will mean \"Akame Slashes,\" in fact, if this would be the anime's title then Akame should be the only protagonist in this anime, where the plot should her doing a one girl fight against the evil rulers of the capital. Frankly, writer Takahiro, should have just use the groups name \" The Night Raid\" as the title for his works instead of the latter that makes him or her look stupid.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Going back to before Akame ga Kill premiered, where I was looking at the synopsis and trailer, my thoughts were: fun, crazy fights, action, ultra violence bordering on grindhouse and a wide, diverse cast in a simple and timeless story to bridge everything together. It was the classic band of rebels against an evil empire scenario, which despite being so played out, offers so many possibilities.\r\nHaving just finished Akame ga Kill, I'm in a rare mood to review it because of how I felt after watching all 24 episodes. This is not a good thing, by the way, as my feelings of emptiness and apathyregarding the series were replaced by annoyance when I saw how totally hollow and unmoving the finale ended up being. Maybe it was wishful thinking, but I was hoping they'd go out with a bang and salvage something for a climax. After all, most mindless action shows usually hit their peak by taking us on a fun roller-coaster of destruction, while spawning mayhem and violence in these sort of anime to paper over the cracks. Unfortunately, this anime went out with a whimper.\\n\\n\r\nWhat went wrong? How could a show that looked so appealing in the lead-up leave me that flat?\\n\\n\r\nIt can be argued from so many points, but everything always tracks back to one thing: death had no gravitas. I'm trying my best to avoid spoilers but it is a key problem. Normally I praise fictional pieces that employ a 'nobody is safe' rule because it can add unpredictability and, when executed right, it establishes the stakes and the 'war is hell' feeling. This show gave us death by the bucketloads, but there was no consequence because, in the end, the death was made to feel inconsequential. After brief references, they just devoted so much time to the dumb humour, goofy moments and fanservice that we never really processed the feels the deaths should've caused. Characters dying should leave you feeling like you've just been punched in the gut and not laughing wondering 'who's next?'. Death became a sideshow to the series, showing just how bad the writers failed with giving us characters we can invest in.\\n\\n\r\nSo how can I sum up the characters in one way? Akame ga Kill didn't make characters at all. They made caricatures with as much depth as a cardboard cutout. This is just an endless cycle until the end. We'll get a moment where a character has to feel and take something away from it, but it's like the writer\u2019s room put down a rule and said \"No character progression\" to keep them as stagnant as possible. This is made painfully worse by a prominent antagonist called Seryuu. Seryuu cries for justice so much that you'll be having night terrors listening to her talk about it as she talks about it nonstop every scene she's in, even when there's no point in it. The other characters are thankfully nowhere near as cringingly bad, but I believe I am being very generous if I describe them as window dressing.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the main protagonists is two-fold. Firstly, despite being the title character, Akame constantly felt like a side character in her own series. Focus is almost never on her and she's just around. This leads us to the shows\u2019s main character: Tatsumi. First of all, the character design just irks me and I'm convinced Tatsumi stole his clothes from Carlton Banks, except he has none of the swag to pull off that sweater. Tatsumi just never clicks as he's always a naive, small town, wide eyed kid who never learns anything throughout the series. He remains dumb as a doornail as he was from the start and never takes anything from his mistakes. For a character that was supposed to be our entry point into the world of Night Raid, the rebel group that's fighting the empire, I think by the end of it we'll have learned more about everything that Tatsumi never did. He is that dumb and not in a good way. Most shounen series seem to have this moment where a protagonist has an epiphany where everything clicks for them and they fulfil some sort of potential, but to Tatsumi those moments are contained in his hands as if they're water and they slip by him so easily, which is a shame and the series as a whole suffers greatly for it.\\n\\n\r\nNow that my gripes with the characters are out of the way, where did these horrible characterisations leave the story? Quite frankly, it was a mess. Every episode was a detour saddled with the excessive abovementioned dumb humour, goofy moments, and fanservice. However once again, if you're not invested with the story's main players, it's hard to accept it as banter by comrades to divert from the horrors of war. Not even the excessive gore and violence gave the story a semblance of gravitas. It felt more gratuitous and shoved down our throats without a context rather than to add weight or darkness to the story setting.\\n\\n\r\nThat in turn went hand in hand with how the story unfolded. Halfway in, as the exposition and world building was done, it became so frantic that it felt like the writers were just throwing idea's at the wall, seeing what they could get to stick. It became a mess with too many moving pieces and not enough attention on these pieces leading to some terrible jarring story shifts that lead me to feel, at the time, that I'd missed half an episode or so. The twists seemed to be there just to add even more shock value at every chance. Eventually it creates the same sense of fatigue and apathy that the death caused for me. I just didn't care and the way everything progressed slowly eroded the quality that much more, as it went from an underperforming show with a decent concept to a show that was constantly missing the mark by a large margin week in and week out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, how does one sum up Akame ga Kill? The animation and action were good, the designs were fairly generic but serviceable (save for Tatsumi's horrible sweater), and the fanservice seemed like it was catered to 15yr old boys who obsess over boobs more than Beavis and Butthead used to, we were reminded of it every possible moment. There was a story, but the writers clearly had no intention of sticking to it and chose the prior mentioned fanservice, T&A and pervy humor over actually progressing the story and characters in a logical way. Oh wait, they did try balancing both light and funny and serious, it just didn't work and gave the illusion that they neglected it because their concept of storytelling was so bad.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, I guess it could've been good, but now we'll never know. Going through the entire series and dissecting it to this extent shows how bad it truly was and it could be a thesis in its own regard, but I'm sure there's enough hard working, dedicated bloggers that will save me the stress of watching it again.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it may seem excessively harsh, 4 is a fair score to me. It was a lot worse, but I can't fault the animation team despite the uninspired designs. The backdrops and settings used were also top notch, which actually bumped my score up (sometimes you can just pause and take in and appreciate the effort and detail they put in building this world). What a waste of animation talent it was, being focused on 24 episodes of this anime.",

There are a lot more characters and it hasn't ended yet.\r\nThe show was good. They didn't make you feel like the story was one-sided like most animes. It wasn't the heroes it wasn't the villains.

But other that that i think it was a good watch.\\n\\n\r\nNothing too special. But it was a nice watch.\\n\r\nI recommend to watch it if you didn't.

            "content": "I don't know where to begin with Akame ga Kill. I just watched it very recently over the course of two days, and honestly it's probably one of the worst series that I've watched in recent years.\r\nThe premise sounds like the typical, dime a dozen, Fantasy series where the Empire is corrupt and people are suffering, and there's going to be a revolution. The special weapons they use in the series, Imperial Arms, are kind of neat in concept. However there are a lot of them which are majorly overpowered to the point where it's really stupid to watch. Such as a sword that canliterally kill anyone with so much as a scratch, or using ice powers to practically go unopposed throughout the entire series and able to take on hundreds of thousands of people with no effort at all.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art style, I acknowledge that the series does have really good quality, however I think Sword Art Online is a good example that a pretty picture doesn't equal a good show.\\n\\n\r\nSound is meh, nothing that stands out or is memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is where I find things go down hill even further. It's the typical thing where the main character is a complete naive airhead that doesn't know what he's doing, and about all of the female cast wants his D. Then there's the title character Akame who's a cliche Kuudere, where she acts all cool and unemotional, however acts super sweet at random. The rest of the cast also consists of overused cliches, such as the pervert character, walking sex goddess characters whom wear practically nothing, as well as the gay guy who acts really weird. The thing that really annoys me about the characters and their personalities is the series isn't original at all. If you see a character personality in the series, most of them will repeat about 2-3 times for other characters, which really takes away at the originality of the series. Also the bad guys are so painfully bad to watch in this series. Practically all of them are the same as in going ape shit crazy, or mercilessly killing innocent people just to try to get shock value out of the audience to justify their death, a big problem with this is they repeat this with almost every bad guy. Not to mention the big bad guy of the series, the Minister, is an extremely cliche villain, him being completely greedy and overly fat, showing him eating like a fat pig all the time, as a lazy attempt to make the audience hate the guy, instead of making people hate him naturally.\\n\\n\r\nI am not kidding when I say this is one of the worst anime series that I've watched in recent years. There is so much more I could, and would like to say however that would go into spoilers. Only thing I can say is as of episode 23, the second to last episode, my rating was two points higher; the last episode was so bad in my opinion that my ranking of it dropped two whole points.\\n\\n\r\nI don't recommend this show to anyone, or at the very least I don't recommend watching it more than once cause there is nothing of value here.",

            "content": "Pushing the edge of violent carnage is not something we get to see very often in anything these days, and for good reason. They are criticized as a mishandled and cheap way to distract us from the inconsistencies in the writing and characters. The only problem with that argument is that, these days, animation studios edit any sort of blood on most action anime to appease for higher BD sales. Now, when you have an anime like Akame ga Kill to do away with that, it is a refreshing mix into the blender; even if the overall taste may be a bit lukewarm.\r\nI love myaction shows to take more chances with the violence rather than the usual Hollywood-esque tricks that try to make everything clean so it can get a passable age rating. There is none of that to be found in Akame ga Kill, and I\u2019m very happy to see something like it to exist. This also helps from the fact that the art and animation is rock solid and colorful. Character models all feel vibrant and unique based on their appearance rather than all of them looking like the same bland boy or girl in armor. Fighting scenes are handled with greater tenacity and wit than what you typically see in many shonen shows.\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned how the characters are unique and great based on their aesthetic looks, the same can\u2019t really be said with their personality or memorability, for the most part. The characters that possessed any of these qualities are Leonne and Esdeath, simply by the fact that they at least have an alluring presence that\u2019s both charming from Leonne and deviant from Esdeath. The rest fall into the pit-trap of being stereotypical just for the sake of being stereotypical. Not to say stereotypes are bad in general, they\u2019ll always be a staple that we get used to. Nevertheless, nothing was added to the experience negatively quite like the stereotypical presentation.\\n\\n\r\nAn issue like this could easily be forgiven if they are given enough material for us to see past it. Most of it is just pointless filler that feel tacked on or they\u2019re just decent character arcs that give off some laughs for me. However, there are some characters that seemed to have supposed to give an important role in the story but they are just killed off in like one or two episodes before we can even start to get to know them. This, in turn, makes the death scenes lack any sort of empathy for the sadness that the main protagonist, Tatsumi, goes through. As gruesome as some of the deaths are, they don\u2019t add to the melancholic nature at all. Which is a huge flaw in its part because the story is centered around our characters and their arcs that don\u2019t really amount to anything in the end.\\n\\n\r\nNotably, this anime decides to deviate from the story by actually killing off certain characters that weren\u2019t supposed to die in the manga. A large number of fans will write off the show as a negative, but that is not a sufficient way of critiquing it. An adaptation will always do changes to the story to make it more unique than just a point by point adaptation. If it didn\u2019t, you\u2019d be better off just reading the manga at that point. In regards to the context of the anime, the changes at least didn\u2019t seem out of place in terms of pacing, which is often the case for many poor adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with its characters, the story that goes with them details the various aspects of their journey as Tatsumi joins a group of assassins, called Night Raid, that seek to stop the corruption that plagues their country. What is strange about how the story is presented is how it doesn\u2019t always seems to be there half the time. When you think about it, all the story is is Tatsumi going through Scenario A, Scenario B, and so on. None are really connected very well and you almost forget about what the underlying nature of the Night Raid\u2019s main goal after the halfway point. They don\u2019t make them as poignant gears to the narrative system that keeps the story focused.\\n\\n\r\nSo it can be made a case that, narratively, the show falls short on that level. That can\u2019t be said with the action though. With all that\u2019s said and done, Akame ga Kill\u2019s main reason for even existing is to show bloody carnage into its action set piece. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m suddenly going to throw all the narrative problems out the window and give this an A or 9, but for what it\u2019s worth, the action is quite enjoyable to watch. Its fast-paced and is very easy on the eyes, thanks to the art and animation. Although it isn\u2019t going to break any molds in how strategic our characters fight one another, its nice eye candy to make any shounen fan\u2019s hairs stand up.\\n\\n\r\nBy and large, Akame ga Kill is the prototypical junk food anime, nobody can deny it. It has all the makings of how we all watched the colorful action animated shows we watched as kids, just not with all the horrific violence. It definitely does do justice with dark humor between the characters and various actions that take place. Other than that, its not offensively bad on any measure. What little plot or character growth there is to be had in Akame ga Kill, there\u2019s at least one charming moment within every loose end that makes you pay no mind to it, only by an inch.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-\\n",

            "content": "(SPOILERS mates look out) SPOILERS!!! HEY SPOILERS AHEAD MAN! DO NOT CONTINUE!! Don't read the next sentence... you little rebel, I like you. v v\r\nI was really disappointed with Akame Ga Kill for many reasons. Especially in the characters department. The biggest thing that made me hate this show was the characters and how the director and creator killed all but \"Akame\" off. I cannot say it was too much of a bad thing. However due to the lack of most of the characters growth, development, and backstory I wasn't really able to get too attached to them. Not to mention that I didn't getto learning anything about the main secondary characters until they were about to die... I have no idea if the directors thought this would be a good idea but I can tell you it was not. I seriously thought that because the show focused a lot on Tatsumi that you know, he would live and get stronger etc. But... you guessed it, he dies. For a show to focus so much on Tatsumi, all of his struggles, watching his team die and then to kill him off it was like a huge \"F--- you viewers\" to my face. I really felt like the members of Night raid died for no good... well yeah, no good cause. I personally felt like Najenda just used them all, which was a real pity. The story feels like your typical shounen anime so you can expect to see Tatsumi be the one who wants to make everything right, be the best, avenge those who have fallen, protect those he loves, you know that type of generic shounen adventure type. The one thing I give it major respect points for is the fight scenes. I'll be damned if anyone could say anything bad about the fights and action during Akame ga kill, like I did feel some of the scenes were a bit unnecessary.. no \"overkill\" (get it?) like the characters being beheaded, excessive gore etc. because I personally felt like it wasn't needed to make most of the fights great, or necessary to try and  improve the story. The BGM or soundtrack is amazing, it's perfect! by far one of my top 10 of favorite OST'. The music works perfectly with a majority of the settings and fight scenes and while you're watching you may also notice it too! Perhaps my biggest enjoyment overall was just seeing the fight scenes because the story and plot itself wasn't anything to get me too excited. 5/10 Akame ga kill really could have been better than what it turned out to be.",

            "content": "My personal enjoyment of this series was swayed by the fact that I had read the manga a few years prior to watching the anime. So yes, I am a \"manga-reader\" as many people call us. And to be honest, I did expect quite a bit from this anime. Did it live up to my expectations? No (Well, if you couldn't tell that from the score, then you've got some problems already, dude). But does it live up to the hype? Read on, and you might find out. I won't keep you too long- I'll just have some short summaries to help you make yourdecision.\\n\\n\r\nStory- Nothing too overcomplicated or exquisitely written (yes, you do write a story before you make an anime). It's your average Shounen anime. With a bit of a twist. However, at a certain point in the story, the pacing just goes out of wack. There is a reason for this, and if you're interested, research it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Passable. Nothing too fancy.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Has it's moments, but for the most part, forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Some interesting ones, some mediocre, and some just plain cringeworthy. The character development is classic Shounen, too, if you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This is largely dependent on what your taste in anime is. If you like a rollercoaster ride with ups and downs and are a fan of classic Shounen anime, chances are, you'll probably enjoy it. If you are a fan of more intellectual anime, it won't be your cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Did I like Akame ga Kill? No. But that doesn't mean you won't. Give it a shot. If you don't like it, try again. If you still can't stand it, there's been no harm done in watching it, and there's no harm in dropping it.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, it'll help you solidify what you like and dislike. Anime is a journey, and the best part is that you decide where to go :)\\n\\n\r\nYes, I had to do that.",

            "content": "to the people out there reading negative reviews, not all of them are wrong, this is a pretty cliche anime when it comes down to the details, and the storyline goes along with a lot of common motifs for hero gets stronger as he progresses and all the women around him all in love with him due to his virtuous spirit. yes it does encompass those but you cant help but fall in love with the series. i decided to start watching this a couple days ago because the series ended and i am a huge binge watcher so i thought i would give ita try because i wasnt sure what step to take next but i am really glad i did because this story touched me. not only was it entertaining but it moved me even after it was over. im not saying this is the best anime out there or that it is a horrible anime either, i think its just an absolutely amazing story that you should give a try if you are interested in the genre or even if the title caught your attention. id say if a second season came out i would definitely watch it because i absolutely loved this anime. people say the anime is not true to the manga because the manga is not yet finished and that they should have made it more like the manga; i personally think the producers did a fine job making it end the way it did. this was one hell of a watch that i enjoyed from start to finish because it was splendidly told from start to finish and the art was great the characters were lovable and tragic at the same time showing how quickly things can change. but if you want to kill time and be entertained nicely with some battles and anarchy then this anime is definitely the way to go.\\n\\n\r\nthis was my first review ive done but since i finished it not long ago i felt the need to give a voice to how just this anime is because i loved it",

            "content": "I've been looking at some of the other reviews who rated it 3 or 4; however I found it absolutely outstanding. \r\nThe plot isn't anything out of the box, but it had a very steady pace and wasn't bad in any way. They explain things in the beginning without bogging the show down, and later on they speed things up with new characters and more complicated twists. \r\nIt's also a very realistic anime. People die. It's not a surprise in real life, especially if the main group are assassins, but for some reason most anime's just make people not die by creating these impossible situations.But with Akame ga Kill, it's different. Once you're dead, you're dead. I know some shounen animes where, when someone dies, I don't feel sad - not because I'm not attached to the character, but because I'm just so confused. I just kind of assume that they come back somehow because everyone always manages to come back to life one way or another. By the time I realize that no, they're actually dead, it's kind of more of a shock than sadness. \\n\\n\r\nI also really liked the art. The fight scenes were amazing and I love how they show the intensity of their emotions. It felt very raw and very real. Each character had some unique physical quality. Lots of times in animes, I get confused with the names or even faces because they can look so similar. But Akame ga Kill had some really epic designs. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good - I feel the Japanese voice actors fit the characters (not to mention Lubbock was voiced by Kirito's actor ^^) and not to mention the opening and ending songs were some of the best I have ever heard. \\n\\n\r\nThe first opening was just straight out awesomeness. It's catchy and rock. The second was even better. It had a more bitter sounding quality to it, and showed the sorrow of the anime while still maintaining the really cool action part. The ending songs were the polar opposite compared to the intros because they were more slow-paced and sad, but that was what made them amazing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters. I have quite a bit to say about this. Lots of people were mentioning that Akame should have been the main character because her name was in the title, but I disagree. Tatsumi has obviously been the main character. Akame may have been a secondary, but she had no more screen time than any of the other Night Raid members. The entire plot was focused around Tatsumi, and it was mostly in his perspective. Just because a character has their name in the title does not mean they are the main character. The protagonist is the person the story follows after. That's Tatsumi. Akame is the climax. She's the most important person, but that doesn't mean she's the main character. She defines the anime. But Tatsumi is the main character. They are two different things. This is why I understand why Akame is in the title but the point of view is from Tatsumi. \\n\\n\r\nAs a generalization, I really liked all of the characters. They all had their own individual quality about them and what I really love about the anime is that they also show the antagonistic side. Later on, when you are introduced to the Jaegers (who are the enemies of Night Raid), you aren't like, oh, they're a villain, I hate them all. The story writers show their side, so you know why they are in the Jaegers and not the Night Raid. You understand them and you sympathize with them and you cry as much as you would cry when a Night Raid character when they die. There was this one time where one person person from Jaegers was fighting one person from Night Raid, and I didn't know who to root for because I loved both of them. The one thing I dislike is how they don't develop the characters enough. When the first person died, I didn't really feel anything except some sorrow because I didn't know him/her (no spoilers :D) that well. Especially Lubbock; that frustrated me. I didn't care especially for him because the anime didn't show his personality too much. But later on, they give him maybe ten minutes to show his badassery, and that was when I realized how amazing he actually was. But they should have done that from the beginning. What they do is they give them their background story and kill them off, but they don't actually show them with their own personality much. That was the only thing I disliked about the development of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSome people say that the corrupted greedy villains in which Night Raid assassinated were too unrealistic, and that they were all sadistic and inhumane.  But those people weren't the point. All of those evil people - they didn't matter. They were just there to show to the audience why Night Raid is right and the capitol is wrong. What matters is the emperor, a little boy being manipulated by the prime minister (who is also important), the Jaegers, and Seryu. Those are the real antagonists. And I feel they portrayed those key people very well. I already explained how the Jaegers were relate-able. And Seryu is part of the Jaegers, but she's honestly a whole other category, because she's worse than the prime minister and the side-villains combined because of her wrong sense of justice and the lust to kill. The emperor is naive. We can understand why the capitol is why it is. And the prime minister is really the only true villain, who is clever but at the same time absolutely powerless. They elaborated on those points very well, and I think that's all that matters. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters themselves. Tatsumi irked me sometimes because he was just so happy-go-lucky in the grimiest situations, but he was a pretty okay protagonist. Akame is the blunt, awkwardly social person that is able to erase her emotions when the time comes to kill. Bulat is the awesome gay dude who is basically the older brother who you idolize because they're so strong but happy at the same time. Chelsea is the older sister that annoys everyone on purpose and loves to prank people. Leone is the bold and fierce and the carefree. Lubbock is the perverted but also somehow knows compassion and can get serious when it comes to fighting. Mine is the sensitive girl that insults people to hide her embarrassment, the kind of person that names her destructive Imperial Arms 'Pumpkin'. Najenda is the chill and the cool. Sheele is the quiet, shy, mostly talent-less, and clumsy. Susanoo is a dedicated and loyal friend who corrects your moral mistakes, not to mention he is a weird housewife with OCD. Bols is the creepy-looking but really sweet nice guy. Esdeath is a psychopath who loves owning people, things, and lust. Kurome is Akame, but more ruthless. Run is logical and calm. Seryu is the devil. Dr. Stylish is the creepy mad scientist with weird fetishes. And Wave is basically a really annoyingly naive Tatsumi. \\n\\n\r\nI spent a lot of time on the characters. But they deserve it because I needed to clear up some misconceptions. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing - some people disliked the humor. But I loved it. Akame ga Kill is not a dead serious anime. Yes, people die, and yes, it's sad, and yes, it's gory. But the humor is also dark and there are some dry humor as well. These people are literally assassins who have seen the deaths of their loved ones, living in a corrupted world, yet they can still laugh and joke around. If you're going to watch this show, you need to start watching with the fact that the humor isn't forced and unnecessary after a sad part - it's to lighten up a death because that's just what they do. They make you cry then make you laugh then make you feel bad about laughing. You may find it inhuman to be able to joke after witnessing so many deaths, but if they can't find happiness in the little things, how can they live with themselves? Because that's how they live. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the negative reviews I really loved this anime. It's one of my favorites because of the characters, the action, and the humor. I would definitely recommend. I know, that if I haven't seen this before and I saw all the negative reviews, I would probably not watch it. But this is me countering all of those and saying you should watch it, because you should experience it for yourself, and decide yourself whether or not it's good.",

            "content": "First review. I'm sure the english translation of Akame ga Kill is \"lets kill everyone except akame\".\r\nAnyways the first episode seemed very promising to me you get this guy Tatsumi who's looking for a job in the empire to save his village however things went disastrous for him and he was recruited by Night Raid. \r\nEpisode 6 I believe was when Night Raid lost their first member. I'd understand if it were only a member or two that were killed because they're in a war however never have I been wrong! Everyone was killed for no good reason.\r\nThe last episode of the series was arguablythe worst episode in the entire show.\\n\r\n1) The series basically told us that Akame was the main character apparently, what kind of main character gets less screen time than a \"supporting character\" Tatsumi?\\n\r\n2) Leona let's the Minister kill her when she could have killed him already, seriously she lets him shoot her multiple times.\\n\r\n3)NAJENDA IS THE MOST USELESS CHARACTER I'VE SEEN! She was supposedly the strongest member in the group as it was depicted in the first episode. she hasn't done shit throughout the entire show maybe except recruiting 2 new members.\\n\r\n4)Apparently Akame gets a new power which was never MENTIONED before, she could have used it before when her life was threatened like someone against Ogre. \\n\r\nAnyways I gave this series a 6/10",

            "content": "\"Everyone has their reason to fight\"\r\nAkame Ga Kill. Akame Ga Kill. After I finished watching it and had already moved on, I realized that it was THE anime of the season. Maybe not because it was good but because it was talked about because everyone had their own opinions.\r\nSTORY: 6\r\nThe story starts off setting the tone with deaths everywhere but that is to be expected with this anime. It then goes on to have this kid to join a group of assassins out to set the world straight. Strangely the story is told from Tatsumi's point of view even though the title of the animeis Akame ga Kill. If you read the manga don't expect this to be the same. As someone who has only watched the anime I found it unreasonable that the show decides to near the end [SPOILERS]\\n\r\nkill off everyone. Some were killed because they were ganged up upon and some simply because their skill set could not win versus their opponents but at the end people just started dying. They just. Did. There also was a small romance thing that i'm not going to talk about because it only lasted a few episodes before the \"great flood\" came and wiped everyone out.\\n\\n\r\nART: 7\\n\r\nThe art wasn't bad. It was actually \"good\". When watched in HD you could see how much work they put into the art with the blood sprays everywhere and the character sweats. The characters were designed to fit their personalities which was actually a really good job by the studio. The backgrounds and settings were well drawn as well. Not breathtaking or anything but definitely not bad. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nThe voice actors are sooooo goood. There are a couple of scenes where Tatsumi and Bullat just make you clench your fists and scream with them too. Anime usually don't elicit physical reactions from me but the sound and everything really just gets you into it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6\\n\r\nI hate to say this but everytime a character in this anime has a flashback...they're about to die. The anime tries to give you a quick deep throat of character development and try to give you feels for a character before they kill them off. The romance part of this (there was a romance aspect?) was rushed, the characters are all rushed but the one thing I do have to give them credit for was that they actually had a huge cast of characters and near the end the evil side (There was two seperate groups in the anime basically a \"good\" and a \"bad\" side) had almost as much development as the good side. I found the \"bad guys\" to be more intresting than the good guys because they had alot of things that made you reconsider whether or not they were truly bad guys. One of the bad guy had a beautiful wife and child and that was one of the most touching characters :'(\\n\\n\r\nSEXINESS: 7\\n\r\nSo you might be like, \"You get turned on by blood?\" well No. Ew. But there were a couple fan service scenes in the anime. Of course you can't have an anime without a bunch of girls going to the beach, and the characters in this anime in general at points were all wearing some pretty um \"intresting\" outfits (not all the time rip). Even the guys. The characters themselves I know some people have a crush on. Akame? Esdeath? Leone? I'm a part of the small Chelsea crew :3\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nYo what the hell is this? You had all this trash talk on it but you gave it a 9? I enjoyed it! Would i rewatch it? Hell no. This is more like a 1 time fling and the ending to be honest wasn't exceptional. (Although the way he went out was pretty sick. That make no sense? watch it :D) The fight scenes were actually hella good and the setting wasn't that cliche. it was pretty cliche. But hey It's definitely worth watching if you have nothing to watch. If you do have something to watch though, this could prooooooooobably wait.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\r\nOk guys. You can say it was trash but really? Ok maybe. I can see the trash aspect of it but you could definitely have stopped watching at any point you were done because there were parts of the show that repeated itself. As I said before this is definitely worth the watch if you have nothing to watch simply because the show keeps moving. That might be a bad thing but you can't really be bored because Oh look she's dead. Oh no he's dead. Oh what she can die? This is one of the shows where if people say it's trash I don't always fight them but to anyone that has come here actually looking for thoughts on if you should watch it or not. Go for it!",

            "content": "Does a show have to contain blood, death and tragedy to be considered \"good\"?\r\nI recently started to ask me that question. Why do shows like Shingeki no Kiyojin and lately Akame ga Kill! experience such a hype? What makes them so valuable? Are we just wanting to see people die?  \r\nApparently yes. Taking into consideration the cinematic value of these shows, there must be something else than just good story-telling or well written characters. Something apart from the factors that make a good show, something that these hyped shows have in common. Which is in many cases violence and tragedy. Not wanting to discusshuman nature now, I want to write a review that considers this and therefore only features my honest opinions. \\n\r\nI'll try to avoid heavy spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Akame ga Kill! is not a very deep or experimental one. Roughly summarized: We have our usual suppressing kingdom under which the poor have to suffer. And we have the rebels, the heroes, the main cast or whatever you want to call it on the other side of the coin. They name themselves Night Raid and fight against the government as assassins by murdering the corrupt, also fighting their \"main enemy\", which is kind of an autonomous counter organisation that works under the kingdom called 'Jaegers'. \\n\r\nAlthough this is not a very new or fresh concept, I don't dislike it. The happenings weren't random and you were able to see, what certain battles effected and how little events more or less influenced the situation on the whole. I also kind of liked the fact, that nobody was safe, since Akame ga Kill! doesn't seem to care about the importance of certain character. That built up tension on the one hand, but created sort of an carelessness towards the loss of characters on the other.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think the story was a good one. \\n\\n\r\nIn short:\\n\\n\r\nCoherence            +\\n\r\nTension                 o+\\n\r\nEnjoyment            +\\n\r\nUniverse               o\\n\r\nCreativity              -\\n\\n\\n\r\nART 7/10\\n\r\nTo be very honest, during the first few episodes I was flirting with the idea of giving a 6, or even a 5 here. The animations were -from time to time- just not more, sometimes even less than \"fair\". And especially in anime that focus on fighting, I want to have epic and fluent animation. Also, I even now believe that the art style isn't more than a fair 6, too. It is nice and clean, but doesn't do anything memorable or unique.  \\n\r\nAs the quality gets recognizably better throughout the last half of the series and provides the epicness and the fluent and nicely done animations I was missing in the first half, my rating in the end is a 7. \\n\\n\r\nIn short: \\n\\n\r\nArt                       o+\\n\r\nArtstyle               o\\n\r\nAnimations         o+\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\nAs so often, there is not much to say here. Both packages of OP and ED were great, the songs were fitting the atmosphere of the show, they were dark but didn't sound too depressing. The soundtrack was a good one, too, it never attracted negative attention or appeared distracting. Kinpaku, the third track from the original soundtrack especially was very outstanding and unique. Also, the voice actors were well-chosen and did a decent job.\\n\r\nAll this leads to the final rating of a 8. \\n\\n\r\nIn short: \\n\\n\r\nOST                      o+\\n\r\nOP+ED                 +\\n\r\nVoice actors         +\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 8/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, eight out of ten. Despite the fact, that the characters are really stereotypical, they are actually well-written, at least as good as can be expected under the circumstances. Nearly all of them have more or less relatable motives and goals and all of them can be likeable in their own way, also no character was really annoying. \\n\r\nAnother thing I liked about Akame ga Kill! was the very thin line between \"good\" and \"evil\". The methods and values of both of the two sides can be raised to question equally. Who is to decide what is right and what wrong? Is assassination, taking a life sustainable, if you kill according to your own sense of justice? Turn people into enemies, just because they support other methods, values or convictions? Can people that stand against you automatically turn into your victims, not taking their precious life into consideration? All these questions play a role in Akame ga Kill!. \\n\r\nTo give an example for this controversy: Many of the characters I liked most are part of the 'Jaegers'. Also, one of the deaths that touched me most was the death of one of this same group. \\n\r\nAs you know my point of view now, I think you are able to relate to my rating on this point. \\n\\n\r\nIn short: \\n\\n\r\nAuthenticity           +\\n\r\nCoherence             o+\\n\r\nUniqueness            o-\\n\r\nDevelopment          +\\n\r\nChar. Design           o\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this show. I cannot say anything else. I know other reviewers did not, some even hated Akame ga Kill! and I can totally relate to what most of them say. But I don't think Akame ga Kill! was bad. I like to determine the rate of enjoyment by observing my behavior while watching. For example, how often I paused the video and did something else, or how badly I wanted to watch the next episode after finishing one. By doing that, I'm simply forced to give an 8 at this point. \\n\\n\r\nIn short:\\n\\n\r\nHow badly did I    \\n\r\nwant to watch      +\\n\r\nthe next episode\\n\\n\r\nHow often did I \\n\r\npause and did      o+\\n\r\nsomething else\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all this, I want to revert to what I asked myself in the beginning. I'm aware of the fact that many people indeed watch certain shows to watch other peoples suffering, either intentionally or non-intentionally. But I don't think that splatter and dramatic losses are enough to make a show \"good\" and ,as a function of this, make them experience quite a big hype. Yes, Akame ga Kill! features lots of these things and yes, they are an undeniable big attribute of shows like this, but there is more to it. I think Akame ga Kill! is a good example for this. Therefore I come to the overall rating of: \\n\r\n                                                       7.6\\n\r\n, which is mathematically rounded up to an overall rating of 8.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n.............................................\\n\r\nI hope you liked my second review. I'm aware of the fact that my english is not exactly brilliant, but I'm trying my best as a not-native speaker anyway! :)\\n",

            "content": "I remember a time in anime where death was anything but concrete, specifically in battle shounen. One could die, but just as easily be brought back to life through, say, magic or star-plated spheres. However, in recent memory, anime fans have shifted that notion in the opposite direction. They had hungered for a more serious, more damning approach to the shounen genre. One where the characters' status within the anime meant nothing for their security in battle. Most of all, when and if they were to fall, they would stay fallen. Luckily, anime fans got what they had hoped for... with Shingeki no Kyojin.\r\nThe animeindustry took note of Shingeki no Kyojin's wild success and started scouting for successors. They took one look at Akame ga Kill and were sold immediately. Look at all the dead people! Haley Joel Osment is going to have trouble keeping calm with all of these dead people! This is Akame ga Kill's key point: people die, and stay dead, forever. That's all that's necessary to keep the hungry viewers satisfied, right?\\n\\n\r\nWhile Akame ga Kill can keep its promise of gruesome deaths, deranged characters, and a constant stream of the aforementioned subjects, that's only the one shounen cliche they decided not to add. What's important to pay attention to is the amount of sacrifice with this anime. No, not the sacrifice of any certain character for the good of the plot, as this anime wants the viewer to believe, but the sacrifice of essential concepts put forth to creating a well thought out story. What this title lacks in revivals is made up of many, many other shounen cliches. These characters can die, yes, but are they difficult to kill? It depends on the situation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are placed into this series to die. Every character is at risk, so the viewer expects this throughout the entirety of the anime. This could cause as a sort of distraction to some, such as seeing evidence of character development as a means to get the viewer's sympathy. It also leaves out a lot of that character development for characters that may fall prey to the anime's selling point too quickly. To make up for this, they put out an episode entirely dedicated to exploring said character's past. But as stated above, this seems rushed and a means to wring out sympathy from the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of rushed, there are segments to this anime that seem all too rushed. Arcs within the anime that feel like filler only constrict the amount of time this anime has to work with to actually advance the plot to the point where it feels as if it all happened within an hour. And this anime doesn't seem convinced that viewers will continue to watch the series without more murder, so they spend time trying to build up the characters only to kill them off by episode's end. This, once again, only limits the amount of time the anime has to actually smoothly advance the plot, even with twenty-four episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTaking a hard look at the characters in this series, one has to wonder whether they really feel like characters. With the emphasis on death and sacrifice, are the characters meant to be cared for, or seen as a plot device? It feels almost like a game of Survivior, where the viewer only roots for one or two particular characters to root and care for, hoping they can win the competition based on likability and/or skill. And with a surplus of characters, specifically when the Jaegers (Shingeki no Kyojin tribute?) are introduced later on, how many are really going to leave a mark on the viewer?\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of all the different perspectives, I felt as though the characters only added to the overall cliche feel of Akame ga Kill. Characters, if not for their typical dark, depressing backstories, only had a key characteristic that the anime played with, while instilling comedy through means of having them act the opposite of what one would expect from their appearance. The main hero personality, the quiet caretaker, the manly homosexual (that's new), the tsundere, the flirt, the pervert, the one no audience member remembers, and the leader. Each of these range among the chart of cliche personalities, but most of them are unbearable to those familiar with the genre. To the extent of their likability depends on the viewer, but is more likely to smell like that of a rotting horse to most.\\n\\n\r\nLike that of most shounen heavyweights, Akame ga Kill's artstyle is dark and has edges that could cut steel. Not to say their bodies are merely made of trapezoids, but the amount of almost frightening imagery is enough to make many horror fans giggle in delight. This is part of what this anime stands for, of course. To make this anime as enthralling as possible, a lot of key details needed to be put into battles and weapons, and they certainly delivered. Fights were flashy and fast, almost to the point of headaches, but ibuprofen exists, so it doesn't matter; just watch the pretty colors. Characters were distinct and noticeable, no matter how unimportant they seemed. Well, other than background characters, but again, who cares? Just watch the pretty colors. The overall dark nature of the show at least helps its case as a mature battle shounen. If Akame ga Kill were graded on art style alone, it would be rated with high votes.\\n\\n\r\nViewing Akame ga Kill could be a worthwhile experience for many, granted the viewer has the right mindset. Akame ga Kill had scenes where it genuinely felt like everything within it had a purpose, but it drowns out its supply of time with too much filler and a giant second half influx of characters. The one biggest problem I had with this anime was its emphasis on death and the sacrifices one makes to make the world a better place. I can see the emphasis of death, but there needs to be more emphasis on why the viewer should care about the world they're trying to save. Everything on the surface is bad because it can be. What else is there to the world other than being black and white?",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill!\r\nReview Text\r\nAKAME, PLEASE KILL THIS REVIEW?:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nBoobs and bloodshed galore.\r\nSYNOPISIS:\r\nGeneric guy in this super generic Shounen fantasy like for the millionth time, finds himself in the capital city of whatever the heck the country is called, (probably beef) and soon finding some rich nobles to sleep in their mansion. Soon enough in their beds, he finds a small league of assassins who is killing the poor nobles mercilessly, and the power of PLOT CONVINENCE says the real reason why they kept him, was to sadistically torture him, just like what they've done to he's BFF's. The league of Assassins \u201cNight Raid\u201d told him thetruth of the capital, and that again by the power of PLOT CONVINENCE the rich people are all a bunch of psycho's for no or completely bull shaft reason. Being sooo traumatised by that fact, he decided to join night raid, to assist the assassination of the Prime Minister with he's new found buddies.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nThe show is like the child's little brother of deadman wonderland, unlike its brother Tokyo Ghoul who is just completely idiotic, at least Akame Ga Kill was a bit more on the self-aware side.\\n\\n\r\nIgnore the fact that Night Raid Assasins are astheticaly defined by there prime colours, like this is Green, Pink, Purple, Turquoise, Red, Black, like its the more idiotic version of Power Rangers of all things, and state that all of the characters are all defined by the laws of two dimensional Archetypes, we have the Tsundere, Kudere, the cool one, the big brother, the quiet one, the big boobies and the dip sticks etc.\\n\\n\r\nSo there\u2019s really nothing special there, and the directing feels like the excact same style of what Shounen writers use, but downgraded.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains in this show have absolutly no reason, or depth in personality for killing, or abusing the people. Its like, hey kids! Look at this horrible psycho who is killing all of these people we a know next to nothing about! Now all everyone will think its \u201cMature\u201d but in fact its jnust being pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nTetsuyas apparently a total BAMF I hear from the masses of casuals, and I state wrong, because having the balls to simply kill people right off the bat is the only exact option on handling Your enemies, heck! The villains in this show are some of the lousier pieces of writing I've seen for a shounen because there really just a bunch of one dimensional psychos who are really just there to make everything all gory and jazz and the masses will all of a sudden think its \u201cVery Mature Content\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAt least in something like Naruto, or Bleach, there are actually two options, either talk, or fight. But in Akame, its just Kill! There were other casuals completely missing the point and stating that they are getting rather bored with there Naruto's, Fairy Tails, One Piece, and now there saying that Akame is more mature because the violence was awesome and uncensored?! Look, I know You may have a way with Your opinion, but there is a difference between being Mature, and being pretentious. Being mature means that the fiction respects its audience, and takes its themes in a serious and realistic manner, being Pretentious is an act of trying to respect its audience, but failing because it does not take its themes in a more unrealistic manner!\\n\\n\r\nAs for a serious and ambitious setting of a small league of Assassins being the only hope on overthrowing a corrupted capital with its King and Prime Minister, it sure is damn well pretentious at that. Because when the show is not fighting, but to try to flesh out its characters and (IDK) develop them, we instead get some Whore, or any female distract us with these silly boob jokes as a horrible excuse for being this comedic sex rom-com and a dark fantasy. There is a damn good difference by being sexually aroused, and taking in mature context seriously. Like how in the second episode Tetsy is mourning over he's recently killed friends from the psycho-chick, then some blonde whore comes in and puts her boobs in he's face as a surprise! Saying, hey if the writing is dull and shallow we might as well sell sex as an excuse to fill out actual good writing into it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is the biggest issue of the story, it tries to be dark and edgy, yet it also tries to milk a little bit more of that paper by an attempt of sex appeal.\\n\\n\r\nConsequently, it does have one redeeming factor. If You really ignore how much of an absolute flashy train wreck this show is, then what its worth can be viewed as this nice parody of shounen, that is indulged in self awareness on how bad yet corny it is.\\n\\n\r\nThough the show completely lacks any sort of depth (as mentioned above) and it takes a really strong mindset to actually enjoy it for what its worth. Buuut I'm an Anime Critic, and critics are never afraid to actually criticise on what is bad, and the show is just being pretentious, which makes me really annoyed if a show attempts such a sin. However, it is definitly more tolerable than Tokyo Ghoul, since that show fails in every sense of making an intensely mature thriller, and becomes a f**king battle shounen with even worse plot conveniences!\\n\\n\r\nWhite fox is still doing a decent job, though I do feel like straying away from there style, since (like mad house) such backgrounds are being a little too dependant on CGI, though it is definitely above average, I only feel as if it was just another upgrade to Your regular animation. The characters each have a flashy design for You to easily tell who is which, though they really do look like some power rangers rip off if I just keep thinking about it... And the action scenes look pretty good, but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunatly, I was not able to find the OST to listen to when making this review, and the only thing available was the OP (which is decent at best and does the job for You to get hyped for action) but the music does have a nice variety of instruments to portray different situations, and will even stray away from your typical violins, pianos, trumpets etc. (skip the ED btw)\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nJust like SAO, everyone thinks its amazing, when it finishes, everyone is now talking how an absolute flop it was. Then they noticed the haters were right all along. Akame Ga Kill will be no different, just sit down, and wait until the entire Anime community will say how bad it was! And for those remaining casuals who think its good, then all the Critics will continue there hate, and wait until until there tastes harden awaaaaaaaay.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n3/10- A repeated formula of characters all over again, though You do get back story, the villains are just horrible.\\n\r\n3.5/10- Just like Tokyo Ghoul being a pretentious prick, but a but more self-aware.\\n\r\n6.5/10- Action scenes seem OK for the most part, and backgrounds are just above average.\\n\r\n6.5/10- It does the job with good variety, but nothing particularly great.\\n\r\n3.5/10- Lacklustre entertainment for being pretentious that is only half decent with the right mindset.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 4/10 For being more self-aware than Tokyo Ghoul.",

            "content": "Shout it out with all your spirit: \"INCURSIOOOO!!\" - Bulat\r\nAkame Ga Kill is best described as an action-comedy flick thrown into a set a hilariously interesting characters in a dystopian world filled with blood, gore and various other atrocities. While I thoroughly enjoyed all the animated action sequences and characters, I was sorely disappointed by the plot. I'll explain further below, but for now...\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nSound: 9/10\r\nCharacter: 9/10\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\r\nOverall: 8/10 (rounded down from 8.125)\r\nGood points:\r\n+ Great, adorable female main character (Akame)\r\n+ Very extensive supporting character development\r\n+ Wide range of various supporting characters\r\n+ Excellent art and animation\r\n+ Excellent music and background tracks\r\n+ Great action sequences\r\n+ Touching,emotional scenes\\n\r\n+ Good comic relief and humour\\n\\n\r\nBad points:\\n\r\n- Unoriginal, typical shounen male lead (Tatsumi)\\n\r\n- Lack of plot depth and twists\\n\r\n- Some incoherence in key plot lines\\n\r\n- Some unnecessary plot lines\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe overarching storyline is kept short, crisp and simple: A group of assassins, Night Raid, murdering \"evil\" people who have done hideous and bad things, all in an attempt to rid society of all evil. Of course, the ultimate goal is to assassinate the main antagonist, the emperor's right-hand minister within the government, from whom all evil stems from, and in so doing (somehow) change the world.\\n\\n\r\nIn the process of formulating a plan to kill the main antagonist, Night Raid trains, toughens up, and goes through a series of missions to earn money, hone their skills and eventually reach a stage where they can challenge the capital directly. The plot is hence split into 3 main plot arcs - the first introductory arc lasting until episode 8, the Jaegers arc from 9-17, followed by the Revolution arc from episode 18 to the end, though there are some standalone episodes like episodes 14 and 22 which do not follow the plot exactly.\\n\\n\r\nWe begin our journey by following the obvious male lead Tatsumi, who makes his way from his hometown, a poor village in the outskirts, to go to the capital to earn money. After getting swindled and encountering Night Raid, he learns the dark evil that the capital reeks of - namely rich aristocrats torturing outsiders for entertainment, extorting of money from the poor, framing the innocent to get away with crimes, you know, something like the capital from the Hunger Games. Tatsumi then joins Night Raid for the rest of their assassination missions onward, killing evil people over and over again at least for the entire first arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot gets really exciting, though not exactly intense from the start - because there's always room here and there for moments of comic humour present in classic shounen titles. Along the way as the missions one by one get completed, we see a gradual increase in the difficulty and danger level that our protagonists put ourselves in, and after a while, we even begin to see some of the supporting cast dying off late into the first arc. (+1 for development, +1 for excitement)\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the first arc, I was thoroughly confused at where the writers were trying to get at. On one hand, because of all the gore, the sudden deaths and the crazed looks that the evil characters keep giving, it seems like they were going for the \"dark\" feel, but almost immediately after, there are slapstick comic relief moments such as Tatsumi's open fly, Akame asking for seconds, Lubbock getting punched in the face for peeking at Leone, and Najenda trying to be charming. By the end of the show, I was convinced that the writers didn't bother putting any more depth into the plot than what I have basically summarized earlier. There are no plot twists - and wait for it - there are no attempts at a plot twist either.\\n\\n\r\nThen we go into the second arc when things start getting really interesting. Plot-wise, nothing changes save for the fact that now Night Raid is being hunted down by General Esdeath's team of Jaegers, and throughout the arc, everything points towards a final showdown between the two sides of Imperial Arms users at the end of the second arc. Instead of Night Raid being on the offensive, for the first time, we see them operate defensively, at least once, during Dr Stylish's haphazard and careless all-out attack on their fortress. Also, it starts to get very cool when you being to see all the different Imperial Arms abilities used in combat - really creative and really varied set of skills and powers. (+1 for interest)\\n\\n\r\nAfter that pretty much comes the showdown between Night Raid and *half of* the Jaegers, which became a long drawn-out battle where it ended with a 1-for-1 trade. It's not even half of the Jaegers because Wave got blasted off into the middle of nowhere in the beginning of the fight, and for stupid reasons wasn't able to get back into the fight. But the anime has already established Wave's apparently uselessness when it comes to fighting his team, so I can forgive that. Even though the anime literally broke the fourth wall and told the audience, \"The final showdown is about to arrive,\" there was never really a 6-on-6 or 5-on-5 showdown ever, it was mostly 5-on-2, 1-on-1, 2-on-1, small skirmishes like that for the next few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAfter many subsequent battles, both sides lose around half of their teammates before we enter the next revolution arc, where I think that plot does finally show some semblance of depth. For one, it becomes more and more painstakingly obvious that Night Raid and the Jaegers are not necessarily in a Good vs Evil kind of relationship - they are simply two entities who are forced to fight each other based on their circumstances, both think they are doing the right thing.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the idea of revolution comes into play, but the anime downplays this part of the plot so much that it seems they wanted the audience to completely forget that a revolution is going on, which was kinda disappointing. There is some talk and banter about how the revolutionary forces have come about, but there is little development about any intentions after the revolution, like who's in charge or how things are going to work out, or how things are going to change. This was a huge plot oversight and was never mentioned even at the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere were actually so many themes brought out in this anime - things like justice, war, peace, sacrifice, the morality behind killing - but all of this was basically left to the audience to contemplate on their own. The anime gives no actual insight into any of these. The one theme they did keep bringing up though, is the social darwinistic notion that \"the strong eat the weak\", by courtesy of our dear tsundere General Esdeath herself, the epitome of a warmongering psycopath, and by the final battle, we begin to see how this shouldn't - and should never - be the case (courtesy of Akame). (+1 for some depth)\\n\\n\r\nI have to point out that the anime at least, managed to bring the entire conflict to some form of epic resolution, though on the revolution side, I really don't think it even bothered to explain anything that happens after the revolution - new government, policies, new laws - none of this was even mentioned. It did however, put a fitting end to all the annoying antagonists, so I would have to give a point for that. (+1 for acceptable resolution).\\n\\n\r\nOn the coherence side, I would say that the anime has done fairly well - especially in explaining all the different quirks and abilities of Imperial Arms and their users, also in explaining the origin of Imperial Arms in the first place. However, there are some key places where coherence falls short.\\n\\n\r\nA key plot point that was used multiple times throughout the show was the idea of Danger Beasts. In the first episode, Tatsumi is shown killing a Danger Beast for the first time, and subsequently Night Raid and the Jaegers did at one point in the second arc join forces to eliminate hordes of evil Danger Beasts. Not to mention Najenda \"taming\" a flying Manta Ray Danger Beast when she came to Night Raid's reinforcement during an assault on their hidden base. Unfortunately, despite being quite central to the development of the plot, the origins, abilities and status of Danger Beasts are never mentioned at all. \\n\\n\r\nI especially needed some explanation as to why Syura went to let all those genetically-enhanced (something like that) Danger Beasts rampage and kill people, but all Syura said was \"Because it was fun.\" I know Syura is just an asshole to humans, but that's not a good explanation anyhow. It's also a lame and unnecessary part of the anime, which makes me kind of designate that particular two episodes as a \"filler\".\\n\\n\r\nThe next key plot point is the particular \"overheating\" property that apparently only Mine's Pumpkin has. Mine first mentions this only in episode 19, which is by the way, super duper late into the plot, when explanations regarding Imperial Arms and their usefulness/strengths/weaknesses are long overdue. And guess what, she only happens to mention this at a point of her fight against Seryu when she is in mortal danger - oh the cliche dramatic moment to suddenly unveil this possible \"overheating\" of her Pumpkin.  Still, I bought it, at least until the subsequent few episodes where it clearly shows Mine firing her Pumpkin at Budou, using rougly 2-3 times the power level she was using the fight Mine, and the Pumpkin does not \"overheat\", it instead simply \"breaks apart\" rather than overheating.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I don't buy this at all. The anime never gave proper explanation of how much Pumpkin could take before overheating - it never even shows Mine ever considering the fact that it could overheat until it did, conveniently, at episode 19, and this overheating property was immediately dropped in the subsequent few episodes. What utter rubbish. I know it's for the drama, but please try again, because later on when Mine tries to escape from the suicide blast, she once again, after walking fine all this while, trips over absolutely nothing and falls to the ground. *shakes head*\\n\\n\r\nThere are also a couple of minor plot holes that don't affect the plot whatsoever:\\n\\n\r\nThe backstory of Akame and Kurome sounds fine up until the point where they split paths. The anime mentions why Akame chose to revolt against the capital but it fails to show any scene of how Akame \"tried\" convincing Kurome to join her. As sisters for so long, it seems unlikely that they would split suddenly just because of a \"sudden realization\". Akame would probably have spent more time convincing Kurome, more than anything, and Kurome should have, as a sister, been a lot more open to the idea of fighting against the capital. After all, they are supposed to be alike and the excuse of \"not abandoning\" friends is a lousy one, since after that, Kurome switches her entire set of teammates anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime features an incredibly interesting Shambala Imperial Arms (used by Syura) that has the ability to teleport. In episode 20, Syura and Lubbock are both safe on the ground before Syura opens a portal to another dimension (which, aesthetically, looked like outer space to me) and banishes Lubbock. At this point though, Lubbock pulls Syura in together with him, and, while the portal is still open, manages to defeat Syura and both of them return back to the capital - but this time they are several hundred metres in the air instead of on the ground. Perhaps the Imperial Arms does not work like Portal's portal guns, but there is still absolutely no explanation for Shambala randomly teleporting its targets into the air after coming back from another dimension.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 8, Nyau, one of the \"Three Beasts\" under Esdeath's commmand, was shown talking out loud to Tatsumi and Bulat while playing his Imperial Arms flute at the same time, as he activated his \"Secret Ability\". I know he's an Imperial Arms user, but even then, there's no way he has breath to both speak and play his flute simultaneously, so that's a no-go.\\n\\n\r\nHence, so while the plot excels at generating interest and excitement, it lacks quite a bit of depth and overlooks certain key plot points.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 2/2 - Absolutely amazing actions sequences that really have you at the edge of your seat.\\n\r\nAesthetics: 2/2 - I really love the character art and design, and I loved how the art especially for Wave and Tatsumi were used specifically to show how similar they were in nature.\\n\r\nOP Sequence: 2/2\\n\r\nED Sequence: 2/2\\n\r\nOP Sequence 2: 2/2 (Bonus points)\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful OP and ED art - is worth a watch!\\n\\n\r\nSound:  9/10\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, all the OP and ED themes are pretty solid, although I didn't really like the second OP Theme.\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme 1: 2/2\\n\r\nED Theme 1: 2/2\\n\r\nOP Theme 2: 1/2\\n\r\nED Theme 2: 2/2\\n\r\nBackground Music: 2/2 - Very well choreographed, suited the themes very well - from comical to dark, to quick paced action.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow we move onto the most important part of this anime - since they really didn't bother with plot depth - and also because the anime really spent a lot of time developing the back stories, personalities and quirks behind many of their characters. I personally think this is where the anime excels at - and I'll explain why below.\\n\\n\r\nWe start off with Tatsumi, the main character, who is basically just your typical cliche shounen hero thrown into a very varied and interesting set of supporting characters. Tatsumi has a strong will of heart, a strong sense of morals, ideals and determination to follow through everything he does. He also manages some character growth throughout the show - and this is mainly through the deaths of many of his comrades. He starts to realize the meaning behind why he fights, more importantly, who he fights for. (+1 for growth) Unfortunately, his character is uninteresting because it's just too cliche, and while he has some backstory, it isn't particularly unique in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have our favourite, with an anime named after her, Akame, the badass Musamune wielder who slashes her enemies down like flies. Her cuteness and huge appetite only makes me adore her so much more, and her killing instinct in battle is just awesome to watch. (+1 for being adorable) Of course, she comes with a sad, tragic backstory that explains why she's an assassin, even before Night Raid, of course. She's also the only one who is a legit assassin, the rest are just a ragtag bunch of people who hate the capital. (+1 for character development) Unfortunately, throughout the anime, her character doesn't change much. She doesn't get as much screentime as Tatsumi, regrettably, and at times where she should grow, it's just scenes of her crying (for Kurome, for her fellow comrades) but nothing in her actually changes - she's still the same old killer assassin we all love, but I guess that's okay.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the best character in the show has to be Susanoo. He's not even human, he's just an organic Imperial Arms but damn, this guy can do all the household chores, can build a house, can fight and take down a massive mega-level Danger Beast. He's basically Superman. He also says all the important inspirational lines that his fellow comrades need to hear. (+1 for all-round awesome character)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, on the antagonists' side, we have the very interestingly evil Esdeath - who on one hand seeks destruction and war, and on the other seeks love in the form of Tatsumi. We start off by hearing all the insane rumours about how she destroyed the entire northern continent, but she's also longing for love - or more like, longing to experience the feeling of love. Her beauty is as apparent as her scariness but unlike the ice that proceeds from her Imperial Arms, she's passionate like a fire and makes not 1, but 2 all-out attempts to make Tatsumi fall in love with her (which involves aggressive seduction). Definitely one of the most multi-faceted character I've encountered, because while she seems cold on the outside, she's actually very warm on the inside - up to the point where she went to comfort Seryu after the death of Dr Stylish, in a rather humourous shoujo-ai moment that Wave witnessed. (+1 for multi-faceted nature)\\n\\n\r\nI would like to, at this point, mention Wave though, because he is a lot like Tatsumi. He's also kind of the cliche character who tries to do his best at everything but somehow or rather, by accident, seems to pathetically fail at everything. But it's not entirely bad because Wave comes to a realization at the end (as does Run, but his was more subtle) that his duty is protect to people above all, regardless of whose side he is fighting on. Throughout the anime also, Wave is shown constantly being disturbed by the actions of more insanely evil comrades like Kurome, Esdeath and Seryu, and it's no doubt he was the most likeable character within the Jaegers. (+1 for character growth)\\n\\n\r\nAt this point though, I really want to stress on how well this anime ha brought out the characterization and back story of so many of the supporting characters, both from Night Raid and from the Jaegers, that really made me not want any of them to die (which was not possible). While there were some annoying ones like Seryu Ubiquitous (naive, stuck-up, justice believer) and Kurome (living in Akame's shadow), I thought that most of them really stood out with their character back stories.\\n\\n\r\nOn the Night Raid side, there was Bulat, a former fighter in the capital army who is kinda gay but also ends up being Tatsumi's main mentor. There's Najenda, the mysterious mastermind who once fought along side Esdeath and hence knows how powerful she is. Najenda has some brief moments of characterization where she mourns for Susanoo which I thought was especially touching and shows how much she cares for her comrades - even at the part where she agreed with everyone to save Tatsumi. (+1 for variety of cast)\\n\\n\r\nSheele, Mine, Lubbock, Leone and even Chelsea are also very interesting and amazing characters, just that their particular back stories were not very fleshed out. Chelsea's in particular, was only mentioned in the exact same episode when she died, and it felt slightly too rushed, and made it too obvious that she was going to die. Still, because of the effort put into the development of their personalities, I could really feel the emotion put into all their dying scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOn the Jaegers' side, we definitely can't forget Bols, the man whose face was disfigured so badly that he hides it from everyone else. Bols is the epitome of \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\" and he even has scenes of him and his wife and daughter in the anime - no other character was shown to have a family like his. Bols also constantly tells Wave, \"I'm not a nice man, I have killed so many people in the past.\" But we all know that Bols is actually really nice deep down inside, he even died helping people. (+1 for uniqueness)\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I have to mention the annoying Seryu though. While she doesn't have much of a backstory, she starts off by showing the audience that she's a nice girl who helps Tatsumi find his way, saying that she \"upholds justice\". But it becomes so painfully obvious throughout the anime that her hatred towards Night Raid is nothing to do with justice but everything to do with exacting revenge for her fallen comrades. The anime showed that Seryu is merely ignorant of her own actions and intentions, making her look like basically a complete lunatic and shizophrenic psychopath, which I thought was just sad. Also, her particular weapon set is just confusing - she has Numbers 1-10 which are all different assortments of guns that somehow attach to her limbs of her body when Hecatoncheir bites her? Her method of activating her weapons just makes no sense whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have the Emperor, whose name seems to be as irrelevant as he is throughout the entire anime. Nothing is known much about his personality, but he is anyway just a pawn used by minister Honest, who is honestly just the most annoying useless antagonist ever. Honest is an old man who is supposed to represent this inherently evil behind the emperor, but the only really way you can tell he's evil is because he keeps eating portions of raw meat all the time randomly in the anime. Everything else about his manipulation is kind of implied, and his characterization is pathetically shallow. We know he's a bad guy, and that's about all we know, we do not know where the current Emperor or minister has come from.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, character development was pretty solid for this anime, with a wide and varied cast of supporting characters whose back stories are mostly valid and emphasized upon. Unfortunately, the main character Tatsumi is slightly too unoriginal for my liking. It would also have been much better also, if Akame had more screentime and more presence in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that I really enjoyed this anime. :) It had a good balance both humour, emotion and excitement that really makes the show a thrill to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some pretty funny running gags in this anime:\\n\r\n1. Pretty much every awkward scene between Esdeath and Tatsumi (especially the scene when they were both in bed)\\n\r\n2. Every scene featuring a half-naked Bulat\\n\r\n3. Every time Kurome puts her hand on Wave's shoulder to remind him of his uselessness\\n\r\n4. Every scene with Bols being unexpectedly nice and friendly\\n\r\nand many more..\\n\r\n(+2 to comedy)\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of pumped up action in this anime doesn't disappoint either. From fast-paced fighting sequences involving close combat fist-fights, sword fights, to bigger weapons like guns, rifles and even magic-based weapons, the battles are well choreographed and full of great animated effects. (+3 for thrill)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime even does well in the emotion department, from all the touching scenes involving the deaths of various supporting characters, to all the mourning, crying and the beautiful music to go along with it, definitely strikes a chord somewhere. Some may criticize that the audience gets desensitized to all the deaths because of the sheer amount of them, but I think it isn't too overboard and it's probably one of the few animes that gives a realistic figure as to how many people would die and how quickly in such high-risk battles. (+2 for emotion) And they really brought out those character emotions very well, so I can't discredit that.\\n\\n\r\nPacing wise, the anime was pretty good. There wasn't a moment where I felt bored, and I simply wanted to keep on watching, because of the great visuals and action scenes. (+2 for pacing)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also receives a bonus 1 point for not having any filler episodes. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.125/10\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Akame Ga Kill because of the amazing cast of very interesting characters, the creativity and design of the many different Imperial Arms and all of the great action packed into the 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nReviewer's Post-Review Comments:\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people have criticized this show for having \"grossly underdeveloped characters\", but I honestly beg to differ. While there is not one character who \"stood out\" amongst the rest, it was clear that there was a lot of effort put in into fleshing out many of the supporting and main cast characters - even if their backstories seemed \"similar\" or \"cliched\", it's commendable that this anime bothers to at least mention all of them, unlike so many other animes out there which completely leave out backstories of supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, many people have singled out specific characters that they hate and hence drop their character ratings, but I believe in awarding merit for all the characters that were lovable and were well-developed. In fact, there are many likeable characters in the show, many of them with lovable personalities and very particularly interesting back stories, regardless of whether they were main or supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, many people criticized how the anime juxtaposed its comic and emotional scenes, and disapproved of how the comic relief really drew away from the sad emotions that they were feeling - but that's exactly the point of the humour. The anime doesn't believe in spending 1 entire episode, or half an episode, mourning for a loss comrade - it believes in moving on courageously, despite all the horrible pictures of death that were painted and all the wails of despair. Instead, I thought that this fit very well into the overall balance of the show - not too heavy and not too light hearted either. It was this particular comic-emotive balance that I thought Akame Ga Kill really excelled in.",

            "content": "Every once in a while, the stars will align just right, and an anime will give you practically everything that fits your preferred tastes. Your favorite setting, your favorite overarching plot, your favorite character tropes, your favorite kind of soundtrack: everything is in place to give you an incredible viewing experience that will stay with you for a long time. However, even when all of the proper elements are in place, the possibility of something ruining your formula still exists. So, when this happens, is it still possible to extract enough enjoyment out of theseries to say that it was worth it?\\n\\n\r\n          To put it quite frankly, this anime really does have everything I want in an anime short of a philosophical undertone. Sh\u014dnen-action/adventure genre, published (manga) and produced (anime) by Square Enix, non-Japanese fantasy setting, huge character cast, fighting against a corrupt government, lack of plot armor, a romantic story line that actually goes somewhere (sort of), vibrant character designs, a Taku Iwasaki soundtrack. This anime had to work really hard to get me to dislike it, and yet that seemed to be precisely what its goal was. The writing for this anime fluctuated between amazing, mediocre, and god-awful atrocious, and unfortunately the lesser moments outweighed the greater ones by quite a bit. The tone is far too contrasting for me to actually laugh at some of the more comedic moments, it flip-flops between predictable and unfollowable, and a lot of things seemed to happen without any explanation as to why.\\n\\n\r\n          However, I feel that I'm inclined to be more forgiving of this series than another sh\u014dnen-action/adventure that I could not stop thinking about while I was watching it, and that was Blue Exorcist (to see my full review, click here https://www.facebook.com/notes/ember-reviews/ember-reviews-blue-exorcist/1543626552532832). It wasn't how similar they were in style that make me draw the connection, but how completely different they were. As I mentioned in my other review, Blue Exorcist is built entirely on tired sh\u014dnen tropes, and most of the tropes felt like they were there because the writers knew that those were popular tropes that people liked, so it came out as incredibly generic with no soul to it. \\n\\n\r\n          Akame ga Kill!, however, is on the reverse side of that same coin. It doesn't feel like the tropes are there because the writers knew they were popular, but because the writers genuinely liked those tropes and really wanted to include them despite their massive ineptitude at implementing them properly. What's really interesting though is that you could cut Akame ga Kill! open and watch the entire history of sh\u014dnen spill out onto the floor, with very glaring elements taken from anime like Soul Eater, Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Bleach, and even Gurren Lagann. In the end, it's the difference between a committee designing a product (Blue Exorcist), and a writer who probably grew up on sh\u014dnen-action/adventure and who feels so engrossed in the story that he can't look at it objectively anymore (Akame ga Kill!). One would think that taking a look at the lead writer's (Makoto Uezu) record to get a glimpse of how well he does would give us some insight, but Uezu is responsible for both Katanagatari and School Days, which basically covers the entire spectrum from amazingly artistic to gouge-my-eyes-out terrible.\\n\\n\r\n          Additionally, Akame ga Kill! suffers from a variety of illnesses that plague some of the more popular titles, the most notable being \"Original Ending Syndrome,\" where the anime catches up to the original manga source material and is forced to write its own ending. I couldn't tell you exactly where this happens in the anime because I have not read the manga myself, but I will note that every episode from episode 19 to the end had me constantly changing my opinion on whether or not I actually liked the show. In fact, episode 21 almost made me stop watching it altogether because they made the mistake of trading in good storytelling for shock value to keep that \"We're just as relevant as Attack on Titan\" sticker they so proudly wear. Furthermore, while I do have to give them props for having the balls to do what they did in episode 23, I have to take those props right back because the result of said event caused the final episode to feel very hollow and unplanned, like they were just throwing everything together at the last minute because they literally had nothing else to do but try and tie up as many lose ends as they possibly could.\\n\\n\r\n          A series can enjoy itself all it wants, but that doesn't mean it's still worth your time, and Akame ga Kill! has a near-unforgivable number of faults. Take the lack of plot armor for example, a trait that I normally find incredibly exciting in a series. The first main character death was, as one would expect, extremely sudden and heart-breaking, and at the time it felt like it had set the tone for the rest of the series. However, the second death was drawn out over an entire episode and a half, and barely had any impact on me at all because of it. From that point onward, deaths ranged from sudden and tear-filled to excessively drawn out and unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\n          It also didn't help that the characters were so poorly developed that killing them off didn't mean anything anyway. Aside from \"Original Ending Syndrome,\" this anime also has a classic case of what I like to call \"Almost Syndrome,\" where characters show noticeable signs that development is on the horizon, but they're either killed out before we can reach that point or they promptly turn around and walk the other way, and this affliction affects practically the entire cast. A character whose loyalty to the Capital is so fervent that her mental state starts to fluctuate could have been an incredibly interesting character to follow, but we never get to see her break down and realize how horrible the Capital really is. Another character who started off with a strong attachment to another family member is molded into a killing machine through drugs and brainwashing and eventually fights that family member to the death, but we never see the progression between though two states. A foreigner who was discriminated against by the people of the Capital and was constantly pushed around on the streets joins Night Raid in the hopes of changing her situation, but we never really see her being discriminated against and what effect that had on her. The potential for development is there, bu it's never realized to the point where I could say that any of them are \"good\" characters. As for lead character Tatsumi, he's about as white-bread a sh\u014dnen protagonist as you can get before you start adding in unnecessary angst, but I suppose the fact that they didn't include unnecessary angst made him a much more likable protagonist that a certain spawn of Satan from that other title I referenced earlier.\\n\\n\r\n          The animation was produced by White Fox, and this marks yet another point on a line graph that displays a steady genericizing and decrease in quality of White Fox's standout works. 2010 boasted the aforementioned artistic wonder of Kanatagatari, whose storytelling prowess was only unseated by its mastery of unique art styles and character designs. 2011's Steins;Gate was a bit more traditional in style, but still had a very unique feel to it, especially with the designs of the characters' eyes (yes that it actually a really important detail). 2012's Jormungand sat somewhere between Steins;Gate and Black Lagoon, and 2013's The Devil is a Part-Timer, while incredible vibrant in color, was very much in a more generic style. Now we have Akame ga Kill!, whose art style is so traditionally sh\u014dnen that it wears a Leaf Ninja headband and quotes power levels. While I will say the character designs were definitely pleasing to look at, they certainly weren't anything new, and the action was only slightly above average until they started bulldozing entire cities in the last act.\\n\\n\r\n          There is no dub for this series yet, though I would not be surprised to see one coming out of Seraphim Digital in the future, especially considering the popularity of this series.\\n\\n\r\n          The soundtrack was composed by Taku Iwasaki, and while regular followers of my reviews are probably bracing themselves for an unending gush of praise that I normally pin to his work, I'm left feeling a little bit underwhelmed this time. With works like Gurren Lagann and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, there's usually at least one track that I found especially noteworthy (\"Libera Me From Hell\" and \"Il Mare Eterno Nella Mia Anima\" respectively), but I can't really think of a particular track off the top of my head that really stood out to me other than the music they used at the end for the preview of the next episode. The soundtrack as a whole is still very solid though, with traditional orchestrations blended seamlessly with hard rock, electronic ambiance, and even some more exotic instruments. Both opening themes, \"Skyreach\" by Sora Amamiya and \"Liar's Mask\" by Rika Mayama give up a dark and heavy rock track to get us pumped for each episode, while both ending themes \"Konna Sekai, Shiritakunakatta\" by Miku Sawai and \"Tsuki Araki\" by Sora Amamiya play us out with a more relaxed and almost somber rock tune.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, I can't really say I hated Akame ga Kill!, but I can say that it was extremely disappointing to watch what could have been an incredible series descend further into the pits of bad writing, especially in the last quarter of the series. I would like to say that you should just skip this series, but the fact that I've felt so invested in it over the course of its air time, especially as it neared its conclusion, makes me think that there's still at least some enjoyment to be gleamed from this series, especially for those who crave more sh\u014dnen-action/adventure like I do.",

            "content": "I waited till people are done with all the negatives reaction, because I disagree with them. I really like the anime and I will explain why I liked it. Warning. It can contain spoilers.\r\nI started this anime when it was just airing the second episode. I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know the story or even what genre. When I start watching the anime it was about the boy Tatsumi. That was with 2 friends on their way to the capital to join the army. But the other 2 friends were earlier and get captured by a rich family. The family also invitedTatsumi and when the family got attacked by Night Raid you were introduced by the person called Akame. Because of the title, I know it was more about her and that Tatsumi would die by Night Raid. It was a nice twist for me that triggered to continue for me.\\n\\n\r\nWithin Night Raid you met a few people. All those people you will become attached to. Everyone even the person who hate this anime has a personal favorite in Night Raid or The Jeagers. Both thinks they are fighting for good (at least some of the bad side thinks that). But what is the good side? That is for you to decide. The Jeagers that is working for the Kingdom or Night Raid for the Revolution Army.\\n\\n\r\nYes it was a good vs evil thing. bla bla. It was nice balanced. The both parties were tied to each other and you didn't know which one was stronger. The overpowered weapons they used are called Imperial Arms. These weapon have to fit the person who holds them and they are in different variotions. Like Weapon type, Armor type or even \"biological\" types. There where in total 48 and I was suprised a lot were showed (26). The others could be destroyed or not part of the anime. But they showed a lot and I loved it for it.\\n\\n\r\nStory was all in one place. All around the kindom. But it also showed how big it was. I like the story of Akame and the others of Night Raid and The Jeagers. So I give it a 9.\\n\r\nArt was very normal not ugly not to good. Not much to complain as long it fitted the anime and it did. Art = 8.\\n\r\nSound was reasonble. A little quiet sometimes. More music was welcome. But maybe the quiet also fits the anime. That is more for you to decide. Sound =9.\\n\r\nCharacters = 10. I loved the background and how attached you can get to them.  (HUGE SPOILER) I was in tears when Mine died. She is my favorite. A friend of mine like Chelsea.\\n\r\nLike I said. I really Enjoyed watching it more then anything. So that's a huge 10.\\n\r\nBecause the other things like the Art and the Sound are slightly worse. I give it Overall a 9.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I hear a lot that it was total different from the Manga. But I didn't read it and I have no intention to. I rate this on my perspective from the anime! You can hate or love me for that. But if you didn't read the manga. I suggest the anime.",

            "content": "Note: This review is from someone who has not read any of the manga and will not contain any comparisons to it.  The opinions are formed purely from the anime. (Also spoiler free).\r\nI hate how MAL lays out reviews. For example, it is easy to click on any anime, go to the review tab, look at the score in the statistic section or the first couple of reviews, and dismiss it as complete garbage without even watching it. I think there should be a sticker or something added to the top of the review that says \"Worth your time to watch and form yourown opinion,\" and I believe Akame ga Kill would deserve that sticker. Now this solution obviously has its flaws because many reviews tell you if you should bother watching the anime or not (which is usually the point of reading a review, right?), but it does counter the situations where relatively \"good\" anime are given bad raps because most of the reviews rip it apart for plot holes, rushed story, bad character development etc. There are many anime that may have these problems but can be incredibly enjoyable at the same time (which is the point of watching anime right?). I believe that Akame ga Kill deserves to be given a chance by the average anime watcher who may or may not care about its shortcomings. \\n\\n\r\n(Still love you MAL)\\n\\n\r\nStory:8\\n\r\nRead the synopsis and you will get a brief glimpse into the world of Akame ga Kill. Although like most synopses, the summary definitely does not do the anime justice. A general overview of the anime reveals a typical shonen plot where the protagonist (Tatsumi) is put into an adventure situation to achieve a goal. Further into the anime you realize this is true, but the story carries a dark twist to it. Without revealing too much, I will say one thing: The anime introduces the concept of death, and fairly well if I might add. This is important, because many shonen anime try to stray away from this concept and I felt this was a nice touch to the overall story of Akame ga Kill, and definitely set it apart from many anime. From a pure anime watcher's perspective I enjoyed the story and can honestly say I was at the edge of my [sofa] for many of the episodes. Although for a couple of the last episodes the story did feel a little bit rushed/disorganized regarding many character's \"outcomes,\" and I know many people were not happy with that. However, based on the series as a whole (Which should be the determining factor of the story's score and not the last few episodes) I believed the anime wrapped things up nicely.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nI am by no means an expert in animation or character design, but I can honestly say I really enjoyed how the characters looked and the fight scenes. The animation dropped in quality in some episodes (like in many other anime) but nothing that genuinely irritated me. The fight scenes were epic and the OP and ED displayed top-notch quality. The colors were vibrant and the environment was visually pleasing, which is always a plus for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5\\n\r\nHonestly the BGM is good, but nothing spectacular or memorable. There was one guitar riff during the entrance of Night Raid that I really enjoyed but that is about all I remember. The OST was also heavily reused for many fight scenes and other dialogue scenes. However, Akame ga Kill scored big points for sound in its OPs and EDs. I loved every single one of them and didn't skip any. My personal favourite is OP2 \"Liar Mask\" as I believe it lived up to the anime's epicness. The OPs also did a good job of hyping me up for the start of the episode, which I believe is an important factor of Anime openings. The ED songs definitely did a good job at portraying the bleak and gloomy atmosphere given off at the end of many episodes, and as a pianist I thought the piano was put to good use. The character's voice acting was also top notch in my opinion I enjoyed all of the character's laughing, crying, and screaming :) throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill provides a great variety of characters that you probably shouldn't get attached to. It actually might be hard to get attached to the characters at all, but that is mostly due to fitting this vast story into 24 episodes. The 24 episode limit definitely capped a lot of the character development, and I felt this could have been done better. However for what episodes they had, I believe most of the characters were fleshed out to the best of their ability given the time limit. Most of the characters were also very likeable and had their distinct traits that made them memorable. Although in terms of character development it was mainly displayed in only a couple of the main characters. All of these problems could have been addressed by making the anime longer or adding another season, although from what I understand, the sales were too low in Japan to permit a second season. This is a disappointment as I believe that Akame ga Kill could have definitely improved in this area by providing more character back story as well as development. I also didn't really enjoy the typical shonen aspects of the characters such as the \"humorous dialogue \" thrown in every episode. I believe a more serious tone projected by all of the characters would have made Akame ga Kill a lot better, and definitely would be more appropriate for the overall theme of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nFinally, the most important factor out of all them, enjoyment. These last couple of seasons have provided many enjoyable anime and I am genuinely happy about that. It shows that the medium of anime is not dying (yet) and can still provide some top-notch shows. During the airing of Akame ga Kill I found myself impatiently waiting for each episode\u2019s release, because something awesome usually went down each episode. This shows that Akame ga Kill did something right, especially since I was incredibly busy (and still am) with uni. This feeling is what I want from anime shows and I can safely say Akame ga Kill achieved it. Honestly the enjoyment level for this anime was at a 10 for quite a bit of the series, but was held back in the last few episodes. I really wanted put this at a 10 because I enjoyed most of the anime quite a lot, but some blatant plot rushing and some \"wtf moments\" brought the score down by one. Overall enjoyment is still at a MAL rating of \"great.\" \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nNow if you look at the math of the total of the scores it averages out to 8.1, but I gave the series a 9. This is because I always weight enjoyment much higher than the other features of the anime because as I previously mentioned, I believe enjoyment is the most important aspect of watching anime. So if you put the numbers into \\n\r\n\"J-YO's MAL score Algorithm\" --> You get 9. \\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill is an action-packed series, that steps out of the boundaries many shonen anime's have bound themselves in. Although it is held back by problems many anime face today, I believe it is definitely worth your time if you don't mind violence, gore and some fan service. Go into the series for pure enjoyment/entertainment and it will most likely provide. It gets my sticker of approval that says \"Worth your time to watch and form your own opinion.\" \\n\r\n(I hope MAL implements it)\\n\\n\\n",

( Short, spoiler free, honest review ) \r\nFirst off let me begin by saying; I cannot fathom how an anime of such high expectations could have possibly fallen so low below the margin of a worthwhile anime. \r\nWith a rather explosive start, Akame_ga_Kill reveals it's main casts of characters, it's dark plot, and it's appealing art style. I had high hopes for this anime. Sadly, as weeks passed, and more episodes were released, the lower my expectations became, and by the end the only thing received was utter disappointment.  \r\nAll in all  Akame_ga_Kill is an anime that fallsshort of anything noteworthy. With characters of very little development throughout the anime, an overall rushed story, unsatisfying ending, and \"plot twists\"  that were so predictable I nearly cringed, Akame_ga_Kill is a bad anime that I wouldnt recommend to anyone.",

            "content": "WARNING: THIS IS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS (especially for last 5 episodes), ALSO THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION.\r\nALSO THE SCORE I GAVE IS ONE OUT OF TWO REVIEWS, I SPLIT IT INTO TWO, IF YOU READ THE FULL REVIEW YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I FEEL ABOUT IT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE MANGA.\r\nNow with that said, this was an extremely difficult anime to review and watch. I will review this twice, once as if the manga never existed and once as an adaptation of the manga.\r\nAs an anime without taking into consideration the manga: \r\nThe animation is fluid, but the art is fantastic as well (ofc itcan't compare to the fate series ^^). \\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nI personally loved the music, especially the battle music. Although they did use the same track throughout the anime, which was only a problem if you binge watch it all in a row.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nCharacters are well thought out even if they are killed off soon after introduction, this enables the audience to feel connected to the character and so the death is more impactful because of it.\\n\r\nunfortunately after around episode 19 the anime does not follow the manga and therefore the author was not responsible for the development of the story and so it fell short in both story and character development. I did enjoy the quirks that each character had.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment, again until episode 19 it was a solid 9 even 10/10 but after that turning point it stopped being fluid and the characters actions did not reflect their personality and wtf was up with the super saiyen incursio in episode 23..... \\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\noverall rating for anime without consideration for manga: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow here comes the rage as a fanboy of the manga;\\n\r\nAnimation and music is the same as above.\\n\r\nThe scores only change due to episode 19 onwards deviating from the main story completely and destroying the anticipation and dreams of many fans.\\n\r\nCharacters and story, we didn't see any of the conflicts between the minister's son's group vs night raid, and the way Lubbock dies and his fight was just an overall disappointment compared to the manga, which showed his resilience until the end and an epic trump card which shows how much of a badass he is even though he doesn't get as much screen time as the others.\\n\r\nThe fight with Akame vs Kurome was just lazy script writing trying to end the conflict in the simplest and shortest way possible. The fight was well animated but thats all, it didn't show the power of either party fairly and so was fairly anticlimactic. \\n\r\nGreat general Budo was build up to be at the same level as Esdeath or even stronger and yet he dies after barely one episode of fighting against Mine/pumpkin, although they both were killed off, again this was in order to fasten the pace because the studio wanted to end the series. Also I got a bad feeling about the manga because of this episode(chapter with Budo fight was not released when episode came out) luckily I was only half wrong(not spoiling the manga)\\n\r\nHow they ended the series is what annoyed me the most, the \"super\" imperial arms that can only be used by the royal bloodline is so fukin cliche and how the brainwashed child comes to terms with his mistakes is bullshit. How incursio evolves into super saiyen 9000 in order to destroy the \"super\" imperial arms then dies, dafuq. The final fight vs Esdeath and Akame was expected (since they were the only two alive... except for Najenda except she can't fight for shit, and Leone was chasing after the emperor) but the ending was fukin stupid, the sword that kills you by a single cut which was used as a joke because Akame had to be careful when cleaning her sword, can now turn the user into a super powerful beast if cut????? uh, I don't think so. And the after image of her bloodlust??? common I could have come up with a better excuse then that. How Akame takes the blames for everything because she is part of night raid and so she is used as a scape goat, but Najenda, the boss of night raid, can take the position of rebuilding the empire because no one knew of her existence right?? sigh. Forgot the mention, WTF is up with the Jaegers change in alliance, this is again since they didn't want to have a fight since that costs money and time they just decided that the main bad guys are now good guys coz talking to them has worked so well in the past-.-\\n\r\nAnyway I could ramble on for ever so let me be frank, I give the rating for this anime a 4/10 due to my enjoyment crashing down since I read the manga and it not following the story. BUT to be fair, the studio did not have the budget for producing over 24 episodes and the manga was incomplete so I understand their decisions, its just that it was done so tactlessly and in a lazy way I can't help but feel angry.\\n\\n\r\nIF U WANT TO FULLY ENJOY AKAME GA KILL READ THE MANGA!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\r\nThanks for reading up till here if u did, 'prreciate it.",

            "content": "[Updated review]\r\nAkame ga Kill\u2026 Oh how I wanted to totally love Akame ga Kill. I really did. The concept was interesting and the first episode showed a great deal of promise. I watched the first few episodes quite happily, enjoying the characters silly antics in between the more serious plot and as time has progressed I began to feel a little betrayed and unfulfilled by the characters in particular. As a general summary, I enjoyed Akame ga Kill overall but felt there was definitely room for improvement.\r\nI can stay silent no longer! So I\u2019m going to try and keep my ranting to a minimum forthis review. I apologise in advance if I\u2019m not very successful. I\u2019ll also keep all spoilers to a minimum. \\n\\n\r\nStory 6\\n\\n\r\nMy original assumption for Akame ga Kill is that the story would be particularly character driven and while this is true in some senses, the failure of Akame ga Kill to develop the characters to an high emotional level and make us (as the audience) totally invested in them means that the story also suffers a little.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of Akame ga Kill is really fun and actually rather simple. A bunch of assassins (Night Raid) fighting against the Capitol and for some reason there are also danger beasts around\u2026 which other than giving the writers a reason to create the \u201cImperial Arms\u201d have no real impact on the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe first handful of episodes were generally focused on introducing you to the wide cast of characters which includes our titular character Akame. The introduction of Night Raid in episode one was done exceptionally well and I found myself excited for picking up this anime. \\n\\n\r\nFrom then on, the series is fairly episodic (up until nearer the end) with a different mission per episode to fight against the Capitol and help to \"develop\" characters. These missions are always interesting, intense and enjoyable to watch. The action, for the most part and in my personal opinion, cannot be faulted. I\u2019ve noticed a few reviews mentioning the excessive gore, I personally don\u2019t think that this was so out of place and actually quite appreciated it in some episodes. But then I like gore in animes so I\u2019m probably a little biased there\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill doesn\u2019t delve into anything particularly complex and neither does it take itself too seriously. I personally would like a little less comedy and a little more intensity but I do feel that the comedy helps us to like the characters and breaks up some of the darker scenes. The harem between Tatsumi and all the women in the show is not really needed but can make for some amusing conversations.\\n\\n\r\nI do also feel that at times Akame ga Kill suffers from \u201cstating the obvious\u201d where rather than showing us what a character is going to do, the writers have the characters tell us exactly what they plan to do as they are doing it, as though they do not trust the audience to be able to work it out for themselves. I have noticed this more and more as the episodes progress and it made me feel as though the writers thought \u201cHuh, do you think that the audience will get that Tatsumi feels this way about this certain situation? No? Well lets have him tell every man and his dog about it until we\u2019ve beat them across the head with it so much that it\u2019s lost its affect.\u201d Good shows do not do this, they expect the audience to have enough intelligence to work out things without being told five million times.\\n\r\nSaying all this, I felt like the ending was tied up rather well considering. I was actually not intending to focus so much on the overarching story itself as I feel each separate mission is genuinely enjoyable and reasonably well thought out. I genuinely have enjoyed each and every episode and found them compelling and interesting to watch. However\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5\\n\\n\r\nHere, in my opinion, is whether this show falls down. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have characters I really like but as time passes, I was more and more cautious about the characters I felt I could get invested in. \\n\\n\r\nMore often than not, I felt like the writers thought \u201cOh wait! We haven\u2019t killed anyone off in *two whole episodes*! Who should we kill off? Oh I know, let\u2019s kill off X\u2026 then Y\u2026 Then we can kill off Z. I bet the audience will be so heartbroken!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nNo. No. That is not how it works. \\n\\n\r\nThere are reasons why some anime characters have the most heartbreaking deaths in history and that is a wonderful thing called \u201ccharacter development\u201d. The problem with Akame ga Kill is that the character development is not very impressive. Sure, we get a very brief insight into each characters backgrounds but this is usually just as they are about to die which isn\u2019t really very useful now, is it? Character backgrounds are to help you really want a character to fight and live, not watch their backstory and be like \u201cThat\u2019s super interesting anddddd they\u2019re gone\u2026\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnd the titular character Akame is a character that I hardly felt attached to at all. I really really wanted to like her but I don\u2019t feel that she has the amount of screen time needed for me to fall in love with her character. In fact, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s said more than a handful of sentences in a lot of the episodes. She seems to just be there to look good and for Tatsumi\u2019s benefit. Which is a shame because the first episode made me think that she would get plenty of screen time and I would grow to love her just as much. She had such potential! Why waste it?\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that Akame ga Kill does do differently is try to make you care for the \u201cvillains\u201d, that is to say the anti-Night Raid group working for sadistic General Esdeath. I was pretty excited about this to begin with as I love likeable villains as much as I love likeable heros (case and point, Light from Death Note, Beatrice/Erika from Umineko). However, I find it extremely difficult to like some of these villains that the writers are desperately vying for us to fall in love with. Bols and Kurome are prime examples \u2013 they show the watchers the \u201ccutesy\u201d side of their characters (oh look, there\u2019s Kurome eating lots of the Japanese equivalent of what looks to be Jammy Dodgers biscuits, she\u2019s so kawaii) and then you see their murderous cutthroat bassassness and you begin to wonder how on earth you ever thought these characters were \u201cnormal\u201d. I think with a little more cautious writing and planning, the writers really could have made up connect with the villains as much as the heroes (something that they do very well in shows such as Shiki) but they just about missed the mark. Which is a real shame because I liked some of the villains even more than some of the heroes.\\n\\n\r\nSaying all of this, by no means do I want to put anyone off watching the show, all of the characters have interesting traits and character flaws that will always keep them interesting to watch. After moaning about the lack of character development, I realise that I do actually like the characters even if I do not feel invested enough to care how many the writers kill off. My favourite character who was killed off caused me to want throw my TV out of the window in response as it was a truly emotional ending and I could see that the writers had built up to it beautifully. So it can be done! But seriously, stop killing off a character an episode and expecting us to bawl our eyes out over it. As a viewer, I became immune to the deaths of the main character and my friend and I began to place bets on who will be next to go\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIf you do, like me, prefer deeper characters where if they die you will want to beat the writers over the head with something heavy, I would advise looking elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and Art 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty enough. It wasn\u2019t anything particularly special but the character designs were interesting. Very bright colours which are often contrasted with darker sketchier moments for more intense scenes. This seems to happen a great deal in the fight scenes. Though a few people seemed to feel the sudden change in art style was out of place, I rather like it.\\n\\n\r\nI adore the soundtrack. The OST is simply wonderful from the OP and EDs to the background music. It never feels out of place and fits in well with the action and especially the more serious moments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6\\n\\n\r\nAlright, alright. I know I promised not to rant and I got a little carried away.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my little rants about character development, I have genuinely enjoyed watching Akame ga Kill! I really have. The episodes have all been enjoyable and despite not feeling particularly as invested in the characters as I would have wished, I like them enough to understand their motivations and enjoy each episode separately. It is quick moving and no one episode is quite the same. So watch the show, but be careful not to let your expectations run away with you after the first episode!\\n",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill! is one of those shows that everyone seems to have completely different thoughts and opinions on. For every one person who will proudly proclaim themselves a fan of the series, there will be someone else who will call it absolute garbage. Unfortunately, this review will end up falling into the latter category.\r\n The story follows a young warrior named Tatsumi who ventures into the Empire's Capital hoping to earn money that would help save his village. Due to various whacky hijinks involving a family of psychotic sadists, Tatsumi learns about the corrupt and deeply sinister nature of the Empire, the rulerof which is a nine-year old child who had to assume control after the demise of his parents. Unfortunately, his young age makes him easy to manipulate for the despicable Prime Minister, Honest.\\n\r\n Tatsumi ends up being forcefully recruited by a rebellious group of assassins known as Night Raid, whose main objective is to kill the Prime Minister and bring light back to their bleak world. \\n\r\n This is a generic set-up but on its own it's harmless. The problem lies in its frankly embarrassing attempts at nuance. While it is true that not every AGK villain is purely evil, the show never once even tries to showcase the actual benefits of living under the current regime or the negative effects of Night Raid's actions. Whenever the innocents are suffering the perpetrators are always the Imperial goons and the assassins are always the good guys. This would not be such a big deal but this show really does genuinely make attempts to get the viewer to sympathise with its antagonists even though it makes no effort to make their cause worth sympathising with instead of being entirely on Night Raid's side. The Empire is pure evil. It is as simple as that. The conflict that AGK presents is a totally black and white and uninteresting one.\\n\r\n Perhaps there would be more time to flesh out the more subtle inner workings of the war if the show was not trying to cram the story that could easily go on for 50 episodes into just 24. The narrative of AGK is just beyond rushed and because of that character development is essentially non-existent. And even if someone does develop, it is handled poorly and breezed through (e.g. Bulat's character development in Episode 8 ultimately came down to a bunch of exposition being screamed over a fight scene). As a result, it becomes impossible to get truly attached to anyone. Which is a shame because there actually are some characters in this who had some potential. Most were completely worthless. Just a bunch of bland (Najenda), unlikeable (Chelsea), annoying (Lubbock), shallow (Tatsumi), underdeveloped (Leone) cardboard cut-outs. But among them there were those select few bright spots. For example, Run who did actually have genuinely interesting ideals and motives. Or Seryu, a severely psychologically broken law enforcer who takes a great deal of pleasure in enacting \"\"\"justice\"\"\" upon anyone whom she considers evil. And her definition of evil is pretty damn broad. Characters that really should be far more interesting than they ended up being if only they got some more development. Coming back to the examples listed previously, Run's motives go unexplored beyond just establishing them and he never gets to affect the story in any meaningful way. And Seryu, while pretty entertaining in how insane she is, is never developed at all. We get to learn about what made her the way she is and after that she is just a purely evil character.\\n\r\n And then there are the likes of Esdeath who are developed, but very poorly. Her arc is mainly done through her getting a school girl crush on Tatsumi. And the viewer is supposed to find it funny and charming even though Esdeath is a raging psychopath whose favourite pass-time is torturing people. Yeah.\\n\r\n Another issue with how the show handles its characters is  the rapid pace at which it's killing them off. The fact that after a certain point there is at least one major character death every episode or two, not only made it hard for them to resonate individually but it also made them very predictable (and yes, the weapons that the characters use, the Imperial Arms do have that rule placed upon them that when the users clash at least one has to die, but quite frankly that rule did not need to be there. It added to nothing, outside of serving as an excuse for the characters to get axed off faster).\\n\r\n On a more positive note, there actually were two characters in AGK that were handled somewhat competently. The titular Akame (who really should have been the MC instead of Tatsumi because she is just better than him in every way) and her sister Kurome. They were intriguing  individually and their relationship and shared history was the only truly compelling and even remotely well fleshed out part of the series.\\n\r\n As for the animation and visuals, Akame ga Kill! feels largely uninspired. The landscapes and general location designs are incredibly generic and forgettable making the world feel rather bland and not immersive. The fact that there is next to no lore to speak of beyond just a story about how the Imperial Arms came to be that was explained in an exposition dump does not help.\\n\r\n Most of the fight scenes are either way too overblown and all over the place to have much tension and using some largely underwhelming choreography or borderline feel like slideshows with some music played over them (e.g. the Zank fight in Episode 4 mostly consisted of static images).\\n\r\n The soundtrack on the other hand was quite good. The track that in particular comes to mind is the second opening theme, Liar's Mask which is epic, fast-paced where it needs to be and slower where it needs to be and perfectly encapsulates many of the show's core themes. In a way, it kind of does a better job telling the story than the show itself does.\\n\r\n The voice acting (for the English dub) was all around decent even if there were no true stand-outs.\\n\r\n Overall, Akame ga Kill! has little good to offer. With its badly developed cast of characters, terrible plot, uninspired visuals, forgettable action and just general bad writing this one is difficult to recommend.\\n",

I found it to be very simplistic/generic, but romance, op characters, action, ecchi, fantasy, and a generally decent plot (at least in my eyes), among other things were present; making it one of my favorite guilty pleasures in anime. I believe and assume the overall quality was tuned down a bit (complexity/plot), in order to grasp a very easy understanding from a more general audience, probably from a younger age. Casting those things among others aside, I think of Akamega Kill as quite a decent anime, I found it very enjoyable; while also finding myself attached to many things and scenes with a quite bit of sentimentality, which is why I gave it the rating I believe it deserved.",

            "content": "Where do I start with this anime? \r\nAkame Ga Kill is probably in my top 5 anime. It is a fast paced, action-packed anime with a pretty great story and was incredibly enjoyable to watch. The storyline was different to that of normal 'good versus evil' and showed the good and bad qualities of each character, even focusing on some of the 'good guys' as being 'bad guys' and vice versa. However the story itself was the typical, corrupted, bad guys trying to take over the world'? Let's kill them all! Apart from the cliche plot it was thoroughly enjoyable and I was hooked fromthe first episode. The characters were all very different, with incredibly different backgrounds and personalities. \\n\r\nOne thing about this anime I was confused about was the hype around Esdeath. Yes, she was a bad-ass character who could be pretty 'cool' (sorry for the pun). She was also very complex character wise in the way that she acted, the story about her past and her ambitions. However she was, in my opinion, very over hyped as to me she was quite the typical villain in most aspects.\\n\r\nAll in all the anime had amazing art, the soundtrack was incredible, the characters were quite complex (apart from one or two) and it was really enjoyable to watch. I would recommend it to anyone out there looking for a complex, interesting and dramatic anime full of action, tons of fighting scenes and a pretty boring main character (but it's alright because the other characters make up for the boringness of that one character). \\n",

            "content": "WARNING: CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS\r\nAkame ga Kill was a huge disappointment for me. I haven't read the manga but after watching episode 1 I had extremely high hopes for it, but all of it was dashed. Don't get me wrong there are some good bits to it, for example the character designs would pass as decent and ED 2 was just amazing and I like how they blended different timelines (e.g. Mine's Pumpkin and an Imperial empire). However, all in all it was pretty dreadful.\r\nFirst of all the story. I really liked the concept of an assassin group who functions to destroy the corrupt. However, asfor the story as a whole, it can be summed up by these words: So predictable it was unpredictable. Seriously I cannot think of a simpler plot. There wasn't a single major plot twist (Esdeath falling for Tatsumi doesn't count because that did not impact the story as a whole), and everyone would have guessed the outcome. Plus there are so many unanswered questions: how would they build a kingdom without bloodshed? What happened to the rest of the Jaegers? Who would be the new king? etc. which the team have completely ignored.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style I have to admit was decent. The character designs were really good and a huge step up from the manga, especially Akame. Her tatoos were also well designed and I praise the team for this. The array of colours and effects such as that of Mine's Pumpkin or Kurome's rise from Chealsea's sting were very enjoyable. However, the fight scenes were the most childish, tedious and downright stupid ones I have encountered. They seem to follow a formula:\\n\r\n1. Give up your element of surprise.\\n\r\n2. Declare your name.\\n\r\n3. Declare whether you are from Night Raid or the Jaegers.\\n\r\n4. Spend 5 minutes talking about what your Teigu does, its strengths and other details.\\n\r\n5. Spend another 5 minutes talking about why you think you will win this fight.\\n\r\n6. Engage for 10 seconds.\\n\r\n7. Be surprised at something of your opponent's.\\n\r\n8. Listen to your opponent repeat steps 2-5.\\n\r\n9. Repeat step 6.\\n\r\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 as many times as possible.\\n\r\n11. Finish them with a \"trump card\" you have saved for the last minute which you could have used in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was quite impressive actually. Iwasaki Taku did a good job with the BGM's which conveyed the mood of that moment extremely well. Skyreach was a fitting OP and Tsukiakari is one of my favourite OP/ED.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character development in the story is one of the worst I have seen. Even though most of them had a backstory, almost all could might as well have been killing robots instead of characters. They showed no compassion at all, they have no mercy and more than half the time walk away with nothing more than a shrug. Yes they are assassins but they just killed people in cold blood, and even though the victims aren't innocent, the characters should at least show some form of sorrow.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore all in all I believe akame ga Kill was a rather mediocre anime. It has a terrible story and dreadful character development. I personally would not recommend this to any people out there.",

            "content": "Cliched Fantasy , Political Anarchy , Assassination and Action is all Akame ga kill is about ; Or is it ??\r\nTo start of , i have watched this series since it first aired on the 7th of July having moderate hopes of enjoyment for the sake of fun and semi-objective time consumption.\r\nThe show starts of with a bold solid episode that captivates the viewer and intensifies the story right from the beginning. The main character Tatsumi is just another brainwashed hero of his village that goes on a journey to help his people from a corrupt state. On his journey he gets enlightened to bethe hero of true justice and freedom by falling and joining the hands of rebellious regime called Night Raid  , run by expert assassins with unique weapons and plans to overthrow the emperor to eradicate corruption and liberate civilians.\\n\\n\r\nI can start of by talking about the weapons or rather the ''Imperial Arms'' , they are a magnificent addition to the show. They exhibit power , strength and Magic concluded from the world of akame ga kill's danger beasts.  What truly bugs me is that i was never satisfied by how the weapons were presented or even how did characters acquire their Imperial Arms and whenever discussions about Imperial arms were existent they were just vague and shallow throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are shallower than the shallowest water you have ever seen or not seen in your life. No one is interesting , no one is unique , everyone has his own perspective of justice and defends it wholeheartedly. When the show progresses you would obviously realize that both fighting parties are fighting for the same cause which is justice , losses from both sides drive the viewer to ''JUST KISS EACH OTHER ALREADY'' moments , if those characters just had a little chit-chat in a bar they would come to terms and peace would instantly exist and the show would end peacefully with no losses, a happy ending basically.\\n\r\nAs i said before this show is bold , so you could expect the unexpected , it has awkward harem moments , a comedic relief which isn't always successful , sudden dramatic scenes and intense action sequences. You later on could deduce a specific pattern the show proceeds by repeating the above stuff over and over again but gets less impactful on the viewer the more it gets repeated. \\n\\n\r\nAkame ga kill is the type of show that doesn't focus or elaborate about the minuscule details it presents , and when something happens or is about to happen it will actually happen and nothing can stop it!!  What seems surprising or rather unexpected is how the characters and the world are so Cliched and have been countlessly repeated in a gazillion shows and still have a unique tweak to it. The outstanding pro and con at the same time is the risky twists that are integrated into the show's progress .\\n\\n\\n\r\nGive Akame ga Kill a try , you would be pissed , amazed , amused and a witness of great action but you will never be disappointed to a certain extent. Watch it if you like Action / Fantasy / Tragedy /Comedy(not really sure).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank You for reading this shit.",

            "content": "The Written Review of a Video Review on Akame ga Kill!\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nAkame ga Kill universe is set in some medieval ages/steam punk era. It\u2019s about a war raging between two sides, the capital and the rebels. Why they having this war is simple, the ruler of the Captial or the gluttons Prime Minister, who is manipulating the young naive kid emperor, to do his bidding. Because of how corrupt the capital is, there is going to be people who decided to stand up to them called the Rebels. \r\nAnd how do they fight them, with these weapons known as Imperial Arms. Now it\u2019s asaid fact an Imperial Arms user will always win in a battle, and when two imperial arms users clash one of them is going to die. But only a handful of people can use an imperial arms. And the Rebel\u2019s special ops, the Night Raid are group of assassins with Imperial Arms tasked with the job of killing the officials of capital and hence forth bringing peace and justice to the world. \\n\\n\r\nNow I must say, the story rather well paced. It was good mixture of peaceful days to dark nights. I found the story was appropriate in its approach separating the action and the dramas rather well\u2026until episode 20 that is. I read the manga, and I felt the anime really rushed the ending, and gave us a somewhat ok ending. It was a definitive ending. However I reckon they should\u2019ve ended at Chapter 49 in the manga and waited a few years for the Manga to have enough content to produce a 2nd season.  Because the last few episodes felt very rushed, and in the manga the characters get developed quite well. But this is anime review, not a manga review. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of characters in Akame ga Kill, because there\u2019s lot you have some very memorable, interesting and well developed characters, but you also have a handful of forgettable, uninteresting, unnecessary, throwaway characters. And that is a problem for show like Akame ga Kill, but also beneficial, because people are going to die, just to let you know. \\n\r\nSorry if I\u2019m giving spoiler hints or anything, just understand people will die, not even the main characters, no one is safe. \\n\\n\r\nNow although the show and mascot is called Akame ga Kill, Akame is not the main character. She is a socially awkward gluttons person. However when she is fighting, she becomes a cold blooded, badass unstoppable killer. Akame uses a sword known as Murasame, when it delivers a cut, a poison starts spreading through the body and there is no cure. It\u2019s disappointing because she\u2019s got a pretty messed up past along with her sister, and Akame isn\u2019t that well developed in this anime. Maybe they\u2019re setting up for an Akame ga Kill: Zero Anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe real main protagonist is Tatsumi, a country boy who initially traveled to the Imperial Capital to raise enough money to help his country town back home. Boy was he surprised when he discovered the Capital was corrupted. Now Tatsumi is you\u2019re kind guy, he believes in doing what\u2019s right and because of that sense of moral, he feels rather vulnerable. He starts off as weak person, but as he gets to interact with the people around him, he slowly becomes stronger, but there\u2019s still that sense of vulnerability, and I think that\u2019s what this series does right. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the main antagonist of the series. Esdeath, arguably the most loved character by fans of the show. She a sadistic psychotic person who lacks sympathy for the weak, if you die you deserve to die and if you live, you deserve to live. However she can show a softer side to when interacting with her teammates and towards Tatsumi, which makes you wonder, is she really a bad person, but then she starts killing things and laughing. She is represented as probably having the most OP Imperial Arms in the world, being able to control and manipulate Ice in thin air. Throughout the show, she is shown as an unstoppable killing machine. Which is really fitting for this show.\\n\\n\r\nI could go into details about the many more characters in Akame ga Kill. But I\u2019m not going to, in fact, I\u2019m going to name a few characters from the Night Raid and the Jaegers.  Mine, the loveable tsundere pink girl, Bulat the big bro and a surprisingly cool character. \\n\\n\r\nThe Jaegers are pretty much the counterparts of the Night Raids. The difference is the side they choose to fight with. And an occurring theme in the anime is morals, which side is right, why are you fighting for them instead of us, it\u2019s these questions that make some of the characters shine, but then there\u2019s also those clich\u00e9d good vs evil characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is rather standard and average to be honest, when it comes to the character looks. However each character design feels unique and depicts their personalities very well, but some of them can look pretty bland when it comes to colours and attire. The environments and backgrounds are rather cool, because the story takes places in quite a number of different locations, adding something different from time to time. And let\u2019s not forget where Akame ga Kill strongest point is, the fight scenes. Each action scene in Akame ga Kill is beautifully animated, each death and kill is met with satisfying brutality. Every fight scene is different, so you get a really good variety in how kills are made, and there is no random stoppage in fights. Thank god.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere were parts of the show where I did enjoy, and parts where I thought it was unnecessary. I really liked the show, I thought it was fun to watch, the action scenes is what makes this show, and the characters that were interesting is what I enjoyed. However I did not enjoy some of the unnecessary bad timing humour. I don\u2019t mind the joke in general, it\u2019s just the timing of the jokes, it can be a very emotional scene, then suddenly a joke crakes up, and it\u2019s feels unnecessary at times like that. But overall I really did enjoy the story and was very interested in seeing which side was going to come out on top, because the story created such a good potential for an ending where anything could happen. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, I wished the anime didn\u2019t rushed through the last couple of episodes and, I would\u2019ve much rather they ended on Chapter 49, which would\u2019ve been a great place to end a season. I liked the story and some of the characters, but I don\u2019t think it really out shined or produced something special other than the action scenes. For the music, is pretty alright I guess, not going to lie, I\u2019m fan boying all over Liar Mask. \\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re going to like this anime if you like violence and awesome action scenes. You\u2019re probably not going to like this anime if you were looking for something amazing. It\u2019s still a fun show to watch though, so I give Akame ga Kill an 8.0, because it was really fun to watch despite its flaws. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Oh boy, where to start with this one. Akame ga Kill is a bit of a train wreck. One I didn't really mind watching, but in a way were you know a disaster is going to happen and are compelled to watch it happen.\r\nStory: Good god, what a mess. I'm going to break this down into parts to hopefully not resort to ranting. Starting with the setting. Typical medieval kingdom/fantasy setting that looks like it's from a generic RPG game. The world building is abysmal. The empire doesn't even have a name, nor do any of the towns or other notable locations. Neither does theemperor. That just seems lazy to me. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the actual plot. Naive, stereotypical shounen protagonist gets roped into a rebel faction trying to fight the system in a kingdom run by evil people. Nothing super special. There's fighting, blood and gore. Expect to see body parts being cut off, heads decapitated, and various other forms of violence. Oh and death. Lots of death. The typical plot armor that usually prevents any of the main cast from dying? Completely absent here. So much of the main cast dying makes death lose its significance. Plus death flags abound. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, elements that just agitated me. The Imperial Arms. Granted, they're really cool, but most of them come with 'trump cards' that characters whip out mid battle and can result in an insta win. What is the point of the entire battle if the character could've just 1 hit ko-ed their opponent? Also the abuse of anime logic. Having weapons inside of character's bodies, characters still clinging to life when they've literally been ripped in half, characters surviving inside giant animal's stomachs... It just goes on and on. Lastly the petty and ill timed humor. It feels out of place and awkward, and it just isn't funny. Other plot holes and issues are present but they'd take forever to list.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Meh. Some battle scenes were sloppy, but overall nothing overly offensive.\\n\\n\r\nSound: One thing this series actually did well was sound. The music and overall soundtrack worked well with the show, and the voice actors fit their characters nicely. Not too shabby.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Now back to the bad. The cast is so flat and one dimensional, and EVERY character is an archetype. Every. single. one. The protagonist could not be more of a Gary Stu who every female falls in love with if he tried. As for the rest of the night raid... Big brother figure? Pervy dude? The clumsy chick? The mysterious aloof girl? All present and accounted for. Loli variety tsudere? Check. Twisted villain who has a strange obsession with the protagonist? Double check. And for the most part, none of them really evolve beyond any of their archetypes. There is one notable exception. But for an anime with 24 episodes, having one character who feels like more than a flat archetype is kind of lame.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the villains, none of their motivations are shown at all. If they are, it's that they enjoy being evil or torturing people, etc. And frankly there is nothing that I loathe more than villains with no valid motive aside from their own personal amusement.\\n\\n\r\nShockingly I didn't hate the series. I honestly can't really pinpoint why, but I still acknowledge that it is pretty subpar. The reason for its popularity remains mysterious to me.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Want a stereotypical battle anime set in medieval times about overthrowing a corrupt regime? Here you go. Just don't expect much character depth or development, nor should you expect any world building. Also prepare yourself for plenty of gore, death and the use of anime logic.",

Starts with a great modern Fantasy set up where an empire is ruled by the voracious and evil Minister who controls the country with violence by manipulating the young Emperor to his carnal and selfish desires! Imperial arms have been forged, many in the shape of weapons, which carry powerful magic and are distributed among the country\u2019s army. Some are missing until it becomes clear the renegade group \u2018Night Raid\u2019 have themwhose sole purpose is to defeat these strong soldiers and kill the Minister, thus saving the entire kingdom. Great Set-up right? I wish I could say the same for the rest! The story quickly becomes boring once you recognize it\u2019s following \u2018the monster of the week\u2019 policy and you hastily understand its comparisons to \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 after witnessing the 1st gruesome death. Personally, this can\u2019t be even compared to GOT but I must say the lack of plot armour really sets the mood until you realize this is the only trick in the magic hat! The uncertainty during fights raised the thrills as both sides were in danger of dying but therein lies the show biggest weakness since they couldn\u2019t offer anything else. More accurately what else they presented wasn\u2019t that good. Many people seem to either blame or defend the show for its many number of deaths but I only had that problem for the last episodes. My issue arises mainly from the way these deaths were portrayed! Very immature, the way how the characters reacted. After an emotional death, weak attempts at cracking jokes were taxed just to bring the mood to its relaxed and light setting! Poor choice, for you never start to take them seriously after the first failed effort. The quick tonal changes from slapstick comedy to a heavy scene and then back again were totally unjust. \\n\r\nThe dark-haired girl, Akame is actually a side character while the MC, Tatsumi, is a generic na\u00efve guy who lacks any distinguishing qualities. Not much light is shone on character development so I won\u2019t go into details except point out that people on both sides are almost alike! The only difference is who they kill for. One does it for the Minister while the other does it with the intention of saving the country by overthrowing the government. Aside from 2 or 3 exceptions, the rest are generally good people. This springs a weird case where some of these villains are more relatable than the heroes themselves!\\n\\n\r\nA major credit to the anime for its display of action sequences, always opting for nonstandard fighting style due to the variety of weapons used. The animations were different for each major character, bringing their own flare into the action scenes. The show also doesn\u2019t shy away from any blood so when people die, they usually do in a horrible way! And we know the characters are going to die but it\u2019s the way they do that really stands out for the same deaths aren\u2019t repeated. And I should mention the soundtrack which is soooooo good! I still can\u2019t get enough of \u2018Le chant de Roma\u2019 which is the best track of the show, channelling in the vibe of the \u2018Witcher\u2019 games OST and its truly addictive to the ears! I do hate anime\u2019s that\u2019s composed of amazing soundtrack but can\u2019t deliver that WOW factor with the rest and unfortunately this falls into that category too. The only problem with this track is that it fits a more serious tone which this show strains away from thus this amazing soundtrack feels out of place. The animation art depicting violence is well done with all the blood and gore but I didn\u2019t appreciate the whole cutesy and innocent approach to characters who were involved in something dark or terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime just wasn\u2019t grave enough, for it swerves you into thinking it\u2019s going from bad to worst but elects back to its light tone. As if the show is afraid of crossing that line. I understand they didn\u2019t want to fall for \u2018takes itself too seriously\u2019 ruse but a little more balance would have gone a long way! Storytelling is rushed and the unnecessary deaths of some characters were so badly written, you can tell they were just included to elicit strong reaction from the viewers! A lot of praise comes to the show on behalf of pulling stunts like this but when they are done in such meaningless ways, you can\u2019t help but be frustrated with the forced \u2018Shock factor\u2019. I had the same problem with \u2018GANTZ\u2019 where they use the same tactic. Killing a character cause, you don\u2019t know how to develop them is bad writing, keep on echoing the same formula and it becomes predictable. Very entertaining for those just looking for some cool action only and no plot or character development. Ending was meh but I really need a remake of this and bring back the \u2018Roma\u2019 track cause that\u2019s too special!\\n",

            "content": "Akame Ga Kill! was probably the first anime I viewed critically, following the story of our main protagonist Tatsumi on his pursuit of success in The Capitol, where he soon realises the ugly and corrupted side of the city. The storyline itself is very typical of the anime's genre, wherein the unlikely hero despite his naivety manages to overcome all odds blah blah blah, with each of the main characters getting the spotlight at some point, with good character development throughout. The unique standpoint, in which the story is from the point of the technical 'bad guys' while being viewed as the 'good guys' isrefreshing to watch and thought provoking at times. The artwork and animation style is seamless, with unique and interesting character design regarding both human characters and others. There is an intricate blend of humour, romance, action and tragedy which flows expertly throughout the story. The main criticism I have of this anime is the sheer and unsubtle way in that *spoiler alert* pretty much everyone dies. The reasoning for this is clear; the creators clearly wanted this anime to be more realistic in way that in the vast majority of shonen anime, the main protagonists seem invulnerable to death, and somehow they always end up coming back to life. AkaKill bears no such obligation, and has a habit of killing off a character immediately after the audience finds out more or gets an emotional investment in said character. I do feel that this rather obtuse method of dealing with the issue of mortality in an anime could have been better used in a different medium, since this message of vulnerability and the reality of death cannot be taken as seriously as it should be when it is set in a world where high-tech weapons and bio-engineering are commonplace, but the primary form of transport is horseback. The series, while the themes are not especially deep nor complex, is not one that requires that great a level of attention to enjoy. It is an anime that should be watched casually, where you take the action for what it is and use as an effective form of escapism.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a thoroughly enjoyable anime, with ample action to keep you on the edge of your seat that will keep the ecchi/harem/romance fans happy as well.",

            "content": "Intro:\r\nWhile surfing through the anime community, I noticed that for one anime in particular, there seemed to be a lot of confusion from its fanbase about why it was that many of the more critical reviewers hated one of their favorite shows from this year. As you could probably tell already, the show in question is Akame ga Kill, a Fantasy Action/Adventure anime that aired during the Summer and Fall seasons of 2014. \r\n        Well, I decided that today I would attempt to answer that question. Why do the critics hate Akame ga Kill so much? \r\nStory Undercutsits own Drama:\\n\\n\r\n        On premise alone, Akame ga Kill sounds like it could be a pretty good show. I mean, who doesn\u2019t like hot assassins, a rebellion against an Evil Empire, and knights with magic weapons? The inclusion of these must-have\u2019s for any Fantasy story is helped out by the fact that the first episode pulls an excellent bait and switch in an attempt to completely sell viewers on this show. Tatsumi, our naive hero, comes to the big city looking to earn money to help his poor village. Upon arriving though, he is treated like crap by the soldier enlistment office, taken advantage of by a thief (thus losing all of his money), and forced to spend the night on the street. But as the story progresses, he is spotted by a kind, noble girl and taken into her loving home.\\n\\n\r\n        The twist is that she and her family are all sadistic murderers. And on top of that, they have previously captured his two friends in the same way, with one already tortured to death and the second eventually dying in Tatsumi\u2019s arms. This unexpected turn does a good job of playing upon our expectations, which up until this point had been a generic beginning, and then twisting them into something legitimately surprising. It was a great way to catch the audience off-guard and intrigue them with promises of being a show that constantly is subverting your expectations. But more importantly than that, it is an extremely emotional moment for Tatsumi, where not only is his very worldview shaken but his best friends are dead. This should be the moment in the show where we form our emotional connection with the main character and really sympathize with him over this tragic turn of events. \\n\\n\r\n        Instead, the series proceeds to completely ruin this dramatic moment by immediately having the other characters crack jokes as they kidnap Tatsumi in a very slap-stick manner; and he acts more like the straight man in an anime rom-com than a person in shock. This jarring and massive tonal shift completely dispelled any sense of tension or drama in the previous scene we had just witnessed. It\u2019s at this point I believe many critics jumped ship in this series, since it just shows how amateur the writing in this show can be. \\n\\n\r\n        You see, using Mood Whiplash in a situation like this is about as big a no-no in storytelling as there is. Since when you\u2019re crying, you don\u2019t feel like laughing; and when you\u2019re laughing, you don\u2019t feel like crying. So, if you\u2019re objective with a certain scene is to, oh I don\u2019t know, show a character experiencing the most tragic moment of their life so far and thus create sympathy for this character from the viewer, you shouldn\u2019t immediately go into a goofy scene filled with silliness and slap-shtick humor, since you\u2019ll end up undercutting your own drama by not giving the audience enough time to process what\u2019s happened and feel any sort of connection to the character who is undergoing this emotional moment. Not to mention, now your comedic scene is ruined so all the jokes seem in poor taste since, you know, this guy just had a childhood friend die in his arms. This is a textbook example of an Immersion Breaking experience and it sucks the viewer right out of the story. \\n\\n\r\n        It\u2019s not like this was a one-time deal either. The failure to smoothly and logically transition out of dramatic moments is quite common in this anime. This makes it the show\u2019s biggest flaw, since these colossal shifts in tone completely undermines every single one of the series\u2019 emotionally powerful moments. When drama is constantly interrupted and replaced by comedy, it makes me think \u201cif the characters don\u2019t take what is happening seriously, why should I?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n        Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s completely possible to have comedy and serious drama in the same show. Series like Cowboy Bebop and Hunter x Hunter are some of the best anime out there, partly because of how well they are able to balance comedy and drama in the same show. However, the difference between a show like Bebop or HxH and Akame ga Kill is that they make sure to keep the emotional scenes and comedic scenes far apart from each other, so the audience isn\u2019t left confused about whether they should be taking the dramatic moments seriously or not. Instead of you know, having them literally 30 seconds apart from each other, which leaves a bitter taste in your mouth every time the show attempts to take itself seriously. \\n\\n\r\nFails as an Action Anime:\\n\\n\r\n        Now, before all you Akame ga Kill fans that are miraculously still here stop reading and jam your fingers from pressing the Dis-like button, allow me to explain what I mean here. One of the most common rebuttals I\u2019ve seen from this show\u2019s fanbase is that sure, it\u2019s not the best written story in the world, but it\u2019s still a fun, enjoyable show because of its\u2019 cool action scenes. Or, to put it another way, it\u2019s got the same appeal as something like Sword Art Online, only Akame ga Kill is more \u201cmature\u201d because of all the blood and gore.\\n\\n\r\n        Here\u2019s the difference though, in SAO, they actually have REALLY great action scenes that are well-animated and beautifully choreographed. Some of it\u2019s even so good that even us hard-asses forget all the flaws Sword Art has and are lost in the kick-ass fights in the show. Akame ga Kill doesn\u2019t even have this going for it because during the production of the show it seems like the animators forgot what they\u2019re primary job is when adapting a manga is to\u2026you know\u2026bring the story to life by ANIMATING IT!!\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd this is what I mean when I say that Akame ga Kill fails as an action show. Whenever there\u2019s a fight in the show, they hardly ever animate anything!  You just get a bunch of still-image frame shots of the after-effects of a blow, or of a character preparing to strike, but you never actually get to see the blow itself. \\n\\n\r\n\tYou see, basically what happens in  Akame ga Kill is that the animators just color in the panels from the manga and then turn them into a PowerPoint presentation while animating as little as they possibly can. \\n\\n\r\n\tTo illustrate my point in greater detail, let\u2019s take an in-depth look at the Tatsumi vs. Zank the Executioner fight. This, according to the wonderful Youtube community, is the best fight in the entire show, and even here you can see the flaws in this show\u2019s animation. \\n\\n\r\n\tWhen you watch the video, you\u2019ll notice during the first attack sequence by Tatsumi, his sword swings are never actually animated. All we see is him constantly about to swing his sword and then in the next frame it transitions to after his blow has already been delivered and dodged by Zank, which also isn\u2019t actually animated, and the closest we get to seeing the actual attack itself is a blue afterimage which is literally just a thick line that the artist put into the shot. We never get to see an actual blow go from start to finish in one fluid motion. \\n\\n\r\n\tOh no! The animation budget ran out! Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll just take a picture, shade it differently than how the rest of the anime looks, then do a slow pan up on the image (an effect even I can do on Windows Movie Maker) and everyone will call it \u201cepic\u201d!   \\n\\n\r\n\tNow they\u2019re splurging here by having Zank in an animation loop of dodging these dangerous blue flashes of light! Oh, here comes Zank\u2019s attack! Oooooh, look at that! Instead of seeing him actually attacking our hero, we get to see some pretty sparks and lights instead! Fancy.\\n\\n\r\n\tLet\u2019s contrast this with a fight that actually has some effort put into its presentation shall we? The Lancer vs. Archer fight in Episode 0 of the new Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works anime. Notice how in these clips, how you can clearly see each and every move that the combatants make from start to finish. Every strike is extremely fluid, detailed, and flows beautifully from action to action so that you can\u2019t help but get pumped up as the two fighters exchange blows. This is because you\u2019re just completely and totally captivated by the amazing animation since each and every move made by either character is presented to us in full during this breath-taking action scene.    \\n\\n\r\n\tIn  Akame ga Kill, it just feels like every action scene was put together by the animation crew lazily. Like they were putting it together using as little effort (and by extension time and money) as possible in order to say they\u2019ve put an action scene into the show. Honestly, it seems like the majority of the time, the animators were more interested in drawing the blood and making the anime \u201cedgy\u201d and gory as possible than they were in delivering us passable fight scenes. Because of this, the animation in the show is nothing more than mediocre and no different than you could find in any other Action or Battle Shonen out there. It also begs the question: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t worth the animators time to give proper attention to the show\u2019s action scenes, why is it worth my time?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\n        And that leads us to the real reason why many critics, myself included, don\u2019t like  Akame ga Kill. We just don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s worth your precious time. Because here\u2019s the thing, if you like and enjoy Akame ga Kill, that\u2019s awesome. We aren\u2019t here to tell you what you can and can\u2019t enjoy, no critic should, but it is our job to tell you if something is worth your time. \\n\\n\r\n        The problem with Akame ga Kill in this regard though is that pretty much everything that could be viewed as a strength or a reason to watch this anime, has been executed better in other shows that are more worthy of your time. It\u2019s not so much that we critics don\u2019t think people can or should enjoy  Akame ga Kill, it\u2019s just that we believe that your time would be better spent on shows that-if you liked Akame ga Kill-you will enjoy even MORE.\\n\\n\r\n        For example, if one of the reasons why you watched and enjoyed Akame ga Kill was because of its Fantasy setting: one that we honestly don\u2019t see that often in anime, then I would recommend that you watch Rage of Bahamut: Genesis. A super-fun, cool, adventure show that came out during the Fall Season which builds a very interesting Fantasy world in half the episodes of Akame ga Kill and is executed ten times better. Hardly anyone ended up watching this show though because it got ran over by the Akame ga Kill Hype Train, which is a shame because I would wager that every fan of Akame ga Kill would love Rage of Bahamut.\\n\\n\r\n        And this is the case for pretty much any merit that can be found in Akame ga Kill. If you want a Gory/Edgy Fantasy series, then you would be much better off watching something like Berserk. An anime that is very mature, has plenty of blood, characters dying in gruesome fashion, and is filled with much more complex and badass characters than Akame ga Kill could dream of. \\n\\n\r\n        Or, if you REALLY want something that\u2019s exactly like Akame ga Kill but with much better action and animation, then you want: A  Goofy Harem with Lots of Blood, Action, Tits and Ass, but unlike Akame ga Kill,  doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything more than that and ends up being much more enjoyable and fun ride because of that The Anime. AKA: Highschool of the Dead.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in more content from me, check out my Youtube channel: Caf\u00e9 Anime! Until next time!\\n",

How is Tatsumi and Night Raid efforts to  destroy the old kingdom?\r\nThe art is really good, White Fox Studio is really adorable to interpret such kind of world. The fighting animation is really good, so I give it 8 out of 10.\r\nBoth opening and ending soundtracks are really good andfit to the such of theme of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the characters inside is really strong, influenced by any aspects inside the plot. You can see how a certain character develop both emotionally and ability. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy the series, but somehow the ending is quite disappointed for me.

Though they were things that I had seen over and over,there were moments that I actually had fun watching this show.Then they started on a downhill slide that they never come out of.\r\nSPOILER ALERT!\r\nI am not a person who throws a fit when a character dies.It happens.It sucks. When you have come to really like the character,but again like real life,people die.But when there is absolutely no reason for a character to be killed off besides trying to make the story more\"dark\",\"deep\",and \"gory\",I get irritated.Half the characters did not need to die,and the way most kicked the bucket felt almost insulting.Like the smallest stupidest things were killing off characters one by one,to the point you did not want to have any connection with them,thus pushing the viewer and the story farther away.\\n\\n\r\nThen where they skipped vital information in one episode skipping way ahead to the next felt like another slap in the face. I had to go back because I thought I had missed something, but no, instead it was writers awkwardly trying to bridge a gap.One minute theres going to be a huge fight between several main characters, then the next they are all just strolling around together giving no explanation on how they managed to escape? Main character saves a girls life, next minute they are dating? Where there was NOTHING to lead us to believe they had any kind of connection.\\n\\n\r\nThen there was no attempt from then on out on trying to make the story flow smoothly,it was just,fight seen,someone dies,rinse and repeat until everyone is dead.Then an awkward goodbye from the two surviving characters,with no kind of conclusion.I wasted 5 days of my life on this show that someone did not put any thought or heart into, but instead took a half ass approach to make a \"thought provoking\" anime by showing some blood and guts.This is pass from my end,and I was my hands of this show",

It wasn't really the case. Only real death in SnK that I felt a lot of emotion for was Petra. Akame Ga Kill had a lot more characters, each with a good backstory which really helps become closer to the character and feel a lot of despair for each death. \r\nAkame ga Kill is your typical action anime where a small force of do-gooders are trying to fight thereigning political regime. Of course, it has it's own twist with dangerous magical beasts and weapons that defy logic. But for the most part, I felt as though that's where the anime sort of killed itself. It focused too much on the weaponry that was available, and not enough into the story itself, not that the story wasn't good, but that it could have been made better if it were not for the weapons that the story primarily focused on. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn't bad at all. It had a very good plot. Almost all the main characters were given good backstories as to who they are, and why they do what they do, and this includes some of the antagonists. But one main backstory that the anime missed out on was that of the Advisor to the king, who is himself the primary Antagonist. I think it was negligence at the part of the mangaka to have left out such a critical part of the puzzle out. Why is he evil? Why does he do what he does? All we see is a tyrannical manipulative glutton who does what he wants, and that's not really fulfilling to see at all. Other than that, the anime did itself justice by giving itself good characters with good backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nFights are generally good. They're not too drawn out, and they get to the point without too much fanfare and suspense. Other than that, there's not really much to write about with the fights. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an anime worth watching. I've heard rumors of this anime getting a second season and I sorely hope that it's untrue. The story has ended, and trying to progress it further would not let this anime die gracefully.",

            "content": "*This Review Contains Spoilers*\r\nI would personally say I am easily amused sometimes.\r\nThis trainwreck of a show however was not the least bit amusing.\r\nThe story at the start seemed as if it was going to be some dark, gritty show which I thought had a lot of potential. However it slowly began to spiral into a more shounen type show with up beat characters which seemed completely out of place. The main character's best friends had literally just died (that's in the first episode btw so don't start crying about spoilers) and he suddenly seemed to be in this up beat organization and completely fine abouthis two dearest friends being tortured by a psychotic family. They try and make you feel as if he does feel bad with the odd \"CURSE YOU FOR KILLING MY FRIENDS\" but then he's off being an upbeat piece of annoying bs.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole Imperial arms feature felt completely out of place and gave a more shounen feel to the show instead of a group of hardened assassins hell bent on changing the city in an underground manner. Yet they seemed to be participating in full frontal assaults with their massive weapons and last time I checked that wasn't what assassins did. I mean for gods sake one of them has a giant bloody pair of scissors how is that in anyway discrete, the only one who could be considered was the one with the sniper rifle and possibly the strings dude.  Chelsea a girl introduced a bit later in the series is the only one of these \"assassins\" who seems to have any infiltration skills.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound was fine but then again no matter how pretty you make a piece of sh*t look it's still a piece of sh*t.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was horrendous and leaves you wondering who the hell the main character is in this god forsaken show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was boring and left you with an awful feeling. I hated it because they killed of any characters with actual potential (RIP Shelly I actually liked you) and the story and set up was an absolute shambles. It might have worked better as a shounen anime but they tried to give it an edgy setting but with the characteristics of a shounen anime but it simply didn't work",

            "content": "Akame Ga Kill. Just the title is enough to catch your attention. When I first heard about this anime, I was fairly new to watching Anime as a whole. This review might look biased because of how inexperienced I was, but it doesn't necessarily mean I was blind to not see what faults the Anime had. Now onto the Review.\r\nStory(5/10): The story is simple to follow. Tatsumi, a young teenager, is on his way to the capital to earn money and save his village. While this concept was dropped four episodes later, and didn't reemerge until the last episode, I knew it wasn't the basisof the story just by watching the first episode. The real plot is that the capital was filled with corruption and unnecessary evil, and it was Night Raid's job to purge the capital of that evil. While the story was rather true to it's roots, it had quite a lot of pacing issues. Even though their main objective was to eliminate the evil within the capital, the story jumped quite often not leaving you with any time to evaluate what was happening and their progress to taking down the capital. Characters die almost every other episode, and it leaves a rift where you'd think that the disappearance of that certain character would have an effect on that certain sides strength. Take for instance, when the were discussing how to defeat an overpowered character, they assumed that it would take 10 or so characters with special weapons called \"Teigus\" to defeat. Definitely not the case. That is where the story has it's inconsistency, it also likes to deviate from the intense action and heart wrenching moments, and add some comedy which really isn't necessary. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound(8/10): The Art and Sound are at the least commendable. The dark atmosphere was intensified due to the soundtrack, and fights are all animated pretty well. Characters look like they were done nicely, and the voice acting matched perfectly with their characters personas. There are some times where you might not notices the soundtrack in the background, but to where it matters most, it helps intensifies some scenes by it being present.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(6/10): Characters are what make a good story. You can have imagined the best story possible, but it only really shines when the characters are there to keep it interesting and moving forward. With that said, Akame Ga Kill characters don't differentiate themselves from typical Anime stereotypes. They look like they're unique and different because of the art and what they typically wear, but on the inside there isn't much difference between character types. They are at least interesting to a certain degree. Their relationship with each other and how they interact with each other is entertaining. An issue however is that the producers of the anime decides to kill off characters too quickly, leaving no time to grow feeling for the characters. There are some characters you'll care for maybe because you just like their personality, or maybe you just think they're cool, nonetheless it'll be hard for you to actually \"care\" about a character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10): Here's where it may sound like I'm being biased, especially since I didn't score the Story or Characters to highly. I don't hate the Anime, not by a long shot. This is one of the first one's I watched, but after getting more experienced with Anime, I see the faults that it tries to hide. I had a great time watching this Anime, and would likely watch it again in the future. The plot doesn't seem all that interesting after you're a couple episodes in, and you notice how the characters aren't very unique. You can however expect it to at least be an entertaining series which you'd want to continue moving forward. It may not be on par with the best out there, but it's definitely something worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(7/10): It's a very solid Anime, it could have been better if the producers gave it more time for characters to develop, it would increase the impact of the story significantly. I do understand that they had to restrict it to 24 episodes, but they went about it the wrong way. Instead of introducing more and more characters, they should have stayed with the original members and worked with them, rather than send them to their deaths early without any character development. It is still something that can be enjoyed even with its flaws.",

            "content": "This review may contain spoilers so read at your own risk.\r\nOverall: So I'm going to go against the general opinion here and say that Akame ga Kill! is not as bad an anime as some make it out to be. It is certainly flawed, but nevertheless enjoyable.\r\nStory: While not the most original of plots, Akame ga Kill! offers an interesting story where it's interesting to see how everything will turn out. One thing to note is how the series takes a dark turn. While not the lightest of stories, the first few episodes mainly revolve around assassinating targets and Tatsumi's often comedic interactions within theassassin group (though sometimes it is inappropriate and unrealistic). However, it becomes much deeper when the Empire decides to take more action against Night Raid, which causes things to become much more troubling for them. There is a large amount of death and carnage at this point, with surprising character deaths and outcomes. However, after episode 18, the anime takes its original route regarding the conclusion of the story. This, as many others have said, is too rushed. Conflicts are resolved way too easily and the pacing is too fast. However, that was only 25% of the story, the other 75% is interesting and engaging.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is absolutely gorgeous, from character designs to background, Akame ga Kill! offers a variety of colours to suit the mood from bright and vibrant to dull and dark. Character designs are well done, though there is oversexualization in some parts, but overall, the art is excellent, and the animation is fluid and never unneccessary.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is very fitting, with distinct tunes, though it's not something that stands out. The first OP is very catchy, and the second OP seems darker, which reflects the transition of moods in the anime. The voice acting on the most part is good, especially Akame's during a certain scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Here is where many have shown disapproval. While it is true that the quick pacing of the series makes it difficult to get connected to characters, this is a 24-episode anime, and death is something to be expected as the plot thickens. One thing I found interesting is how the anime showed that despite the Capital's corruption, there are those in there who maintain benevolence, showing that Night Raid's actions aren't always 100% justifiable. However, this did not get touched upon very much, which is disappointing. Another disappointing factor is that the villains seemed simply evil with no depth to them other than enjoying causing carnage. On the other hand, I enjoyed how the anime conveyed the theme that everyone is ultimately human, shown by Akame's emotions and Esdeath's love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite its flaws, I feel that the pros of this anime overshadow the cons, and is in general a very enjoyable experience. \\n\\n",

Most viewers who are new to anime will pick up on the fact that there are a number of episodes which focus primarily on explaining the motivations and relationships of the enemy team unlike in typical good vs evil books or shows in the west seeking to make the enemy as despicable aspossible.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound is excellent with some great fight scenes - no complaints or issues there.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with the series though is also in part it's strength. It is the fact that the story portrays the cost and consequence of battles and war - i.e. there is a lot of destruction and death. While this is a realistic aspect, overdoing  it desensitises the audience. Likewise, while some tragedy can drive conflict and character growth, too much of it is just plain depressing. \\n\\n\r\nI won't go into spoilers but suffice to say that while I enjoyed the series, it failed to make the most of what came before. I felt that it wasted some of the great setup and development and in some instances how the characters interacted were inconsistent with how they were portrayed earlier, particularly in the relationship between Tatsumi and Esdeath, as well as the evolution of Seryuu. Some things just didnt make sense and that was disappointing in a show that aimed to have significant tension and conflict. \\n\\n\r\nThe abundance of characters introduced - like lambs to the slaughter in some regards also limited the character development somewhat. After watching this series and reflecting on it, I've decided arbitrarily that shows should probably aim to limit death to perhaps not more than 20% of the characters, because more than that leads to a sort of diminishing returns in terms of emotional impact.  I just wish they had toned down a few elements to maximise the emotional impact of some of the brilliant set pieces there. I just wish they had toned down a few elements to maximise the emotional impact of some of the brilliant set pieces there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though the story is certainly a much darker exploration of the genre, compared to others of it's type. I would recommend people interested in action in a fantasy setting, definitely check this out.",

            "content": "Every single episode name starts with word \"Kill\". Akame ga Kill is series focused on killing, assassination and fighting evil with evil. As much as I want to say about this anime, I won't express my full feelings because I want to keep this review spoilerless.\r\nSo what's up with Akame ga Kill ?\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nStory is very simple and quiet messy. Young boy named Tatsumi comes to new town, then he gets in assassination group called Night Raid which focuses on putting down corruption in the capital. They are targeting  prime minister - ugly bastard that is manipulating current very young emperor and that leadsto pointless bloodshed, ubiquitous poverty and other bad things.\\n\\n\r\nWhole story, at the beginning feels that it had great potential, but ended up only decent. Is it unique in some way ? Yes, and that is a very good thing. By the introducing Teigu ( Imperial Arms) story or rather I could say fights scenes and characters were more interesting. Basically there are a lot of Teigus even ones that are ultimate weapons of mass destruction. What makes it more fun that those Imperial Arms vary in a lot of ways. We come a cross super-armor types, then we see something like string/wire manipulator, after that we come through badass laser-cannon and so on. Every Teigu is unique on its own, and gives user his very own abilities, but user must be compatible with Imperials Arms of choice.\\n\\n\r\nWhy the story feels messy ?\\n\\n\r\nIt has no real conclusion, ending feels rushed and empty. Sure, from the start we know that Night Raid wants to put down evil guys in Capital, but what after that ? Is something more to it ? Sadly... no. Although there are some mini-plots like struggle between Akame and her Sister that makes story a bit more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the biggest problem with the story - Meaningless, stupid and illogical... deaths. First of all, the death ratio is way to high. Characters don't get enough development before their death and thus the tragedy isn't actually that emotional. At some point it becomes like not what will happen next rather WHO will die next in horribly brutal way... Its just becomes disgusting. Death scenes atmosphere alone are often ruined by some out of place comedy that occurs after the scene.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that death of the main or close to main character is bad thing, it is actually very good to make a show more serious, but in Akame ga Kill, where someone dies there and someone dies over here its just pointless. Death are meant to have some meaning behind it, some purpose, and nearly all of the deaths in this series do not advance the plot further nor make the show more mature/serious. I would enjoy this show way more if all this mess just didn't happened.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOutstanding Art. It shows in a great way which emotions characters are feeling, fight scenes are spectacular due to slim lineart and great camera angles. It is not unique by any means but it still shines. Backgrounds are fairy simple, but solid too. What makes it more amazing is dynamics of animation, vivid colors and visible contrast between colors, they are great and makes fight scenes live.\\n\\n\r\nGore. Overflowing gore, you will definitely like art in this one if you love seeing gushing blood, detached legs, arms and heads.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality does not worsen through the show, it remains great, solid and lively.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSFX are top notch ! Clashing weapons, precise footsteps, fantastic sounds of Imperial Arms, its just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOpenings and Endings - first opening and first ending are worse than second ones. Latter are way more fitting and conveys in great way the feelings of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOST is godly. Iwasaki Taku is responsible for this outstanding tracks. Music varies from gentle singing, through harsh rock, to fantastic chorus. Everyone will find fitting piece for themselves. OST makes great atmosphere and fight scenes way more intense and it fits really well with violence in the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are simple in this one but well designed and ok-written. I won't talk about everyone but here are the most important ones:\\n\\n\r\nAkame - Title characters that actually is not the main protagonist. Cold-hearted but with portion of kind emotion. She cares about her comrades very much. Her design is harsh and is really expressing her dark style.\\n\\n\r\nMine - Tsundere, my favourite one from this show. Her design, Teigu and charm were really interesting\\n\\n\r\nTatsumi - He is the real main protagonist, typical main boy character that attracts nearly all the girls. His design is plain and boring but his personality makes him worth the audience attention.\\n\\n\r\nLeone- Big breasted Sis that sips alcohol when she only can. She has interesting design that focuses on animals/beasts.\\n\\n\r\nThese four are the main \"good\" characters of the show. Why did I put good in quotation ? Because some villains in this anime are also good, but at the same time as the main characters they are also evil... in the end all of them are killing or trying to kill each others. And here comes next problem with this series - villains.\\n\\n\r\nVillains in Akame ga Kill are just... boring they are one-dimensional, there is nothing that could make them interesting. Most of them are just thinking really simple and in the mediocre-edgy way like \"I must kill you, because I just must and hah killing is fun right ? kill kill kill! \" The real main villain - Esdeath is big tiddy frost gf that actually have no moral way of thinking and lacks mercy too, she likes torturing and guess what else... yeah killing.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting villain was actually supporting one - Bols, member of Jaegers - group of main villains including Esdeath as captain, all of them are trying to get rid of Night Raid. What makes Bols most interesting ? He has mysterious design, alluring and unexplored mind of psycho, he has wife and daughter too and that alone makes him more amusing than any other villain. He has great Teigu too. Others are not worth mentioning or I just don't remember them because they were stupid or/and uninteresting. Also, relationship between Night Raid and The Jaegers is messy too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the flaws and lackluster plot, in the end I enjoyed Akame ga Kill (mainly because there was Mine, Tatsumi, Akame and Bols) OST was enhancing in great way the overall feeling of the show. Most of the fights were very good but not on the masterpiece level. Ending did not left emptiness in my heart, rather confusion, because it was rushed, deaths near the ending were just outrageous and there was no conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nJust go ahead and try it yourself, I certainly can see why someone can hate this show and on the other hand someone can love this show. For me it was just nice experience excluding those awkward death scenes. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it for someone who loves gore, fights, vivid art, dynamics of animation - shounen fans.\\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend it for someone who looks for outstanding plot, as there are a lot of other anime in this genre which have way better plot.\\n\\n\r\nFarewell.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I also excluded details of the anime so readers will not be getting any spoilers.***\r\nToo many action/fighting genre animes aren't as fun to watch due to things plot-armor (meaning main characters never die) and repeatedly use the plot of a protagonist and antagonist that both power up until someone wins in the end. Akame ga Kill is not such an anime. \r\nAkame ga Kill is an anime that delivers a funny yet dark, action-packed, adventurous story executed in anear-perfect manner. I felt both ends of the emotional spectrum watching it: happy, excited, comically entertained as well as sad, depressed, and tearfully pained by things that happened in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo say Akame ga Kill is generic is literally spitting on a near-masterpiece and call it trash. Akame ga Kill does a fantastic job of delivering and executing a plot in which a group of powerful assassins attempt to overthrow a now-corrupted kingdom. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're in for a complete story with wonderful character interaction that make you laugh or cry; if you want an anime where they make you fear for the life of your favorite character, i would definitely highly recommend akame ga kill for you.\\n\\n\r\nI give Akame ga Kill a rating of a 9. It is a very good anime for someone who enjoys good fighting action, comedy, and tragedy in one story. Even if you dislike anime with death and gore, dont mess out on this anime. You can complain about some of the stuff after watching!",

            "content": "A male transfer student that goes by the name of Tatsumi transfers to Capitol High, where he joins a club full of delinquents as opposed to the student council. In that club, he meets a clumsy girl, a tsundere, a gluttonous kuudere, a playful kitty, an overprotecting senior, and a guy that gets repeatedly shunned by members of the opposite sex. This is a perfect scenario to be in for Tatsumi, as almost every girl in the club feels inclined to be romantic with this fine young man. However, the student council is livid by the fact that Tatsumi rejected their offer to join theirestablishment. The council president, Esdeath, also bears feelings for Tatsumi, because he is the hottest free agent on the main character market. \\n\\n\r\nNow THAT right there would have been a solid show. Instead, we get the bastardized version of this wonderful schoolyard harem, called Akame Ga Kill! (AGK). AGK seems to suffer an identity crisis, because on one hand, AGK it is a light hearted comedy that we should all watch to settle down. On the other hand, AGK is about darkness, corruption, and tragic deaths. Not to say that you can\u2019t have both sides of the spectrum in one show. As a matter of fact, many great shows have clashing genres. AGK just does it so poorly, to the point where it\u2019s hard to get emotionally invested in this show as it\u2019s intended to be. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is not even worth mentioning. The basic principle of the story is good vs evil, or the Revolutionary army vs. The Empire. There is minimal excitement generated by the story because what is expected to happen usually happens. The appeal with AGK is its characters, and how they interact with each other. If you are a fan of crazy yandere characters, you\u2019d probably like Esdeath. If you are into the innocent type, you\u2019d probably like Akame. Even though the characters fall under fairly typical archetypes, they are definitely fun to watch. There is a reason why AGK is so freaking popular, and it\u2019s because of the bipolarity of the characters. Man wouldn\u2019t it be awesome if the lovely ladies in AGK were real girls? They are so cute and fluffy on the outside, but deviously thirsty on the inside. Guys seem to really dig that.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the characters are awesome, it does not excuse the fact that they are given little screen time for us to actually get attached to them. AGK seems to sell the fact that they have a \u201cno character is safe\u201d mentality. That is all and dandy, but are we actually expected to feel emotions when someone dies a tragic death? There are just too many characters, and most of them suffer the same fate. The lack of screen time combined with zero element of surprise truly plagues this anime. It was a pleasure watching AGK. But it\u2019s nothin\u2019 special.",

            "content": "Whitefox gave us Steins;gate, so I was honestly quite excited and hyped for this show. Given that I myself enjoy the gore genre, this seemed like theeeeee anime of 2014.  Sadly, halfway through, I only continued watching AGK just for the sake of finishing it. \r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe title of this anime was very misleading. It doesn't even give hint about its story or plot. Given a chance, I'd name this anime 'The Uprising' or even 'Night Raid'. That aside, the storyline was simply too convoluted. It tried to be edgy, gory, humorous, harem-y, yet sad at the same time. Jokes were commonly used rightafter a serious conversation or scene, and many a time I laughed not because of them, but because they totally ruined the atmosphere that the writer had tried so hard to build up. \\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the dialogues used were a tad shallow and clich\u00e9. I welcome unexpected character deaths. HOWEVER, dying for the purpose of making this show more mature themed and depressing don't do justice to their deaths at all. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nIt was decent. The gore scenes were repetitive - it was usually either a clean cut at abdomen  or the neck, though I was quite surprised that they didn't censor much. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe only average point of this series. I rarely skip the openings when watching AGK. Soundtracks were usually used at the right time, but they weren't anything special. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nWhat character? Many were simply cardboard cut-outs. We have the strong-willed and determined muscle guy, the clumsy and oblivious girl, the (twin-tailed) tsundere, the ice queen yandere, etc. The only character that pleasantly surprised me was the justice girl(Man is she crazy or what). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nThis anime was quite enjoyable at the start, but ended up being dreadful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nPerhaps newcomers to the anime medium may find AGK good, but I did not. TBH I felt that I would have enjoyed this show if it was my first few anime. However, having seen quite a decent amount of anime, AGK is as clich\u00e9 as an anime can get. Despite that, I would not say that people should avoid this show at all cost. Instead, people should watch this series just to experience such a show. Some may even find this series highly enjoyable, worthy of praise, and even well-made, although I do not share such sentiments.  \\n",

            "content": "\"As the survivors, we carry the feelings of those who've passed away on our shoulders\" - Akame\r\nAkame ga Kill is shounen series written by the mangaka Takahiro and produced by Studio White Fox with 24 episode, 19 of which was canon and the rest being strictly anime original. While it can be noted that this series does indeed have many flaws and in some cases, bad writing, it cannot be denied that this series can take audiences on a crazy ride filled with sadness, death and great action scenes.\r\nStory\r\nThe story of Akame ga Kill takes place in a fantasy world containing the capital city knownas \"The Capitol\", a wide variety of villages all set out in the outskirts of the country and forrest filled with dangerous and deadly creatures known as \"Danger Beasts\" The story takes place in the capitol city which is known for its corruptibility and follows the main male character Tatsumi whom is from the country. Upon arriving in the capitol (Being completely oblivious to what actually happen there) Tatsumi sets off to make an earnest living for himself and his fellow villagers back home only to find out in the most gruesome and mind boggling way that the Capitol is as dirty as they come. But after nearly becoming a victim of this corruption himself, Tatsumi is recruited by Night Raid, a group of assassins dedicated to eliminating the corruption plaguing the Capitol by mercilessly killing those responsible by the use of incredibly powerful weapons known as Teigu.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance the story does seem very promising because of potential thoughts of great world building, deep mature plotlines and gruesome battles, however, some of these things primarily the world building concept never gets realized.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall tone of the series is what I felt to be the biggest flaw that the show had because I don't why for the love of god would the writer take a serious mood such as someone mourning the death of their close friends/processing just how ridiculous their perception of the world was, only to then ruin the mood with out of place comedy or fanservice. There are some cases whereas this isn't the case, but for the most part, this series is completely guilty of this crime\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that the story truly shines on and what I personally respect is the fact that it stays true to one of the main plot points that is set up early on in the story, and that is the concept that any of these characters can die at any given time. There are persons that feel as though all of the characters' death are ridiculous (And in some cases they are eg.Leone), but for the most part, they're deaths all had some form of meaning and added progression to the story. As stated in the quote at the start of this review, these people forever lived on the hearts of those who survived and helped them grow as characters (For example, Schere (Scheele-Mine, and Bradt(Bulat)-Tatsumi *God I hate the official names*)\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the comedic scenes feel out of place sometimes and just plain weird, overall the series is pretty much what one would describe as being dark and edgy. Where I think the plot also succeeds is the depiction of how despicably evil the capitol and some persons in it are because the story tackles tons of mature themes such as rape and very brutal acts of murder). In regards to the readers of the manga, there are a lot of persons whom feel as if the story went to shit because of the original episodes but when looking closely at them, they stayed true to the general concept of what the show really is and lets be frank here, we all know that the manga will end similarly to how this story will end\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\\n\r\nApart from a few derps here and there, the art and animation was simply beautiful. The character designs although were too bright and shounen, looked pretty well, the fights and their choreography was superb, and the special still shots used throughout the series for kill shots and other reasons looked especially great because they added more emphasis and impact towards those said scenes and were simply drawn very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe OST of Akame ga Kill was pretty enjoyable and somewhat different to what we usually hear this day and age, but it's still pretty forgettable after a while. The OP's and ED's however are all beautifully made and I'd like to give a quick shoutout to the talented Sora Amamiya whom voices the main female lead Akame and also sings the first OP and second ED songs, all of which sounds very good like the others. The voice acting consists of a very experienced and relatively new cast and for the most part, all of the actors portrayed their characters very well\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nLets be real here, a lot of these characters are pretty damn cliche and fall under the typical shounen character tropes such as the typical shounen male MC, the tsundere, the air-headed megane, the pervert, the big boobed character and the stern leader, as well as some painfully black themed psychotic characters.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, most of these characters surprisngly or not did have some depth to them throughout the series. For example, the air headed character ended up being one of the core members of the team primarily because she was one of their best fighters and plain and simply was very important to the team - The reactions of said character's fate by the rest of cast is a perfect example as to why this statement is true....This was the first example as to how the story stayed true to the theme of anyone can die at any given time\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this, the series managed to introduced a cast of antagonist known as the Jaegars whom were mostly very likable and had good depth to them and in some cases, these characters are even more likable than our main cast (Esdese, Wave, Bors and Ran for example)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the series can still be faulted for some of its one dimensional black characters whom for the most part did their jobs well (That is, showing how messed up the people in the capitol are) but quite frankly, were over used and got pretty repetitive and boring the more times we saw these type of characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nManga Comparison\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen compared to the manga, personally I feel that the anime had a few times where it surpassed the manga, but overall the general way that things were handled in the manga were better. In fact, the anime omitted a lot of what made this series so dark as well as skipped out on some character development for some of the characters. Plus the tone shift problem isn't as bad as it was in the anime and the overall look of the manga isn't as bright and shounen as it looks in the anime\\n\\n\r\nNow, in regards to the original episodes vs what was skipped. Personally I feel that the original episodes were better for many reasons:\\n\\n\r\n1. The way they handled characters such as Ran, Shura and Emperor was done way better than in the manga, because in regards to Ran, where his character ended up in the anime is what has been foreshadowed since his character was introduced and in the manga, all of this was flushed down the toilet for a more sub-par route. I also liked that they managed to keep the characters true to who they are and managed to successfully end their stories on a good note\\n\\n\r\n2. To keep this short and sweet, Wild Hunt are the prime examples of the main complaints that most people have with this series (excluding the tone). These characters are the most poorly written, over the top and painfully black characters that this series has to date. Their only purpose was to literally be evil for the sake of being evil and stupidly attacked both sides of the playing field. The common argument as to why people even defend these characters is because they do add some character development to some of the cast, but in reality and for the most part, those character developments could have been handled much better than they were in the manga(Case in point - Ran and Bors' family). They were unnecessary and extremely edgy for no reason. Why you ask? Because we already know that the capitol is corrupt, and filled with messed up people, Takahiro WE GET IT\\n\\n\r\n3. Akame vs Esdese, Tatsumi vs The Emperor (The giant mech was stupid as fuck lol) and Shura vs Lubbock were all prime examples of exactly how epic the fights are in this series and both fights managed to showcase the positives of all of these characters and truly made them shine \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill, albeit it being my favorite manga series, it's anime didn't quite reach the level of enjoyment that I had while reading the manga and some cases in the original episodes such as the Colosseum Battle and how they handled General Budou . Although it has many flaws to it, it managed to succeed in its positives and it gave the anime community something to talk about whether or not you were defending the series or bashing it.\\n\\n\r\nStory = 7/10\\n\r\nArt/Animation = 9/10\\n\r\nSound = 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters = 8/10\\n\r\nMy Overall Enjoyment = 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "While watching akame ga kill it was obvious to me at least that it is a WWII allegory. I know that the amount of gore and two dimensional villians might make it seem like the story is lacking, but I think the mangaka purposefully wrote it this way to make his allegory and the characters representative of this allegory stand out more, so that it will take notice more. Most of the characters do not represent a particular country and it is more about the ideas that countries had at the time, some countries still continuing those ideas. Multiple characters represent Japan, because Akame gakill is an anime, and it is about Japan's wrong train of thought during WWII and also the change that was necessary for them to go through, that the author thinks America has yet to experience. \\n\r\nThe main \"evil,\" or antagonists in the anime are Esdeath, and the Prime minister. \\n\r\nEsdeath wears a nazi-esque uniform and is representative of fascist idealist countries during WWII which would include Germany and Japan. \\n\r\nThe Prime minister represents the emperor's advisers during WWII. The Emperor's character is a child in Akame ga kill, a metaphor for his incapability to rule properly and how he was a puppet ruler.\\n\\n\r\nIn an ideal fascist society, everyone is capable of both muscular and mental strength, making the society function a lot more smoothly. However, for many people the strength required for military personnel is simply not possible. The characters Kurome and Akame wear schoolgirl uniforms and are at one point forced to become assassins for the capital. This is representative of male university students who were drafted during WWII, and were forced to become trained killers. One of the main religions in Japan is Buddhism, in which Killing even a bug is a horrible thing. Both Akame and kurome were made female characters to make their weakness more obvious, especially with kurome who is twelve. In a fascist society people who are naturally weak do not do so well. In Japan during WWII, weak or injured men who could not complete the drills during their months of training properly, were promoted, then told that they were to become kamikaze and die for their country. The men would then try to desert, or somehow escape their situation. The men were usually found by their comrades and killed. In the anime, akame decides that the capital is wrong in their thinking and that she can no longer kill for them. She deserts, but before doing so she tries to convince her sister to come with her. Kurome does not go with her because she believes both her and her sister will be captured and murdered by Esdeath. Kurome who is scared she will be murdered by Edeath, who is a firm believer of the survival of the fittest, frequently ingests steroids in order to hide her weakness\\n\r\nBoth Akame and Kurome represent the spirit of the Japanese people, who during WWII, were suffering. Akame represents a couragous  person who could make a difference if they stood up to the authorities. Kurome is representative of a weaker person during WWII, who for whatever reason cannot escape her situation.\\n\r\nThe opposite of Akame isn't the character Kurome, but the character Wave. Before the war he is a sailor and thus the emergence of the capital(Japan) as a fascist society does not effect him in a negative way, so he does not see how the people are suffering. He states at one point that he does not understand why Kurome is scared of Esdeath. Wave is probably the character most likely to save Kurome from her situation but instead, like the rest of the jaegers, he becomes part of her nightmare.\\n\r\nA relation not to be ignored in the anime is the similarity between Wave's armor grand chariot and Tatsumi's Incursio. Tatsumi and Wave's beliefs are almost identical, which would naturally include the way Wave is drawn to the military and battle. Both of them originally came to the capital planning on rising in the ranks of the military. The first episode and what happens to Tatsumi's friends is representative of pearl harbor, and in the end when Tatsumi is stuggling to save a little girl represents how America sees other countries today. In the last few episodes the word Imperialism is said several times, speaking of the emperor and his actions taken to expand his country, and also of tatsumi. Although Tatsumi is able to realize that Esdeath is evil, unlike wave, it is only because he is on the opposing side. All the other members of night raid, including Akame, have a moment of silence after they kill someone, during which they express sorrow. However more similarly to members of the Jaegers and Esdeath, Tatsumi does no such thing, and is still expressing rage afterwards. Another hint that Tatsumi, although he is the MC, is not a good guy, is that Esdeath is attracted to him. \\n\r\nThe rest of the members of night raid represent a multitude of things including La resistance, Najenda, those who were persecuted because of their race during WWII, Mine, and Leone who represents poorer countries during WWII who also suffered. Najenda is missing her right arm because the eastern side of France was taken by Germany during WWII. Mine's name is German and also mocking of Tatsumi(America) who has a relationship with her. \\n\r\nAkame ga Kill is my favorite World War Two Allegory and although it is sad, it is important to watch, also the soundtrack is bomb.\\n",

            "content": "Akame Ga Kill! is a story about a young man named Tatsumi who travels to the capital of his nation in order to try and earn money for his starving village. However, after his arrival, it seems the capital is more twisted and full of despair than Tatsumi ever could have imagined. He ends up joining a team of assassins called Night Raid, a group whose purpose is to rid the capital of its corruption and turn a new leaf in the despairing nation.\r\nI really enjoyed watching Akame Ga Kill. It was a fun ride with fun characters, fun battles, and a setting that's wellimagined and shown. It has many strengths, but I do believe that it falls short in some of what it has and what it could have done.\\n\\n\r\nTo start, I would like to talk about the setting, premise, and overall direction of the show. Akame Ga Kill makes it very clear what you're gonna be dealing with from the get-go and follows through with it to the end. Aside from a large amount of gore and violence, one thing the show does a good job of communicating is the setting we're in. The anime does an excellent job of painting how corrupt the capital is under its minister's reign. It shows how things are connected, how the public is being manipulated and abused, and how an uprising has been so hard to do. As Night Raid dispatches foe after foe, we get to see each one's unique weapons and powers as as well as the corrupt and sick things they've been doing to find themselves on Night Raid's hit list. These battles are also nice demonstrations of the heroes' abilities, as well as emotional moments for the characters. The show makes it very clear it isn't afraid to kill off a character we've grown close to, and it communicates very clearly that no assassin is safe from the job of killing they've burdened themself with. The fight scenes, though the animation can feel lackluster and a bit lazy at some points, is overall satisyfing, as what carries it through is each character's abilities and strengths clashing against each other.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads me to the next thing I would like to talk about: the characters. Each character has a memorable design and personality, and their distinct features, differences from each other, and abilities help make each member of Night Raid memorable. The chemistry between the characters, for the most part, is well established throughout the show, and we get to see how well these assassins are connected, which helps make their deaths all the more emotional for both their fellow friends as well as the viewer. However, I do have some problems with our heroes. For one, lots of them don't exactly have the most original personality or character archetype. Lots of them follow specific anime tropes that have been long overused, such as the tsundere character, the onee-san character, the pervert, the kuudere, the overly heroic protagonist man, and so on. They do make good use of these for the most part, and each character will definitely stick with me for a while, but I would be lying if I didn't say a large portion of their memorability comes from their character designs, which are not exactly outstanding, but do a nice job representing the character and making each one distinctly stand out in the crowd. Another problem I have is with some of the dialogue. Here's a fun drinking game: take a shot every time Mine explains how her gun works. Chances are, you'll be wasted by episode 10. The audience is treated like idiots through a good portion of the anime, and this is made very clear from the character's dialogue and exposition. Rather than let the audience figure out the situation for themselves, the characters feel the need to state in an out-of-place manner the blatantly obvious, and exposition scenes happen in almost every episode. They did an alright job of keeping me entertained with the visuals, but the dialogue became fairly irritating every so often. It's definitely a problem that's hard to miss. Finally, before moving on, I want to talk about character development. Lots of the characters have very clear motivations, and some characters have their lives cut short before they can fulfill their dreams, which does help to make their demises more painful. However, lots of characters especially seem to lack development. I think Esdeath's elite assassin team could have definitely had more development, which could have been fixed as easily as introducing them later. It would have been so much more interesting, and you would have had a much more powerful emotional resonance with the the characters and an audience member It also would've made some certain showdowns with other characters way more emotionally impactful and less one-sided, but I'd like to stay away from spoilers as much as possible. One character, in particular, I would like to address is Akame. Both the title of the show as well as the openings and endings highlight her in particular, so you would think her being the protagonist of the show is a safe bet. However, she gets significantly less screentime than you would expect, and instead, the show probably should have been called Tatsumi Ga Kill! as most of the show clearly follows Tatsumi's journeys and interactions, many of which do not include Akame in the slightest. Akame is also one of the main characters with the least development in the entire show. It does a good job of establishing her past and relationship with certain characters, but Akame ends up being a pretty static character throughout her time in the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I would like to talk about the atmosphere and tone of the show, which I think it handles nicely. The constant themes of death and violence are prominently present and never forgotten about, and, as I stated before, the show does a great job at nailing how the empire is in a state of despair and horror. The show manages to accomplish lots of the tones through its soundtrack, which is not outstanding or exceptional, but does a great job for adding another layer of depth to the battle scenes or otherwise, whether it's a tense or despair-filled moment, the music helps set the mood very well. The visuals and animations are about average, the fight scenes sometimes feeling like our vision is restricted so the animators have to do less work, but are overall interesting enough. A neat touch during some scenes of the show is this unique art style, one that really emphasizes the characters and their emotions, which are oftentimes delusion or hatred. It doesn't appear as much as I would personally like, but it definitely helps add some layer of uniqueness to scenes, though whether you like it or not is completely up to you, I personally enjoy the touch. One sizeable complaint I have about the show's themes presented, however, relates to the stupid-audience treatment I mentioned earlier. The show bashes you over the head over and over with its themes, and it would take a complete idiot not to take away something the show is trying to say about killing and the work and struggles the characters go through. Fights and dialogue give a nice shoving down the throat of these themes, and the show definitely could have taken a more subtle approach to this. Something that contrasts almost everything I've mentioned, however, is the show's humor. Throughout the series, the characters are cracking jokes fairly often, which debatably breaks the atmosphere, but I feel it helps make the character interactions feel more natural, though I agree it definitely could have been toned down in some places where the darker themes of the show should have taken the spotlight. For that matter, the show definitely could have had a more grounded and gritty feel to it with both the art style and color choices, which in the actual product are fairly standard, and it would have accompanied the atmosphere much of the show goes for very well in my opinion. The humor would definitely have to be more grounded and/or toned down if that were the case, and the show would have a much different feel to it, but I think it would've worked nicely. However, that's just my personal opinion, and you don't have to agree with me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed watching Akame Ga Kill. I loved the characters, and the premise and battles will stick with me for some time. Despite its many flaws, there are a good amount of things the show does well, and I think the problem is less what it did wrong and more what it could've done better. Overall, I would rate Akame Ga Kill! a fair 5/10, and I would recommend it to someone not necessarily looking for something outstanding but a very fun ride (and someone who can handle gore of course). Thanks for reading my review, and have a great day! <3",

Character rate 6\\10.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the anime from the first two episodes, I really become obsessed later and consider it one of the best anime I watch in my little experience, but afterward I was really disappointed, the plot was messed up with many unreasonable and illogical scenes, so enjoyment 4\\10.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading :)\\n\r\nsorry for any linguistic mistakes.",

In fact, if it weren't for the plot twists, I would have dropped it a long time along time ago because it starts off with a boy leaving his village to embark on a journey( seen this plot a million times). \r\nTLDR REVIEW:\r\nNo one wants to read long lines of text so this is basically why I rated it a 5.\r\n-Started off with gore, strong tragedy\r\n-Ended off with aharem, lots of fan service.\\n\r\n-It failed to sustain its proclaimed Genre. \\n\r\nWhy are you rating it a 5 then? Because:\\n\\n\r\nStory -(7/10): Again, the story isn't that bad when it started , I ACTUALLY LOVED IT WHEN IT STARTED. Later on though.... its fan service for men.\\n\r\nThe main villain has huge breasts and apparently, [SPOILER AHEAD] falls in-love with the main character. [END OF SPOILER]\\n\r\nOver time, we just keep seeing her try to make love with the main character (at least 2-4 times).\\n\r\nPlot utilization:\\n\r\nThe story itself states \"There are many corrupted people in the government, she is just one of them\" yet we are stuck seeing 1 big breasted female for the entire series.\\n\r\n-The mentioned \"Revolutionary Army\", is BARLEY even utilized. The story has mentioned that the revolutionary force was huge, yet they do not stop in when the main big breasted villain is destroying villages, and slaughtering people. [Note] The main group we follow is the \"Night Raid\" which the story openly admitted that its just a \"SMALL GROUP OF ASSASSINS\" . So tell me? Why is this \"Small group of assassins\" fighting the main force? \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: \\n\r\n I really don't necessarily care\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nI really don't necessarily care\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\r\n-Girls turn into weak little females who fall in love with the main character\\n\r\n-Most of the females cliched.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\n-Again, as stated above, I was overwhelmed with the plot twists. \\n\r\n-The action was pretty spot on.\\n\r\n-Fun and unique weapons!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5:\\n\r\n-Started off with gore, tragedy, action\\n\r\n-Turned into harem, romance, fan service.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Death is something that does not happen constantly on some shounens and there is a lot of praise around that when it is well executed. \r\nAkame ga Kill is a situation where the show... abuses a bit too much of it and reached a point where the show lost itself on the overuse of deaths and violent scenes along with the fast pace on the storyline and, in the end, its potential was gone.\r\nAkame ga Kill is an shounen, action, adventure anime (and it does have comedy too even if it was out of place sometimes) made by the studio White Fox, an adaptation ofthe manga created by Takahiro. and it aired last year, containing 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill involves the story around Tatsumi, the main character, who left his village in order to travel to the Empire and go to the capital to make sure he can get money and save people from the place he lives. What he doesn't expect is that the capital is a terrible and corrupted place, especially with this old bastard known as the Prime Minister, manipulating the Emperor, who is still a child. \\n\r\nTatsumi eventually became another victim of that corruption but then, he got saved by the assassin group called Night Raid, who decided to recruit him to the group, and then the journey starts with them.\\n\\n\r\nSoooo, basically, what to expect of this anime? Well, expect a lot of fights, action and deaths, and when I say that, I do guarantee that NOT EVEN the good characters are safe on these series, almost everyone there could pretty much die (and be sure that you won't be spoiled, or then it will just ruin everything if you decide to search anything related to Akame).\\n\\n\r\nIt's probably one of the charms behind Akame ga Kill. It felt like something refreshing to watch (I sounded like some creepy guy or a sadist by saying that), since some of the popular well known shounens don't really kill their characters and they don't have such a hard time. \\n\r\nAnd the series even gave a hint behind those possible deaths, since the assassins on the series use weapons called Teigus (Imperial Arms). \\n\r\nYou can expect not only equipments, armor, weapons but also living creatures or organic teigus and some of these weapons were made by remains of Danger Beasts (who are creatures in Akame's world), and a form of magic was used to create them, not to mention that it was created by instructions of the First Emperor, scared by the fall of the Empire. \\n\r\nWhat is that hint and the thing behind the teigus? \\n\\n\r\n\"If two users of Teigu were to fight each other, one of them is guaranteed to die.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat \"rule\" basically made it clear why many deaths could potentially happen. You know, when those things started to happen after the first fights, there was that shock factor involving how the creator of that story had the guts and wasn't afraid to kill and remove almost anyone. \\n\\n\r\nAnd when I started, it was really nice to see how Akame ga Kill made me get worried about some characters (not everybody though), even on the bad side. It's what I love.. and hate on the series too. I mean, if you enjoyed the series and you were following it weekly (or monthly if you read the manga), you won't be feeling so secure regarding the characters that you like so much, and that feeling given by the story was something interesting since it involved both sides. \\n\\n\r\nBUT at the same time, you are going to miss characters who got killed, not that I'm bashing Akame ga Kill on something like that, it's the feeling for your favorite characters  which you won't see anymore, that's understandable. What I will criticize IS that, after a certain point, some deaths weren't really well made, they were not executed properly, character development is important, screen time too, it makes you care and get those feels for a character, get attached to them and see their relevance on the series. \\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill has a serious problem on these two elements that I mentioned regarding some characters, and it looked like some deaths, right after the first character who got killed in the series, were right there just for the shock factor almost every time, and throwing emotional or sad music randomly for someone who didn't have much screen time or development doesn't help much; there were a few deaths who were actually sad. \\n\r\nAlso, that rule of one person with Teigus certainly going to die is soooo unforgiving. It's... a good and bad thing at the same time on AgK. The way that the story was literally following that pattern of Teigu users fighting caused those deaths that I mentioned, so yeah, some of the strong and weak points on the series involves that rule too.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is.. okay, it got some good moments and it does get better on fights. I think the budget wasn't there that much though and it looked like that they invested A LOT MORE on the last episodes.. a decision that wasn't the smartest one out there since the last episodes had bigger flaws. I did like some of the character designs though, they were cool actually. \\n\r\nAnd guess what, THE EPISODES ARE UNCENSORED, so you can get some solid action scenes and understand what's happening on each fight happening on the series. Watching the series without the glorious censorship during an era of animes getting destroyed by censorship when they aired felt really good. It looked like the middle finger was being exposed to the censorship without giving a fuck (what did i just say). But hey that's just what was available for us... \\n\r\nAfter you get more informations about the series, the truth regarding censorship is exposed. \\n\\n\r\nIn Japan, Akame ga Kill was censored (there were even some censorship comparisons, and there were some weird things like it happened on Tokyo Ghoul and Terra Formars). You can imagine it was one of the main reasons that the anime didn't have success on Japan, and there were poor sales on the BDs too. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, now I must talk about the world portrayed there. You probably heard of the series when the anime was airing and probably heard of the controversial stuff behind it. \\n\\n\r\n\"What do you mean by controversy\" \\n\r\nLet's say that... Akame ga Kill has a lot of violent stuff and sometimes it tries a bit too hard to be dark. Come on, we already know the world here is evil, corrupt and it's terrible for everyone who lives there, we get it. Some people would even go \"OH HEY THAT CRAP IS TOO EDGY FOR ME\". \\n\\n\r\nI can agree that Akame ga Kill tried a bit too hard on the violence and you would be like \"that's going a bit too far \" or \"why is that here, that's just free and worthless violence\". I can understand and see why people say the series tries too hard to be edgy and dark (it's even one of the reasons why you will find out haters of the series out there, especially on MAL too), although I think that the series doesn't try THAT much unlike other animes with a lot of gore scenes out there, but I must agree that there are some scenes who felt like they were random or just thrown there. \\n\r\nAnd no, the series isn't deep or mature for trying to setup a dark theme and many gore scenes, it's not unique, it's just a shounen like many others despite making use of some factors that were not so explored on some shounens like making sure almost nobody is safe there.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the characters, first of all, an advice: do not research anything about them, you may potentially get huge spoilers. Soooo, we got that group, Night Raid, a bunch of assassins trying to make justice against the Empire by getting rid from their members and also kill the typical cliche and generic bad guys, assassins or psychopaths. There are some interesting characters but there are also the generic ones, or even the characters who did not have enough time to be on that story so we couldn't get to know more about them.\\n\\n\r\nOn night raid we got members like, Tatsumi, Akame, Leone, Lubbock, Bulat (Aniki), Mine, Sheele, Najenda and after some time on the anime, there are two new Night Raid members, Chelsea and Susanoo. Night Raid wants to cleanse the capital as the good guys on the story, BUT the thing is that some of the members are wanted dead on the Empire, because of the murders and the fact that some people from Night Raid actually worked for the Empire before realizing that it was corrupted. Even though they want to get rid of the corruption and the evil stuff from the empire, and they are shown as the bad guy, stuff like murders and killing people come to play. I even remember a dialogue of the series where Tatsumi says that they are heroes doing justice and Sheele just says that they aren't doing nice stuff and they are just assassins doing their job. \\n\\n\r\nIt was an interesting dialogue since it brought Tatsumi to the reality of that world, it exposed to him what would be coming after he left his village, it showed to him that not everything would be the paradise and the nice thing that he imagined by working to them, it wasn't that hero complex thing that he thought Night Raid was and it showed the honesty from some assassins of NR. \\n\\n\r\nWell, now that I talked about the NR, and the bad people (the Minister and the Emperor), we have another group, which was an interesting one but unfortunately didn't get much development and some characters did not get more time on the animation. Jaegers, the police squad working for the Empire and it's goal is to get rid of Night Raid, and yeah, they are also Teigu users... their members are Wave, Ran, Kurome, Dr. Stylish, Seryuu, Bols and Esdeath.\\n\\n\r\nThe interesting detail about the Jaegers is that, even though they work for the dark side of the series, not every member is actually that crazy, evil or fucked up (unless Seryuu is mentioned, she is a crazy psycho and there is a reason why she is probably the most hated character of the series with her twisted concepts involving what is justice in her point of view, pretty much a victim of the Empire's system on Akame ga Kill) and even some characters know what they are doing is clearly wrong, like on Bols's situation. \\n\r\nWave and Ran are examples of characters who are not exactly the bad guys that you would typically see, but unfortunately they weren't explored on the series, and Wave is a great example of another character who got butchered and ruined on an anime adaptation again.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will talk about Esdeath, the leader of the Jaegers under the orders of the Prime Minister. Esdeath is actually the main villain on the series, one of the reasons why I had to mention her here,, she is a high-ranking general of the Empire and through the anime, it shows how much she is broken beyond belief on her strength/ power and, besides that, Esdeath is sadist, evil, she enjoys stuff like murder and torture, she doesn't have empathy for people who are considered weak by her, since she lived on that philosophy of \"only the strongest ones survive\". But she is not a completely heartless monster, I mean, she does cares about her comrades, she adores them, she even comfort her comrades if they go through some pain or hard time. Also, Esdeath has another thing that I didn't mention before... although she does a lot of twisted things, she is actually looking for love. \\n\r\nAs you can see, Esdeath is probably one of the interesting characters on the series and the anime shows why she is so popular on the series and loved by many fans and followers of Akame ga Kill. She is not particularly one of the best villains ever though.\\n\r\nSoundtrack is solid and enjoyable, the openings and the endings are really good, especially the first ones, the original soundtrack does fit well on the series, and there are some emotional and epic songs on important scenes. It's not something amazing, incredible or 10 out of 10, but hey it does the job. Voice actors did also do a good job on their characters.\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect the series to be incredible, I kinda fell for the hype when it came out.\\n\r\nI must admit, at the start of the animation I was enjoying this show a lot, then later I saw its flaws and main problems, but I must say that I did still have a really fun time with the anime until the end of episode 19. \\n\r\nNow, for the last episodes... the anime original content showed up and it gave a lot of disappointment in the ending since the story was already fast paced and a lot of events would be happening on many episodes, but then the last ones with that alternative route (not following the manga) felt like a roller coaster. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of that fast pace, problems regarding character development and screen time for them showed up even MORE than before and it ruined the story. So many things would be happening so fast (even to a point where some of the craziest asspulls ever seen in a long time happened and the logic behind some events just wasn't there, especially on Akame's trump card) that even Sonic would be jealous, you know, GOTTA GO FAST. \\n\r\nThere were a few good things, although almost none on the last episode... anyway, the ending of the anime was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nIs it worth watching or checking out? I would say that Akame ga Kill isn't really made for everyone. You can maybe check it out and see if you like it, but after some experiences, it's not really an anime that I would recommend to many people out there, because of the content and the settings I mentioned about it and especially the last episodes.",

            "content": "The story follows a boy coming from a small poor village named Tastumi. We see from the very start he is very skilled with a sword as he kills a Danger Beast fairly easily saving some civilians. We learn that him and two of his friends are coming to the capital to join the army and protect their village. He isn\u2019t accepted as they have a lot of people trying to join because of the Danger Beasts but at a bar he meets a woman that tells him to join the army you need to know someone and luckily she does so she offers totake his money as payment for getting him in. He stupidly accepts this offer and she runs away. He ends up on a street and is picked up by a nice girl named Aria. He tells his story and her parents allow him to stay. He learns about a group named Night Raid that is trying to ruin the peace. Unluckily for him Night Raid decides to attack Aria\u2019s house tonight. They assassinate her parents while he tries taking her to a barn with a guard to protect her. Here they get cornered by two Night Raid members. The title character Akame and the girl from earlier, Leone. Akame decides she\u2019s going to kill Tatsumi if he won\u2019t let her just take out Aria but Tatsumi decides to protect her as she protected him. Leone decides this isn\u2019t the best way and shows Aria\u2019s family is actually corrupt by opening the barn and showing him a room full of tortured and dead humans including Sayo and Ieyasu (his friends). Ieyasu is barely alive and confirms to Tatsumi it was Aria before he passes. Tastumi is pissed and kills Aria himself. Leone grabs him and takes him to the rest of Night Raid which he eventually joins.\\n\r\nNight Raid has some interesting people in it.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off we have Akame who is quiet, a good cook and eats a lot. Leone, the typical alcohol loving woman that treats Tatsumi as if he\u2019s her younger brother. Mine starts off as a stereotyped teenage girl but ends up growing out of that. Lubba who is a ladies man and tries spying on Leone in the bath among other goals. Sheele who is a klutz and a bookworm and Bulat who takes a liking to Tatsumi and helps him train (it\u2019s also heavily implied he has a crush on Tastumi). The leader\u2019s name is Najenda and she does a good job fitting this role. Other characters that end up joining Night Raid after Tatsumi are Chelsea and Susanoo. Chelsea is kind of a rival to Mine although she was never as stereotyped I found, and Susanoo is Najenda\u2019s Imperial Arms. Imperial Arms are a major element to Akame ga Kill!. They are super-weapons created long ago and it is told that if two Imperial Arms users fight one will die. Each member of Night Raid, except Tatsumi, has an Imperial Arms. It becomes a goal for a few episodes to get him one before he eventually finds one (not going to spoil it as it\u2019s the result of an important event).\\n\r\nThe other side also all have Imperial Arms. While we don\u2019t see the Emperor\u2019s or Prime Minister Honest\u2019s until near the end of the series we do know they have one. For the first part of the series they are fighting members of the government but they aren\u2019t really collaborating. About halfway we get a new group introduced called the Jaegars. This is run by General Esdeath who had been introduced prior as one of of the Capital\u2019s strongest generals. Other members include Wave who has a similar past to Tatsumi but never learned of the corruption, Bols who is a pyromaniac but loves his wife and daughter, Run who we really don\u2019t learn much about until late into the series, Seryu who is another teenage girl but is pretty much the exact opposite of the stereotypical teenage girl, Dr .Stylish who likes experimenting with dead bodies and lastly, Akame\u2019s sister, Kurome. Again they all have their own Imperial Arms and they have their own reasons for joining the Jaegars. One thing I really liked was a lot of the characters have goals that could be achieved from either side. Both Tatsumi and Wave want to protect people from their village but happen to be recruited by opposite sides and I think they would have been just as happy to join the other side if given the chance. Most are like that but some have a bias that would stop them from joining the other side.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was all really good. Emotions were conveyed great by the actors. The music always fit the mood and the second opening song, Liar Mask, is one of my favourite songs and I\u2019d give it my favourite opening song too. The animation style  is also really nice to look at. It has vibrant colours at times, while at others it\u2019s dark grays and browns. This always fits the mood and it and the music work together perfectly. \\n\r\nNow onto things I didn\u2019t like. Akame ga Kill! seemed to set a lot of things up just to either rarely use them or use them at all. One example is the Danger Beasts. I thought with you seeing Tatsumi taking one out before even meeting Akame they\u2019d be important but aside from it being mentioned that Imperial Arms are made out of them they only really appear when the plot requires them. If they\u2019re really that much of an issue that they\u2019re described as at the beginning I think we should at least see them more often. Sometimes we\u2019d go quite a few episodes without even seeing them, let alone them causing any problems. Another is how in the first episode before Tatsumi finds Ieyasu and Sayo are dead he imagines how they\u2019d react to a couple different situations he finds himself in. These were pretty humorous and they happen one or two times after he finds them but then stop. I wish this had continued as it could have helped the comedy, which while good, wasn\u2019t as good as it could have been. The last five or six episodes also seemed a little rushed. I read on different sites that the anime was often skipping chapters at a time (I think one of them was around 18 chapters or something). I feel at that point it would have been better to try negotiating a two season contract instead of cramming everything into one season. Even the final battles were fairly rushed through.",

It's clich\u00e9, it's poorly written, it's poorly executed, and worst of all, it's pretty boring. What I'm going to do though is break the mold of a traditional review and highlight the 3 biggest blunders on Akame ga Kill's bill that I didn't see covered extensively enough in other reviews. Let's begin!\r\n1. Ineffective character deaths and Clich\u00e9d motifs\r\nLet's talk about motifs. A motif is a recurring theme that's presence in an art piece is rather dominant, up front, and is usually meant to makesome sort of statement. Usually these are something like some form of symbolism or underlying theme that properly paces and sets the tone or something. When used effectively, they're a valuable asset to a composition. But when used wrong, they're obnoxious and distracting. And Akame ga Kill employs the worst motifs in the worst possible ways.\\n\\n\r\nTo get it out of the way, the worst motif that Akame ga Kill wields is the \"rain when I die\"clich\u00e9. This trope consists of a character death being punctuated by rain to make it more poetic and moving. While as this is already terribly clich\u00e9 when used once, there's a bigger problem than its mere presence.\\n\\n\r\nIt's how many times it was used. THEY USED IT 4 TIMES. I counted 4 character deaths where it was already raining or it started raining during their death scenes. That is absolutely unacceptable and pathetic, and what makes it even more pitiful is I know exactly why they did that. All of the characters that die are usually given really lazily delivered depth from their past or something a few scenes before they died so the writers can feel justified in killing them off. It's lazily written, it's lazily delivered, and it's effect feels lazy. By casting rain over character deaths, it's meant to give more emotion than should actually be present. But what's present is no emotion and no heart, so it comes to symbolize something else.\\n\\n\r\nLaziness. Anytime rain shows up, it feels as though it's only there to lazily create some sort of mood or punctuate a scene. There's no sense of natural presence, and overall it just feels lazy. See how many times I say that? That's because Akame ga Kill is probably the laziest anime I've ever seen in its presentation, execution, and composition. \\n\\n\r\nI could talk about how terrible the \"death in a field of flowers\" scene was for hours but I won't get too far into that for the sake of brevity. Basically one of the characters dies in a forest setting but once again it becomes really obvious that the writers are going to kill her off because there's a giant field of flowers ahead of her. Naturally I thought \"oh, since it's THIS anime, she's going to die here and it's going to start raining.\" Sure enough, that is EXACTLY what happened. She gets shot or whatever, and it starts raining as she dies. It's lazy, clich\u00e9, awful, and ineffective.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, terrible use of character deaths, punctuated by miserable motifs, leaves a feeling of indifference in the audience rather than genuine sympathy. \\n\\n\r\n2. Cloudy character motivations and the issue of insincerity \\n\\n\r\nNext up, let's talk about Akame ga Kill's problem with character motivations. \\n\\n\r\nThe first issue that pops up here is Tatsumi, who is laughably billed as the main character. Tatsumi had some sort of motivation given to avenge his fallen comrades from his village or something at the beginning of the show. What's wrong with that you might ask? Well, as the \"story\" progresses, the plot just seems to forget about this. After a certain point, Tatsumi's dead friends are completely forgotten about and are never mentioned again throughout the show. And this is before the middle, so it's not like this is a natural deflection or timely repression. It's abrupt absence from the narrative is absolutely confusing and makes me wonder what exactly Tatsumi is even here for. Logically he doesn't really seem to be needed in this narrative at all. What he contributes to the story isn't really all that significant and (((HERE'S YOUR SPOILER WARNING))) he doesn't even survive the show. To be completely honest, I don't think he should have been included in this story at all. The story is named AKAME ga Kill, so why isn't AKAME the main character? Akame is the biggest blank slate in the entire show given the presentation. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I mean by that is that Akame is billed as a main character according to this site and pretty much every other one, but she's not treated as such. She's given no real depth, she doesn't seem to have an interesting personality due to i-ll advised attempts at giving other characters depth, and just seems to be there to occupy space. But now we're getting into an even bigger problem with the way the setting is composed that I don't really care enough to get into. This show sucks, so the worst thing I can do is waste the time of people reading this review. With that, let's move onto the other big issue with Akame ga Kill's character motivations, Lady Esdeath.\\n\\n\r\nLady Esdeath is pretty much the poster girl for terrible, clich\u00e9 character writing as it, but it's her confusing character motivations that truly sets her apart as an especially terrible character. Early on, it's established that she wants to find true love. What's wrong with that? Well, that's all we're given. She just says she wants to find love and suddenly she wants to find love! Up to this point, it's made pretty clear that she had zero interest in finding a mate or getting married throughout her life, but just all of a sudden she wants to for absolutely no reason? No, that is not acceptable nor is it believable. Her motivation to conduct a search for a mate is so ridiculously cloudy and strange that it feels insincere. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the key word for the Esdeath-Tatsumi love subplot: insincerity. It was delivered and executed so poorly, I was pretty certain Esdeath was doing this as some sort of ploy to achieve an ulterior motive to be revealed later, but apparently the insane writers were serious! She just suddenly wants to find love and the introduction of this subplot is incredibly jarring and misplaced. If your audience is left wondering if you're hiding something when a character is doing something, you've done something horribly wrong. The mark of any bad movie, TV show, or basically any work of fiction is not properly conveying why things are happening or why characters are taking certain actions, and Akame ga Kill certainly fits both of those molds pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nThere's no depth, there's no heart, there's no effort put into proper conveyance; it's just lazy and terrible.\\n\\n\r\n3. A lack of proper flow and tone whiplash\\n\\n\r\nLastly, we have the problem of bad flow due to misused tone. Flow in fiction, in my eyes, is the way a story unravels and reveals itself to you. Anything such as long bouts of overly expository dialogue or jarring scene transitions or even improper introduction of subplots can break up flow and force the viewer out of the world they're supposed to be immersed in. While Akame ga Kill basically has a problem with everything I just listed, the real deal breaker here is mishandled tone. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have to explain what tone is, correct? Simply: tone is the way a compositions feels. It's the mood that's given off. And my god, does Akame ga Kill have terrible tone. It misuses tone in not only a broad sense, but also a specific one. The overall tone of Akame ga Kill is uncertain. I have no idea what I was supposed to take away from it due to its clashing tones. While it's true I have given immense praise to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood for using a similar set of clashing tones (most notably, lighthearted vs. apocalyptic dread), there is a huge difference between the two. Brotherhood mixed its tones together pretty much flawlessly, and there were never any points where I thought the story felt disjointed. Every transition to a new scene felt natural and tones never clashed as a result. Plus, the overall tone is there and clear: lighthearted adventure of discovery that becomes a desperate struggle to stop a seemingly unstoppable force. Great show, great use of tone.\\n\\n\r\nBut Akame ga Kill has no idea what it's doing with its tone. It employs a similar set of tones but the way it clumsily throws them together is just embarrassing. The overall tone should be lighthearted with well-placed bits of brutal carnage (and it's unfortunate that I even have to say something that stupid out loud) due to the nature of the story, but the really violent parts aren't well-placed at all. They abruptly appear out of nowhere and leave the viewer in shock. While this was the intended effect the first time, the fact that they kept doing it became a problem. There would be some sort of enjoyable little fight going on and it would be fine and I wouldn't have to complain, but then all of a sudden a character is violently murdered and I'm left there irritated because the writers have no clue what they're doing.\\n\\n\r\nThe desired effect when writing a fight scene that results in death (especially a duel) is to have it build up to a climactic finish. That way, the tone can gradually change without it feeling jarring and forced. Akame ga Kill does not do this. While you could argue that fights do build up, I don't think there's a solid argument to be made that the payoff works. Instead if having an interesting battle that feels like natural for the story, the way it unfolds is a semi-interesting fight that stops because someone died. The fights never feel dynamic or climactic (although I will admit a good argument can be made against that for the final battle, despite it not really making any sense) and the payoff never works. They don't feel psychological or the result of 2 different personalities clashing with weapons. It feels more like weapons that are fighting with people attached to them. I didn't really want to put it that bluntly: but there. \\n\\n\r\nJust like the rest of the show, the fights have no flow whatsoever and due to improper placement of its supporting elements, they lack any lasting impact on the viewer other than indifference. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the big problem I'm trying to get at with this section: misplaced supporting elements. The tone shifts in Akame ga Kill are very jarring and unnatural, and as such continuously disrupt the flow. That's called tone whiplash. It occurs whenever the transition from one scene to the next is punctuated by heavily contrasting tones that don't mesh well together or the way they transitioned doesn't feel natural. In this case, it's the product of unnatural progression and is a very large problem with the body of work as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nAnd when looking at the bigger picture, I'd say most of the things I listed can be applied to the whole thing. There's a repetitious use of awful clich\u00e9s, character motivations are poorly explained or not explained at all, and overall the final product lacks flow and depth. \\n\\n\r\nIf I'm being honest, I almost feel like a 3/10 is a generous score for this anime. It's absolutely atrocious. Keep in mind too that I only highlighted a few elements of THE WRITING. I didn't even touch on the music, music placement, animation, art-style, dialogue, setting, or framing; which are the other areas I grade on. So if you thought the writing was bad, imagine how terrible everything else is that I didn't talk about. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, stay away from Akame ga Kill unless you want to learn how not to make an anime.",

Own kingdom the story is kinda pointless if u think from a logical viewpoint but try to enjoy it. And also the last 4 or 5 eps.where a rushed mess which skipped scenes changed story etc which was a bummer because the anime had potential but disappointed me and I read the manga from there onwards\\n\\n\r\nART:8/10\\n\r\nthe art is really good it makes everything look alive n colourful the fight scenes look awesome and the animation works really fluidly.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:8/10\\n\r\nthe OP and the ED's are really good the right soundtrack at the right time makes the moment feel right in the way it should.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:6/10\\n\r\nhere lies my main problem the characters die like flies one after the other the deaths are rushed they die without any character development so we don't even feel anything for them which is really sad like the emperor and Leone die just for the sake of dieing which was like WTF.other than that they are good.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:7/10\\n\r\neven with all the crap I said the anime is pretty enjoyable except the last 4 to 5 WTF eps so I suggest you give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:7/10\\n\r\nAkame ga kill was enjoyable bt could have been much more if they had more eps and took the pacing a bit slower.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay, I\u2019ve read a few reviews saying how tonally inconsistent this anime is, shifting between a dramatic show trying to get you to cry and a fun action that\u2019s occasionally a comedy. It does do that a lot, but I enjoyed the premise and so sitting through this was easy and a fun time for me, if you look past the filler-feeling episodes sometimes and some of the very gimmicky characters and some cliche plot devices etc.\r\nSpoiler free review from someone who hasn\u2019t read the manga.\r\nSTORY:\r\n5/10\r\nOkay, I liked the idea of assassins being main characters, there are quite a few episodes where it\u2019s just \u201chere\u2019sthe mission/person we are going to kill/we kill them\u201d and that\u2019s it. The idea of a corrupt capital and a rebel army isn\u2019t that new or original either but it was a decent enough backdrop for the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe tone is where I agree with many people who gave the show harsher reviews etc and for good reason, it shifts constantly. Like, one moment it\u2019s a fun friendship anime with people fighting the bad guys and boom next episode tons of death and apparent dealing with trauma even though it was all laughs and no apparent issues beforehand. And rinse and repeat. Most noticeably with Tatsumi who deals with major angst but only for like\u2026probably about a third or less of the anime spread throughout the whole show, and even then mostly just in \u201cboss fights\u201d lol. \\n\\n\r\nLike dannnng. Guess they\u2019re all on lit antidepressants for most of the time and just get angsty when the plot needs them too-hmmmmmmm\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nLooked pretty good. There was the occasional lazy looking shots in fight scenes and some more still shots, like when they were further away the quality in animation would drop a lot and the heads/hair would seem a bit the wrong size and would draw me out of some of the battles etc but for the most part it was fine. \\n\r\nI think they tried to make the Imperial Arms look decent but other then most of their initial shots they looked like standard normal anime weapons, the only one that I remember looking somewhat better was Lubba\u2019s threads which looked shiny and like the light reflected off of them rather then just being flat colours all the time(of course the swords shone too) but yeah, nothing that special.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nFrom what I remember the OP and EDs were fine, skipped through most of them to get to the story (or lack thereof LOL). I usually skip through most openings/endings so unless it\u2019s really banging I won\u2019t usually watch it that much.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere were your typical cliche tropes, Main character good guy also pretty OP who fights for his friends, clumsy sky girl, stoic OP girl, tsundere etc etc etc\\n\\n\r\nWe got a pretty good look at most of their backstories through dramatic flashbacks making you care about them to some degree, notably also with the villains which is always a surprise for me, not just the main \u201cgood guys\u201d, like most anime I\u2019ve seen so that was nice.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nI just had a lot of fun watching this! Yes, there are many cliches, plot devices, character stereotypes and more but I had a really fun time watching this so it was still a good anime for me.\\n\r\nThis scored high for fun for me, but technically wasn't as strong but not terrible either(story/character-wise etc).\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Pretty decent fun assassin anime that is not afraid to kill off characters, in the least! LOL\\n\r\nThe tone shifts all the time but for a decently emotional anime packed with action you can\u2019t go wrong for an easy watch with Akame ga Kill!",

            "content": "I\u2019ll attempt to keep this reasonably succinct because I hate reading turgid reviews which are ultimately superfluous. If you find my assessment to be disingenuous or intransigent, I hope to not waste too much of your time reading it. \r\nI believe we must examine Akame within the context of the genre and through the lens of enjoyability rather than the haughty ideals of what makes something \u2018different\u2019 and \u2018deep\u2019 posited by some of the other reviewers. In this light, I found the show to be quite enjoyable \u2013 the characters were (mostly) well crafted with depth, nuance and development, the plot was reasonably competent, theart and animation ranged from quite good to gorgeous, and the show was well above average in terms of evoking emotions during impactful scenes. Akame didn\u2019t change my worldview, it didn\u2019t shake my beliefs to the core, and it won\u2019t be shown in any museum as an art piece; if these are your benchmarks for anime, you have my deepest condolences.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the show is far from flawless. My most germane gripes boil down to the following: the pacing was at times stilted or rushed, the death of characters was too often formulaic and obviously telegraphed, most of the jokes failed to land for me, and the pseudo-harem clich\u00e9 was a bit annoying at times. Although these may seem like major detractions, I still found the overall experience to be quite gratifying.\\n",

            "content": "First of all, let me say this is my favorite anime. And it doesn't look like it's gonna be replaced anytime soon. So, please keep that in mind when reading this review.\r\nWhen I first started watching this series, I didn't know anything about it. Like, I didn't know the story at ALL. Like, nothing. But this series was calling me, and so I watched the first episode. Ok, it was fine. I liked it. But then I didn't watch the second one for some time. I don't know why. Maybe that was because it was my first gory anime, and it kind of surprised me(then I got used to the gore and didn't mind it in the slightest bit). But as soon as I watched the second episode, I was lured in. I wanted every next episode to end; just so I could watch the next one.\\n\r\nStory- 7/10\\n\r\nI won't tell you guys the story of this anime, because it's all in the synopsis. There is one thing to say about the story, and that is WASTED POTENTIAL. Oh my God. I really loved the world AgK created, and I kept regretting that it wasn't developed as much as it could have been. Same for the Teigus, otherwise known as Imperial Arms. I would have loved if a few episodes were spared to explain exactly where they came from. The plot isn't very complicated, but I liked it very much. Something in it pulled me in and did not want to let me go. I wish they cut out some of the Jaegars vs Night Raid fight scenes to concentrate more on the world and the planning the \"Revolution\", which, in the end, did not satisfy me at all. But the story was fast going and smooth, and that is why it gets a 7/10\\n\r\nNote: I know this anime has a filler ending, but that does not bother me in the slightest. Thank you for your understanding.\\n\r\nArt- 8/10 Sound- 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation in AgK isn't something you see everyday. The fight scenes were very nicely animated, but the way the characters were animated kinda bothered me. It made them look like flat, generic idiots. The moments when that didn't bother me, was when they were dying. I personally think that is really cruel, like the creators went \"Oh, yeah, we don't care about your animation for the whole show, but we gotta make you look nice on your death bed!\" Literally. What also kind of annoyed me in the characters, was that each of them had their own color that they were identified with They were goddamn ASSASSINS and the part when they were standing all together made them look like Power Rangers, with \u201cthe pink one\u201d, \u201cthe green one\u201d, \u201cthe yellow one\u201d etc. I used to really dig that, but nowdays I'm like \"Nah\".  'Kay, on to the sound. OMG, some of them OST's sound so sad, they make me clutch my heart and go \"Time for a feel trip\". The main theme, \"Fallen Heroes\" was so... Gah, it was just plain amazing! All the seiyuu's did great jobs. Each voice fitted the character perfectly, and because of that anime, I found some seiyuus that I will definitely enjoy hearing in the future. Even the ones, whose voices sounded like nails on chalkboards, or fake, or annoying as hell. \\n\r\nCharacters- 7/10\\n\r\nAh, the characters. They\u2019re nothing you haven\u2019t seen before. In Night Raid, our main group of protagonists is complete with: the loli, the pervert, the big sis, and so on. Most of this anime\u2019s characters had really schematic personalities. Neverthless, I got TOO attached to the characters on both sides of the \u201cconflict\u201d and cried on deaths of both allies and enemies alike. I even cried when the characters I hated most died, simply because I got attached to them after the first 3 episodes. Also, my favorite character EVER is from this anime. I\u2019m not even gonna get started on how much I love Leone as a character. Some of the other, interesting characters included Esdeath (the fan favorite), Akame (the less popular fan favorite), Najenda (who is liked by nobody, and that is sad and unfair). The lack of character development in this anime is acceptable, because it\u2019s this kind of anime, that character development is nice, but if it\u2019s not there, that\u2019s fine too, you know? I didn\u2019t notice the lack of character development, and when it finally occurred to me, I was like \u201cOh. Kay, whatever.\u201d\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime as a show isn\u2019t something that stays in your memory, it isn\u2019t one of those shows like Naruto or One Piece, that is so good everyone watched it. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact, that usually the worse shows are the more enjoyable ones. And Akame ga Kill is hella enjoyable. With your simple plot, nicely animated fights, beautiful OST\u2019s and your touch of bad, but still laughable comedy, this show is enough to entertain you for the 24 episodes you will spend watching it. Yes, some parts can bore the life out of you, but there\u2019s no denying, that every anime, show, has those parts and that is inevitable. Akame ga Kill fits the criteria of an enjoyable shounen (this coming from a girl). Like mentioned above, the plot of AgK is pulling in, despite its simplicity.\\n\r\nOverall- 10/10\\n\r\nBefore I close this review, I want to note that my score is based on the fact that this is my favorite anime. And sure, it does have its flaws, but still, I love it, it\u2019s something that reached somewhere inside me, and that is why I give it a 10. I think that is what most people do, because if something made its way into your heart, then you don\u2019t see or don\u2019t mind its bad side, even if it\u2019s very obvious. But that aside, Akame ga Kill is an enjoyable show, good action, with a touch of bad comedy (But on the other hand, Fairy Tail comedy has only a slightly higher level than AgK, and we still laugh on it! Or, I do, \u2018cos I have no sense of humour.). I would recommend this show to anyone who likes bloody action shows, dark fantasy and\u2026 colourful characters?\\n",

            "content": "\"Where there is life, there is darkness. Where there is darkness, there is evil.\"\r\nThis world is not a kind place, we all know that by now. No matter how much humanity tries to improve itself, the outcome is always the same. War is a constant. But both sides of war contain bodies with stories of their own and ideals they hold close. So how does one choose which side of war to empathize with? There are no winners after the fighting stops, just a side with less fatalities than the other.\r\nAkame Ga Kill broke its way into the anime scene July of 2014, and eversince then it has been sending viewers on an emotional roller-coaster as they waver back and forth in an attempt to decipher not only their own feelings, but the feelings of society as a whole. It is directed by Tomoki Kobayashi (Sola/Steins;Gate) and is the first original piece from the writer, Takahiro, who gave birth to the story in early 2010.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime showcases terrific use of flashbacks, emotion, and has no qualms with killing off characters in order to advance the story. But Akame Ga Kill is not perfect and does have some issues with it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are countless plot holes brought forth that are quite easy to either misinterpret or just overlook completely. On multiple occasions, characters will engage in shouting matches with enemies nearly a mile apart from each other. Anyone to pick up on the physical distance between the characters during these exchanges will quickly lose the sense of realism and validity of the world within Akame Ga Kill. In one episode, a character yells something from the ground to another character nearly a mile in the air, riding on the back of a flying manta-ray. And the most unrealistic part of this scenario isn't the flying manta-ray, its the fact that the two were able to hear each other from that far apart.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many things Akame Ga Kill does right, but there are also many things (Like the one above) that it could have easily avoided had it been given a little extra care. So I'll dissect the show into a few key components to better illustrate these things.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 6/10\\n\r\nAkame Ga Kill paints a beautiful portrait of hope and misery, but by itself that portrait can't carry the rest of the show. One issue I had was the immense lack of background music during situations where it could have easily elevated the emotions of those scenes. More often than not, you will find yourself watching an intense battle between opposing forces with nothing to hear apart from the clash of swords and the characters announcing what move they were going to use next. It created somewhat of a detachment between the show and the audience. Had the creators given a little more thought into each scene, it could have been exponentially more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Akame Ga Kill, apart from the immensely dense and unoriginal main character (Tatsumi), really sculpt the better part of the series. Each one is a twist on a typical character you can find in almost any action-adventure, but all of these characters are dependent on each other and become more complex throughout the course of the show. Character development is crafted phenomenally and the use of flashbacks provide sufficient background detail on characters in order to help explain why they are acting the way the are. As I mentioned before, Akame Ga Kill is not afraid to kill off characters, which is a feat that many shows struggle with now due to the fear of losing viewers that may only be watching the show for a specific personality. In addition to this, each character's wardrobe color can even tell us more about the type of person they are. Mine, pictured on the far left of the image at the top, wears nothing that isn't pink. In this case, the color demonstrates not just her purity, but reinforces the fact that she is just a normal teenage girl when you take away her gun and tsundere tendencies. One more thing about the characters (And I know I'm dragging on here, but this is really the high point of the show) is that each side of the war has personalities that are basically congruent to another on the opposing side. Because of this, viewers have an even harder time choosing who they want to come out on top and often find themselves worrying about characters on differentiating sides.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nApart from the fantastic character design of Akame Ga Kill, the animation of the overall show seems rather lazy and blas\u00e9. When Night Raid and the Jaegers aren't fighting each other, it just feels like there is something missing. I'm not sure what that something is though (I might have just been distracted by the intense, heavy outlining of everything). The environment is nice, but it isn't something you can't find anywhere else. Had it been a little more original, I would have had no problem giving it a higher score.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nWar is hard to properly craft within television, but Akame Ga Kill does a solid job deviating from the typical portrayal of it. What's great about this series is that you will have an inside look at both sides and see that there really isn't much different about them at all. And this is great because it is essentially telling you that fighting is pointless, but at many times inevitable. It's very relatable and will constantly have you questioning morality. Any show that is able to have you sympathize with a character known for slaughtering innocent people is doing something right. Akame Ga Kill is one of those shows.\\n\\n\r\nNot very often am I able to find myself completely invested in shows spanning a full 24 episodes. But I kept crawling back to this one each week, worrying about whether or not my favorite characters would be able to make it to the next airing.\\n\\n\r\nIf you embark on the journey that is Akame Ga Kill, prepare yourself for intense fight scenes, emotional collapse, and a load of metaphors that apply to society today. But at the same time, you must be willing to tolerate some silly dialogue, nonsensical scenes, and a few over-the-top anime archetypes that I'm sure you've seen before.\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely worth watching, and I highly implore you to give it your full attention. Go Night Raid.",

            "content": "Throughout \"Akame ga Kill,\" Akame never seems to be the main character.\r\nThe story focuses on a group called Night Raid. They are assasins who hope to rid the Capitol, ruled by the Prime Minister, of its depraved ways. The starting members are Akame, Tatsumi Leone, Mine, Lubbock, Sheele, Bulat, and their leader Najenda. The anime starts when Tatsumi, with his two friends, sets out for the Capitol to earn money for his village. Instead, he finds a world of unimaginable corruption, all spreading from the depraved Prime Minister who controls the child Emperor's ear. After nearly becoming a victim of this corruption himself, Tatsumi isrecruited by the aforementioned Night Raid.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of this story is what instantly drawed me in. Who doesn't want to watch an anime dedicated to assassin and their kills? For a time, I eagerly awaited each episode until it reached a lull in it's quality. The direction of the story gets more confusing as each episode goes by, and it becomes easy to forget what the original concept was. Characters are killed off, more characters are added, and it barely escaped becoming a train wreck. About three episodes from the finale, it finally gets back on track, and the audience is reminded for what purpose Night Raid exists.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the art work is amazing, and very well crafted. Proportion is spot on, attention to eye detailed is handled, and the hair (the most important part for me) sways perfectly. CGI isn't used terribly much, and even unimportant characters are given the attention their deserve. Around the middle of the anime the art appears to degrade, but that happens to most all animes. However, in the twenty-third episode the animation changes and become completely different from all episodes before that point. The shots that are used make it look like a movie, the characters became longer, and the hair goes through a very detailed transformation. It was like the art had matured, and while it was a nice transformation, it was definitely odd to witness. \\n\\n\r\nSince the anime focuses on eight different characters with Tatsumi and Akame being the apparent main characters, not a lot of development is thrown in. Tatsumi and Akame are obviously the most developed characters with their past shown in flashbacks, and improved upon with dialogue. I am especially grateful to have Tatsumi as a main character for while he is strong, he still needs to improve, and is not afraid to kill as beautifully shown in the first episode. Akame is a bit overlooked as the series continues to focus on Tatsumi, and not her. It always bothered me since the series is named Akame ga Kill, and not Tatsumi ga Kill. The other characters' pasts are shown in shorter flashbacks, and less dialogue, but they were developed. However, hardly anything is known about Najenda and Lubbock. They had to be the least developed characters on Night Raid. And I might as well take time to talk about the strongest character in Akame ga Kill, Esdeath. While not being a main character, she was as developed as Tatsumi and Akame. She has a very cruel and distorted personality and is the main villain for Night Raid.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Akame ga Kill was heaven to my ears. I even made a cover of the first opening, and the second ending. The first opening is a fierce anthem of war that got the blood pumped and ready to watch some killing. The first ending left the episodes on a bittersweet nostalgic note to reflect upon the heaviness of whatever had transpired. When the series entered episode fourteen, the opening still sounds like a war cry, but more heartfelt and provided the feeling of getting revenge for fallen comrades. The second ending is melancholy, reflecting how the series had turned to a more serious note the closer it got to the finale. Each song mainly featured Akame.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much, but it is not for the weak of heart. I warn everyone reading this review that you will probably be in tears by the end -- I know I was. Other than bawling my eyes out, I enjoyed watching the relationships between the characters. There is nicely timed laughter, and though the pacing gets a little odd in the middle, the whole show turned out fine. \\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nGreat concept. The story wavered a little during the middle, but got back on track. It was a little annoying that the anime is called Akame ga Kill, but Akame never seems like the main character till the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nAmazing artwork in the beginning. Dulls a little towards to end. Suddenly switches to a movie-styled film. I loved the focus and detail to the eyes, hair, and even the background characters, but the transformation in animation style was way too sudden.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 9\\n\r\nMelodies openings and endings. OSTs were very memorable. I bet I'll cry every time I hear one now.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nMain characters highly developed. Side characters developed, but some still remained a mystery. Nothing was really expanded on, and motives aren't quite clear unless you fill in the holes yourself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nVery enjoyable. I looked forward to each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.4\\n\r\nWhile good, characters weren't really expanded on, and the supposed main character never really seemed like one. Music was splendid, and well as the story is helped describe. The art was great, but the style transition was way too awkward. I liked this anime a lot. I recommend it to everyone!\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Ship: Esdeath x Tatsumi\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Esdeath\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Song: \"Tsuki Akari\" - Second ED",

            "content": "Plot\r\nThe world is filled with corruption and chaos, where the innocent get killed or set to prison with no proper trial. All controlled in the hands of the depraved Prime Minister who manipulates the Child Emperor to do his bidding. A world filled with dangerous monsters alike. A young fighter, Tatsumi has set his journey for the capitol to earn money for his starving village. Tatsumi was nearly becoming a victim of corruption, got recruited by Night Raid, a group of assassins dedicated to eliminate their targets who plague corruption on the capitol.\r\n________________\r\nAnimation\r\nOh yes, how this anime handles the Animation is the ACTION and theBATTLES which is the main theme. The reason of this is from the variety of characters and Arms. They can't fall back to a standard fighting style for all of them. For example, not everyone has to use a sword and shield, so the character animations have to be varied, and Akame Ga Kill handles this BEAUTIFULLY!!!\\n\\n\r\nEven though these characters are going to battle and we do ask the question \"who is going to die?\" but also ask the question \"HOW they're going to die?\"\\n\r\nI have to give creds to people who lay out these scenes in unique and interesting ways. I do also give creds to the animators for the GORE FEST this anime offers. Akame Ga Kill doesn't play easy unlike OTHER animes I've known. ....I AM LOOKING AT YOU SCHOOL DAYS! For this regard, when you have people die, THEY DIE FOR REAL! That comes very rare in types animes that has come before.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nIt is the adaptation of the unfinished manga with a great big twists of it's own. For I guarantee you would get hooked on the first few episodes and then it gets more interesting from there on. Akame Ga Kill has factions throughout the whole anime. First, you got the Night Raid, The Revolutionary Army (Resistance), The Empire, Path of Peace, The Four Temple Rakshasa Demons, and The Jaegers. Each Factions hold unique kinds of characters for they're all deadly. By deadly, I mean, they're all ready to kill.\\n\\n\r\nThe REAL FOCUS is only between Night Raid and The Jaegers, for they are the main factions on this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, this show is not all serious, that I can assure you. Even though someone dies, there'll be a person who would \"lighten things up\" with some jokes to tone things down a bit and it's totally necessarily fine. From slapsticks to emotional character death and back again to slapsticks. This is somewhat fine for me, however it lacks balance between them and it can get boring.\\n\\n\r\nAkame Ga Kill for me is like a Monster-Of-The -Week type anime, with each episode (or two) will introduce a brand new character with a unique or POOOOWEFUL, UUUUULLTRAAAA, \"OP\" Imperial Arms (More info on Character section). Which makes this show interesting on what are these Imperial Arms can do, and have the audience imaginatively pare with other Imperial Arms on \"which is more better?\" type battles.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing this show lacks is Plot Armor. Remember it's going to be 2 main factions between N.Raiders and The Jaegers. No matter who wins, someone.....IS GOING. TO. DIE!!! For that which makes this show more \"interesting.\"\\n\\n\r\n________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nAll these characters who are in the same/different faction(s) have one thing common. They all have these legendary Imperial Arms. These Imperial Arms were created by the orders of the previous emperor knowing of his death. Done so, that his legacy would live on after death. These Arms come in a variety of magics and supernatural powers which can be use for other means. Unfortunately, since their creation, the Imperial Arms are either lost or traded. However it's commonly known that people with Imperial Arms can hope to defeat/murder others who have Imperial Arms.\\n\\n\r\nThe Black haired, Red-eyes, assassin: Akame, is NOT the protagonist. (That's what the anime tells you to believe). It's all about main person, Tatsumi ,whose going to help earn money to save his poor village.\\n\\n\r\nEach character in this anime are all well in-depth and they have a pure reason why they all wanted to fight. Some may fight for Justice, Honor, Peace, Tranquility, Glory and all that goody shabang. For others fight for Greed, Pride, Sadism, Vengeance or for the sake of Murder.\\n\\n\r\nWe've come to know between Night Raid members are the heroes and The Jaegers are villains. Of course, the audience would root for the heroes because the other team are all bad right?\\n\\n\r\nWRONG!\\n\\n\r\nEven though, The Jaeger are task to eliminate all Resistance, including Night Raid who are against the Capitol, still there are members who joined in have the same intentions like Night Raid. Unfortunately, it's a pity though.\\n\\n\r\nFor that, this anime spends more time on Morality from both sides of the..... ummm, how should I call it..... uhh, \"DEBATE\". These both Factions brings up the question, \"what do they really fight for?\"\\n\\n\r\n________________\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI have no hate for English Dub, since there is none in Akame Ga Kill. If there is, I have to recommend Subs and this anime doesn't need it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack on this anime for me, is both good and bad. On the Good side, the soundtrack on it's own is DAMN BADASS!! The other it's only used as the main theme of this anime, which would be fine, except it rarely keeps it's atmosphere for long. Makes the music quite jarring at those times, it's a shame really.\\n\\n\r\n________________\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\nAkame Ga Kill comes as a fun time with friends to play bets with who haven't seen this anime before. Have them picking a favorite character they like and see how far will they survive until the very last episode? I, for one, agreed to that and I had fun with it. They should tread carefully though, because they would have their feels for the character they like, HURT! A LOT!\\n\\n\r\nAlso I can see this anime to be a Fighting/Hack&Slash KOEI style type game. C'mon, who couldn't disagree that these characters have unique fighting styles and awesome looking finishers.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters in this anime has some \"Fan Service\" and could have fallen into the trap of Sexual Assault but fortunately, that never happened.\\n\r\nThe Fights in this anime for me are amazing, even though for there are some feel little rushed.\\n\\n\r\nI don't like to compare this anime to Akame Ga Kill to the manga but if someone really wants my opinion, then I recommend reading the Manga since it is unfinished and all your favorite character(s) is there (Hopefully).\\n\r\nI have to say this is not a type of anime you can watch re-watch it. It is a once-in-a-while type unless you really want to see your characters die again. \\n\\n\r\nI do have mixed feelings on how I should personally rate this anime because I do 85% love it. Does it live up to the hype? Yes, almost. Is it a MUST BY for anime collection? No, not particularly. I would recommend streaming it. Unless this is how they want to end Akame Ga Kill and start Season 2 or not at all. If they do want start Season 2 then I would recommend it's a buy.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: 8/10 - The Fatalities were never more better than that",

            "content": "Akame ga kill is a pleasant surprised\r\nI read a few reviews and generally, it is quite negative so i watched the anime with low expectation and wow it was very nice and unexpected. \r\nThe story: a group of assassinations who works against the corrupted government. The plot sounds a bit cliche and not too amazing but the way the anime executed the plot and the pacing was just enough to not become too draggy nor too fast-pace. \r\nThe art: nice since it is quite a new anime.\r\nThe sound: I think it was ok but not outstanding since it didnt catch my attention.\r\nCharacter: there are nottoo much character development but then again, there are definitely some. They are not too draggy which for me, i think that is nice for a change. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: My top list of my anime was 7 deadly sins so watching this has a lot of similarity. Each of the anime has its own unique characteristic but my enjoyment of this one is almost the same as when i watch 7 deadly sins. The fighting scene are not too draggy nor it is super epic but it is definitely above average. The tense of the episodes making you want to cheer for people of the nightraid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is a quite great anime and i was quite entertaining watch it. I know a lot of people compare to the manga and the anime and I didnt read the manga but I like the anime as it is. \\n\r\nI definitely recommend the anime",

            "content": "So I finished Akame ga Kill and it has been enjoyable, but it's far from perfect. So I am going to go with my standard pros and cons of the show. \r\nPros. \r\n1. It looks amazing, the art in it is very well done. From the fight scenes to chase scenes to anything really it all flows really well and just looks great. \r\n2. They have some pretty interesting characters who have some good back stories that should be delved into more. Even the villains are given good back stories and made it pretty interesting. \r\n3. It's fun. It's an anime you can just sitback and binge watch and just enjoy the action in, and because of the art it just makes it a fun anime to relax to. \\n\\n\r\nSpoilers ahead. \\n\\n\r\nCons. \\n\r\n1. Whilst the show started out very strong it went downhill very quickly. The interesting backstories all the characters have and all the stuff that made them interesting, becomes pointless once you realize that most if not all of them are going to die. Any connection you have with the characters on either side is lost because before to long they are dead. It was ok when it happened the first couple times in the anime, but before long it became something done for shock value and had no real impact anymore. \\n\r\n2. The hero of the story is cliche and boring. Tatsumi started off interesting enough and had potential, but he has since become the standard boring hero that all the girls in the show fall in love with. He hasn't had any interesting fights and out of all the characters (good guys and bad) is the weakest in both power and interest. \\n\r\n3. The show has become super rushed now. From what has been said the show has deviated from the manga now since episode 19 and is doing its own thing, because of this it has become super rushed. Also they have skipped large parts of the manga which has also added to the rushed feeling of it all. This is making it very predictable and has really lessened the quality of the show. \\n\r\n4. A not very original ending that was really quite boring and really showed the rushed nature of the show. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end my final thoughts are this show had a lot of potential. The characters were very interesting and it started off pretty deep with lots of layers to it. It's now become quite generic and well boring. Still worth watching but mostly for some cool action moments and the few really good early episodes.",

            "content": "When I heard about this show, I was genuinely excited to watch it. \r\nWhen the first episode came out, I was not impressed. Others loved it, but all I saw was a run of the mill fantasy anime with gore.\r\nStory - 4 - The story is repetitive to say the least. Night raid goes on an assassination attempt, fight happens, gore happens for the sake of edgy, and some important character dies every few episodes because someone needs to die. You see, this anime forces itself to be special, but it doesn't try to be special. It forces its drama, but doesn't try to bedramatic. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. And that's the problem. Everything feels forced. Drama feels like it's there not for drama, but to have drama. Death and gore feels like it's there not for advancing the story, but to have death and gore. And unnecessary fanservice is there for the sake of unnecessary fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6 - The animation is actually pretty good at times, and it's pretty solid. Concerning the settings and environment, there is nothing special about them. You can literally replace backgrounds with every other generic fantasy anime and you wouldn't be able to tell a difference. The designs for the soldiers are as generic as can be and the imperial arms can be too colorful and flashy at times. For an anime that's trying to be dark and gritty during fight scenes, the designs of the imperial arms don't help.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6 - Sound effects are solid. Soundtrack is decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3 - The characters were the biggest letdown for me for this anime. Almost everyone is cliche cliche cliche, and they do jack shit to distinguish themselves from that. A positive is that they're smarter than your normal cliched characters, but that's the least you can expect from a \"dark\" anime. \\n\r\nTatsumi is your naive \"I want to be stronger\" main character that everyone is supposed to sympathize with for the billionth time. \\n\r\nBulat is your typical manly \"big bro aniki\" type of guy (Why do these characters always have pompadour hairdos?)\\n\r\nLeone is your cliched energetic chick who flirts with the main character because he's the main character and that's the only reason.\\n\r\nLubbock is your cliched perverted friend-zoned \"try to be cool but fails\" character.\\n\r\nSheele is your cliched quiet glasses-wearing dumbshit\\n\r\nAkame is the supposed main love interest (but maybe not?) and title character, who is coincidentally the least fleshed out of all the members of Night Raid that had their generic backstorys fleshed out.\\n\r\nAnd Mine.\\n\\n\r\n                     Mine.\\n\\n\r\n                               The MOST CLICHED TSUNDERE one could think of. Her name; M-I-N-E, spells tsundere. She is the most cliched of generic of cliched of generic of cliched tsundere down to her appearance, her voice, her personality, and her attire. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains don't fare much better either. 70% of them are evil for the sake of being evil. Seryu aka Justice Bitch, is innocent one second, and insane the next. Why? \\n\\n\r\nDialogue - Others didn't seem to have a problem with the dialogue, but I did. \\n\r\nThere is too much dialogue going on in the fight scenes. Its excessive even for a shounen, but this anime is trying to be dark and the constant dialogue doesn't work. And one might say, that excessive dialogue doesn't necessarily break the mood in fight scenes, and I agree, but it does here. \\n\r\n\"uhhh, my wound is hurting from where I was stabbed earlier\" (Character is shown to hold his wound) and then you get this type of dialogue x1000 over in every single scene. You'd think for an anime that's trying to be mature, they wouldn't treat the audience like they're 10 year old dumbasses.\\n\\n\r\nAnd apparently there's a dialogue template, seeing as how much dialogue is rehashed over and over again with maybe one word that is altered each time. It's like mad libs really. \\n\r\n                 - \"As expected of [Insert random name here]\" each time someone's opponent does something powerful. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, my enjoyment of this series amounts of a 4/10 and an overall score of 4/10.\\n\\n\r\n                 \"As expected of [PancakesAndStuff] for wasting his precious limited time to write a review that most people will probably find not helpful. \\n\\n",

Even i didn't enjoy the anime much , i can still say that Akame Ga Kill did not make me regret watching it .\r\nStory:7\r\nThe story tell us about Tatsumi , who goes to the capital in order to get more money for his village . He has two comrades and that is Leyasu and Sayo , who soon died . Tatsumi soon joined the Night Raid , where his journey begins . I can't say much on thestory plot because i don't want to spoil it much . The story pace seems rush and thus make it unjoyable . The rush itself is one of the flaws that make it an anime where they got pottential and yet got flaws at the same time .\\n\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nThe arts and animation were decent . Even the battles scenes were decent . They got some 3D animation which is a bit cool .\\n\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nThe voice actor and actress were okay . Nothing that make it very unjoyable . The OP and ED were nice . Got some thrill feelings for the OP and relax kind of feelings on ED .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:6\\n\r\nSome character did have backgrounds and some didn't . Some even exist only to be killed in a second which is pathetic . I don't want to say much about the characters because you'll need to watch it to understand what i meant . Some characters that i really like where Akame , the one that have a death sword , Sheele , an airhead girl yet very scary when it comes to battle and Bulat , the cool dude that got cool hair whose seems gay by his comrade . They really know how to make it very unjoyable for me by ''Erase'' one by one of the characters that i like . I was very mad and sad at first and after some episodes , i didn't even care who live or who die anymore . Like i said , some characters exist mainly to be killed or to die . They really forgot about characters development here .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7\\n\r\nI enjoy first few episodes just fine but after that , my enjoyment became my torturement . Why ? Let's take a look . They tried so hard at making the story as dark , gore and epic as possible that they forget about the pace of the story and the characters development . These two things play a major role on animes to make it at least a bit enjoyable . Yet , Akame Ga Kill failed to make it enjoyable . There were some comedy that can only make my torturement less painful . Other than that , i got nothing .\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\r\nAkame Ga Kill fail to make me watch it with full enjoyable . I am a bit dissapoint by how the story goes and how the characters development and such . If you want an anime where blood splatter , gore and a bit epic battles exist , Akame Ga Kill is for you . Just don't put much faith on this one . Its not every one cup of tea .",

Tatsima.. wait I remembered, yes, Tatisuma, who cares anyway, he isn't the main character, the anime starts with him and keeps focusing mainly on his story, his points of view in every scenario, what he thinks of and how emotional he gets every time,till the very last episode, well, maybe before the very last episode, and then they decide to.. wait, nvm.... Anyway, he is a guy from a poor village or something (yes, not very professional by me), while his main goal was (cus RIP) to help his village by going to the capital and just ruin his freaking life the stupid motherf.. wait, going out of subject, are we? It turns out to be the worst decision of his life.. I don't recommend watching this anime at all!!!! Unless if, you pause at episode 19 and wait for the sequel.

So, you kept on eating more, never deciding if you liked the taste or hated it. By the end, you didn't really feel good about eating it, but it was an interesting experience nonetheless.\r\nAkame ga Kill! has a lot of bad in it. The hero, Takumi, is almost memorable in just how bland he is; say what you will about Eren Yaeger, but at least \"yells a lot\" is something of a character trademark. All ofthe villains are either cartoonishly evil, more likeable than the heroes, or some ungodly combination of the two. You know a character is a bad guy, because the show gives you a freshly painted still frame of their face twisted into sharp angles, eyes transformed into those of a demon. The series feels like a shonen anime as written by one of those angsty film school students who always wrote screenplays about serial killers.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then on some days, I was in the mood for trash.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the show has a few villains that I kind of liked. Some exited the picture before they got to reach their full potential, but their personalities were fun, even if I still don't get why the bondage-fetish warlord was so in love with Blandy McBlanderson. I guess it's just another manga writer imprinting his sexual fantasy onto the main character.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of dumb action to be found in Akame ga Kill! Animation is okay, nothing special. There are some superpower concepts that I thought were pretty interesting, though.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the heroes are predominantly women, but they're not all trying to get it on with Mr. McBlanderson, so... yay, feminism?\\n\\n\r\nEh, there's better shonen to watch.\\n",

            "content": "I don't know if I'm alone in this, but whenever I look for new anime to watch, I scroll through MAL's Top Anime list or through recommendation lists of shows I liked.  When doing this scrolling, I have a hard and fast rule: watch shows rated on average 8 or above.\r\nHowever, sticking to that 8 and above rule has not given me any fruitful results lately.  I watched Nodame Cantabile and found it boring (not that it isn't good; it just wasn't good for me).   I watched Shigatsu and found everything but the 21st episode boring.  I watched Mushishi andfound it boring.  So I thought to myself, \"Hey, why don't I learn to think for myself?\"  So after seeing Akame Ga Kill in Nanatsu no Taizai's recommendation list and getting pulled in by the synopsis, I decided to give it a try.  Mind you, I watched it against the advice of every reviewer on the internet, so it took a lot of courage.\\n\\n\r\nAfter I finished it, my first thought was, \"Hey, not bad.\"  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off with a rather typical premise: small organization with relatively OP characters fight the establishment.  However, just like everyone says, the story has a dark twist.  I'm not going to try to say that the edginess makes the show somehow deep.  What it does do is capture your attention.  Just about every episode something pretty revolting gets shown on screen, triggering emotional reactions.  This, added on with plenty of interesting plot developments and plot twists, makes for one hell of a ride.  Akame Ga Kill doesn't have the best story known to man, I'll admit, but it complements the shows other factors to make the show entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is completely normal for today's anime, which in my book is great.  I'm the type that can't stand old animation and art styles, so having the bright colors and fluid animation helps make the show fun to watch.  However, it is still just average for today's stuff.  It's not glorious like Unlimited Blade Works or Hanasaku Iroha.  So it gets an 8 for doing a pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nI can't think of an OST that I would want to hear more, and I guess maybe the first opening is good.  However, the OSTs did do well to set the mood and they never felt out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nEvery single character in the show feels like a cardboard cut-out.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst, let's talk about the villains.  They fall into one of two camps:\\n\r\n1. EEEEEEEEEEEVVIILLLLLLL\\n\r\n2. Stupid\\n\\n\r\nThe first one is the most prevalent.  You know exactly the types I mean: mad scientists that do human experiments (how often has everyone see this character?  seriously, come on), guys that cruelly operate brothels with drugs and stuff, people that torture humans for fun, people who kill because they loooooveeee battle, and manipulative greedy guy.  In my experience, there are very few people in the world that are 100% evil and without any redeeming qualities.  Yet, this show trots them out one after another and expects the audience to be convinced by them.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's definitely not convincing.  In my view, every villain should have a valid reason as to why they are willing to fight.  Almost every human being is rational and is endowed with the emotions of guilt and pity, so villains should always avoid doing things that look villainous unless it's for a good reason.  But it looks like these EEEEEVILLLLLL characters just do bad things just to do bad things, and it's infuriating.\\n\\n\r\nThe second one is the villain type they send out to add more depth to the characters.  There is one or two of these types, and they aren't much better than the first type.  The show tries to make them more real by having them shout out good causes as they attack our protagonists, but they are also shallow.  Instead of fighting because they are EEEEEVVVILLLLLL, they fight because they don't attempt to understand anything around them.  Which is stupid, because no rational human being willingly fights for a side that they don't understand.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, you would think the protagonists would be more original or fleshed-out, but they aren't either.  Give yourself 5 seconds to think of protagonist tropes and the first (I think) 7 things will perfectly describe Night Raid's members.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nEven after the awful characters and the merely above-average story, the show was still a ton of fun.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion/Overall: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a lot going for it: good visuals, thrilling story, and fitting sound.  As a result, I think it is definitely worth a watch to pass the time.  In the end, watching anime is about having fun, and Akame Ga Kill definitely fits the bill.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThis anime had a lot of potential, but it was undoubtedly rushed. Throughout the anime there are some great, though predictable twists, which were enjoyable due to their hilarity. However, there were many points within the anime that were way too cliche. I have not read the manga, but I do see that is ongoing, so I'm guessing the anime made its own path, I am merely judging the writer's of the anime. The story seems generally fast-paced at times and rushed to the point that the lack of development makes it fail somewhat. I don't disagree with killing of maincharacters in a show (I've been desensitized by Game of Thrones) but without a proper buildup to that point makes the catharsis which the audience feels very fake. \\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art in the anime seems a bit outdated for its release date when compared to the animation of other anime that were produced by Ufotable. The excessive gore within the anime seems like I'm watching the incredibly old Elfen Lied, but, it is still watchable. The slow motion and sometimes fast-paced camera movement make up for the lack of better animation. In addition, the pan-out scenes that are covered with detailed art when the slicing of a throat of the killing of a character occurs is pretty awesome.\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music could've been better with more rock/action packed type of music, but it's okay I guess. Not great and not bad.\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nThis is where the series fails horribly. Going back to the last sentence of the story review, I mentioned the fake feeling we get due to the lack of buildup in the storyline, which of course makes the characters suffer. The characters are introduced and then killed off, again I don't disagree with this, but the lack of character-depth provided makes it less emotional in a way, unlike other anime (FMAB for example). If the series was given two seasons each with 20 episodes or so, giving it more time to buildup the plot and characters, fixing out the flaws, this could've been a masterpiece.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nRegardless of the plot and characters, it's been a while since I've watched an anime that was unique, and refreshing. This anime is action-packed, somewhat heart-wrenching and hilarious. I binge-watched it in a day and a half.\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\n8/10 would recommend. :)\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing. People don't keep their promises in this anime :/\\n",

            "content": "Where to start? Personally, I believe anyone who watches this will either utterly hate or love it, there simply is no in between. It definitely does its role in provoking certain emotions from the sadness of seeing certain beloved characters being killed off to the anger you might feel towards the prime minister.\r\nStory 10/10: The story isn't anything over the top or \"original\", but it is very interesting. It's about a group of assassins called Night Raid who are sent out to assassinate corrupt officials. Overall, the story has a serious mood to it, but it compensates with its fair share of humor which Ireally enjoyed. The story itself is fairly realistic to the point where even your favorite characters die, solely due to it being set during a time of a war and in reality, the odds of your survival are nill to none.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: Very impressive, nothing too flashy, but simply phenomenal. Helped set the mood and all, and was fitting to each aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Both openings and endings complement the anime very well! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10: Each character was very lovable in their own way regardless of how short their screen time was... (Spoiler Alert...Sheele)... Every characters backstory sufficed, and explained very well their motives on wanting to pursue the life of an assassin. Loved each character and didn't find that one character that you couldn't stand like other animes i've seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Perfect, hit me in the feels at the proper times. Left me as an emotional wreck for awhile after the show finished and was a constant rollercoaster of feels. Great action sequences!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: Personally, I don't understand the dislike for the anime. It does deviate from the manga about halfway in, but it seemed necessary due to the cramming of it being into 24 episodes. I vastly enjoyed the realism it had, seeing your favorite characters die off and not be invincible was nice. It also didn't have something that could bring people back to life like other shows, which I've always hated in certain animes... Once you're gone, you are gone with no way of being brought back. Would recommend this anime to anyone who loves good action/comedy animes.",

            "content": "Unique. Akame ga kill is very different from the usual magical thriller anime's. \r\nI loved the story line and I loved the characters. Some people say that it is basic, and characters are underdeveloped, I'll admit that 24 episodes is a bit too little for so many characters to be developed nicely, but looking in general, I think they did a pretty good job on it.\r\nBut despite their under-creations, this anime has two vital points for which I congratulate it:\r\n1) Killer characters. Maybe I'm in that age at the moment, but I've been honestly fed up with all the moral BS that stops protagonists frommaking any real difference and then having to deal with the consequences. Okay, maybe that was a little rough, but it's honestly quite annoying, having to go through protagonists being torn up between what is morally right and what they should actually do. Akame ga kill spares us the trouble, and the main characters are allowed to kill without much remorse. Some people dislike that, I say MUCH OBLIGED! \\n\\n\r\n2) Killing main characters. Yea, spoiler alert, good guys, main guys, do die in this anime, thanks to the awesome rule that somebody has to die if two imperial arms go into a duel. This means that whenever we get a clash between good and bad, you know someone is going down, and thank you for not making the bad guys lose every single time!! Some may say that it is shallow, but what this really does, is it takes away the cliche clashes between good and evil after which nothing is decided cause both sides retreat. Akame has characters to spare, and Characters to KILL. I personally quite enjoy when main characters are not protected by some divine luck. And like game of thrones, this really spices things up.\\n\\n\r\nSo there you go, unique and intriguing, perhaps not a masterpiece, but definitely worth watching :) A Solid 9 from me #Kisses",

The only complaints I have are that it didn't entirely follow the manga and it ended. It had so much potential to continue. I personally think this show should have been produced after the manga was finished. The deaths in the show were what really pushed me over. \r\nI really felt something for each and every single character in the story line and the constant losses they sufferedkept me intrigued. It really showed that what they were fighting for was real and important.\\n\\n\r\n If you're a manga reader of the series don't worry this is a great adaptation of this wonderful series with some changes near the end.

This one is right up your alley.\r\nAkame Ga Kill starts out with a boy name Tatsumi who ventures out to the Capital City to get work in the Imperial Army to raise money to save his village. After getting denied jobs and getting robbed by a busty blonde name Leone he gets invited to a wealthy families home and becomes part of their security. However, he later finds out that the family take poor people or people born out side the Capital City and torture them to death. After seeing his friends form his village in thisshed where they torture the people and later kills the young girl who invited him to their home. After that he joins up with the infamous Night Raid assassins whose goal is to change the corruption in government and start a coup. A faction called the \"Jaegers\" are formed to uphold the governments authority and is lead the the sexy, badass war psycho General Esdeath. The problem that most people had with this show is that after episode 19 the show deviates from the manga. Now if you are an anime only viewer this show is great, but if you want to read the manga start from chapter 39 on because after chapter 38 that is where the anime starts to deviate from the manga. Now I read the manga and the score would have been a 10/10, but for what its worth it's still a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great. White Fox did a really good job animating the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only four characters I am going to say are the four that stood out to me.

He wants to get stronger in order to change the world the people in the current government live in as well as the rest of Night Raid. Akame is the badass sword fighter who mostly has an apathetic tone, but cares deeply about her comrades. She also gets a few funny jokes here and there, but for the most part she's there to have awesome fights. Now there is Esdeath. I really like Esdeath. First off she a person who lust for war and violence, she can control  ice, and has no sympathy what so ever. She also is in love with Tatsumi and will do anything to have him by her side. Not to mention she is fucking awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Akame Ga Kill is great in my opinion. The one voice actress that stood out to me is the voice of Esdeath. Also both openings are great songs to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Akame Ga Kill. Even though it strays away from the manga it still is able to hold up to it's epicness. Also the the last two episodes are beast. Overall Akame Ga Kill is a great show and definitely a good show to watch, but like I said if you want to catch up with the manga you can stop the anime after finishing episode 19 and continue with the manga on chapter 39. Also I don't like how people who died in the manga didn't die in the anime, but I digress. I recommend this show just for the fact the majority of it was epic as hell. Like I said only downfall is that it doesn't follow the manga, but if you're an anime only person then it's still a very good show.",

            "content": "During the time of its airing, Akame ga Kill was considered as one of the most hyped Animes mostly due to its dark tone, exciting fights and fairly violent scenes. However the question is, did it live up to the hype ?\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Akame ga Kill will surely grab the hearts of some due to the way the first episode is presented.. But sadly, things don't go too well after that. The plot is very linear and nothing new is ever really presented to change this in any way during the entire show, and because of this it can get very predictable at times.The pacing of the show is extremely poor considering that events go by in a flash and the next situation is presented without even giving much value to the previous. Other than that, the world is never really explored or explained to the viewer, you are expected to accept whatever is thrown at you.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nThe art was fair I'd say.. Not bad but not great either, but it did a fairly good job at complimenting the dark tone where it mattered.\\n\r\nAs for the Animation, it was very well done, particularly during the fight scenes.  The movements were smooth and seemed fast paced but, unfortunately, this wasn't the case throughout the anime. The Anime cuts down on its production during most of its scenes and shows its better side mostly during fight scenes but even then, not all the fight scenes show the same level of quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't really anything to write home about.. Similar to the art and animation, the score really only stood out during the fight scenes but even then it wasn't anything memorable.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also okay, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHerein lies Akame ga Kill's biggest flaw, its characters. The main character is your typical shounen lead who believes in fighting for what's right and and to never give up, something we've seen done numerous times. Similarly the entire cast is filled with stereotypes, they have nothing extra added to them except for a few minutes of vague backgrounds but that wasn't the biggest problem, the biggest problem was the huge lack of character development. The characters don't change or improve in any way except for the upgrade in power ups for a few of them which could hardly be considered as actual character development. This also impacts the next point which is how the Anime makes clear that people will indeed die and due to the lack of character development, there were no emotions felt behind any of the character's deaths, in fact the story eventually reaches a point where you can easily just predict the character next in line. The villains especially were the most ridiculous, they weren't given any legit reasons behind their motives and most of the time it felt as if they were just doing 'bad things' because they are 'bad people'..  No depth in characters whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\r\nIf we consider only the fight scenes, then Akame ga Kill offers a fair level of enjoyment but look past that and you've got yourself a pretty stale show. Most of the time it felt as if the show was trying too hard to make the viewer empathise or feel especially during the more depressing scenes but there was nothing there to give the viewer that push to actually feel immersed by the scene.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion and Verdict: \\n\r\nAkame ga Kill is a poorly written show but having good directed and animated fights is what keeps it standing. though I did personally enjoy the show to a certain extend but the flaws prevented me from enjoying it in its entirety. If you're looking to just pass the time and don't really have many other options then go ahead and give Akame ga Kill a try, but if you're looking for something with an interesting story and quality entertainment then you'd best look elsewhere.",

            "content": "What is right? What is wrong? Who do I follow? Who do fight? Do I forgive? Do I avenge? \r\nTell me, what path would you choose?\r\nThese are exactly the kind of questions viewers are faced with when watching Akame ga Kill! It\u2019s more than just bloodshed and assassinations \u2013 there\u2019s a very distinct underlying theme behind this series. Unless you are ready to open your mind and explore the validity of what you and others have believed before, I suggest you not watch this anime until you are. However, if you are in fact ready to accept that some things are undeniably true and false,then proceed and see how great this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nNote: From episode 21 and onwards, the anime differs from the manga, mainly due to the fact the anime covers a lot more than what had been published in the manga at the time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBACKGROUND INFO\\n\r\n=============\\n\r\nBefore I begin, I want to provide a brief background info on what led me to this anime. Back in 2012, I was going through a phase where I only wanted to read manga. Not just any kind of manga \u2013 I wanted to read a manga that had characters engaging in fast-paced battles with one another in hopes of achieving their respective goals that their ideologies manifested. I wanted to read a manga that provided me, the reader, more than one perspective to which I could ponder about what is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI searched through at least a dozen manga until I stumbled across Akame ga Kill! Initially, it was the manga\u2019s cover art that caught my eye because it was done very well; that feeling was compounded further as I read through the first chapter. It was just one chapter, yet it had everything I had been searching for already. It had been a while since a manga was able to make me confidently say \u201cthis is it\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFast-forward to the present: When I heard that the Akame ga Kill! manga was going to be adapted into an anime, I was so excited. I was anticipating the release with great optimism, especially when I heard White Fox was going to be the studio taking on this task. And now with its release, I can finally write and share my review! \\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 10/10\\n\r\n==========\\n\r\nWith a story revolving around politics and sociology, it\u2019s easy to see how many viewers can pass up the opportunity to watch Akame ga Kill! (AgK!). In real life, these disciplines are complex insofar that those who do not have enough information on a particular issue cannot even begin to decide on what\u2019s true/false or who\u2019s right/wrong. However, passing up on AgK! because of that reason would be a huge mistake.\\n\\n\r\nAgK! does a brilliant job of breaking down these political/sociological boundaries so that every viewer can see how some issues surrounding these areas affect the average person. Although it may be more exaggerated in comparison to real-life, AgK! offers viewers an unobstructed view of the corruption of power (namely, those with high authority) that control societies. These corrupt individuals and groups prey on the innocent \u2013 oppressing them and using them as nothing more than tools to fuel their selfish desires. Some are not even aware that they are being manipulated, at all. \\n\\n\r\nAs a consequence, there are individuals that unknowingly grow up to become pawns. They live thinking that they exist to defend peace, justice, and their homeland, but in reality they are doing the opposite \u2013 defending, and thereby nourishing the corruption. However, some individuals grow to realize this peaceful and orderly world they supposedly live in is an illusion to hide the evil that exists. Therefore, unable to stand by and watch, they go against society to try and save it. This is exactly what AgK! is about \u2013 choosing your own path and proving it\u2019s the right one. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the story\u2019s pace, I think it was done extremely well. Every event that took place had its own purpose, was not rushed nor was stretched to unreasonable lengths, and more often than not it advanced the story in a logical direction. I was a bit concerned that the anime adaptation would result in some loss in detail from the manga, and of course there would be. Some miniature story and characters from the manga are omitted from the anime to save time, but the main story remains unchanged for the most part. In regards to the anime's pacing, White Fox did a wonderful job of choosing where to start and end each episode, in respect of the story.\\n\\n\r\nLooking more closely at the story itself though, many viewers will be surprised at how fast things happen to unfold. We (viewers) are accustomed to having important people practically survive until the story\u2019s end, but in AgK! this will change that belief quickly. People die a lot during the course of AgK!\u2019s story. It gets to the point where you start saying, \u201cOf course they would die \u2013 at the end of the day, they\u2019re human!\u201d as if every other show you have watched before had characters that weren\u2019t human, after all. It can be absurd to many viewers, but I consider it a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nNo matter how you look at it, AgK!\u2019s story reflects some basic truths about the reality we live in. Whether in small or large amounts, many, if not all, countries around the world are affected by corruption in some form. Taking everything so far into account, I give AgK!\u2019s story a 10/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\r\n=======\\n\r\nIn my opinion, AgK!\u2019s art is above-average, but not quite the best I\u2019ve seen. Starting with the background art, sceneries are drawn clearly without overpowering the main focus (the characters and other important objects such as weapons). Viewers can appreciate the amount of detail that goes into landscapes that have been destroyed. Studios often do a poor job on this, but White Fox clearly put some effort into doing a better job. Animals (namely monsters) and weapons are drawn with more detail than I expected, which is always good. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, characters look rather simple despite each one having unique physical features about them. One thing that annoyed me a bit was how the \u201ceye-liner\u201d or eyeliner around the top of a character\u2019s eye was sometimes a different colour than the traditional black. That made it seem like they had bushy eyelashes. To me, it really diminished their aesthetic look. I\u2019m aware that that\u2019s how they may have been designed to look like, but I didn\u2019t really like it. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, I find everything else about the characters really satisfying. The majority of male viewers (and not unlikely, female viewers) will enjoy some of the eye candy in AgK! They are done rather sparingly and appropriately more often than not, which helps in maintaining the overall heroic tragedy theme. I wouldn\u2019t say AgK! would be ruined it didn\u2019t have any typical fan-service, but it does provide relief when events get a bit too depressing.\\n\\n\r\nNow, regardless of the type of emotion felt, the characters\u2019 facial expressions are spot on. Very expressive. I particularly like it when a female character blushes and smiles \u2013 it was often exaggerated but man, it was like staring at a manifestation of true beauty. Not only that, these facial expressions are often accompanied by backgrounds that support them whatever they may be. Can you imagine how beautiful it is to not only see a female character blushing and smiling, but doing so while the sun was setting in the background? Talk about gorgeous. Furthermore, changes in the characters\u2019 physical conditions are drawn really well. Whether caused by things like injuries such as burn, an amputation, or even a small scratch, it was done sensibly and tastefully.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to animation, it was great for the most part. The fighting scenes were fluid, the special effects looked amazing, and the characters\u2019 movements were just as good. Except for their walking animations \u2013 they were terrible. Granted, many studios seem to have a hard time animating a character walking so I\u2019m not that annoyed. There may be times where it can get annoying though, so be prepared!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I\u2019m satisfied with the drawing, but because I can\u2019t overlook some its nuances I have decided to give AgK!\u2019s art an 8/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\n=========\\n\r\nFor viewers who have never heard of AgK! prior to this anime, the characters\u2019 voices may sound reasonably good. However, coming from a person who started off reading the manga before watching the anime, I found that some of them weren\u2019t as I expected them to be. A few sounded too young or old for their age or physical appearance, as well as having voices that did not suit their personalities really well. It\u2019s really hard say exactly what I mean by this, but then again it really boils down to personal preference. As objectively as possible, I would say that each of their voices are memorable and have enough expression in them to convey the right meaning in any given context. Heck, even though I know there are better voice actors/actresses out there, I\u2019ll admit that some of the voices kind of grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nBriefly speaking, sound effects like swords clashing, guns firing, and explosions are \u201cnormal\u201d \u2013 they are what you expect it to sound like. Nothing really fancy. Although, I do want to point out that the sounds monsters make are pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, the OP and ED songs in AgK! are beautiful. All of them. The songs used in the OPs are really intense which help maintain the viewer\u2019s attention; the songs used in the EDs are much softer which prolong the feeling of tragedy usually seen every episode. I think White Fox did an excellent job with song selection.\\n\\n\r\nAfter reviewing these aspects, I would have to give AgK!\u2019s sound a 7.5/10 (which I have to round to an 8/10 because of MAL\u2019s scoring system at the time of writing this review) I didn\u2019t factor in technical things like stereo and stuff, but I mean it sounds good with 2.1 sound. I don\u2019t believe it would diminish the quality of this anime by any significant amount having done so, nor would it be exceptionally better if it was surround sound but again, it\u2019s only my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\r\n=============\\n\r\nThe characters in AgK! are downright amazing. There are just so many of them, and with various personalities, too! Whether you enjoy seeing a character act sneaky, intelligent, tsundere, courageous, stubborn, or evil \u2013 it\u2019s all there. Viewers are bound to find at least one character they like. They often possess background stories of some sort which lends to the creation of pretty complex and in-depth personalities. AgK! isn\u2019t afraid of making viewers like characters that are supposedly \u201cbad\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, who the characters are as individuals often defines what their advantage and disadvantage are. Anyone can be susceptible to manipulation, regardless of how powerful they may be. For example, underestimating your enemies is one characteristic that many of characters possess, ultimately leading to their demise. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, viewers may end up kind of frustrated at AgK! because many of the likeable characters die. It may be extremely absurd to some, no doubt. However, in the end, I think AgK! aimed to get the majority of viewers to come together and ultimately scrutinize the actions of a particular group of individuals: the corrupted authorities that use their power to deprive societies of their liberties.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being brief in this section, I think it was more than enough to justify giving AgK!\u2019s character aspect a score of 10/10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\n=============\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching AgK! I honestly cannot find any reason to hate it other than those minor things like having bad walking animation or unsuitable voices. I always get excited when the latest episode airs. Lucky for most of you though, the series has probably ended by the time you manage to read this review, so you can watch it back to back. I do enjoy the weekly anticipation though, so all was not lost. \\n\\n\r\nFrom a purely objective standpoint, I would have to give this AgK! a 10/10 in terms of enjoyment. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\n==========\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Akame ga Kill! was everything I was looking for. The story was great. The characters were great. The art was great as well. And while the sound not so much, I can\u2019t say that it was enough to make me disappointed with this series. White Fox did a terrific job at adapting the manga into an anime. I\u2019m glad they were the ones to pick this series up. Who knows the horror that would have befallen on this anime had it been produced by a different studio? \\n\\n\r\nIt looks like writing a personal review on Akame ga Kill! was the path I chose. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTell me, have you made your resolve?\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked my review, please hit the 'helpful' button below! I'd greatly appreciate it! It gives me motivation to write more reviews and get better. Thank you!",

            "content": "I cant help but feel perplexed about the things people are saying about this anime and its relatively low scores. i understand that some anime aren't for everyone however its usually for understandable reasons that lovers of the series overlook or it might be down to personal preference.\r\nHowever in this case its for reasons like terrible characters which is simply not true at all and i have to seriously question what there meaning of the word \"terrible\" is,  as it isn't the same meaning that the rest of the world uses.\r\nthe story and premise is summed up in one word... Excellent, seriously i maycompare this anime to Gurren Lagann a lot because they are similar in a lot of ways. the premise is fresh and new. its based in an extremely interesting world filled with corruption, slightly similar to Fullmetal Alchemist. the introduction of imperial arms really intrigues me and adds so much to the combat as there is lots of strategy behind almost all the battles, its like watching a extremely interesting game of chess where you don't know who will win as the enemy will die but so will our main and supporting characters. no one is safe, this show has guts to kill of some extremely important characters and keep them dead. (like gurren lagann) the story in the manga and the anime deviates however the story in the anime is still awesome and i wouldn't have known if some hadn't of told me. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nthere isn't much to say about the art except the fighting scenes are beautifully done and almost a 10 however i decided to give it a 9 when compared to shows like attack on titan and hellsing ultimate.\\n\\n\r\nthe music was pretty good however there wasn't any stand out tracks like blumenkranz from kill la kill so i gave it an 7/10\\n\\n\r\nthe characters are, with out a doubt, the BEST part of this anime. all the character are extremely well developed with interesting back story's apart for a couple of exceptions like Lubbock and Chelsea who you don't really care for.   the main protagonist is awesome and has a lot of development (like gurren lagann) the romance is ether a hit or a miss however it has grown on me greatly and i ended up enjoying it.\\n\r\ncharacters like Akame, Tutsumi, Leone, Bulat. Esdeath (omg i wanted to put down so many more names) really make this show awsome, 3 of the characters from this show are on my favorite characters list. 10/10 don't listen to the haters, the speak lies.\\n\\n\r\nthis is one of them shows that you have to switch your brain off to enjoy (like gurren lagann) its all out insanity and amazing characters are the main selling points of this anime. i wasn't expecting much when i decided to watch this anime and omg was i surprised. 8/10 \\n\\n\r\ni highly recommend this anime.  8/10\\n",

That is not exactly true. The Characters are all really nice, they have just enough depth to not be stupid but not too much for them to get proper good and believeble, but that only benefits the show as it's main concentration is on action and the story, aswell as providing some rather average character back stories and their views on death/killing/war and peace and so on.\r\nWhat i really really liked about this show was the factthat drama did not feel forced, and when mature themes were explored, they weren't dumbed down. When someone dies, he dies. Not like in SAO's first arc, not like in every arc of Naruto, when people in AGK die, they die for real, and that's what makes this show so awesome.\\n\r\nIn terms of art it's pretty simple, reminds me of toaru, some moments are blatantly censored, like gore and split limbs, while others are not, like blood.\\n\r\nYou see, AGK has very clever written dialogue, without turning into a mess full of super-convincing dialogue which makes everyone give up their cause. The characters say just enough things, they don't convince each other to stop killing and live in peace, no, they express their viewpoint, and they fight, till one of them dies.\\n\r\nAll the funny moments kinda serve little purpose aside from getting you to know the characters so the drama feels more intense and you kind of feel the loss.\\n\r\nThe characters despite being kinda cliche, do say smart things, their will to fight is clearly justified through their life and backstory, which is very good for the show because it means that it lacks a truly good side and bad side (right up until the end, even then the bad side shows some kind of goodness)\\n\r\nTatsumi is an average MC. He is not too beliveble, i think any real person would submit to Esdeath at the first glance on those tits....\\n\r\nSo yeah, Tatsumi is actually probably one of the biggest plot devices throughout, aside from avenging his friends, there is barely any motive for him to do what he does.\\n\r\nWhat i do hate about this anime is that it's too generic, average, nothing particularly makes it stand out, and it lacks truly memorable moments.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is top-notch, truly nice tunes in some episodes make sure to underline the show's mood.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: an above average shounen, with good characters, good soundtracks, but it would probably benefit from being double the length of what it is and get slim plot twists in there too.",

            "content": "This is a complete do-over of my previous review of this anime. I wrote that just after the series ended and was in the heat of the moment. So, this new review is a completely unbiased review meant to tell you exactly what you're getting into.\r\nLet's clear up one thing. Akame ga Kill's genre, from what I see is, action, superpower(weapons), fantasy, comedy, adventure. Many people might say it is a dark anime but the comedy and sudden change of atmosphere refrain me from putting it in that category. It's certainly no Mirai Nikki but it does have blood and gore. As for the darkpsychological aspect, it doesn't quite cut it.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10:\\n\r\nYour typical good vs. bad scenario. The synopsis should clear things up. Good guys are the assassins who kill the rich corrupt people to maintain justice. The bad guys are the rich corrupt politicians, soldiers and anyone who supports them. Then you have some weapons with insane powers which makes stuff more interesting. From the start to the end, the mission is to kill the prime minister who controls the child king and has corrupted the country.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nThe art is amazing. It is without a doubt one of the best features of this anime. The characters are amazingly designed and even the bad guys look cool. The artwork of this anime shouts high quality which goes well with the story and action. The art department is certainly no let down.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nA good opening and ending song. I won't go into much detail here since this is not what this anime is about but the songs are enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10:\\n\r\nIf you watch this anime just to live in the moment, this anime is certainly well done. The characters each have their own personality and are amazing in there own aspects. There individual weapons and abilities grant them amazing skills and powers and watching them in action is amazing. If action, coolness and kawaiiness is what you're looking for, then Akame ga Kill has done it's job well. This is if you watch the anime for enjoyment and don't care much about character developments, backstories and emotions towards them.\\n\r\nNow to look at some of the downsides. The characters are not developed much and even their death doesn't leave much of an impression aside from the fact that there are less characters in the group and one less thing to think about. I barely felt any attachment to the characters and their deaths didn't faze me a bit. Yes, some parts made me tearful but that's mostly due to the dramatic scenes of the death rather than losing that character.\\n\r\nThe character's past are shown and explained but that still isn't enough to make you feel anything towards them. Each character is given 2-3 episodes in which they introduce, explain and kill them off leaving no room for the watcher to feel anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is really fun and some characters are the main cast in the comedy whereas others are just there to get bashed. Comedy is well done and each character has his/her own comedy act to show in the series. This causes this anime to lose it's \"dark\" appeal.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the bad guys, well, they are bad. You will hate them, want to kill them yourself. Those are your average bad guys. Then there are those \"bad\" guys working against the good guys but you can't come to hate them, not all of them atleast. Some of the \"bad\" guys end up becoming more popular than the main cast and their deaths tend to make me feel more tearful.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the character development department is what makes it or breaks it. If you live for the moment and want good action with kawaii and cool girls and boys with insane powers and comedy acts, this anime is for you. But if you want an anime that will slowly build your attachment to the character and tells their stories so that you get attached, then this might not please you much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nThis anime, no doubt, was enjoyable. It was so enjoyable that I could rate it all 10's but since this is unbiased, I will refrain from doing so. Since I was in search for blood, gore, superpowers, action type anime so this fit the bill perfectly.\\n\r\nDespite the bashing it gets, I would still recommend this anime to anyone in search for an action anime with good animation and characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked it. Will watch it again if I find the time. It's completely different from your usual action stuff, that I can guarantee. Whether you love it or hate it, depends on with what mindset you watch it. If you ask me, I would say: Forget all the review you heard and watch it for the fun of it. That's the best way to enjoy this anime. Don't go into the deep stuff like the mechanics of the anime. Just enjoy it.",

            "content": "This is a really great anime...I'm the type of person who doesn't like cliche shounen action animes that has art styles from 10 years ago, and repetitive fighting scenes of the same format against different opponents like naruto and bleach. Akame Ga Kill! has lots of gore, and lots of killing, which I love. The fighting scenes that occur, and the smooth process of the storyboard is very well executed. I like how nothing is unbelievable and overall, generally, plot holes don't exist, or at least is dismissable. \r\nI didn't read the manga, so my opinion has no weight and has nothing to do withthat of those Manga lovers, who seem to be in rage of how different it is from the manga. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: In the beginning, I thought it was going to be another anime with an overused theme of a main character who is young, who is male, and who has a sword, fighting beasts and becoming stronger or whatlike. And as expected, there was also a Tsundere character, Mine, a sadist, Leone, a quiet one, Akame, and a glassed one, Sheele. I'm not tired of this pattern just yet.. just yet in anime, but the characterization wasn't at all impressive. But the characters become more likable as it progresses. Each character has their own motivation and background, of which is developed in the plot, though it may feel a little bit rushed.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: But in my opinion, though it seems many disagree with me, the plot gave this anime life. The individual deaths of \"them\"(spoiler-free pronoun,( I mean, every anime has a death of some character)), gave this anime some feels, and make you cry. The plot is a little bit rushed by the second half of the anime, but is dimissable. This is probably because they can't possibly do it exactly the same as from the Manga, unless this series had been more popular in Japan to give it a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art lives up to the \"feels\", and also lives up to the gore. The art is good and smooth, I rarely see mistakes or bad drawing. They use special effects like tears, or light very well and matching to the scene. The style of drawing is normal, but they enhanced this normal drawing style with some spectacular scenes in crucial moments of the anime. They also use a peculiar \"skill\" where they put up a grotesque, exaggerated, singular image of a person's face to emphasize that person's emotions. The drawing-style isn't special, but I feel like they brought up innovative ways of bringing life into a pretty overused drawing-style of anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The openings and endings are all very enjoyable. The OP is hard rock/metallike-guitar sound, and the ED is light and has the piano in it. The voice acting in important scenes doesn't fail to disappoint you. The voice acting is great and fits with each character.\\n\\n\r\nThis was quite a ride the past few months...Enjoyable for those who likes gore, adventure, and sad genres. This anime is quite sad, but gives you exciting action at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nstory: 8/10, art: 8.5/10, sound: 9/10, character: 8/10, Enjoyment: 9/10.\\n\r\noverall: 8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "First and foremost, for the individuals who are accepting that this is a group of concubines in view of the extensive female cast. No it is most certainly not. This arrangement does tease you on it however. Second, try this out, regardless of the fact that it may look exaggerated or bland. Regardless of the possibility that it is, that does not mean it isn't good. Third, initial five scenes are with the end goal of world building, scene six quits fooling around. Furthermore finally, is the buildup genuine. Yes. Are the naysayer off-base? No. This arrangement is not flawless however its a fun oneto take after. \\n\\n\r\nThis arrangement has a tendency to have a ton of adult content(gore, assault, etc[post note: What is secured in the anime is significantly happy contrasted with what has happens in the manga so don't expect excessively much]) however not so much a full grown anime. For the individuals who are accustomed to viewing arrangement of merriment, note that this will be a radical change from that. \\n\\n\r\nBlood is not to a tacky level however sometimes it breaks those limits. \\n\\n\r\nThe demonstrate has a tendency to run on a non specific side and in reality tosses in buzzwords and such, be that as it may, after some time it step by step starts a novel change and draws a line in the middle of this and generally arrangement. The outline may not engage you however I do need to say to give this arrangement a shot. Extensively the pace is abate as I would see it, however on the other hand, the start of the manga was moderate too. Didn't generally get til part seven I accept. \\n\\n\r\nThe principal arc(volume one/Chapter 1-4/Episode 1-3) wasn't all that intriguing. Any issue the arrangement had was settled later on in volume two when everything got more genuine. Despite the fact that I accept that it was to some degree producing for the first bend to not be intense. It provides for you the feeling that the characters aren't excessively strained with one another. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I excessively was marginally disturbed by the cheerful satire this offered, I got accustomed to it before long. It was decent and truly got me adoring the characters. What I adore most about the comic drama is that it transforms into some genuine business in this(manga peruser). What's more now that I think again at it, it isn't so terrible. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe voice on-screen characters have done well. Each character has a fitting voice, and there are a considerable measure of feelings put into a significant number of the scenes, and I compliment Sora Amamiya for the part of Akame and singing the opening and second consummation. I without a doubt love the soundtrack. It's amazingly fitting and it includes the climatic changes the anime ought to have. The opening has the quick pace and the closure has the dim components which compliments the arrangement well. The mood melodies simply includes and highlights the limits of this arrangement. \\n\\n\r\nWorkmanship: \\n\\n\r\nThe workmanship was one thing that didn't get my attention as much as the manga did. The manga's specialty was one of my most loved parts. It was dazzling and appealing(in the later parts, workmanship style changed a considerable amount since the starting) and on account of that, Tashiro Tetsuya(Akame ga Kill's manga craftsman) turned into my most loved craftsman. My most loved piece of the craftsmanship was that it really provided for me a feeling that the characters are developing, developing, and that is truly a decent experience. Ideally, that will be involved into the anime as it were. The character workmanship wasn't as awesome to me; evidently precisely shown, however in a manner they made the characters look more prosaism and nonexclusive, instead of making them furious. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nA ton of the character improvement is platitude, standard, whatever you may call it, on the other hand it is basically grown through what happens now as opposed to their past. Indeed in this way, it builds up the characters well, forms their identity, and even anticipates a significant part of the occasions. \\n\\n\r\nTatsumi(The primary male) is a truly adjusted character. He is not powerless however he is not solid. As opposed to having the aim of turning into the best somehow like most shounen hero, he needs to end up popular rather to spare his town that is kicking the bucket from destitution. Before all else he is seen as a reckless, buzzword MC however is later formed into an objectively thinking killer. His improvement is extensively light however he's, as it were, not quite the same as most MCs from other activity, dream arrangement. \\n\\n\r\nAkame(The fundamental female) is a stoic character who is seen as an expert professional killer. Be that as it may as about emotionless as she may be, her capacity to express feeling is not nonexistent. She is really truly expressive through numerous angles, simply not much of the time. Her improvement is matched with her sister Kurome, significance they both create side by side with their competition against one another. It's truly an one of a kind circumstance for such. \\n\\n\r\nWhatever is left of the cast does appear like your set of adage characters, both identity and outwardly, yet of course, what character doesn't look nonexclusive these days. Unless the character has some interesting yugioh hair than don't trouble with the character outline. Loli, enormous sister sort, pervert, and so forth. At the same time as this arrangement comes, their advancement will get you to cherish them as the vast majority I've gotten notification from had. \\n\\n\r\nAs basic as the characters appear to be, some of them are really truly mind boggling. You need to consider it to make sense of why a character does something or whatever along the lines. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nIt's your exemplary battle the abhorrence realm story... But with numerous, numerous, numerous detestations. The story may appear as though its simply something done over once more, however it was refined with the written work of Takahiro, expert of unpredictability(opinion). It doesn't appear to be intriguing from the start and has a couple of issues, however it gets before long. There are included components that differentiates this story from your more standard arrangement. The pace is moderate yet the starting is utilized for world building. It accept it'll quit fooling around scene five or six. \\n\\n\r\nEach circular segment is applicable to the plot. There's no deviation to the story and its anything but difficult to take after.",

That says a lot when you don't have to keep watching a show to see if its going to get any better.\r\nAkame ga Kill! is your typical anime plot of a character wanting to prove himself to everyone else who thinks they're not of value.  However, Akame ga Kill! may have the look of an upbeat \"go get 'em\" show but beware; a lot of death and destruction is ahead for all characters.  \r\nEpisode 1 really set that tone from the get go.  I was expecting a journey like Naruto's where miraculously everyonefor the most part, lives and is happy.  But I soon saw the show was not going to go this way.  Prepare yourself for some heartache and really depressing moments.  \\n\r\nLuckily, it's not all killing and gore.  There are moments of hilarity and girls fighting over the main character.  I tend to really hate the harem themes but it was at least light hearted and not overly played out.\\n\r\nI still have a lot of feelings about how the show ended but that could also be because I developed attachments to a few of the characters.

            "content": "I honestly cannot bring myself to deliver anything higher than a simple \"two\". Seriously, I wouldn't mind putting the lowest one. The anime starts off with an interesting plot, but as the story develops I can only ask/say: \"Who was the one that decided to accept this?\". \r\nI will start with Esdeath, the controversial character that many like and many don't. Firstly, I cannot agree Esdeath is all about evilness. I actually think she has more good than evil. Which becomes way too \"conflictuous\"/hard for the viewer (or reader, honestly the manga isn't any greater when it comes to her, if not ... worse) toput a referential on where she should stand on. She changes dramatically when she meets Tatsumi and the whole relationship between them two is about coyness from her part.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[MR.SPOILER SENDS HIS BEST REGARDS]\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf your sole intention was to kill her all along without a pinch of mercy, at least bring a good reason for such, because the way they stuck to her (hugely different) character did not bring any. For instance, it's hilarious how Tatsumi literally kicks her off as soon as he gets to know about her past, stating she is indeed evil on her accord. Like ... What? He literally heard her saying she survived ever since she was young all by herself, lost her parents sooner than anyone in the entire \"series\" line, and the instant conclusion he could come to was the one that she was pure evil ... And I honestly find it hilarious some people come saying she is evil not because of her father's death. I mean, that's literally so credible ... probably the creature she did not like hear growling was certainly just there as a realism-aspect, right (/sarcasm)? Anyway ... this attitude of Tatsumi is the clear example the creator (or author, if you wanna call him that) did not give a single bit of care to the cohesion and logical sense of things. Then, the fact he doesn't even consider bringing some thought into Tatsumi's mind like ... \"Maybe if I am here for her, I can change her ...\" Or even better: How about ACTUALLY TRYING to change her instead of simply asking TWICE! (when she doesn't even really know him) to change sides? I mean, what in hell is that kind of creativity? None, I bet ... \\n\\n\r\nNow, skipping this aspect, let's consider everyone's hate for her sadistic intents. But wait ... where are her sadistic intents actually? I didn't really notice much ... other than the fact when she let all her soldiers violate an entire tribe that, not only was against the Empire but was also responsible for her father's death ... No offense, I think anyone would bring vengeance in that manner ... Probably even worse. Some people do that nowadays for smaller things (not this thing, but something equally chocking). Oh, and about her saying she did it not because of her father ... I really think this is the perfect example of when the author has no fucking idea (no offense) of which path to take, so he makes up some shit that seems to fit ... I could counter-argue, saying she is kind of unknown and \"weak\" before the knowledge of emotions, particularly the love one, where she says she is going to do X and always ends up doing Y (in the good way. An example, just read the \"prison\" (cell) part in the manga: Her and Tatsumi, if you can't find it, it's totally normal - Brainwash from \"AUTHORitarianism\"). The fact she admits she loved(s) her father, means she actually cares about him, and the fact she thinks about him, means that one way or the other she did that for vengeance. Hell, I even bet when she was grumbling about only having orders to kill them, she was wishing she could actually give them a decent punishment for their misdoings (I am probably reading between the lines here, something more people should do before judging characters). But I believe it is hard for people to think a little about it ... specially because any author can bring his viewer/reader to think/support anything he wants. He just needs to weakly explain it (which this one doesn't even do). \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, skipping Esdeath ... Let's reach the real elephant in the room ... Death! Oh hell! Everyone dies. Not in the same manner of course, but hey! Honest dies in the most fundamentally retarded manner possible (12 shots are not enough ... Geez Honest, you should have bought a machine gun ... Bad luck right?), then Budo ... This one's a peak ... \"Stronguest General ever\" ---> Dies in a single match. Then I should not stop quoting the chapter name in the manga: \"Esdeath and Budo, the unbeatable doublet\" (or similar, am not even going back to check it) ---> I didn't see any teamwork and in the end it is like League of Legends where each team member goes on a 1v5 sequentially instead of joining up together ... This story is just sad and terribly designed. At least treason is something really stressed out in this story, since Budo literally ends up admitting he is going to betray The Minister. Even Tatsumi manages to be a liar and opportunist to a certain degree, what can I say right?\\n\\n\r\nLast but not the most important one: Korume and Akame. What the fuck? No happy ending? Oh, yeah ... forgot that everyone must die and no reasoning can be used here. And then Esdeath is the sadistic one, right? Everyone wants to kill someone ... I mean, why did Bols even die? The one and only character that had someone waiting for him with a gold heart, no offense. I can't really bring myself to look into his past and say he is all-evil-mighty ... But this is Akame Ga Kill so ... let's kill him. Fortunately, this just proved Night Raid has less passion than anything ... After all, the group is constituted by a bunch of traitors and killers, what thing gives them the right to be represented in a positive way? They have nothing positive. A few happy and joyful moments (that even the Jaegers have) but they are nothing more than a pair of merciless killers, as much as everything in The Capital. It's just sad that a real projection of what would happen after The Resistance took over The Capital, cannot be done - Because if it could, I bet it would be nothing other than Honest V.2 but in a Democratic form. A government lead by a bunch of killers ... hmmmmmm, where's the change exactly? They even go as low as to execute the poor Imperor boy even knowing he was being brainwashed by Honest ... What a lack of fundamentals. How can people even defend Night Raid? The only decent character in the Night Raid, is Bulat and unfortunately he is right the first one dying (11/10 class there). Tatsumi, despite being dumb as hell and whatnot, he is still a decent character - Except for the part where he chooses Mine. I am the kind of guy that defends Tatsumi & Esdeath (for obvious, credible and justified reasons listed above), but even I say that Tatsumi & Leone would make a billion times more sense than Mine (or even Akame, if it came to that). All in all ... I would like finishing my review by ironically going to the beginning of the series. The first thought I had when I saw Night Raid invading that house. I immediately thought Night Raid were the bad guys, guess what ... they are. Just in a concealed manner. I mean, if Leone had not stepped in, Tatsumi would be dead by Akame. The Miss no-feelings-for-enemies, 11/10 category of design. I think I should not spend much more time arguing about alternatives for this story ... this garbage doesn't deserve it (no offense included, okay ... maybe some ...).",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill! is a frustrating show for me. It's a show that, at times, seems like it wants to be more than a typical shounen, but then only delivers on that promise in the most superficial of ways. While I did enjoy the show to some degree, it disappointed in not delivering what could have been a great story.\r\nStory - 6/10:\r\nProbably the weakest element is just the approach to the story, and the themes and depth present within. The show opens with possibly the most shounen cliche of all - a boy from the country arrives in the big city looking to become afamous adventurer (and easily slaughters a massive dragon-thing on the way in, saving a caravan). It's all done with a big smile that makes it feel like just another shounen. The first episode closes with a wild upending of those expectations, when it's revealed that the kind girl who took the boy in is actually part of a family of sadistic torturers, and the boy's friends from his village are two of her victims. It's gory and devastating, and not something you see in most shounen. It shows potential. It asks a lot of questions about appearance vs reality, about good vs evil, about the nature of humanity, etc. It also introduces the Night Raid group as potential bad guy assassins, only to flip things around and make them the good guys. The first episode, and the way it closed, actually really drew me in, and I was interested to see where the show would take those ideas moving forward.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, those ideas never develop into much. The show immediately falls into standard shounen tropes and cliches (that's not necessarily a bad thing, as they're mostly well-executed, but it's disappointing from a broader perspective). Akame ga Kill! lives up to its name, with plenty of blood and gore and death - yes, main characters die, and frequently. These are ways in which the show again subverts the norms of shounen series, but again falls short of delivering anything more than a superficial difference. Character deaths often fail to resonate, because we never get that much information about the characters, and the show just speeds headlong into the next confrontation so we barely get a moment to process the last death. The show also suffers from typical shounen tonal shifts - one second something serious is happening on screen, and the next there's some dumb attempt at humour going on. It totally kills the mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe story essentially revolves around a rebellion. The child emperor is being led astray by his evil advisor. The common folk are suffering. Night Raid is part of a larger resistance effort. All of this could make for interesting plot, but the strategy is never really developed, and the politics is essentially non-existent. It's like the rebellion exists for no other reason than to give our assassin heroes the moral authority to actually be killing people, because those people are evil. The story could have delved into the moral grey areas of killing, even if those being killed are also bad. But it's just another superficial element that never gets expanded on. Even someone like Wave, who seems like a good person and actually questions the killing, just goes about his job because the empire tells him to. There's no context to what is good or evil in this series, it's all very ambiguous - that should be a situation rife to explore character decisions in deep and nuanced ways, but it's wasted here.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe show looks great. The character models are all attractive, the animation is solid, the background art is nice. Most of the fight scenes are compelling, if nothing else. Not really anything negative to say about the show aesthetically.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nSame as the art, the sound is solid. I liked the soundtrack, most of the music tracks really helped to set the atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nJust like the story, there was a world of potential to explore with the characters, but it mostly fails to deliver. I'm still trying to figure out why Akame is the titular character. She seems more like a side character in a show named after her, and her story with her sister is one of the more interesting character explorations present (and apparently it has a spin-off manga). It's too bad, because at the end of the first episode, it really looked like she was going to be front and centre. Instead, the show revolves around Tatsumi, who isn't very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe one element that is kind of interesting about Tatsumi is his odd relationship with Esdeath, the imperial general. While the whole situation is incredibly contrived, Esdeath's supposed love for Tatsumi does open up a lot of interesting possibilities - opportunities to explore why each is fighting on the side they are, and maybe finding some common ground. But instead it's mostly just played for gags and never goes anywhere. Esdeath is a strangely likeable character, despite all of the horrible things she's done in her past and her apparent love of killing and torture. It would make it hard for Tatsumi to love her back, but are the people in Night Raid really any better? I don't know, because the show never really asks those questions in any meaningful way.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters get their one or two episodes. It's almost like a death flag if someone gets a backstory episode. But there's little development going on here. It really just is a show about a bunch of cool good guys fighting against a bunch of cool bad guys. There are little touches of ambiguity tossed into the mix, like with Bols, a character who looks evil, yet is often kind and caring and has a cute, loving family. But it's so on the nose - his appearance, the overly lovey-dovey relationship with his wife and daughter. It's like the author is trying to beat you over the head with the idea that this guy who happily murders thousands of people on the empire's orders is actually a loving husband and father and friend. There's no nuance or depth to it.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that said, I found myself enjoying most of the characters - good guys and bad guys. On the superficial level with which they're presented, they mostly work. It's a fun collection of personalities, I just find it a shame to leave so much unexplored.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am disappointed about many things in the show, I can't deny that I enjoyed watching the episodes. Even the ending, which many people complain about. I thought the ending felt appropriate given the story to that point and the overall tone. But maybe I will check out the manga to see how that ends as a comparison. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10: \\n\\n\r\nAkame ga KIll! feels like an anime that is never quite sure what it wants to be. It's trying to subvert the shounen genre, and succeeds on the superficial level, with lots of blood and guts, characters who actually die, characters who actually acknowledge their ships, etc. But it could have been so much more. Interesting ideas are presented, and then dropped or handled in equally superficial ways. It's almost like the author was afraid to dive all the way into an idea, instead retreating to the comfort and familiarity of the genre any time he veered too far off script. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, an enjoyable enough show, but it always leaves me wanting more when shows tease bigger ideas and themes and don't follow through on them.\\n\\n",

My original thoughts were that all the characters seemed waaaay too happy and lighthearted for what they were doing. I believed their reactions to be unrealistic, however, I don't think this is a series that focusses on such realism, which is fine! This series is a fun lighthearted Shonen/comedy with a dark undertone with surprisingly quick pacing. My only real problem with it is the lack of creativity when it comes tojamming in each characters backstories, it's not very natural. Despite this, very enjoyable series would recommend.",

And what they've done well with the anime is that they haven't blown it out of proportions... it has the right mix of everything , in my view, and it's score is way too low for the anime's standards.\r\nSTORY(10)-\r\n             The story as i said is a pretty good one. A group of assassins fighting against unjust rule,.. ya , you might say it's kinda old-school, but its presented  to absolute perfection. If anything you might feel a bit downwhen the characters you like die, but without that , in my opinion the story would have been a bit unrealistic. You dont come out of a war without a single casualty.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound  (10 & 9)- \\n\r\n                                         The art in this anime is really good and the sound just backs it up. I don't know about the japanese version(I saw the english dub) but the english dub artists have done a really great job, i especially liked Leone's sound, she would'nt have been the same with out it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter( 10 )-\\n\r\n                           There's actually pretty good character development in this anime, considering the screen time the characters have, you'll come to really love most of the characters and you'll definitely shed a tear or two if they end up dying. The romance is the only one which one could say , they could have worked on a bit, it felt a bit too rushed and thus didnt come out as good as it could have, but hey it turns out pretty good in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment(10)-\\n\r\n                                      I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and is one of my all time favorites.

Then i went back and started again.\r\nThe story was awesome. It gives you a lot of meanings. For every one of character's story and everything.\r\nYou cry a lot on anime!\r\nThe art was very good.

It's really realistic and effects you. \\n\\n\r\n The sound was very good too. I liked the music's too, but it could be better, like death scenes. It may give you a bit more emotion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter storys and themself were quite brilliant. Anime makes you love every one of them. They are well-made.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime.

            "content": "Two notes: I haven't read the manga yet. But I will sometime in the future. There also may be a few spoilers here and there.\r\nAnyways. So in the beginning of the year I watched Death Note for the first time and I thought it was very interesting. It would have been a masterpiece if it wasn't for that second arc. And I thought to myself, \"what could be a much worse anime ending than Death Note's?\"\r\nAnd then I watched Akame ga Kill.\r\nI was very excited when I was about to watch this anime. I thought the premise of the anime was interesting. A show filledwith action, fantasy, a dark theme and lots of gore, with the main characters being anti-heroes. This was one show for me to stay away from those ordinary shonen shows. Was it unique? Yes. Was it entertaining? Kind of. Was it one of the greatest anime I've ever seen? Sadly, no. It would have been one of my favorite anime if it had a better character development, a better balance between comedy and drama and an ending that is on par with Death Note, Soul Eater and nearly all Gainax endings. Anyways let get into the review.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10\\n\r\nThe story is about Tatsumi, an ordinary village boy who goes to the Capital to earn money. But discovers that the Capital was a ruthless place filled with torture and a plethora of murders. He then is saved Night Raid, an assassin group that is part of a Revolutionary Army. Their goal to destroy the corrupted Empire for a better place. Like I said earlier, I thought it was an interesting plot filled with action and gore. The execution however, was a bit sloppy. In reality, it was an okay anime with little to no character developments and weak pacing. As for the comedy, some can be entertaining, but they are mostly clich\u00e9d and they just ruin the serious moments like someone dying. However, to be honest, I thought the fight scenes were pretty damn entertaining and fun to watch. And I thought the Imperial Arms (the weapons that the characters use) were somewhat interesting and are very unique. Though the heavy use of trump cards for every weapon kind of ticks me off.\\n\r\nAnd then there's the ending...\\n\r\n The anime is known for being as one of the worst anime original endings ever and I could see why. It felt really rushed and there were only a few survivors in the end, killing off nearly all the characters. The reason why it had this kind of ending is because the manga was nowhere near the end at the time the anime was finished. But for now, we can all just wait for a FMA Brotherhood-like reboot sometime in the future. I wish.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10 \\n\r\nThe characters at first glance, look very unique and memorable characters we can all love. While they can look unique and have some interesting back stories, most of the characters are just a bunch of stereotypes. You have Tatsumi the naive protagonist who is almost as bland as Kirito from SAO, Mine the tsundere, Leone the big sister, Lubbock the goofy pervert, Sheele the nice girl, Bulat the big brother, Najenda the boss of the group etc. And that just some the members of Night Raid. There are also the Jaegers, the Empire and literally everyone else. Nearly all are weakly developed stereotyped characters. Why? They all (well most of them) get killed at an instant. However, there are exceptions: Akame and Esdeath. Akame is a cold yet kind-hearted assassin who just wants her world to be a better place. She is one of the most unique characters I've ever seen in anime and is one the reasons why I got interested in Akame ga Kill. But I was a bit disappointed when she wasn't the star of the show (even though her name's in the title, it's gotta be the bland protagonist as always). And there's Esdeath, who is a cold-hearted serial killer with ice powers. Also she's very sexy and just wants to have love. She can be deadly for most of the part, but at times she can be very soft. Even though they can be unique looking and entertaining, they are just a bunch of clich\u00e9d and weakly developed characters who are mostly just killed as the story goes. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\r\nThe anime was produced by White Fox, known for their works like Steins Gate and ReZero. The animation is very good. The action scenes were absolutely top notch and it isn't shy to show a little gore in it. Akame ga Kill is known for having a countless amount of deaths filled with a buttload of blood and gore. The characters and the Imperial Arms were also uniquely designed. As for the setting, well it's just like your average fantasy setting. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music for this show was very fascinating and it had a lot of variety into it. From rock, to classical, to electronic and even to jazz. I loved the soundtrack. The biggest standout of it was an OST called Le Chant De Roma. It matches perfectly as the main theme of the show. As for the openings, the first opening, Skyreach by Sora Amamiya (Akame's seiyuu), was like your average Jpop opening. The second opening, Liar Mask by Rika Mayama starts off slow then turns into an epic badass song as the chorus goes. And I loved it. Not really the best anime openings ever but the song is good enough to be one of my favorites. The endings are basically like your average anime ending (a slow ballad just for you to skip to the next episode). The soundtrack is the best part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nDUB: 8/10\\n\r\nNow let's go to the most crucial part of the review. The dub. I know a lot of people that can be anxious about this part, but bear with me please. When people think of Sentai Filmworks' dubs, they will know that they will automatically suck. But to be honest, not all their dubs are bad. There are some dubs that are actually quite good. And Akame ga Kill's dub is one of them. While some performances can be below average like Akame's (whose voice was a bit too deep compared to the Japanese) and Leone's (who was a bit squeaky), the rest are either okay or surprisingly good. This show also was known as the first Sentai Filmworks anime to air on Adult Swim's Toonami. The dub may not be on par with the original, but it still qualifies as a good dub.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\r\nAt first I thought I was gonna really love this show so much that I would have put it in my favorites. But sadly, it doesn't live up with it's weakly developed plot and characters, as well as 'that bullcrap ending'. But it is still can a fun watch though. If you don't like gory stuff, stay away from this anime. But if you're the opposite, I guess give Akame ga Kill a shot. But don't expect good stuff in it though.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n+ Action is great and enjoyable\\n\r\n+ Akame and Esdeath are good enough to be a man's waifu\\n\r\n+ Gore scenes are handled well\\n\r\n+ Unique character designs\\n\r\n+ Most of the music\\n\r\n+ An dub that is better than expected\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- The story is badly paced\\n\r\n- A bad balance between comedy and drama\\n\r\n- Stereotypical characters who are weakly developed \\n\r\n- THE ENDING\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nSound : 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd now Akame and friends...YOU'RE DONE!",

Is it surely dark, deep, with awesome action scenes, good character development, and most of all my reason for rating it 10 are the deaths(spoiler, I wont reveal the deaths though). It was very realistic how and when the deaths occured, which fulfilled their cause. I think all good anime don't necessaritly need a happy ending for the heros, sometimes they fulfilling their resolve is the best that can possibly happen. I really am moved by the anime as how much meaning deaths may hold. I highly recommend people to watch this anddon't judge the anime by the rating or reviews,  for me its a 10, but neutrally I can safely say this anime is no less than 8.6!",

            "content": "WARNING\r\nThis review has a few spoilers here and there so I'll just say in advance that the series is not worth your time. With that said, it's a really famous one, practically everyone has already seen it and those who didn't already know what happens in it but whatever.\r\nHey! Remember about this anime? It was hyped as the best thing ever when it was announced and then it diverged from the manga and everybody quickly began hating it and thus it became a dead horse...and I'm kicking it but whatever.\r\nDespite whatever opinion one could have about the series, its initial hook can't be denied byanyone.  It's basically the same premise as Assassin's Creed, a group of assassins fights (and kills) corrupt politicians and armies and both sides of the conflict are initially presented as grey. \\n\\n\r\nTo make things more interesting, the fanbase of the source material wouldn't shut up about how there's no plot armor through power of friendship like in a typical shonen and thus a lot of main characters die, I remember very well how the series was compared with Game of Thrones and Shingeki no Kyojin because of that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even more, the show was adapted by White Fox, a studio which received nothing but praise for its Steins; Gate adaptation. Also Taku Iwasaki, one of the most popular composers in the medium nowadays, was in charge of the soundtrack. So here you have a series with an interesting premise, a big fanbase comparing it with two big mainstream titles and big names behind its adaptation, what could possibly go wrong, right? Well, absolutely everything.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the visual department, it's easily the blandest such a story could get. The characters design is terrible, first of all, they look generic, just to name a few examples, Akame looks like a black haired version of the ninja girl from Angel Beats! and Leone and Esdeath are basically 2d versions of Yang and Weiss from RWBY respectively (hell, they even have similar powers). Just look at Tatsumi, the main character, and tell me he can't be replaced or mistaken by any other main character in the medium, he totally can. \\n\\n\r\nAnd no I'm not implying this show ripped off those series in its characters design, or that those shows have unique characters design, but it's clear that Akame ga Kill! does not stand out in this department.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's even worse than having such forgettable characters design is how they feel out of place in the setting, despite being promote as a dark series in a medieval fantasy-like setting with weird monsters in it, the characters looks very childish and colorful. Every character has the same color all over them, two at best, as if they were the Power Rangers. And their clothes are even worse, just look at Akame, Tatsumi, Mine, Chelsea or Esdeath, what kind of uniforms are that? It\u2019s like the designer didn\u2019t know if the characters belong in a fantasy setting or a contemporary high school.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the characters would often make ridiculous poses in midair while yelling the names of their special attacks, as if this was JoJo or something, when it\u2019s supposedly a dark fantasy series with political overtones. And hell, the designs are not even the worst aspect of the visuals, quality drops are abundant, motions are slow, battle choreographies are simple in a heavy action-packed series, backgrounds are well made but they are also generic and make the setting look like any other fantasy setting there is , and the special effects are plain ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nOk, maybe there are some scenes where they look good (the final fight comes to mind) but in general they are weak. Add to it armors and a giant robot-like power that look like they came out of a tokusatsu series and you have surpassed the amount of ridiculousness you can tolerate in the visual department of a series. Heck, that\u2019s not even the worst part of it, since the series also got laughable censorship despite the dark stuff and gory violence its manga was known for. And yes, you can claim all you want how later on uncensored Blu-ray releases came out but that does not change the fact that seeing a black hole where there\u2019s supposed to be a cut hand when it was airing is plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not all about its production values, the sound department is also weak. The sound effects have no impact, the voice acting is nothing special and even the soundtrack is pretty forgettable. There are a few good tunes in it such as the first opening or Le Chant de Roma, and one can definitely appreciate how Taku Iwasaki went for something atypical, but as a whole is a big disappointment coming from him. \\n\\n\r\nBut enough of that, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really important, plot and characters, and here\u2019s where things get really bad; but I\u2019d like to talk about its few positives first. \\n\r\nAs I already said, the show has a few good tunes but also one can at least say that is trying. It tries to have a somewhat mature story with serious themes as well as questionable characters and ideologies from both sides and it also has some character development. It has a fast pacing thus it does not make events to last longer that they need yet there still are a few relaxation moments to show a few interactions between the characters to get you to like them. There\u2019s actual death without resurrecting its characters thus it does not kills the tension like other anime and the series does not have a predictable and happy ending. \\n\\n\r\nSounds great doesn\u2019t it? The problem is that absolutely all of the above is handled in terrible ways so let\u2019s break down these elements to show what went wrong here:\\n\\n\r\nSo there\u2019s this kingdom where the young King is manipulated by the Prime Minister who governs oppressively and keeps all the wealth of the country and that leaves the rest of the population in poverty, opposing him and the imperial army are the Night Raids, a group of assassins which is part of a revolutionary army that tries to take them down and save the people. These people used to be members of said army so in a way they are also trying to correct their past mistakes. \\n\\n\r\nSo far so good but those themes aren\u2019t explored in a satisfactory way since neither the presentation, the exposition nor the tone back them up. First of all, there\u2019s absolutely no subtlety at all in this show, the dialogue is way too obvious in trying to convince the viewer the main characters are assassins and no heroes and the imperial army has a morbid sense of justice; something it should show instead of right out tell.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, how is the spectator supposed to believe in the equality from both sides and their grey morality when the Night Raids are shown as heroic as possible (especially when they die) while the Jaegers are presented as bloodthirsty and sadistic as they can possibly be the very instant they engage in battle. Hell, this is not even limited to both armies since even the different social classes are shown in the same manner. Where are the equality, the ambiguous morality and the themes here? They were thrown down the toilet.\\n\\n\r\nThird, the tone. This is easily the worst aspect of the show, it suffers from serious tonal whiplashes to the point nowadays whenever a series suffers from the same issues it is directly compared with this anime. Whenever a main character fights, he/she is presented as the right side of the conflict, not so ambiguous now, right? Whenever he/she performs an attack, he/she yells it as if this was a fighting series for teenagers and looks and sounds cool while posing, not so serious and mature now, right? What\u2019s even worse than the battles is how right after a dramatic or plain tragic event happens, the characters do or say something stupid while the art style changes for a chibi one thus ruining the mood completely.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not even the worst example, since sometimes the show recur to fan service right after someone was killed, I\u2019m not joking, there are moments when the protagonist kills or see someone dying and all of a sudden he gets his whole face covered by the giant boobs of his female companions. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the series is just not believable at all, the power level is totally inconsistent since the capabilities of the characters change every instant depending how convenient is at that moment in the plot, is laughable to see how veteran soldiers from both sides owns their enemies with ease but then they get killed off in an instant by rookies. The Capital is under total surveillance and even so the assassins can infiltrate constantly without being noticed despite their colorful clothes and hairs. They are covered alright, but this is still hard to buy. \\n\\n\r\nWhy does the King not suspect anything, he can\u2019t be that clueless, didn\u2019t he have any type of formation despite his position? Why are the nobles going so calmly around the Capital when they know that there are loose assassins who constantly attack the city? How come they do not complain at all? Also, how come people believe in the Night Raids so easily? They are former members of the same army that oppress them after all. You know what? Forget it, there are machine guns, power suits and an armor that looks like a giant robot here, things that does not fit the setting at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe answer to most of that is that you barely get to see actual people in the show, every character is either part of the revolutionary army, an imperial soldier, or a corrupt politician, and when you see citizens, they are victimized poor people treated as scum by the nobles who see them as nothing but sacrifices for their enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not even joking, in the very first episode, there\u2019s a teenage noble girl who acts all cutesy and funny at first and then reveals that she fools poor people into coming in her castle only to drug them, torture them, kill them, tear them apart, and then collect their bodies in the storehouse. What kind of nonsensical characterization is that and how is that grey? The portrayal of the themes is clearly one-sided.\\n\\n\r\nEven the art style and the voice of the girl change completely during that scene as if was trying to scare the viewer or something, when It would otherwise make them laugh because of how sudden and over the top that switch was, which shows how poorly directed the series is.  By the way that effect was overused later on and would be used even during comical or tragic moments and so confusing the viewer even more about how they are supposed to react in such scenes. \\n\\n\r\nIf being horrible written wasn\u2019t enough, the show also suffers when it comes to characterization, the characters are shallow archetypes that you can\u2019t really tell apart from other characters from other series, at least as far as personalities go. Not only that but they barely have their background stories revealed and even for those whose backgrounds are revealed, they tend to be shallow and poorly handled, most of them are former imperial soldiers that turned against their government once the young King took over, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s their only motivation. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no personal investment in there, it\u2019s just an ideological one, and even if you say that it\u2019s a noble cause or something, then why do they try to convince both the protagonist and the viewer that they are not heroes because of the horrible things they do when they fight for such a cause? Even worse, the only reason one of them has for having enlisted in the army in the first place was because he fell in love with the female general at first sight. That\u2019s not only stupid but also unbelievable since he\u2019s the pervert who constantly peeks and tries to take advantage of every other girl in the Night Raids. \\n\\n\r\nThe only characters who have somewhat decent background stories are Akame and Esdeath, the main antagonist, since they are both tragic and explain their basic behavior and serves as their motivations and ideological positions, yet even them are not exactly excused since their personalities are as inconsistent as they can be whenever they are not in battle. The latter is easily the worst case since she becomes a big sister type of character towards her squad and a shy teenage girl whenever she\u2019s around the protagonist. As for Akame when outside the battlefield\u2026well, she just goofs around. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Tatsumi, is the typical one you can find in most fighting shonen series: he\u2019s dumb, na\u00efve, idealistic, and for some reason his capabilities in battle change all the time, he feels completely out of place in such a story. The excuse of the fans of the show was that although he begins like that he later on develop because he\u2019s affected by most of his companions dying, which is not true since he remains mostly the same until the end of the series and those deaths have no real impact in him, and even if that was the case, it wouldn\u2019t be believable since he does not spend much time with them before they kick the bucket. Hell, not even the other members of the group seem to be affected by those deaths despite being long-time comrades.\\n\\n\r\nEven worse, during relaxation moments, they devolve from their shallow archetypes to even more shallow archetypes since they become harem archetypes who are attracted to Tatsumi, for no good reason, even the male ones. And even if they\u2019re not literally attracted to him, they still seem to spiral towards him as you never see them interacting with other people, meaning they are nothing but plot devices whose only purpose in the story is kill some bad guys, talk a few minutes with Tatsumi, and then dying in order to make him develop, which, as I said, does not even happens. \\n\\n\r\nThe Jaegers, the main villains of the story, are not exactly better despite being shown as basically the same group as the Night Raids, with every character being the counterpart of an assassin. First of all, by doing that, your antagonists will feel like evil rehash of your protagonists. Second, despite being presented as a not completely evil family who gets to love one another during relaxation moments, it\u2019s not believable since whenever they engage in battle they laugh like sociopaths, their faces deform completely, they kill people in horrible ways, they enjoy what they\u2019re doing and that is reflected in their dialogues, and some of them even betray their companions in battle in order to kill the protagonists. So much for a family that shares the same sense of justice.\\n\\n\r\nEven worse is how, just like it happens with the Night Raids, none of them are affected by other members dying. The only member who is not a completely unbelievable total asshole is Wave, and the only reason of that is because he\u2019s basically Tatsumi, he has a very similar personality and the exact same motivation, thus proving once again how this faction is just a copy of the other one.\\n\\n\r\nBut I understand why the series failed so hard in both story and characterization, it\u2019s because of its pacing. Despite the fans praising how fast it is, what they never realized is how such a fast pacing wasn\u2019t allowing proper character development or build up for the events, or how those events didn\u2019t have enough impact before moving to something completely different, especially in terms of emotions.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever an important event or a big revelation happens, it is almost instantly overshadowed by another one thus it does not feel important, whenever the characters train, the series skips the training thus they appear to be way more powerful out of nowhere. Whenever a character dies, the others get over it almost instantly. Thus, although the pacing is indeed fast, it is actually too fast for its own good and makes the story comes off as rushed.\\n\\n\r\nNot even the relaxation moments help since, as I said before, whenever you see the characters out of battle, they act and feel completely different, with even more shallow personalities and interactions, with basic background stories and motivations behind them and they devolve to walking fan service, since the whole series mutates from whatever mess of a tone it goes for during moments when there\u2019s tension to a harem comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s even more, not even the not happy and not predictable ending is safe since it\u2019s also affected by the rushed pacing, in the last episodes characters change their minds; reveal more powers; a giant robot-like thing appears to destroy the whole city; the assassins and the soldiers, along with the Prime Minister, fight each other in full daylight, unlike the rest of the series; a lot of characters die at the same time thus their deaths somehow manage to feel even less important than the previous ones and also;  while you get to see the outcome of the conflict, you don\u2019t get to see its effects afterwards. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I mean by that is how did the kingdom recovered so easily from such a disaster, why does people trust Najenda with such ease and why is Akame blamed for everything that happened, when everyone knows exactly what actually happened? None of these things make sense or get an answer. \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally I\u2019d like to talk about the aspect that made the show so famous in the first place, the lack of plot armor, which was also portrayed poorly, for several reasons. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, having a lot of characters dying so close to one another is equally bad as having no death since that way it makes them feel like nothing more than cannon fodder. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, if you kill them off before fleshing them out, they will seem unimportant to the plot, to the remaining characters, and more important, to your audience, who won\u2019t get emotionally attached to them and thus won\u2019t care about them when they die. \\n\\n\r\nThird, it makes the show predictable in its own way since from a certain point the viewers were expecting every character to die thanks to the already big body count. \\n\\n\r\nFourth, and last and more important, this lack of plot armor is actually a lie since Tatsumi has the biggest possible plot armor in the show which is Esdeath falling in love with him. That way he\u2019s assured of not being killed by her during the whole series and her squad going easy on him to the most part, plus it\u2019s a big plot convenience, since she does not really loves him but she\u2019s using him to learn what love actually is and Tatsumi just happened to fit in absolutely every very specific characteristic she wanted in a boyfriend.\\n\\n\r\nAs you see, despite the few good moments in its visuals and its neat ideas, the show as a whole is one big mess and has nothing in it besides its interesting premise. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is terribly written; the exposition is terrible; the themes aren\u2019t explored properly; the characters are shallow and often rewritten; the tone is uneven; the pacing is too fast for its own good; the finale is weak; the production values are average at best; and the main hook of the series is actually a lie. For all those reasons, Akame ga Kill! is a terrible show, it didn\u2019t deserve all the attention it got, it deserves all the bad fame it gets and I consider it to be amongst the worsts anime I\u2019ve watched in general. \\n",

It was incredibly disappointing and drawn out. It promised so much in the first episode, but it did not deliver. I struggled through the entire thing and was so relieved when it was finally over. And both my sister and I felt like we had just wasted a colossal amount of time. The first episode was full of action and beautiful gore in the style of the 300 film franchise, and presented a city so rife with crimeand debauchery that we were looking forward to total destruction and a purge akin to the ending of Sodom and Gomorrah, full of action, darkness, and drama. This did not happen. Underdeveloped characters and a weak story that failed to have any forward motion or pull (too much repetition) caused this anime to drag. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else.",

            "content": "What can be said that hasn't already?  It was an absolutely amazing ride, it was refreshing in a way i never really expected.\r\nI would consider the constant barrage of negative reviews  to be a superb level of butthurt that i enjoy.  \r\nAgK is a story about assassins taking down the bad guys.  That's all you really need to know about the story.  It's gutsy, gory and amazingly fast paced.  It reminded me alot of SnK, and i think they were trying to recapture the magic that story had.\r\nUnfortunately it fell flat on its face, so there are legitimate criticismsto be made, although i won't be making those.  I feel like people have been too heavily influenced by what actually unfolded to give those criticisms the proper weight.  I also think that those criticisms don't actually affect the show as a whole, nor should they.\\n\\n\r\nAt first i though that AgK should have been stretched out through two seasons, i realized that the pace is what put this one over the top and allowed it soar above its shortcomings.  If you look at it objectively, rarely has a story been so well executed with a strange sort of dread, shock and appeal that i can't really find anything like AgK.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the characters aren't fleshed out as many people believe they should is actually a strength imo.  It's a story driven animu that doesn't back down from being what it is and stays true right up until the last episode.  Seeing the intense struggle not laid out for the viewer in exposition was very odd, but very refreshing.  What some may call weakness, i see as a fine opportunity to fill in the blanks yourself.  The fact that you know what's coming but still don't expect it is jarring yet masterful at the same time.  You want it to be one thing, but it never is, like the cold touch of reality.  And because of this, I rate this show very highly.  \\n\\n\r\nNot just anything can pull this off the way they did.  Entertaining, dreadful, endearing, funny, over the top ridiculous, silly, enlightening and clever all in the same package coming at you at 100 mph, i can't help but feel that this had, perhaps, a kind of unique magic that won't be seen for awhile.",

            "content": "I started Akame ga Kill!, expecting it to be an amazing anime. After the first half completed, I was very disappointed. It was good, but nothing more. I knew this show had potential, and in the end, I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.\r\nStory (10/10): The first episode is very good, but the quality of the story takes a dip after that. The story focuses too much on the characters killing various people, all of who's personalities are much to similar. They are all just another psychopath. But during the second half, we finally get some interesting characters introduced. Things finally get interesting, and they continueto get interesting until the very end. They finally drop the overly weird shit that plagued the first half of the serious and finally start to make interesting twists. There are a lot of character deaths, but I think that they are all done very well. I've always liked when characters die in action shows, not because I want them to, (Though with the majority of the antagonists in this show, I do want them to die) because it is realistic and always keeps me at the edge of my seat. This anime really came back from its weak start in the second half, especially in the last five or so episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): The art in this show is gorgeous. It looks even more glorious in HD. The characters movements are fantastic and the action scenes are some of the better I've seen. I was iffy on some of the character designs at first, but I grew to love them over time. It's hard to watch some anime directly after watching this anime, because few shows look as crisp and clean as this one does.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): Both OPs are excellent. They really get you into the show and are just plain epic. Both EDs are also very good. Many episodes end emotionally, and both of these songs are very fitting for how many of the episodes end.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are also fantastic and really get you into the action scenes. I'm not good at judging voice acting (unless it is obviously bad), but to me the voice acting sounded great as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10): This was, in the first half, a major weak point for this anime. I liked just about none of the characters early on. There were only a few that didn't bother me and only a couple that I truly liked. Then eventually, they all get developed extremely well and a few of the protagonists and have become some of my favorite anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are also great. This show was created some of my most hated characters. (Kurome, you are one of them.) It also really made me think about whether I like certain characters. Esdeath is very interesting, and while I do hate her for her disturbing and brutal nature, she as interesting side about her that is eventually introduced. I will never understand why she has actual fans, and how people could prefer her over the beautiful Akame, but so be it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Very rarely can an anime make me shake in excitement when I am watching it. This may be the most exhilarating action show I have ever seen. (And I have seen Shingeki no Kyojin and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which were damn exhilarating in their own right) The worry that your favorite character(s) will die is always present. AgK was always enjoyable, even during the lackluster first half. The action is just so intense, that I find my heart thumping during each and every episode. The brutalness of the show and it's characters allows you to never know what is coming next. It doubt that I will find a whole lot more shows that have kept me as excited as watching an episode of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10): It is very rare for me to see an anime come back so much from a lackluster start. That second half was just so fantastic. This anime managed to squeak its way into my Top 5, which is pretty damn difficult considering how rock solid my Top 5 is. I hope to read the manga one day. I'm sure I will enjoy it, but I also want to see why the hell the some of the manga readers are so frustrated with this adaptation. I can understand why people may be annoyed that things were altered near the end of the series. But, if anyone should be blamed, it should be all the people in Japan who aren't buying the Blu Rays of this fantastic series. The studio, who did an amazing job adapting this manga into only a 24 episode anime, is not to blame, but to applaud. The way they ended things was fantastic, and while I may prefer another action anime eventually, this will undoubtedly remain one of my favorites forever.",

            "content": "\"Tell me one anime about weapons and powers that starts with an A\".\r\nAfter you've watched this anime it's name will probably be the first one that comes to your mind. Akame ga Kill or originaly Akkame no Kiru is a 24 episode long Action and Fantasy anime that finished airing in 2014. \r\nPlot and Storyline\r\nWhen it's about the storyline of Akame ga Kill you have that nice, step by step tale about the main character who develops his personality. Not sure, but although the  anime's name is AKKAME ga Kill I would say that the main character is yet Tatsumi. After all thestory begins with his appearance in the Capitol.  \\n\r\nIn a world full of crime and corruption young Tatsumi decides to go to the Capitol to earn some money for his poor village. Soon he realizes what's the reason for all the suffer and hunger in his country. The Kid-Emperor is literary being controlled by the Prime Minister who's nothing but evil. Tatsumi's wish for change leads him to Night Raid, a group of assassins whose job is to get rid of the corruption by mercilessly killing those responsible. The makes the story unique is that their job is done with the help of some powerful tools, weapons called Imperial Arms. They kinda remind me of the wands in Harry Potter, \"The weapon chooses the user, Harry\". Or at least it checks if he/she is worthy using it. Just kidding. Let's move on to the characters.\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n Tatsumi: I think of Tatsumi as a copy-paste characters from other anime shows: nice, kind and naive but a determine believer that has a hidden strength that's gonna awaken sometime...(I'm not talking about Naruto. JK!). I found his character rather boring, but hey! He was the spark for the whole story. \\n\r\n Akame: Akame was really awesome. Despite her robot-like behavior I really like her. She proved her good leadership and strength. What I liked most about her is that she kept her secret power until the very end. Not to talk about her background story... BooM! An independent and strong feminine character, Akame you rock!\\n\r\nLeone: Leone is definitely my favorite character in the whole show. She's a strong, loony and a bit manly character. Her positive and funny personality really gave the series a certain extra.  \\n\r\nEsdeath: Esdeath is a character that really gives you the creeps. A character I've never seen before. Such a strong general (The strongest Imperial Arms user) falls in love so easily with a man she doesn't even know. I think that it was more madness than love, but I'll let you decide that one.\\n\r\nBtw. Es-(Eis ger. for Ice) and Death. \\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe characters are really unique when talking about their looks. The makers didn't spare blood and violence just as the diversity of screens and backgrounds. Kobayashi (director) and Uezu (writer) showed their talent and gave us a damn good anime.\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill is a good show with a well developed and interesting storyline. It's perfect to kill the boredom on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The thing that I mostly liked about this anime is that it actually has this hidden meaning. It just displays the cruel reality of the criminal and corruptive World we live in.",

This review contains spoils  !\r\nI hesitated a lot to see this anime, but it was a big surprise.\r\nThe graphics deserve the 21th century and the storyline is rather plausible. I want to say that this anime talks about world's horror and decadence in a country which looks like ours in the Middle Age (without magic of course).\r\nWe don't speak too much about the past of the characters (that can be the case in an anime of 12 episodes where half of the episodes are flashbacks), while managing to become attached to them.\r\nWe manage to sympathise with all characters, even the vilains. I wouldsay that it is really an asset : how many animes or manga did I see which tried to show us the opponents of the main characters as monsters without spirit of which the only purpose was to control the world or to take revenge on everybody ? (I caricature of course)\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning, I was literaly bewitched : I watched 10 episodes in a night. All characters is going to end up dead, or almost. At the beginning, it was suprising when the first character died, and it was an other asset of this anime - but it was also tiring at length.\\n\\n\r\n In my opinion, the end is too predictable and too easy : I expected more. I would like to point out that I haven't read the manga and I won't read it because the end was a terrible disappointment to me.\\n\\n\r\nSo that ? Well, this is a great anime with beautiful graphics and sounds. The characters are well developed but the storyline, above all the end, could have been better.\\n\r\nIs that all?  No, Let me give you one last piece of advice : this anime is maybe a little gore for some people.",

Also, I personally don't read manga, so don't expect any comparisons from the anime to the manga. Even so, I felt the need to write a review about this particular series, Akame ga Kill! The plot is basically a young boy by the name of Tatsumi goes to the capital who is responsible of the poverty of his village. There he finds a corrupt capital like no other, in which a young emperor is being manipulated by his much older minister,and finds a group by the name of Night Raid that fights that corruption with the art of assasination. The story may be a bit common and not something so hard to come up with, but they way they developed it, for me atleast, was great. Not only because of all the action and bloodshed but of how the mangaka kept the anime realistic to some degree, not fearing to kill one of their main characters if need be, unlike some anime in which the MC can face hordes of enemies and end up unscathed, this one is about the MC getting stronger which each near-death battle and growing wiser because of the people around him and what was passed onto him, growing both in strength and mentally. I'm not such a picky watcher but as far as I could see the art was great, not rushed, and the music was a but absent, i felt it complemented each fight, the character development is fabulous, as you see not only Tatsumi but those around him also mature in different ways. It is an anime in which you shouldn't get to attached to a certain character, but to all of them and their purpose as a whole. This may be a bit of a spoiler but i don't know how else to put it, many characters get killed, but each with a reason that without it maybe they wouldn't have suceeded, unlike in some anime with pointless deaths (Such as Guilty Crown in my opinion) and instead it leaves this bittersweet feeling of each death. The whole anime was a bit bittersweet in my opinion, but hey, that's for you to decide. It's really worthwhile if you have time for it, and I gladly recommend it. That's it for my review :)",

            "content": "Ok, make a story where everyone  in it dies,then  put tons of blood and violence to please the fans, and give a half-ass story that skips lot of it's content that the manga has with a bad ending. That is Akame ga Kill in a nutshell. Now when it comes to bad story in anime I have seen tons and Akame ga Kill is in that list, so your probably wondering why is it so bad? Well let me tell you. \r\nStory:\r\nTatsumi is a fighter who, accompanied by his two childhood friends, sets off to the Capital in search of a way tomake money to assist his poverty-stricken village. After being separated from his friends, Tatsumi not only fails to enlist in the army, but is swindled out of all his money. He is then taken in by a noble family who offer him help, but intend to torture and kill him, just like they did with his friends and dozens of other people. Tatsumi is rescued by a group of assassins known as Night Raid, and is invited to join their ranks. Composed of the swordswoman Akame, a young woman armed with a huge pair of scissors named Sheele, the string manipulator Lubbock, the armored warrior Bulat, the sniper Mine, the beast fighter Leone and their leader Najenda, a former general of the imperial army. Night Raid is also part of the revolutionary forces assembled to overthrow Prime Minister Honest, who manipulates the young emperor for his and his men's personal gain, leading the rest of the nation to poverty and strife.\\n\\n\r\nEach member of Night Raid carries one of the \"Imperial Arms\" (\u5e1d\u5177 Teigu?), items created via alchemy and parts of the supernatural Danger Beasts over 900 years ago. Forty-eight of these items were created and about half of them have been lost to history. These items range from weapons like swords and firearms to more utilitarian items including a cosmetic box and armor, and even organic beings such as a shape-shifting dog and a powerful warrior. The Imperial Arms cannot be used by just anyone, as their users must be compatible with them or risk death. The power of most Imperial Arms is so overwhelming that it is said that when two Imperial Arm users fight each other, one is bound to die. General Esdeath, considered to be the most powerful fighter in the Empire, who assembles her own team of Imperial Arms-wielding assassins, the \"Jaegers\", to hunt down Night Raid. That is Akame ga Kill in a whole.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I tired to like the characters in this show, but ever time I tired they died and this is very annoying, now I know Akame ge Kill is trying to make you shocked and sad from all these deaths, but in the end you don't have feelings for something you just meet. There are no bonds with the characters or getting time to get attached to the because by the next episode their already dead (Fist of a North Star reference) so unless you like anything with a face you really won't care about half of the people who die in this show.Besides, Even if I where to explain ever character in this show with one word it probably be generic, expect for Esdeath she cool.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nI know I know I know, so far I haven't said anything good about Akame ga Kill yet, but it's animation was it's best focal point. Since ever character had  different weapons and not just a sword (thank god) the show knew how to animate ever single imperial arms it had and the fight scenes were pretty good. One thing I did like about Akame ga Kill is that you didn't know who is going to win the fight and I liked this knowing that even the main characters weren't safe, even though they go over board at times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Akame....Ga.... Kill..... Is....... Sh*t. Sadly, what people say about this show is true it doesn't offer anything new or interesting to the table. Too much fan service (Blood and Violence)to the point that Its just there to there to make you forget how bad the show actually is and make you forget with cool fights and in my book that doesn't cut it for. A true good anime dosen't have tons of blood or ecchi moments to the point the only reason you will watch the show is for a fap aid, a good anime has character development, a evoking story that has you thinking just to put the pieces together. and a ending that you will never forget.Of course, Akame ga Kill isn't the worst anime I ever seen, but definitely  the the most disappointing.",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill definitely had its strong points. It had a cool cast of protagonists that were really likable and entertaining to watch. You also had some pretty awesome fight scenes as well, but that's just about it. The thing about Akame ga Kill is that it has too many low points that outweigh the strong points. \r\nStandalone from the manga, the pacing for the entire series is just horrible and doesn't allow for natural character development. Characters are suddenly forced into situations that are supposed to elicit some sort of reaction from you with little to no story behind it. Nothing is explained andthe series leaves you with questions that are never really answered.\\n\\n\r\nIf you were to have read the manga, you would probably feel disappointed with what the anime was adapted to. The anime leaves out major plot devices that were really interesting in the manga. Of course, they weren't completely necessary since it worked out in the end anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Akame ga Kill starts off strong, but quickly, and I mean quickly, goes down hill. I'm sure that if given a longer run, the anime could have done so much better in developing characters and developing the story. However, despite the horrible pacing, Akame ga Kill is still very entertaining to watch.",

            "content": "(NOTE: This review will contain spoilers, so if you have yet to watch this show and plan to do so, you have been warned)\r\nWhere to start with Akame ga Kill...\r\nStory: 2/10\r\n To preface, having seen the promo for this show before it aired, I was hyped. It looked promising. People were heralding it as 'the new Attack on Titan'. While my expectations were not quite that high, I certainly looked forward to what the show had to offer. It looked like it had that balance of dark 'edginess', awesome fight scenes and the classic 'underdog takes on the world' story that could make it oneof the shows of the season. In truth, none of my expectations really came true.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning nothing seemed too wrong. We learn about the world in which the show is set, we are introduced to the corrupt government, setting the 'underdog' story in motion, but the show soon falls at the second, or third, hurdle.\\n\r\nI will cover the main characters individually later in the review, but where this show first falls flat is in its main character, Tatsumi.\\n\r\nTatsumi is, for lack of a better word; plain. Almost infuriatingly so. From his appearance and personality to his voice acting, everything is so insurmountably and undeniably boring. But more on that later. \\n\r\nFor me, the lack of an interesting main character is incredibly jarring. It stops me from sympathising with whatever the character is going through, so this disappointing excuse of a protagonist was perhaps the first sign of what was to come.\\n\r\nThe rest of the first episode was pretty decent, further establishing the setting, with the rather well played reveal at the end serving as a sufficient hook to make me want to watch the next episode.\\n\r\nFor a few episodes, the show continues at that pace, never \u2018amazing\u2019, but certainly not bad enough to make me drop the show. It\u2019s a little \u2018boss of the week\u2019-ish, but I don\u2019t mind that. However, things start to spiral out of control when we hit episodes 5 & 6. Episode 5 serves as a development episode for the scissor wielding (No, not Ryuko) Sheele. This seemed a little odd to me, as the show hadn\u2019t really had an episode dedicated so obviously to developing one character. Then episode 6 happened. When I saw Coro bite down on Sheele I realised what this show was going to become. This show was going to make me fear character development.\\n\r\nSurely enough, one by one, each character got their episodes of development, and soon later they all died. One after the other. As soon as that development got started you prepared for the worst, and it almost always came. More than anything, this annoyed me. These episodes set me up to like some of these characters, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to actually warm to them because I knew they\u2019d be dead in a few episodes at best.\\n\r\nSo, the show continues more or less along this pattern, while attempting to establish some sort of moral juxtaposition to try and get you to think about which side is right, but in the end I just didn\u2019t care. Truth be told, the only reason I finished this show is because by the time I wanted out I was over halfway in and thought I might as well endure it till the end.\\n\r\nThen came the ending. Oh God, the ending.\\n\r\nTo put it frankly; the ending was a trainwreck. It tried to make you feel sorry for all these characters you didn\u2019t care about dying left, right and centre and fell horribly flat in doing so. The pitiful attempt at an \u2018open' ending felt tacked on and unnecessary and left me with a sour taste in my mouth. There was some tacky and vague \u2018closure\u2019 and no real satisfaction, this really tipped the show over the edge in my opinion, turning it from average to poor.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nNot a whole lot to say about the art.\\n\r\nThe character designs, for the most part, were fairly good, with good utilisation of colour to separate and distinguish the otherwise bland characters. The most disappointing design belonged to Tatsumi. It just furthered his unappealing \u2018plain-ness\u2019.\\n\r\nThe animation was, relatively average throughout, however the fight scenes were very well animated and could possibly be considered the shows best feature, but they were not good enough to make up for the gaping holes in other aspects of the show. \\n\r\nConsidering the show was animated by White Fox, the studio who brought us Steins;Gate, it is not surprising to see flashes of brilliance here and there, but I don\u2019t think it was up to their usual standard.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nEven less to say about the sound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn\u2019t particularly memorable, but it did what it needed to do. The first opening was very good, but the rest of the shows openings and endings were again, un-memorable to the point I can\u2019t even vaguely remember them. The sound effects were well executed and complemented the great animation in some of the fight scenes.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was pretty good, with particularly memorable performances put in by Kana Hanazawa, Eiji Takemoto and Kouji Isshi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nThe characters, along with the story are where this show really lets itself down.\\n\r\nFirst off, we have shambles of a \u2018main character\u2019 in Tatsumi, who really couldn\u2019t be more generic if he tried. He has little to no originality, being the spiky-haired \u2018justice\u2019 driven shounen protagonist we\u2019ve seen a million and one times. It\u2019s hard to see why they gave the show such an uninspired main character. I found it genuinely difficult to sympathise with his plight, making his eventual demise leave me amused more than saddened. If he was so plain for purposes of self-insertion or immersion then that was a failure too. While he wasn\u2019t intrinsically \u2018bad\u2019 he was just so painfully average.\\n\r\nThe only other character who doesn\u2019t die as soon as they get some development is the namesake of the show, Akame. Akame is nothing new, so I won\u2019t say too much about her. Her backstory was vaguely interesting at times and her interactions with her sister, Kurome, were usually pretty good, if a bit dry. \\n\r\nAlmost the whole remainder of the cast exists to be built up and immediately killed off. However there were some notable individuals such as the psychotic Seryuu and morally conflicted bols, but these served as fleeting moments as they were all killed off rather swiftly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI tried to like this show, I really did. But in the end, it set itself up to fall from the start, with the weak main character and the weaker plot doing nothing to aid this show in my eyes. While the show did provide some visual and auditory stimuli by the way of animation and sound it wasn\u2019t enough to make this show \u2018enjoyable\u2019 for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nSo, this show, which I can only describe as \u2018painfully average\u2019, earns an overall rating of 4/10. The potential for an epic \u2018underdog vs the system\u2019 story was there but was ultimately let down by weak characters and dysfunctional plot. If I had to sum it up in a phrase: \u2018wasted potential.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, and look forward to my next one!\\n\r\n-SpaceCowboyFin\\n",

            "content": "Just a quick review.\r\nI watched this after having seen a lot of stuff circling the internet about it. Starts off promising. A mix bag of action/drama/comedy/quasi-harem. Characters initially seem unique and potential to be fleshed out so that you really get a feel for them and their backstory.\r\nHowever, none of that takes off. There's really not a decent plot to keep things interesting. Evil leaders makes life a headache for the rebellion. Okay... but then you meet some characters that are PRO-empire... and they don't seem to be antagonists. And then everyone you started enjoying in the show is killed off. It was like watchingGame of Thrones... What backgrounds they did develop seemed like a waste of time since the character was likely to die off in the next episode. And then by the end, everything seemed RUSHED to completion. I felt really empty and empathetic to the show by the last two episodes that I hardly cared what happened to the characters that survives.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, as with most modern day Animes. Sound was fine.\\n\\n\r\nI felt let down from all the hype surrounding this show before watching it.\\n",

Well, it was pretty good up until the middle of the series, when it began to go down in quality. Many events occurred, and after that it became quite predictable. Personally, I thought it had great potential. The first 14 episodes or so were fantastic, interesting, and riveting. And then....it was not as good. After those said 14 episodes or so, I felt like the series had used up all the fuel it possessed at the beginningof the series. At the end, I was not satisfied. The show felt partially incomplete, and I was left wondering what this series could have been if it had followed the manga, even just a little. Overall, the one thing that pushed me to give this a 7 was the first half of the series. Had great potential, but squandered it by letting repetitive and predicable scenarios unfold.",

Although it is not a 10 in my opinion, it was a really good anime. The plot is nice and the action is done really well. The anime also is not afraid to kill characters. This is one of the things that makes Akame ga Kill! good. The directors or whoever are not afraid to kill off characters. You can never expect who is going to die in the next episode and so forth. The animedoes a really good job of sticking the viewer to the story as well. It makes you always want to come back to watch the next episode. A major fault to me and the manga readers would have to be post the 18 episode mark. I did say I would disregard the manga in this review, but it is rather hard since the anime took it's own route at that point. They continued to make it good and I definitely enjoyed it, but there were some parts I would have liked to see get animated. Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone. It's one of those animes that has enough pros to overlook it's cons.",

            "content": "*Non-spoiler review*\r\nPurely my own personal opinion as an avid anime viewer.\r\nIf you're looking for a dark fantasy show that does not care about your feelings, this is the one to watch.\r\nThe show takes many well-known fantasy elements and twists them. Not as much as something like Berserk, but still a reasonable amount of messed-up. It doesn't focus on the monsters or demons, but rather the dark side of humans. The main cast is out to set things right through whatever means necessary.\r\nThis anime is going to bring you through a roller coaster of emotions, including laughter, anger, and despair. It's not the kind of animethat you watch to relax. Personally, I was emotionally exhausted after each episode, so I don't recommend binge watching it. Yet, I still recommend spending some time to watch it every now and then, because it's pretty epic.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, you should watch it to experience the highs and lows of each character in the series, as they struggle against one another because of their own ideals, and they try to uphold their own concepts of what justice is.",

            "content": "*WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY OR MAY NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED*\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe story begins with Tatsumi, a fighter, who travels to the Capital in order to make money to help his village that has been struck with poverty. He tries to join the army but gets turn down. He then encounters a noble family to take him in. As he stays the night, a group called Night Raid attacks and he learns from them that the family he stayed with has killed his friends. As a result, he then decides to join Night Raid.\r\nNight Raid is a revolutionary groupwho plan to overthrow the government as the government has put their own nation into poverty. Each member of Night Raid have what they call a Imperial Arm, a supernatural weapon created years ago.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much the summary of the story (I tried my best not to spoil much).\\n\\n\r\nI love the story. The reason I give the story a 9 out of 10 is because there are some comedic bits that were badly timed. I understand that they added the comedic bits in order to lighten the mood, but I just found that some of the comedic bits didn't work. I think they probably should've ditched the comedy and kept the tone consistent.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. The fight scenes are beautifully done. The reason I took a point away is because there were a lot of scenes during night-time that I thought was really dark. I think they should've put a little more light, but overall, the art is great! (I must be picky lol)\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nAkame Ga Kill has two openings and two endings: Skyreach and LIAR MASK (openings); Konna Sekai, Shiritakunakatta and Tsuki Akari. I thought the first opening wasn't a good fit for the anime, great song, but not the best fit. I thought the second opening was a bit better, until the electric guitar came in near the end of the song. The endings were a great fit for the anime and I honestly found the endings than the openings of the anime. Also, there were guitar parts playing in the episodes when a battle was about to happen and I just didn't think it was a great fit, but it didn't bother me much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime truly special to me is its cast of characters. I really don't want to talk much about the characters because I don't want to spoil it, but you got all kinds of amazing characters that together make a great family (talking about Night Raid). All I will say is this: don't grow too attached to one character. That's all I'm gonna say 'cause to me the greatness of Akame Ga Kill are the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Esdeath is my favorite villain of all time, hands down. She's just a badass enough said.\\n\\n\r\nSeryu is like the most vile villain I ever met. Don't be fooled by her. That's all I'm going to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nHonestly, I love this anime. It's one of my favorite animes. I really enjoyed the show overall. I love that it's a serious anime and you get dark moments, but they try to ease it up with comedy and I respect them for trying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\n(Sometimes, the way I give the overall score is I add all the scores from the five categories: story, art, sound, character, and enjoyment. I then divide the total by 5 for the overall score, sorry forgot to say that in my previous review. Keep in mind it may not always be like this. I just do this when I'm not sure what overall score to give).\\n\\n\r\nMany people have hated this anime because it does not follow the manga (I haven't read the manga by the way). And this is what I say: just because a manga is turned into an anime, it doesn't mean it has to be exactly like the manga! Also, a lot of people don't like the show because of the humor, which I can understand. So just letting you know what to expect of this show: don't expect it to be happy or something like that. This is a show that is dark and should be taken seriously. If you think of it as a dark show and focus on the characters and just forget about the comedy, hopefully your view of the show may change. But I just find it awful that there are people hating on the show because it doesn't follow the manga. If you like dark animes, then I definitely recommend this. However, this is how I recommend to watch the show. The show is dark and can be depressing. It will get you. Watch the show and when you feel a bit down from the show, watch something else because it is a really dark show and will get you. Overall, Akame Ga Kill delivers what it promised: a dark anime. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. Let me know your thoughts on this review and any feedback you may have for me. Until next time!",

            "content": "Let this be clear and try to get this off my chest before I get the hate. This is an opinion and I'll try to stay in touch of being informative. It may be a harsh criticism but keep in mind it's only one man's opinion. \r\nAkame ga Kill is one of those shows that misleads the audience of generalizing what's is shown without stating what it is. Akame ga Kill was misconceptionalized as a \"realistic\", \"dark\",..........\"MATURE\". In actuality,  it's your typical shounen action trope of the day. To be fair, the show is dark, but not as dark since you have unintentional comedicmoments in the show that contrast from the show that it was trying to be. The artstyle, while not actually a problem,  does prove why the show fails to be dark and gritty. Anything \"good\" about the show is nothing but pure enjoyment and character projection. \\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill starts with our main character Tatsumi or whatever his name is (he's a forgettable character). He travels to the \"Empire\" (yes it is called the Empire,  clever name for a city), and finds ways he can help his own village. Later, when robbed by Leone and broke, he encounters a benevolent wealthy family which holds a dark secret. That night, a group ofbassasins attacked the wealthy family and kidnaps Tatsumi and forced to join his group. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk problems. One thing you may notice in the narrative that the characters motivations contradicts what actually led to a conflict. At one point,  the Night Raid finds a target to kill but at one point we're suddenly at a beach episode which is massively common in anime. Another thing that Akame ga Kill fails miserably are the characters. Whether you like them or not,  most are cookie-cutter generic anime personality traits ever to put on characters like Akame ga Kill. None have no personality other than they interact with each other so it matters either way.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself forces itself to have contrivances and plot convenience/device only to have the plot to keep moving. Also, for some weird reason, the show usually have \"emotional hard-hitting\" moments that supposedly be sympathetic or impactful but it comes as POINTLESS as they serve no purpose to the plot later on other than plot devices. This relates back to the characters,  a huge downfall of the show itself. Little to no spoilers as said but a certain character dies after we been through a backstory...... At the same time. The kind of writing does not work because you're trying to invest your characters in an emotional standpoint but if you're deliberately kill them off at the same time,  you're not taking your characters seriously. \\n\\n\r\nDid I mentioned the writing of the script? Yeah, well to be honest,  it does have potential but really, how many times we seen and hear these kinds of story without any interesting development to the whole premise. A corrupt government and a resistance group rises to overthrow the government,  it is too simple to explain yet it has the potential if done right but no,  it's the most boring premise ever foretold. \\n\\n\r\nLet's talk action. It's decent... Just decent. The studio is White Fox,  who also made Steins;Gate and Jormungand which also has decent action. The only similarities that it has pretty colors and why are we glorifying artstyle as a whole here. Like I said,  it's decent not as fast-paced and beautifully choreographed Sword of the Stranger. At times, it looks like I'm watching someone angrily paints the wall trying to catch your attention. Overall, it's decent. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing of this show is terrible with tons of contrivances, poor characterization, lack of plot development, and decent action but I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoyed it. Yes, I watched the show only to cure my boredom and Akame ga Kill are the kinds of anime that you can sit back and laugh at the screen to acknowledges its hilarity. \\n\\n\r\nAs of many of you saying read the manga, I'm not a manga reader myself but my intuitions say it is bad as the anime. An extremely popular anime that appeals to the mass teenage audience because it is dark and realistic shounen no wait I'm sorry ....\"seinen\".....that is different than other action anime but it's just an edgy show for teenagers to project themselves in. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Regardless of how many people have downrated this or given it poorer ratings, I am more or less impressed with how consistent the character development has been despite having such a broad storyline and so many characters. Poor character development? Likely anyone who claims this has little idea of what character development actually is in a story. I'm not entirely convinced this is a story that is dark for the sake of necessarily being dark either, as many other so proclaimed \"dark\" animes have been even more gruesome for shock value than this one. This story is about a struggle between the underdog and theruling power, but you see it prevalent in factions of characters as opposed to the typical \"good guy vs. bad guy\" regime that is prevalent in everyday animes. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started watching this, my initial thought while I was browsing my list was \"well, it's something I've been planning to watch so I may as well watch it.\" Simultaneously at the time, I was watching other mediocre flimsy animes that were more or less not even remotely catching my interest. By the time I actually got a few episodes into the story, I was already hooked onto it--something that can't really be said for other stories for a long time. Even so called \"classic\" good animes fall short in terms of what should be delivered relative to this anime.",

            "content": "Now, I'm not usually one to write anime reviews- but the sheer fact that the most agreed with review on MyAnimeList listed this as a 6 just led me to log in and tell you guys how I really feel. Enjoy!\r\n Story: 8/10 \r\n     The story is like many shounen animes, however, it is still immensely pleasurable to follow. If you go in taking an action anime at face value, you're going to have a harder time. I find Akame Ga Kill a wondeful story which emphasizes that there are many everyday (and not so everyday) heroes who make sacrifices forthe greater good. It also sheds light on the fact that not many people will ever know the true extent of these sacrifices, and that not all people share the burdens of revolution equally. In real life, these burdens may not be carried for the greater good- but within Akame Ga Kill lies a world where revolution for the better is not only possible, but tangible.  Akame Ga Kill pulled at my heartstrings in a way I had not previously felt- I had mourned characters within anime, but never had I felt such a sense of nobility in each death, that there was almost immediate catharsis from the feeling of mental anguish towards a fallen character. These characters had made their sacrifices, and they were more than happy to fulfill their duties. \\n\\n\r\n Art 9/10\\n\r\n     As time passed within the series, the art only got better and better. I really enjoyed the styles for the females and the males, and my only fault would be the color-coding is a little much at times; however this is my only complaint. I watched in HD and took several screenshots for my desktop background, just due to the sheer beauty.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\n    Suspenseful moments are really where this soundtrack shines, and I have no critiques except for the notion that I believe that a good soundtrack should go unnoticed- there were several times I \"broke the fourth wall\" and noticed the sound as slightly strange. Other than that, wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\n    The characters are the shining light of this anime, and I'm proud to give my first 10/10 to the characters in Akame Ga Kill. You'll love them, you'll hate them, you'll regret loving and/or hating them, you'll feel happy for them, grow attached, and watch them grow as characters. From the beginning you follow the lead character as he develops his barely shaped idea of justice into a full-blown dignity which alone makes this show desirable. Now multiply that by each character in the show. Yes, the hatred you feel for the bad guys is a little much, however I think it is symbolic- there is evil in this world, the real world, and they are signified by these monstrous characters who seem human but bare animal-like teeth and reek through the screen of hatred and desolation. However, I find this an exercise in empathy for all that exists truly in this world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\n   I love this series incredibly, and there were several times I questioned if there was a threat for the land I loved would I give it all up, just like the main characters did. They resigned themselves to become assassins, murderers, and in doing so didn't delight in the murder, but felt each ounce of pain. They renounce their humanity for the sake of the greater good. No one will celebrate these characters sacrifices, and yet, still they sacrifice. I have nothing but wonderful things to say, my only point off for this anime is that it still sucks to see characters you love die. But at this point, I believe that a 9 for enjoyment for this anime is actually better than a 10- all the death is necessary for everything that occurs to have true meaning. There is no coming back to life, no second try, just death.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\n    I believe that if you have any love of justice or emotion-provoking anime with a lot of action, you will love this anime. I am counting the days until I am able to watch the second season, and I have great hopes for the future episodes. Tell your friends and watch in groups, or watch by yourself- all the while enjoy the wonderful, thrilling, heart-aching ride that is Akame Ga Kill.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n",

Overall a 9/10 was given for the overall enjoyment of the show. Furthermore, the show does a good job of displaying what both sides are fighting for so you don't feel compelled to truly dislike all enemies in the series. I cannot stress enough on how great the character development is. On a side note, this show is not for the feint of heart, there is graphic depictions of war andmany of the villains are rather brutal in their methodology on how war should be waged. some of the content is also not for younger audiences as there is slight nudity, prostitution, intense violence, depictions of torture, and a theme designed to sicken the viewer.",

            "content": "Oh boy..... the controversy with this one.... NOTE: This is my first review. \r\nStory-7\r\nThe story in Akame Ga Kill goes as this. A boy named Tatsumi sets out to the capital to earn money for his starving village. He soon comes to a realization that the capital is corrupted. Before falling prey into the corrupted government himself, Tatsumi is recruited into Night Raid, a group of assassins who dedicate their lives to erasing the corruption of the capital's Prime Minister and child Emperor and killing those who are responsible.\r\nOverall, the story handles itself pretty nicely. It is decently paced, aside from some moments in themanga that White Fox completely left ignored *cough* *cough* Wild Hunt. One issue I have with the story however, is that I have one problem deciding whether or not Akame Ga Kill is supposed to be dark and brutal or just light hearted. There are multiple scenes were in the middle of a serious dramatic battle, some comedy is implemented. To me, it kind of kills the mood that the show is trying to portray.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nThe artwork in this anime is great. Not the best, but great. The character designs are good and all but the only thing I would probably have as a complaint are just the censers that Akame Ga Kill has. In our version, it is not bad, but in Japan, the censers are far worse, even worse than Tokyo Ghoul and Terraformars. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\nIf you are getting attached to any character in Akame Ga Kill, be warned, THEY WILL DIE. That aside, the characters are interesting. They are not the most developed characters I have seen in an anime but they are interesting. Each character has their own reasons for joining Night Raid while the antagonists of the show have their reasons too. This department could have been higher if White Fox didn't cut out the Wild Hunt arc, where characters start to develop.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-5\\n\r\nAs much as I like reading the manga, reading the manga is (to a degree) to why I didn't enjoy the show as much as some others.... until you got to the last 4 or 5 episodes. White Fox decided to have Akame Ga Kill receive an ANIME ORIGINAL ENDING. Some may argue that \"Studio Bones did the same with the first anime adaptation with Fullmetal Alchemist\" but these are in 2 completely different situations, and you may know why *cough* *cough* there is the Wild Hunt arc. White Fox did a bad job hiding the fact that they had skipped this arc, even anime only viewers would notice. Although, I got to admit, the ending is what I would imagine for Akame Ga Kill when it reaches it's conclusion. For that part alone, well done White Fox.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-6\\n\r\nAkame Ga Kill was a good faithful adaptation to the original source until the last 5 episodes. It's not the best adaptation ever but it's not the worst one either. The show was good, it could have been better as it had a lot of potential.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill! is a good overall watch - nothing special, but certainly worth seeing.\r\nThe Story (7/10), while certainly not the strong point of Akame ga Kill!, holds its own rather well. While the content it delivers is hardly A material, the pacing of what it does have is quite good; the watcher is never itching to watch the next episode immediately, but is also seldom (if ever) left bored. \r\nThe Art (8/10) is nice and simple. While it could have been more detailed, there was no pressing need of it, and the style suited the action. \r\nThe Characters (7/10) are difficult to get attachedto, especially from the mid-way point to towards the end of the series, as characters tend to be rather short-lived. While the killing of characters one would normally associate with at least some form of plot protection is interesting, it quickly loses its effect. What we are left with is decent enough, though the habit of giving at least a cursory background and development to characters only to kill them off isn't one that everyone will enjoy, especially since these deaths generally fail to elicit the emotional reaction they were clearly intended to.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sheer Enjoyment (8/10), Akame ga Kill! does a good job of keeping the audience entertained throughout the series; the lack of character connect-ability is generally offset by some excellent fight scenes and great (if re-hashed) weapons ideas. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Akame ga Kill! is worth seeing if you enjoy the genre (assassins, mild comedy, lots of killing, etc...), but can probably be left alone if you don't.",

            "content": "This is my first ever review so please go easy on me haha! \r\n******** IM NOT GOING TO SPOIL ANYTHING UNTIL I TALK ABOUT THE ENJOYMENT SECTION ********\r\nOkay, so to start off let me just say that this was an emotional rollercoaster. Nuff said.\r\nStory: If you've watched Kill La Kill then you may understand me when I say that this anime has the \"bigger picture\" plot. A smaller story begins to develop into something more extravagant and in this case, more threatening. Now I am a huge fan of these plot lines but I find them misleading much like Family Guy. In order to notspoil anything, all I can really say is this, \"The story had me believing that at episode 12, things were going to end quickly. But it just kept going and going; I wanted more and more. But I did feel as though there were some flaws regarding the speed of the story.\" I did read the manga and I have to say that the anime trailed away, causing it to end earlier. It felt rushed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Honestly, it's nothing too special. However, there are some points where I simply loved the artistic style. For Example, during basic moments with dialogue and simple banter between characters, it's style is what you'd expect anime to be. But during intense scenes, it's bright and colorful, mixed with beautifully fluid animation. Again, without spoiling anything, here's an example: During a fight scene, you can see all of the action. There are no stray aways. The blood isn't bland, it's vibrant and has the look of actual blood. It isn't watery, but has actual depth to it which says that the artists paid proper attention to detail. This leads to the gore, it's brutal and detailed. Now this doesn't mean it's guts and brains but.... damn. Don't eat food. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Imagine Fairy Tail but more dark and somber. Akame Ga Kill takes place in the time of Knights.. so medieval-ish. The music was orchestrated properly, but what really stood out the most were the sounds during battle and the simple cartoonish sounds. But I'll get to the section after Characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I find this very difficult to do without spoiling anything so I'll just say this, \"The characters aren't all stereotypical. And that's what i loved so much.\" I am only going to do the main characters that you get to know and love.\\n\\n\r\nTatsumi \"Main Character\"i: Starting off we have the first character. A boy who wants to save his family from poverty. He's headstrong and will do anything to save his village. He believes in justice but damn, he's naive. Though despite this, he's very bold and level-headed AT TIMES. There's a reason why I put the Main Character in quotations. But watch the show and you'll know why.\\n\\n\r\nLeone: From the name you can probably guess she's a cat girl > (Leone ~ Lion) But she has big boobs and she's blonde. However, she's also headstrong and very intelligent. She has a cocky attitude and a fiery temper. She shows no mercy to those who don't deserve it. \\n\\n\r\nSheele: Long purple hair, glasses, reads books. Scratch that, reads A book along the lines of helping air headed people. She's dumb. She is quiet and loves to smile. But like that particular character, she has a dark past. With this dark past, she developed a knack for killing. \\n\\n\r\nAkame: She's also quiet and with a dark past. But you could call her the \"robotic\" character. This is because of her poker face that she holds. So when shit gets real, you'll know because she shows expressions. But Akame also has Moe Moe moments. Poker Faced Moe characters are the best.\\n\\n\r\nBulat \"Handsome\" or \"Bro\" : He's muscular, got sweet hair, wields a staff, and is a true leader/inspiration to Tatsumi. Oh and he's also gay.. unlike the next character.\\n\\n\r\nLubbock: Wields strings as a weapon. He's truly an ass kicker. Too bad he can't get ass. Basically, on a team made up of most girls, he's the pervert. But like Tatsumi, he's passionate about fighting and protecting his family. \\n\\n\r\nBoss (Her real name slips me but they call her Boss) : She's the boss of the group. Level-headed, calm, firm, but also friendly. Boss has all of the qualities of a leader. You don't really get to see much of her because she's usually commanding the others. \\n\\n\r\nFinally... \\n\\n\r\nMine: I saved her for last because, though there isn't A LOT to mention about her, I can say that she is a Tsundere. She's petite and dresses like a lolita. Mine wields a long rifle that literally powers up based on her emotions. So you can imagine, being a tsundere, how much firepower she's packing. She's emotional, loves her dearest friend Sheele, and is the typical girly girl. \\n\\n\r\n********SPOILERS BELOW********** SKIP TO \">>>>>>>>>>>>\" to avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Out of all of these numbers, I gave this a 7. Why? Look.. fine. I'll spoil it. So here we go. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime to me, is known as, Game of Thrones Anime. Characters die. And Tatsumi isn't the main character. The show is called Akame Ga Kill. Guys. Please. If you cried from Angel Beats, you'll break down watching this. I love this show but I don't want to watch it again because the characters I love die. There was a character I loved, and she had her head sliced off and mounted on a spear. In the very end, Leone dies because of wounds, Sheele dies in the 4th episode I think.. I'm not too sure, but she gets eaten. I don't even want to talk about the others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>You're safe",

            "content": "I don't write too many many reviews, but for the sake of having something short and quick to reference when looking back on anime to recommend to other people, I've decided to do it a lot more.\r\nSo here you go a short, but hopefully informative review on Akame Ga Kill.\r\nStory: Good\r\nThe story (as described in the synopsis) is not the the most mind blowing or deep story out there, but it is deeper than most. Expect dark themes, comedy, tragedy, and ridiculousness packed on top of a average fantasy storyline.\r\nArt: Great\r\nVERY PRETTY.... not much else to say really. There are a few weird bits hereand there, and of course Iv'e seen prettier shows, but overall I was impressed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good\\n\r\nI judge anime music on it chances on making it into my iTunes library. The music in this show did it's job. There were a few tracks from the OPs and EDs I would consider getting, but nothing stood out too much. All sound other than music was fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: good\\n\r\nI liked the characters in this show, they weren't just cardboard cutouts (at least not completely). I do feel like some characters needed a little bit more time for development however. That's not to say they weren't developed at all, but I feel like I needed just a little bit more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very Good\\n\r\nI watched the whole show in 2 days. If that's not enjoyment I don't know what is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: very good\\n\r\nIt's not mind blowing, but it's not your average run-of-the-mill-cuz-we-just-need-moneys anime. So by default it is very good (which is an 8... in my mind anyway). Watch if you are in the mood for action, fantasy, dark-themed, gritty-holy-cow-how-do-you-have-so-much-blood",

            "content": "-This review contains spoilers-\r\nAkame Ga Kill is a very uniquely done anime for all its feels and storyline. I am someone who asks the following questions while watching any kind of anime:\r\n-What are the relationship between the characters?\r\n-Is it staying true to the storyline?\r\n-Is there any obnoxious characters/features?\r\n-Can you see development of these characters?\r\n-Is there good humor?\r\n-What character(s) can I relate to?\r\nIt passed all my questions, and here is why. \r\n-Story-\r\nThe idea was very well done and it doesn't seem like one where it could stray. It really did stay true to its story and everything was held up until the end. It just didn'tseem finished, but that's like nearly every anime. You just don't want it to end. But what is there to continue from there? In the end, only two of the main characters were still alive. Winning the battle and moving on with their lives. So it would be more of an anime like \"Nichijo\" rather than more of like \"Parasyte.\"\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nIt was a fairly done art style, but sometimes it wouldn't make sense as to how short hair can suddenly turn into long hair the next scene. It's not too bad, and there's not too much blood that was too hard for me to settle. They occasionally show a heart, but thats usually the only origin they show.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nIf there wasn't so much screaming, I would give it a 10. I shouldn't really say it was the worst because of the screaming, but it's sounding clear and clean. \\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nAt first these characters seem pretty terrifying and not very friendly. However, as time progresses, their just normal people trying to fight for what was right. They are very lovable and the backstories are just fantastic. When they die, it's very unexpected sometimes and you probably will hate it for a while. But I managed to get throughout to the end, and all the characters you hate tend to die off as well.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime and it's great for amazing battle scenes and very lovable characters. All in all, I highly recommend it to someone who loves shounen.",

People have special abilities and trump cards and as overpowered as they may seem no one is untouchable in this anime. Expect the unexpected. You'll absolutely love it. The action is fast paced. It's good stuff\r\nStory: 7/10. The story is clear enough, it has flaws and somethings are a bit vague but it's easy to follow. From episode 1-2 the anime makes it clear what's the story is about. It's clear enough. Without giving any spoilers or too much detail it's all about overthrowing a corrupt empire and building abetter one. The ending is perfect so you won't be disappointed. No cliffhangers, no unanswered questions, no discomfort, it's wrapped up.This is however a dark anime. Don't expect a happy ending sort of fairy tale here. It's not for the faint hearted. This anime is a emotional shipwreck and you will be affected after watching this. Relationships are built and then destroyed within an instant without any warning whatsoever. This is one anime where you cannot predict what's going to happen and how things are going to turn out. Its quite realistic in that sense. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. As an person who loves serious action anime, this is the anime for me and if you like action animes its the same for you. There's no childish action, sparing, fillers or respect for each other. It's like Claymore, Berserk and Hellsing. All out bloody war where the loser gets ultimately killed.",

            "content": "WARNING THERE MIGHT BE A FEW SPOILERS (First Review)\r\nThis show is pretty decent.. It's not the best but it's watchable. The first 19 or so episodes of the show was pretty great but episodes beyond episode 19 was disappointing. The ending was also a disappointment for me.\r\nStory: (7/10):\r\nTatsumi, the main protagonist of the show sets out for the Capitol to earn money for his starving village and later finds out that the Capitol is a corrupt kingdom. Most government officials, the Prime Minister and the emperor are all corrupt. After nearly becoming a victim of corruption himself, Tatsumi is recruited by Night Raid, a groupof assassins dedicated to eliminating the corruption inside the Capitol by killing them.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10):\\n\r\nThe art in the anime seems a bit outdated for its release date when compared to the animation of other anime that were produced by Ufotable. The excessive gore within the anime seems like I'm watching the incredibly old Elfen Lied, but, it is still watchable. The slow motion and sometimes fast-paced camera movement make up for the lack of better animation. In addition, the pan-out scenes that are covered with detailed art when the slicing of a throat of the killing of a character occurs is pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (6/10):\\n\r\nI hate to say this but every time a character in this anime has a flashback...they're about to die. The anime tries to give you a quick deep throat of character development and try to give you feels for a character before they kill them off. The romance part of this (there was a romance aspect?) was rushed, the characters are all rushed but the one thing I do have to give them credit for was that they actually had a huge cast of characters and near the end the evil side (There was two separate groups in the anime basically a \"good\" and a \"bad\" side) had almost as much development as the good side. I found the \"bad guys\" to be more interesting than the good guys because they had a lot of things that made you reconsider whether or not they were truly bad guys. One of the bad guy had a beautiful wife and child and that was one of the most touching characters cry emoticon\\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10): \\n\r\nI'm going to be honest. I didn't always notice the music playing in the background, if there even was any. There were moments when it definitely amplified the moment, but most of the time the whole soundtrack was pretty forgettable. Though at the same time, it's nothing to talk down on either. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said all this, I want to revert to what I asked myself in the beginning. I'm aware of the fact that many people indeed watch certain shows to watch other people's suffering, either intentionally or unintentionally. But I don't think that splatter and dramatic losses are enough to make a show \"good\" and ,as a function of this, make them experience quite a big hype. Yes, Akame ga Kill! features lots of these things and yes, they are an undeniable big attribute of shows like this, but there is more to it. I think Akame ga Kill! is a good example for this.",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill! is an action, dark fantasy, tragedy anime, based of the Japanese sh\u014dnen manga, written by Takahiro and illustrated by Tetsuya Tashiro. The anime is produced by Square Enix and created by White Fox, and is a 24 episodes long.\r\nThe story is about a boy called Tatsumi, who travels to the capital to raise money for his village, only to find how corrupt the capital is first hand and is recruited to the assassin group called Night Raid after they show him how corrupt the capital really is. Now, the story is well created but take into account that episode 19 to 24is not based of the manga and if you read the manga first, you may not like the anime but to be fair i will not be comparing the anime to manga after look at some forums and seeing how much hate there is from people who read the manga. So for the review, i will look at the anime as it's only thing. Now back on about the story, I can say that are was things i really thought they wouldn't do and there as so many twists it will keep up guessing whats going to happen next. \\n\r\nNow on to the Characters, like how i did it them in my review of No Game No Life, i am only talking about the main two characters of the anime and because of story spoilers i can't talk about any other character or can't go into details about the main characters. Now on to the main Characters themselves.\\n\r\nTatsumi (Voiced by S\u014dma Sait\u014d), is the main male protagonist, he is a swordsman from a village far away and goes to the capital with he's two friends only to fail victim to the corruption in the capital and joins Night Raid to help rid the corruption.\\n\r\nAkame (Voiced by Sora Amamiya), is the main female protagonist, she is a highly trained assassin. She is cold-hearted and has very serious demeanor after being trained to be assassin with her sister at a very young age. She joined Night Raid after finding out how corrupt the Empire is one mission causing her sister to think she has betrayed by Akame and wants to end Akame life herself. \\n\r\nNow the presentation, Akame ga Kill! uses a number of colors and well designed fight scenes to attract people. It's graphics design is similar to another White Fox anime Is the Order a Rabbit? just with darker colors to match the theme of the anime. The Character animations are well done with great detail to character movements and facial expressions. The voice acting is well done as every character had a believable voice that fits them well. The sound is also well done especially the music in the fight scenes really captures the feel of each fight. Lastly the topics that are used works well as they don't to be out of place and really show how dark the story is. \\n\r\nNow onto my thoughts, Akame ga Kill! is very unique anime as it's story is something never seen before and doesn't go for the happy ending like most animes go for, instead goes for a more deeper impacting one. The characters are well made and because of how the story is written, keeps up thinking whats going to happen next. On the point of characters, i really like most of the characters in the anime but i love Akame as she not a character that needs saving by the main male character and is very interesting to me, i just like very unique characters in animes. The fight scenes are beautiful to watch as the had a lot of effort put into them and the soundtrack is great as i like the openings and endings songs a lot. Overall Akame ga Kill! while i say it's not everyone's cup of tea, it one of the uniquest animes i ever seen and if you love stories that are dark or like a lot of action then this is anime you should watch.",

            "content": "Spoiler Alert!! At least watched 22 episodes \r\nThe manga of Akame ga kill was fine Im not the type to read before watching but ive read it after AGK went a different way from the manga so Im just goin to reference some of the manga.\r\n24 episodes seems like a long time when first watching it but I soon realised that most of the stuff was rush which makes me sad because AGK could of been a great anime if it had more episodes.\r\nThe story itself was interesting in the beginning with tatsumi starting out as a standard shonen MC but it became darker whenhe discovers that the Capital isn't a happy place. It actually intrigued me and when the first character died I was like \"holy shit\" but when others started to die just when I nearly created a bond with them it was seriously rushed it not even funny. After a good 18 eps of killing off characters ( I've read the manga by then and will start referencing ) it changed when things didn't go same way in the manga, I was stunned that I couldn't watch the wild hunt arc which went into Runs past and lead to the capture of tatsumi and Lubbock. Some of the skipped parts were shown for example Lubbock's death, Esdeath trump and tatasumi execution in later episodes. The strange thing is that tatsumi's execution was much sooner so you could say it is a further story to the manga storyline and the supposed true ending. Even though the anime went original I strongly agree that you read the manga because it has a much more climatic ending which will make you wonder if tatsumi will make it out or die, don't you think so.\\n\\n\r\nIn the anime after tatsumi death it seems that more characters die and they end up versing the emperor \\n\\n\r\nThat was my review well it wasn't a generic one but I hope it helped",

I'm not going to go through what the anime is about but its about a bad government and a group of \"heros\" are going to revolt again them using some underhanded means and ya killing people \r\n(Spoiler all mostall the good guys in the show DIE!!!!) \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10) \\n\r\nThe story is good. Get straight to the point and give enough information for you to enjoy each episode. The main characters are great but some lack screen time and back story to actually make you feel an attachment. the first episode was very well done but it started to go off track and actually did not really show case what plot or mission they are doing or what significant changes where made with the enemy death would have loved to see them kill generals and stuff or taking control of areas to increase their army. but over all its a great story \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) \\n\r\nNot the best but still it gets the message across and honestly its the eye of the beholder \\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10) \\n\r\ni really like good bgms from anime and this one do not offer alot especially when killing is done it would be nice if they had music that actually show case more emotion \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10) \\n\r\noverall not all characters in the story can get a 8/10 and i would say only the first few eps the deaths of the characters where a huge impact to be but it starts to get dull in between episodes and if you watch game of thrones i'm starting to see the trend in their deaths and my the last few ep of that i was not shocked at all. So if you have seen that show you will get the same reaction for this. Now that i'm writing this the king in the show is some what similar just that the uncle is the mastermind in akame. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) \\n\r\nwhen i first watched the first 7 or so episodes i gave this rating and i'm not taking it back as it really give me the enjoyment i needed  i personally hope more anime have this kind of story-line where good guys finish last. :3  There where shocking moments, comedy and sadness in this show so it really is worth it to check this show out. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) \\n\r\none of the best in this season and new to anime history. Great for anyone who likes another, High school DxD or attack on titan. \\n\r\nDo not that if you liked this review be sure to comment or reply to me if you like more reviews as having been a anime lover myself i kind of dont get the community here. \\n\\n\r\nAnime that i dont like get 9/10 while anime if like get 2/10 like this one. \\n\r\nAlso my review get removed by the admins so often... can't people just speak their mind why is there a need for a guideline and it does not even spoil the show just that i dont like to include all the nonsense like sound, Art and story holy shit man does an anime review need to be a comprehension. \\n\r\nif it good --> A  F***ing must watched show can't it be this simple.....T_T",

And nothing better to say about the soundtrack in general, it wasn't horrible, but not specifically good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nThis is were the things became bad, and I mean, really, REALLY BAD.\\n\r\nThe main Character Tatsumi, is a guy who came from a little village to the big metropoli of the world, looking for fame, fortune and all the stuff that every character with this description wants.\\n\r\nFirst of all, why the anime it's called AKAME ga Kill, if the main character it's not actually Akame but another guy who only god could know (And I started to think that even he doesn't know).\\n\r\nBut yeah, this guy is boring, bland and forgettable, and almost all the character are like him.\\n\\n\r\nBut, to be fair, there are like three or four character that are kinda...Okay.\\n\r\nLike Burat, I remember the first time he appear, I laugh a lot with him, also, Sheele and Chelsea were kinda cool, but, yeah, for the most part, the characters were boring, and even I hate a lot of them, like the main Tatsumi, and that Seryuu B****.\\n\\n\r\nThe villans where...odd...yeah, that's the only way I can discribe them. Their purposes where kinda understandable, I mean, they want power, and...yeah, that's it, they are bad because...I don't know, maybe God was bored, but in general, they are just your generic King, or generic military, nothing to say but, meh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nS P O I L E R  -  A L E R T\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nIn this part I'm going to say some SPOLIERS, so please, be careful if you haven't watch this series, and you really want to.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nAs I said, this series started good, with some cool scenes here and there, showing the characters, and all that stuff that we need to progress.\\n\r\nActually, I could say that this anime became bad, with the first dead of a member of Night Ride.\\n\r\nIt's not only out of place, not only over the top, not only unnecesary, but it just feels wrong. When you are going to kill some characters is for two reasons : \\n\\n\r\n1.- It's really necesary to continue the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd 2.- It's a Charatacter who no one cares.\\n\\n\r\nI remember when I just saw that first dead, before I was happy because the anime was going in a good way, showing some character development, but then, it's like the writter was saying \"Oh, so you start to like the character that I created? Jo jo jo, thank you very much, I guess I'm going to KILL HER, not only in a painful and gory way, but also humiliating her, while I remember you the little development that I give her...are you happy now?\"\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not saying that over the top deads are bad, they could be funny and even epic, but no if you do it with the the character we should grow fond.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, every moment since the first dead, was painful and awful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\\n\r\nThis could be a good anime, but, it just tried to be something that it wasn't, and in one of the worst ways, prostituting the main idea, trying to be dark and deep, but just killed the characters in a really bad way, turning just in some strange porn-gore who just some sick people could enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, Akame Ga Kill...it really sucks.\\n",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill is a show that while trying to convey complicated and interesting themes, falls flat on its face when it comes to its poor characters, awful worldbuilding, and convoluted story. Let me explain. Akame ga Kill was fun when it was airing. It was mindless, bloody fun that allowed the viewer(in this case me) to take in all its gore and heart-pounding action as a part of this entire experience. But therein lies the problem of the show. Instead of sticking to its simple ways of an action show with some battle shounen elements it evolves into a show that not only triesto tackle messages like the death of people in battle and the effects of war, but it completely fails in this regard due to its horrible character development. But first off, let's start from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Akame ga Kill is a simple story of a rebellion. Rebellion against those who have been wronged and those who wronged them. It's standard fantasy fare that's been done over and over again with the classic anime touch of battle shounen. Which isn't a bad thing because it does what it sets out to do very good. It's action is well animated, the Teigu(Imperial Arms)s are unique and interesting, and the enenmies that Night Raid has to face are both varied and relateable in many ways. Which brings me to a point which I found to be a major fault of the show. The backstories of the characters. Many of the characters in the show(especially the villains) have their backstories only explained when they die or moments before they die. This leads to characters that not only feel rushed, but also either one sided or unrelateable in some cases. It's quite jarring but a notable mention in a show such as this. One other thing that must be mentioned is the world that the show tries to create. It's very disjointed and cluttered, something that was reminiscent of the worldbuilding episode in FMA:B where it took about half the episode to describe what was happening in every country around the main country. It felt very rushed, much like the static characters. The same goes for the build up for the final episodes, for while they are very good and blood-pounding, it didn't really fit the tone of the entire show. One thing that does deserve mentioning however was the deaths of characters. Much like the early episodes of the famous Shingeki no Kyojin, Akame ga Kill isn't afraid to kill off characters(sometimes important characters) for the sake of the plot. This can sometimes come off as cheap or even bad when the characters aren't that important, but nevertheless it's a bold tactic that not many battle shounens try these days.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Sound, and Animation: As a White Fox show, the animation and art in Akame ga Kill really brings the world to life not only through character designs(despite the rainbow hair colors) but costume design as well. To that extent, the animation and sound effects used in the fights are very good and are used to great effect amongst all the shit in the story and terrible worldbuilding to at least try to bring the world to life. In it's season it had some of the best effects, music(especially in the Incrusio scenes), and animation, which is noteworthy in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned before, a lot of the characters in the show are either underdeveloped or developed at their death. This is just poor writing in general and I'm appalled that the writers actually thought that it would work. But it worked. I actually cared for some of these characters. It's very interesting how they pulled it off through a combination of flashbacks and deaths. This however doesn't make up for the bland character personalities that were either just bland cliches or random weak motivations(Akame being a standout here). Esdeth in particular was the worst offender to this(besides being super overpowered as a fighter). Which was mostly to blame because of her whole pseudo-yandere personality mixed with blood warrior stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts: But despite all these flaws, Akame ga Kill is still a very fun series that I thoroughly enjoyed. While I wouldn't recommend it to someone that is looking for a battle shounen show, if you want action that has some nice details and animation eye candy(while not notable in anyway) then you could watch this. It won't change your world, but it won't ruin your day either.",

            "content": "First of all, the only reason I've ranked this anime as an 8 is simply because I enjoyed watching it. I didn't really enjoy it because it had a good story, outstanding art, fabulous soundtracks, or amazing characters. I enjoyed watching it and that is the reason (and only reason) I've rated this an 8. \r\nStory: 6 \r\nWas the story bad? Not at all. Was it great. No. It was a fair storyline, however in order for a good anime to be \"good\" despite its average storyline it needs to excel in something, which Akame ga Kill has not. \r\nArt: 7.5\r\nI believe the art fromAkame ga Kill is just high average art. It's pretty, very well depicted, however not enough to carry its own weight against the low rating of this animes storyline. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThere was nothing wrong with the soundtrack. However, nothing outstanding about it (in my awesome opinion). Although there is nothing at all wrong with the soundtrack, it is simply not enough to make up for the plot. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThew characters of Akame ga Kill are quite unique and are definitely deserving of a 9 despite the other flaws of this show. Oh yeah, SPOILER WARNING!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen they first killed off one or two of the main characters, it was very tear-jerking, however, that is one trait I like about an anime - when the writer knows in order for the show to be realistic, some of the characters have to die. However, not ALL or MOST of them. This was one aspect of the show I liked (although it was definitely sad) then grew to disapprove of as they killed the Night Raid team one by one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay the spoilers are over now. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nLike I said at the beginning of this review: I enjoyed watching this show. Would I watch it again? Probably not. But as I enjoyed watching it, I will give it an 8. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nThere is nothing necessarily WRONG with this anime, however there wasn't enough RIGHT to make up for the areas it was lacking in. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show? Yeah, I would. I would prioritize it, but I feel it was a good something to watch. Had it been like 70 eps instead of 24, I may feel differently (and it might have been a better show). But as it is fairly short, yes, I would recommend it (as long as you are okay with gore). \\n\r\nAnd I do have to say, I love how it doesn't have the overused \"mercy\" thing that a lot of animes have. \\n\r\nSo yeah, if you're wondering whether or not to watch Akame ga Kill, you should, but be prepared for not a totally amazing 5 star series and be prepared for a interesting, unique series (thats the best way I could describe it without being negative).",

As other review say, AGK only focuses on 2 point;\r\n-Goverment is bad;\r\n-Revolution is needed, so they come \"Night Raid\"\r\nSo the main point on the story is just night raid winning many battle to its victory, quite simple right?\r\nArt-10\r\nThe art is good, outstanding for me.\r\nSound-7\r\nsound is fair enough to give  it 6-7 but i feel like givingit a 7 because the OP\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-6\\n\r\nMany of the reviewers give it 3-4 or even 1-2 but i still want to give it 6 because the character development of the people in night raid is pretty good, even so the Esdeath's group didnt get much development and Esdeath herself keep doing torture to show the viewer how bad it is, even when it wasnt needed\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nDo i enjoy this because the art which is 10? Well, a little but not just it. This was among the first 10 anime i even watch, and at that time i would have give it a 10. I enjoy this bacause it is easy to understand, the ending is different from other anime and the character that being introduced, one by one was lovable. And this anime, apart FMAB is the only anime that make me feel anxious about what happen next, and care about someone in the anime that just about to die etc\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 7 or 8\\n\r\nI feel like giving it an eight but seeing the story and other, i'd still give it 7, more like 7.5\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch it?

From the beginning it may feel as a shounen, that changes into action/romance with some gore. You experience it in a linear way, with empty side characters. Although the universe is detailed and everything gets explained, so you don't feel emptiness after the end. The anime follows the manga adaptation, which is still ongoing. The anime didn'\u0092t had a clear ending, which is clearly reflected in the last four episodes. Where everything gets so rushed, that thestory loses it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe strongest part of the anime. Colorful and well developed characters through out the whole story. It reaches a level, where you have more sympathy for the \u201cbad guys\u201d, than for the \u201cgood guys\u201d. Though a few characters gets forbidden in time with shallow development and not enough screen time. I am looking at you Chelsea and Lubbock.\\n",

            "content": "Let's start out by saying that this show, as you can see by the reviews, is pretty much either a hit or miss. You either like it or you hate it. That's completely justified. Also, another head-note-thing, the show does deviate from the manga at a later point due to the fact that the manga was not completed at the time of this show airing and for some reason the adaptation decided to finish the story without the source material.\r\nOverall (8/10, 7/10 excluding Enjoyment rating)\r\nThe show, overall, was good. While the writing was subpar, the very nice art/animation and the good sound made up forthat in my books. The characters were shallow, but I expected as much, and I got what I wanted: A shallow shounen action show. If you were expecting something else, you'll hate this show. The comedy is nothing special, the plot is almost laughable at times, the characters are mostly bland, and the \"dark\" portions are often completely negated by a comedy scene directly afterwards. If you expected a \"good show,\" you won't get what you want, but if you want some action, you've come to the right place.\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10):\\n\r\nThe story is nothing special no matter how you look at it. If you've read any other reviews, you know the problem with it. Young Tatsumi decides to go to the capital to earn money, but soon finds evil within the city. So, he joins an assassin group dedicated to revolution. The premise works. The setting is some sort of medieval fantasy world that has like mechs and stuff, so pretty much just a shounen wonderland. However, the largest problem with the show is that it tries to be too many things at once. At times, it's dark and serious, but just moments later the show does a u-turn and suddenly it's comedic and lighthearted. This is done on several occasions. The characters keep repeated how tragic the death of their comrades is, but it's hard to connect and feel that way yourself when they're spitting out jokes and fan-service left and right.\\n\r\nI personally didn't find the ridiculous tone swings that repulsive, but it certainly takes away from the show and ruined the show for many people.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nThe art and animation, for the most part, looks very standard. That's not necessarily bad. Some designs were just bad considering the supposedly dark mood the show is supposed to have. (I mean, a sword that is just a giant pair of scissors? That looks ridiculous no matter what tone you have. And Bulat's hair... wut?) I did like some designs, such as Akame in the final episode, Chelsea, and a few others, but most of the designs weren't anything special. The animation and art really did stand out when it needed to. Most of the fights, especially the last one, were very appealing to the eye and looked amazing. The fighting in this show could be enough to satisfy one if you really like fantasy-shounen fights.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nFor the most part, the sound was appealing. The music, while no tracks really stood out, didn't feel repetitive and set the tone of the scene decently. I really liked the intros/outros, and the voices were good as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are all cookie-cutter characters with a slight kink. They behave and act like an archetype, but oftentimes when it's their turn to die, they'll get an episode of characterization that reveals the slight kink in their past or something. I didn't really care for many of the characters, but I did care about the Emperor... and maybe Chelsea, but that's because her design was so cool. I liked Lubbock because I always like the crafty characters and he gets a cool scene in the manga, but that's pretty much it. Many of the character's \"kinks\" are laughable. They're either badly written or ridiculous. (Nobody cared about Esdeath's backstory and her love interest is just stupid.) None of the characters are very appealing, but if you treat the show like a shallow shounen action, you'll be just fine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nDespite all the technical flaws this show had, and there were a lot of them, I still thoroughly enjoyed this show. If the tone wasn't completely destroyed, the comedy was usually entertaining and the fights were amazing. The last episode did a great job and kept the tone consistent throughout. It was a wild train ride. The plot was rushed, but it was a great time. The shounen fighting made up the technical errors for me, but that's completely personal opinion. I treated this show like a shallow shounen action, and I got what I expected. If you treated this show differently, you likely got something you didn't want. \\n",

            "content": "Akame ga kill was a joy to watch, but it wasn't something I'd put on the top shelf. Even though I'm generally not a fan of \"harem\" shows, AGK had enough other stuff going on such that I was able to finish the show without wondering whether it'd be worth it. So I'd imagine that this show would be an incredibly good watch for those who more into shows like sword art online and other shows that are more about the \"plot\" than the plot.\r\nThe main plot was mediocre, but the show does a great job of setting up a large cast of characters andhaving them resolve all their issues in a mere 24 episodes. That was impressive. But had the show been longer, and had the show dropped the date-simulator aspect I think the character development could have been even better. Being a 24-episode anime, I think AGK could have afforded to drop 3-4 of the side characters. It would've allowed for more storyline, or deeper development between the members of Night Raid.\\n\\n\r\n*spoilers\\n\\n\r\nAGK is actually a show willing to kill off members of the harem for shock value, and I see that as the main reason that the show was addicting. I have to say that I wanted to see who would die next, and how it would happen. It also made me worry about the characters when they were in a fight, which is something fresh that anime shows don't do very often. This is a good thing, but although the plot itself was so heavily focused on battle after battle that it I can't say the show offered much else.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole General Esdeath romance was ridiculous. Yes, she was sexy and very endearing, but the whole concept of a character like that felt more like some nazi-fetish masochist's wet dream rather than an actual character. Had there been a more compelling reason for her to be in love with the MC then I guess it could've worked, even as a standalone show, but it didn't feel genuine and it lacked the substance it needed to be truly believable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, it's a pretty enjoyable show to blow through on a rainy day. I don't think too many people would walk away from the show saying \"I had a crappy time\"",

            "content": "Story [7/10]:\r\nOne word that ruins this anime for me, pacing. I like that the characters are not invincible, it tells a story more true to real life than you'd see in a typical anime of this genre. Some are very outgoing and larger than life and it makes you think that the characters are invincible super humans with unreal and unachievable standards. This anime does a good job of making its characters realistic and telling a believable story. However, things happen without good reasons, details are missing or clearly rushed in, and this ruined the experience for me slightly. Some anime I have seen tella better story in just ten or twelve episodes than this one does in twenty-four.\\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]:\\n\r\nNot much to say about the art but I like the dark theme it has and how a scene can be portrayed based off the gore or happiness and carefree situation going on. It is obvious to tell based off visuals alone what is happening in the story and whether or not something bad may be creeping up soon.\\n\\n\r\nSound [6/10]:\\n\r\nSound design is good however slightly lacking as nothing truly stood out. There were no neat effects in my opinion and the music in the anime is not too catching either. I think that the characters voice acting however is extremely good and therefore is deserving of at least a fair rating. All the characters are believable in their voice acting and it is obvious that they really knew how to play their parts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8/10]:\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime can almost save it from being considered far too bland. I love the characters in this anime and wish that they were more flushed out and got better endings. I think some of the characters die for little or no reason especially considering how strong they all are. The good guys and the bad guys in this anime both have nice little quirks here in there that make them not just the bad or the good, they are believable and fight with a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [7/10]:\\n\r\nI recommend the manga over this anime. I think that the anime is far too rushed, there is little pacing, details are altered or entirely missing. I enjoyed this anime but not as much as I enjoyed reading the manga. The characters were simply more flushed out, the abilities and fights are more interesting despite being still images on pages, and I think that there is more of a happy ending. This review is being written upon my second viewing of this anime but I only decided to rewatch this series because I wanted to see how the story was told differently from the manga.",

I can see where this may come from. For me personally the story was pretty interesting and compelling. It really had some of the basic ingredients of the typical anime,but it also has a lot of twists. I find the personalities of most of the characters really aspiring and for me personally the ending was something that makes this anime a bridge between the anime world and the real one. It makes you value the sacrafices that a lot of people make and I just think that no matter that it had some sad moments it is a really well rounded story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nAbout the art of the anime, it is not something outstanding, but I find the appearance of the characters, the scenary and all other elements pretty enjoyable. It is true that it can be a bit violent and even gorry at certain times but I do not personally think that it is overdone.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound of the anime is prety decent.The intro of the anime is nice. Everything can be clearly heard, the voices of the characters are clear, appealing and relevant to their appearance. I really do not find any obvious flaws with the sound but just like the art it is not something that is really outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nSo this is the part I liked most and this is the part most people complain about.\\n\r\nThe most common thing that people say about the characters is that their actions are illogical and that they seem idiotic, crazy or just overreacted. I do agree that some of their decisions are not very usual but there is a beauty in this. Most people say the show and the characters are garbage just because they do not like the ending or they do not like the experience they get based on ther first impression and they easily dismiss it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching it. I felt really atached to the story and the characters. I liked every bit of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an interesting story, if you are not bothered by a little bit of gore and you like having some sad parts I would recommend you Akame ga Kill! I would say that this is not a story that is for everybody but I do think that if you do watch it you will not regret it!\\n\\n\r\nThank you for your attention!",

To watch is to enter an unpleasant territory full of dark elements. Now, you can interpret that unpleasantness in two ways. Whether that'd be the dreary experience or the thrilling bloodshed, both can pretty much describe the nature of this anime.\r\nIn a world of darkness empowered by shadowy secrets and corruption, several assassins constitute a covert group with the motive of overthrowing the people who lead a crippling nation. Night Raid, the source that drove the story and itsconflict also introduced some predicaments into a solid premise. While the clich\u00e9d personality of the characters was something I didn't mind much, it was the execution that caused a lot of letdowns. The creators tried too hard to grip the audience. Here's the case. We have the power of Teigu, relics of high calibers that paved way to fights of high action and risks. The apparent life or death fate of these fights was why when some ended in an anticlimactic fashion, any tension dissipated too quickly. Many deaths were burdened by the small amount of relatability in the characters, like more in-depth backstories, to create an impactful consequence for us viewers. Feeling meaningless in the end, it only left a sour taste even if the fight was great. But those that depicted true clashes really showed how dangerous they were. No jokes, no playing around. Being serious was the way to survive and that's something that caused the thrills of enjoyment. Another good thing was the interactions between allies alike in both sides, antagonists included. The fact they had actual relationships between each other with ideals that mixed and matched gave qualities that spoke for the state of their world and for their own personal character. Romance, a side dish within the show, was supported by good situations leading up to the influx of feelings but the suddenness were quite contrived, which failed to satisfy. For the comedy, the facetious attempts kicked me out of the serious atmosphere on occasions but some were suitable enough to leave a bit of lightheartedness. This anime had no major world building as it focused more on a condensed setting. Even so, at least it managed to stay true with its violent and grim take on dark themes all the way from the start towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nExpanding on the darkness, the world was splattered with detailed redness that reinforced the gory violence this anime had set out for. First of all, the visual wasn't anything special but compare it to the narrative or character elements and it was more detailed at numerous times. This was noticeable in particular with the incredible close-ups of the character's face full of all kinds of expressions. Combined with the blood, brutality, and amputated limbs, you'll get something that trembled the tone with negative feelings. As for the animation, there was inconsistency so the enjoyment varied. But together, it added up into something average. A few of the episodes were dedicated to intensified movements for the fights, coming in with great choreography and energy that expelled out onto the unforeseen demise of whoever will lose. It was these fights and the different but cool appearances of the characters that factored in the badass sides of the show. They also go hand in hand with their Teigu powers, which have various designs to make each one a unique and special weapon capable of delivering deathly attacks on their own ways. Efforts for the voice-acting were sometimes hindered to full potential by the clumsy switches between seriousness and humor. It still didn't stray from the fact that they were able to express emotions to a successful degree. Anguish, anger, and pain can be heard coming out of their voices, along with care, friendliness, and relief. These showed that the characters were still humans who possessed varying feelings and ideologies, whether clashing with foes or matching with their friends. While the soundtracks weren't the most golden part of the show, they were the ones that had the least amount of issues. I'd say they were effective in their uses. The collection of a variety of tracks blended in with the mood of each scene, such as sorrow or excitement, without any obstruction.\\n\\n\r\nA show with great promises and buildups, Akame ga Kill! took several downfalls and redemptions throughout the whole journey, making it difficult to justify itself as a well-executed anime. Too many times it had tried to forcefully crack emotions with the deaths it was not afraid to show, and the lackluster performance meant that a lot of the efforts fade away to the void. Despite that, it didn't come without enjoyment, and for a dark Shounen, is still a show that can excite with strong anticipations.",

I MEAN REALLY.\r\nStory 1/10\r\nThe story is trash. Need more explanation? Hopefully, the manga had an actual better story that's all anyone needs to know( I didn't read it).

One Example is how everyone has a will to do something(including the villains) , for example Tatsumi(the main characters) wants to earn the money possible to save his village from starvation.This then results in him joining the \"bad\" guysto earn the money needed.The story then progresses to epic battles of which frames are almost never identical.Some Battles (early in) will involve deaths that are portrayed well and for some reason has a purpose later on.In the ending there are happy moments,sad moments, and hands down epic fight scenes.Sure this anime isn't a all around masterpiece as there are flaws, as mentioned the characters didn't really develop that much besides Mine,Akame, and Tatsumi. Another flaw is that the imperial arms that are used as battle plot, tend to get repetitive and boring after a bit, but that doesn't mean that they didn't get their job done and provide some \"thrill\"to the battles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime was great with some notable problems.Do u recommend this anime?Yes, as it is great and a good time killer!\\n\\n\r\nDear viewers, you don't have to like this anime, or anime in general, its really just my opinion but go ahead and watch it if you have time.\\n",

So it is a bit of a change up from most anime I've seen.\r\nStory 7-\r\nAkame ga Kill! follows an elite assassination group called Night Raid and their attempt to overthrow a corrupt empire.  Enter Tatsumi, a young traveler hoping to join the empire's military, skilled with a sword, trying to make money for his village back home.  One day he is taken in by one of the empire's elite, only to find out all maynot be as it seems in the empire.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9-\\n\r\nThe quality is good, although I could score it an 8.5 for not fleshing out battle scenarios more\\n\\n\r\nSound 9-\\n\r\nImpressive opening themes, and decent soundtrack.  Enjoyable and really sets the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8-\\n\r\nI know some may say the characters come up a bit short but I digress.  They fit the Action Comedy roles well, so well I could really see Otaku culture represented in these fantastical characters personally.  I know that's a bit of a stretch objectively, but I could see it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9- \\n\r\nThe story isn't as fleshed out as it could be, but enjoyment takes you on a wild ride regardless.  Great boss fights, diverse enough characters and backstories, and deep themes resurface here and there.  It's not pretentious at all when presenting these themes which so damn easy to do in media, but it's far scarcer than it could be.  It remembers it's Action/Comedy at heart, so that's where it shines.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8-\\n\r\nCould it have been heavier on the themes?  Yes.  Could it have been heavier on story?  Yes.  But Akame ga Kill is different.  It's got a balance that makes it easier to accept dark themes in moderation, and works out well.  That said, it doesn't excel in every aspect, so it deserves an 8.",

First there was quite a few good action scenes with gradual character development and quite good plot development, true quite a few characters died in the first half however that was just following the manga therefore making it understandable for it to happen. However I feel that's where the made the wrong decision due to them producing an anime original ending which seemed pointless if most of the series was sourced based to begin with, true the manga had not finished and isonly scheduled now to finish in the summer of 2015 but that's where the producers dropped a bollock, they should have waited for the completion or near completion of the manga to produce an anime which had a satisfying ending for the viewers, however due to them producing it too early they managed to lower the enjoyment for the viewer from the original ending they produced. Therefore overall I feel the anime had much more potential but was rushed by producers to try and take the unfinished story to produce profit for themselves ahead of thinking about the enjoyment for viewers, therefore causing the original ending which many viewers may have felt was rushed and unsatisfied with.\\n\r\nStory:7\\n\r\nCharacters:7\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6/7\\n\r\noverall:7",

            "content": "This anime started off with so much potential. Unfortunately, it fell into mediocrity with the following episodes. The anime can\u2019t seem to decide what genre it is. This results in serious scenes to be paired up with comedic moments that feel shallow and can\u2019t be taken seriously. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story is fair. Although the storyline itself isn\u2019t particularly original, it has interesting elements. Moral aspects such as murder and good vs evil is explored, but only on a surface level. It doesn\u2019t dwell on it for more than a couple of moments at a time. The story is rather direct and linear, which is alrightbut lacks creativity. As the anime is so straightforward, there is little for the audience to ponder and dwell on once the episode is over.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is simple and clean. It is pleasing to look at, but does not stand out. The character designs are rather well done and I feel each of the characters' looks match their character trope. The animation is good, but also doesn't wow you in any way. There are scenes where the actions are dynamic and fun to watch, but those are rather rare and far between as most fights occur and end in a very quick span of time. The movements of the characters aren't exceptionally animated, but a good enough job is done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the anime is nice overall and works well with the anime. The opening and ending themes of the anime, while not outstanding, is nice to listen to even outside of the anime. Unfortunately, there are scenes where a \"serious\" battle is taking place, but rather comedic music is playing. This takes away from the experience, but only occurs a small percentage of the time. The voice-acting is good and the emotions of characters can be felt (to some degree, but we'll get to that later) during emotional scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nThis is the section that the anime suffers the most at. Most of the characters don't get much development before they are killed off. There are no characteristics that allow any of the cast to stand out as real and believable characters. The way they act are rather predictable and they feel extremely 2-dimensional and scripted at times. Although the voice-acting is good, the way the characters act are unrelatable as well as unrealistic. I know this is an anime, but there should be a level of believability in the characters with the \"serious\" tone the anime seem to be projecting at times. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nDespite my criticism, the anime is fine and truly has some comedic and memorable moments. Although i find myself bored due to how predictable it is at times, I enjoyed this anime overall. This leaves me with an overall score of 6.2, which rounds to 6.",

            "content": "Akame Ga Kill the animation is the adaptation of an unfinished manga about an assassination group known as Night Raid who are part of a revolutionary army that wants to other throw the cruel empire and most characters wield these ancient weapons known as Teigu which have special skills but only can be wielded by specific people.\r\nStory - (7/10)\r\nThe story is very simple, tyranny rules a country and the people are oppressed so a revolution seeks to other throw them, a story that has been done many times but even a simple story done well can still make it unique and Akame Ga Kill managesto add a little more to the formula and that is due to the characters. Sadly though, it was rushed to the restrictions of 24 episodes and the fact that the manga is still going so changes had to be made to have an ending within 24 episodes which do weaken the anime a bit but with what they added still manages to leave you somewhat satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nArt - (8/10)\\n\r\nLike most action anime the animation is fast paced and energetic and doesn't do anything too over the top. The character designs, while simple still managed to have a somewhat distinct design and the transitions of emotions, specifically the villains were done really well when showing their personality visually and that was something I really liked. \\n\\n\r\nSound - (6/10)\\n\r\nThe sound and music were pretty much very generic and nothing too memorable, it sounded good but it could have been done in any other anime.\\n\r\nThe seiyu's were also good but nothing too memorable, a very safe choice to me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - (10/10)\\n\r\nThis is one of my main reasons why I really liked this anime, the characters were so interesting and engaging that they were so likeable. My favourite is Tatsumi and while he looks pretty simple, he had really great development. In the first episode he actually was already able to handle himself and was quite strong and despite not having a teigu he is still able to fight on near equal footing, what I liked was while he was strong, he wasn't too strong as they shown he had lots of room for improvement and each episode you see him get stronger both physically and as a character, he breaks most traditions of a main character and doesn't fall into the typical good guy category. the other characters like Akame, Bulat, Mine, etc are all very interesting and most have some really good backstories and get as much screen time to display their skills. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - (9/10)\\n\r\nThis was a fun anime for me and left me wanting more after each episode, the story is simple but the characters make it interesting and you can get easily invested with what happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - (8/10)\\n\r\nI would recommend this for anyone who likes battle anime where the action is intense and really engaging and character driven. While it is rushed,  there are still the moments that matter a lot and doesn't feel too dragged or unnecessary, each episode had a purpose and did really well with each one.",

            "content": "The show starts showing that it is not afraid to show gore, and it that the overall story will have a dark undertone. It also establishes the \"No Character is safe\" feel for the show very early into it. this is two things the show does very well in the first few episodes. There also is a huge cast of characters that seem like they all are highly likable when you meet them. Along side these characters are a revolt against the government story, and magical weapons that all possess very unique powers.\r\nThis is what makes the show seem so great for the first tenepisodes, but one can tell it was not meant to be 24 episodes long but much longer. The show starts moving at a lighting fast rate, killing off characters extremely quick, thus making the unique likable cast no more then names with no real descriptions other than the back stories we are force fed on the spot. The dark undertones goes away with all the comedy, and do not even get me started on \"Justice Girl\", or the last four episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs you near the completion of the show you no longer wonder if a character is going to die, Akame Ga Kill beats the dead horse they gave no development to so frequently, a semi main character dying is no longer important or impact , its just a way for the writers to try being different.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the story, it starts out with Night Raid first starts off training their new pupil, fighting corrupt government officials. Then the fights start becoming against people trying to stop them mainly the Jaegars . Then the fights start becoming silly, we start seeing giant robot looking monsters fight our hero's, some of them literally just appear on the spot.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does some right, the first half where everything is suspenseful and new is great, the characters and weapons all come off cool. The Jaegars are great villains. There is a romance that does impact the story a little. Finally all the weapons and overall plot are pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Akame started off looking like a 8 or 9 , but the things the show does right, are either overused and become bland, or they totally abandoned ( looking at you giant robot fight).",

The animation had weird skips and was choppy, and the fights barely consisted of more than 1 slash with a sword. I wouldn't have minded if they did it in an \"assassiny\" way (I'm sure that's not actually a word, but still) but no, the atmosphere was that of some big shounen fight, but with no real action.\\n\r\nAlso (though it get's better after time) the anatomy of the women is actually quite bothersome, for me at least. Seriously, boobs are not that far up your chest!!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nCan barely remember it. If it had been particularly good or bad, I would have remembered it, so here a \"mediocre\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: absolutely pathetic (1)\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where I have to try not to rant.\\n\r\nThere are a few misconceptions about what is \"deep\" and \"well written\" nowadays. People think that merely having a large quantity of characters means the cast is diverse and they mistake having exactly one character trait for quality. Every character can be summed up in ONE WORD.\\n\\n\r\nShere: Airhead\\n\r\nMine: Tsundere\\n\r\nBulat: Kamina\\n\r\nTatsumi: Simon\\n\r\nEsdeath: Sadist\\n\r\nMinister: Evil\\n\\n\r\nAnd so on. This one word behind every character name pretty much gave away all there is to know about the character.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, having a \"sad backstory\" that in no way affects the storyline (except the one with the evil sister that's an enemy) is not deep!\\n\r\nIf you want to give your characters a sad backstory, fine, but make sure it shapes them! Make sure that specific event influences how and why the character acts, and make sure it can't be swapped out for any other sad back story.\\n\r\nAll in all the characters all were incredibly uninteresting, and the only reason\\n\r\nthey are so numerous to begin with is so the writers can kill of and have the people go \"omg they killed a main character, no one is saaaaafe~~\"\\n\r\nSeriously, I feel like I am watching an anime GoT parody.\\n\r\nIt's not even like any of them are unexpected, the death flags given are so shamelessly obvious, I was more surprised if someone actually didn't die.\\n\r\nSo yeah, it's not like any death comes as a surprise, and it's not like you actually miss any of the characters.\\n\r\nEverytime they reveal their \"sad past\" to the Protagonist (Tatsumi) again, they might as well be saying: \"Yo, kid imma ded next episode.\"\\n\r\nAlso, the Minister, who is supposed to be the main antagonist, is a joke. He's pretty much the standart villain you know from kid's show who wants to dominate the world for the sake of doing it. He's not even really a character, he's pretty much a parody of an archtype.\\n\r\nNever forget, if your antagonist is plain and stupid, your protagonists will lose their depht as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nDespite my ranting, I DID enjoy it for a few episodes, but you kind of understand what the end is going to look like fairly early in the game so it get's really boring. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nWhat is there to say? It's pretty horrible. Awful character, bad art, choppy animation. Character deaths occur purely for shock value. The first one might catch you by surprise (though to me even that one was pretty obvious) \\n\r\nbut that's about it.\\n\r\nNo need to waste your time on that, but if you got time to spare....you should probably still just watch FMA or something.",

            "content": "BILINGUAL REVIEW. SPANISH REVIEW BELOW. SPOILER FREE.\r\nAkame Ga Kill is the best proof of the reiterative use of gore for supplying the lack of development of the story and characters. It is still, not a bad anime, not much al least.\r\nStory and Characters  4/10\r\nIn this anime, the unexpected twists become the common denominator since the first episode. At first glance, it could mean that the boredom is deleted, however when the twists are continuously dramatic, although they developed differently, they end up being predictable.\r\nWe found in the same extent drama, gore, and ecchi; even though the gore meets the expectation of horrifying tirelessly, theecchi is exaggerated and poorly made with forced scenes for the sake of fanservice -although part of the public can like it- I was not enthusiastic about it. The drama, following the line of ecchi, is prolonged until the end, leaving us with a hole in the heart and a lot of things to say.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI found two essential elements in the story\u2019s development: the concept of justice and the bond of friendship. The first is deductible from the synopsis, is the spine of the series: The intensity of the characters believing in justice is what consolidates the story. The bond of friendship it is the strongest point of the anime at a human level, also, it was the catalyst of the drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe controversial end is one of the hardest blows for the viewer, but seeing the abuse of tragic situations It does not seem so farfetched.\\n\\n\r\nI conclude this section with the two aspects which I hate the most: the lack of development in the personalities and the almost-love relationships appearing. Because it is how they are: They just appear. They did not grow, they just happen unpredictably and with not much sense, and they dilute with the disbelief that they cause because with so much misery no one wonders if what you are seeing is consistent or not. \\n\r\nAbout the personalities, all of them drowns below the fanservice, the tragedy, and the free action. There is no time left to delve into characters  or to understand how they feel because the jump between the action scenes is so fast, and for the same reason, I did not enjoy the drama: there was no pause so that the viewer could think what was happening. In Akame Ga Kill there is no space for enjoyment or staying hooked on the drama. Everything is action, there is so much that is choking the others elements.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThese are the  strongest points of the anime, definitely. For me, the best of watching Akame Ga Kill was the soundtrack, including the two amazing openings and the animation, although the second one is no original and constantly abusing of fanservice, it leaves us with miscellaneous characters and with personalities that at least the try to be robust. Square Enix did again what they are able to do: an average animation but presentable. The personalities match with the design and the palette of colors, and the battle scenes are fluid and intense.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWatching Akame Ga Kill was exhausting. Although the strokes of absurd comedy helped to endure it, it was not till the end when I felt that I wanted to discover what would happen in the next episode. \\n\r\nProbably you are going to enjoy it if you like fanservice or if you end up having a crush with some of the characters, nevertheless, do not search for consolidate personalities, a coherent development or a balance between drama and comedy. You could say that this anime has it all yet it feels like nothing. \\n\\n\r\nSPANISH REVIEW\\n\\n\r\nAkame Ga Kill es la mejor prueba del reiterado uso del gore gratuito para suplir la carencia de desarrollo en la historia y en los personajes. A\u00fan as\u00ed no es un mal anime, no del todo.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria y personajes 4/10\\n\\n\r\nEn este anime los giros inesperados se convierten en el denominador com\u00fan desde el episodio uno. A primera vista podr\u00eda significar que el aburrimiento queda eliminado, sin embargo cuando los cambios son siempre dram\u00e1ticos, aunque llevados de diversas maneras, terminan siendo predecibles.\\n\\n\r\nEncontramos en la misma medida drama, gore y ecchi; y aunque el gore cumple la expectativa de horrorizar sin cansar, el ecchi me pareci\u00f3 sobreexagerado y muy mal llevado; escenas y situaciones forzadas \u00fanicamente para un fanservice que bien puede gustar a una parte del p\u00fablico, a m\u00ed no me entusiasm\u00f3. El drama, siguiendo la l\u00ednea del ecchi, se alarga hasta el final de la serie, donde nos deja con un agujero en el coraz\u00f3n y muchas cosas que decir.\\n\\n\r\nEncuentro dos elementos clave en el desarrollo de la historia: el concepto de justicia y el v\u00ednculo de amistad. El primero es deducible a partir de la sinopsis, es la columna vertebral de toda la serie: la intensidad con la que viven la justicia nuestros protagonistas es la que hace evolucionar el argumento de forma consistente. El v\u00ednculo de amistad es, sin demasiados artificios, el otro fuerte del anime en cuanto a nivel humano; y adem\u00e1s ser\u00e1 el elemento catalizador del drama.\\n\\n\r\nEl final, controversial como poco, es uno de los golpes m\u00e1s duros para el espectador, aunque viendo el abuso de situaciones tr\u00e1gicas no parece tan descabellado.\\n\\n\r\nTermino este apartado con dos de los aspectos que menos me gustaron del anime: la carencia de desarrollo de personalidades y las relaciones casi-rom\u00e1nticas que aparecen. Porque es as\u00ed: aparecen. No se desarrollan ni crecen, simplemente ocurren imprevisiblemente y sin mucho sentido, y acaban diluy\u00e9ndose junto a la incredulidad que provocan, pues con tanta desdicha uno ya ni piensa si lo que est\u00e1 viendo es coherente o no. Respecto a las personalidades, todas ellas quedan hundidas y camufladas bajo el fanservice, la tragedia y la acci\u00f3n gratuita. No queda tiempo para profundizar en el pasado de los personajes o en entender c\u00f3mo se sienten, porque el salto entre escenas de acci\u00f3n es demasiado r\u00e1pido, y por la misma raz\u00f3n, ni siquiera llegu\u00e9 a disfrutar la tragedia: no hab\u00eda pausa para que el espectador pudiera pensar qu\u00e9 estaba ocurriendo. \\n\r\nEn Akame Ga Kill no queda espacio para el reposo, saborear el drama y mantenerse enganchado; todo es acci\u00f3n, tanta que acaba asfixiando al resto de elementos.\\n\\n\r\nArte y Sonido 6/10\\n\\n\r\nLos puntos fuertes del anime, sin duda. Para m\u00ed lo mejor de ver Akame Ga Kill fue la banda sonora, incluyendo dos openings geniales y una animaci\u00f3n que, aunque no demasiado original y siempre abusando de fanservice, nos deja con personajes variopintos y con personalidades que, al menos, intentaron ser robustas. Square Enix ha vuelto hacer lo de siempre: una animaci\u00f3n normalita pero presentable. Las personalidades cuadran con el dise\u00f1o y la paleta de colores, y las escenas de batalla son fluidas e intensas. \\n\\n\r\nDisfrute 5/10\\n\\n\r\nVer Akame Ga Kill fue agotador. Aunque los toques de comedia absurda ayudaron a sobrellevarlo, no fue hasta el fren\u00e9tico final cuando sent\u00ed ganas de saber qu\u00e9 iba a pasar en el siguiente episodio. Probablemente vaya a gustarte si disfrutas el fanservice o si acabas teniendo un crush con alguno de los personajes, sin embargo no busques personalidades consolidadas, un desarrollo coherente o un equilibrio entre drama y comedia. Se podr\u00eda decir que este anime tiene casi de todo y sin embargo se siente como nada.",

            "content": "Akame ga Kill is a great display of a seemingly-ideal revolution against power and tyranny. From a conceptual basis, the overarching ideas are very real, and very relevant. We see how power corrupts people; how soldiers blindly accept oppressive instructions and how people kill for the sake of killing. AgK mirrors many military regimes in modern society - we have countless documented tortures and mass killings simply because it was either their job or they were given free reign to do so. I thought of the Iraq War more than a few times as I was watching this movie. \r\nOne character - a soldier workingfor the oppressive kingdom, who really hasn't done anything bad on-screen - mentions he joined the dictatorship to change the system from within. While he sounds completely sane and logical, the audience is pitted against him instantly, specifically because they know that any involvement in working for evil makes you part of the evil; and the creators have done a great job in leading the audience up to this pattern of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nOther concepts to do with justice are very well thought out here; and the audience grows quickly throughout these 24 well-paced episodes to validate or invalidate each character's proposed notion of justice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Camera work was absolutely great, with the art sufficiently engaging the watcher, not frustrating them, and allowing them to appreciate every drawn scene. Fan-service was toned right back when the plot needed focusing which was great. \\n\\n\r\nAgK did fairly well to keep the tables even in the fighting. The fights were enjoyable from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe best audio was best during fights, and even then it was mediocre. I really think that there was a constant discrepancy between what was drawn and what was required. \\n\\n\r\nGood characters, the male lead died, which is always refreshing (cruel, I know) and Akame wasn't validated. No fame or history books for assassins. This was consistent with the episodes - \"everybody knew what they were getting into\" - and is totally true. \\n\\n",
