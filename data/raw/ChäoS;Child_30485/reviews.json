            "content": "I hated Chaos;Head. I mean, just HAAATED it. It was a disaster from start to finish. It manages to be simultaneously boring and unbearably melodramatic, which would be impressive if it wasn't so awful. It is only natural to expect that its offspring, Chaos;Child would be just as terrible. \r\nAnd then suddenly WHAM PLOT TWIST!!!! It kinda isn't!\r\nThe same old shit from the first one is still going down: people are getting killed in bizarre, overly art-designed ways and a group of children with relatively poor social skills and a penchant for doing stupid stuff and being in the right place at the right timeseem to be more proficient at solving the mystery of whodunit than the police. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike its predecessor, and almost miraculously, Chaos;Child actually feels like a mystery. This is in contrast to the original Head season's feeling more like a bad School Days fanfic. It has atmosphere and an ominous tone, and the characters of Child are actually pretty good this time as opposed to being UNBEARABLE (re. Chaos;Head). It has been genuinely unsettling at a couple points with some fairly macabre subject matter and implied graphic violence, and the narrative has been moving along at a pretty good pace. It even made me gasp and clutch my pearls at one point. \\n\\n\r\nChaos;Child isn't the best mystery/psychological/horror anime out there. It isn't even the best anime in the series that includes itself, Steins;Gate, Robotics;Notes, Occlutic;Nine, and the much maligned Chaos;Head.It's chaotic and confused, and the story is all over the place. It is not, by any means, a perfect show. What it is is pretty good, and it deserves a watch if you are inclined to enjoy something dark in the vein of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\n\\n\r\nBonus Game: Try to come up with some names for new entries in the series of works linked by the Random word;random word title. My ideas include Avocado;Surprise and Taxidermy;Birthday. \\n",

            "content": "-- This review contains spoilers. Only read if you have finished the series. --\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is very interesting alone, or at least it was enough to catch my attention. It's a direct extension from Chaos;Head, so I was going into this trying to find answers. However, the problem with this show is that the explanation for things isn't exactly logical due to the lack of direction put into it and lackluster writing. Quite simply, it's a huge mess. \r\nYou have your typical high schoolers that are somehow involved in this big case that turned out to be incredibly pointless in the end. If you've seenthe last episode, you'll know what I'm talking about. It was explained, with an obnoxious info-dump, that the whole reason the case even exists was because MC wanted to do something he enjoyed. But you know what's hilarious? He wished for this directly after seeing people die in an \"earthquake.\" And I'm supposed to believe he \"forgot\" his wish when he literally begs for it out in the open? How is that even logical? That seems like something a bored kid would wish for, to be honest. It makes no sense whatsoever and just goes to show how the writer doesn't even remember half of his/her script. \\n\r\nThe show also includes characters that don't necessarily need to be there, such as cute girl from hospital. She was probably necessary for about an episode - that's it. You're supposed to use your characters effectively throughout the story, not have them as cute props in the background for cheap appeal 95% of the time. I could say the same thing for other characters, as well. \\n\r\nLet's not even get into the fact that literally NOTHING was solved by the end of this show. The \"evil organization\" still exists, we don't know what will happen to any of the characters after the final scenes, and this entire season was just unnecessary to the plot in general because some boy made a stupid wish. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nThe appearance or \"art\" itself is okay for today's standards, maybe even on the mediocre side. With that being said, I think the animation is terrible beyond words. When I say this, I'm also referring to the fight scenes throughout the show - which was very minimal. The swords or \"weapons\" each person with powers had looked totally out of touch with the original artwork. When comparing the weapons to the characters, the differences were incredibly off-putting and underwhelming. The fight scenes themselves were hilarious, in my opinion; I'm just being honest here. I wouldn't even call the last episode's fight scene a climax or worthy of being watched at all - it was just that boring. At one point, MC's finishing move literally was out of no where, had no sound, and was replaced by a quick black screen filter of sorts. If I could describe it in one word, it would be: underwhelming, again. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, this was probably my favorite aspect out of this show, which is not a compliment. In fact, it's an insult. If your soundtracks are the only thing you'll be known for in a series, then you're probably doing something wrong and not focusing on everything equally. I'll be sure to look into the singers and sound director's other works for my own personal enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOr as I like to call it.. How To Create A Boring Character 101. \\n\r\nStep 1) Include dialogue that is so basic it doesn't reflect the character's personality at all. \\n\r\nStep 2) Include zero depth, because adding depth is too much work.\\n\r\nStep 3) Include only flashbacks to create character's past. \\n\r\nStep 4) Include cliche lines with predictable actions. \\n\r\nStep 5) Profit. \\n\r\nAnd voila! You're finished. \\n\\n\r\nAll joking aside, there was nothing memorable about these characters. What were their names, someone may ask? I wouldn't know because I don't consider it relevant. In fact, the entire show was irrelevant. I feel as if though this was all just an elaborate detour and we still don't know anything. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a waste of time. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. I only completed it because I was already halfway through it anyway.\\n\r\nI don't grade each category like we're \"supposed to\" because I find it pointless, and it wouldn't really convey my points accurately either. My philosophy is that whatever the show gives me, I give back in return. In other words, if you give me minimal effort, I'll give you a minimal score. I would give this show the lowest possible score, but it at least tried to do something different - which I do acknowledge.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 2/10.",

            "content": "As a fan of the semicolon series, Chaos;Child was initially my 2nd most anticipated anime of Winter 2016 (after Rakugo Shinju). It was heartening to hear that this new adaptation was by a completely different creative team to the disastrous Chaos;Head anime, but its short length raised questions about how faithful and complete the adaptation could be. \r\nTwo disclaimers: Firstly, this is a review of only the first 4 episodes. Secondly, I haven't played the VN since it is only in Japanese. However, the very few western people who have played it seem pretty pleased with this adaptation so far. For those who haven't playedor watched Chaos;Head - doing so is recommended to fully understand this, but there is a recap episode that pulls up the most important points. \\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\\n\r\nChaos;Child is a murder mystery crossed with psychological horror, set within the larger SciAdv universe. That description may already mean you know this anime is, or  isn't, for you. Nonetheless, so far this is a particularly strong example of these genres.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't as immediately memorable as those in Steins;Gate, though they fit the darker tone that C;C has had from the beginning. Taku doesn't appear a typical semicolon series protag, being apparently well adjusted, though it seems with many pychological issues under the surface. The other two main characters are Kurusu, Taku's sister in law, who is more down to earth and attempts to dissuade him from his investigations, and Onoe, a childhood friend who is the main one pushing Taku onwards. \\n\\n\r\nChaos;Child excels at what it needs to: psychological horror. The murder mystery is not really a \"whodunnit\", instead a device to showcase ever more gruesome murders and advance the plot via the main characters's investigations. The murders and other horror elements are memorable, without overusing gore. \\n\r\nSuch moments are about once an episode, leaving the rest to atmospheric buildup, character development, and the furthering of the investigation. \\n\\n\r\n-Technical-\\n\\n\r\nChaos;Child's animation and visual design is another strong suit. The studio is Silver Link which typically does strong work; here they were given a VN to adapt, not the easiest of tasks compared to a manga. Thankfully though everything here, from the character designs to the backgrounds to the mood lighting to the environments looks very good. \\n\\n\r\nSo far there isn't much music to speak of, other than the (catchy) OP, more along the lines of background noises and ambience to build the atmosphere. The voice acting, both in the Japanese and English dubs, is suitable to the tone of the anime, with each VA sounding suitable to their character, apart from Takeru's English VA who IMO sounds a little on the immature side. \\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\\n\r\nThe first 3rd of Chaos;Child has got off to a very strong start, leaving me highly intrigued into what will come in the remainder. This certainly isn't an anime for everyone; a liking for both the horror genre and the SciAdv series is likely a requirement for enjoyment, but if the descriptions I've given so far have piqued your interest, this is an anime worth checking out. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Just like its predecessor, Chaos;Child was very interesting to watch despite all the weird random events.   There just times when having random things occur actually makes the show more interesting and attention grabbing.  \r\nThe story flows better than it did in Chaos;Head.  There's still a set of New Generation Madness murders, which happen on the exact same dates as the old ones, just occurring 6 years later.  Takaru is the new main character who tries to solve these new cases along with help from his and members of his school's newspaper club.  A bunch of weird events occur asthey try to solve these cases and there is pretty distinct ways that most of the characters fit into the case.  Unlike Chaos;Head though, the events in Chaos;Child flow much better, especially since  there is not a few episodes around the start and middle that are centered around specific girls.  Since the episodes flowed better, it allowed the psychological aspect to flourish much better. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very well done.  I noticed how well every background fit the scene along the way, but I really noticed how well done the art is during the last episode.   The animation is very good as well and it's pretty consistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great.  Every piece of music enhanced the mysterious tone of the anime and or helped to calm you down during more friendly scenes.  I love the opening theme and the ending theme is really good.\\n\\n\r\nThe character aspect is another area where Chaos;Child beats out chaos;Head.  Takaru was a bit more believable in terms of his actions and development.  He was still somewhat easily frightened, at the beginning, but didn't isolate himself as much or deny everything that happened around him.  Both Chaos;head and Chaos;child have protagonists that fit their roles very well, but Takaru is just a bit better.  Serika was probably the second most developed.  Her personality almost completely changes towards the end from how she was at the start, but it improved her character and added a lot more detail that helped the anime progress smoothly.  Besides those two, I didn't find many faults in other characters, but I'd rather not write about a third or half page just describing the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I looked forward to watching the new episodes every week and I never felt like an episode was just a huge disappointment.  I love Chaos;head too, but Chaos;child just has higher quality stuff in every category; my scores only differ by 1 point though so no offense if you like Chaos;head better.  I definitely recommend watching this if you like psychological anime, since it's not filled with tons of worthless information that seems to only have the purpose of making fake drama/suspense; I'm talking about a so called, \"classic\" anime here, that will remain nameless in this review.  So check it out if you like the genre and don't worry, the harem part is pretty much non-existent; I don't even know why the show has the tag.",

            "content": "Chaos;Child is the sequel to the anime to Chaos;Head that aired 8 years ago which is more or less the time gap between the two shows in series. The show starts about 6 years after chaos;child where at the end of that show a major earthquake had struck the town, but by the time Chaos;child starts most of the city has already been rebuilt.\r\nStory- the story follows Takaru and the all the members of the newspaper club as they start to notice and investigate strange deaths that have occurred in the city recently. after connecting some dots they realize that the murders happening right noware similar to the ones that occurred 6 years ago in Chaos;head. the show than follows the group investigating the deaths and where the next possible murder will take place. the show reveals that there's more to the murders than a simple copycat as human experimentation and psychic powers into the mix which is all well into you remember that this is chaos;child. the show reverts back to gilgomaniac and di-swords while also puling of plot twists after plot twist to keep the viewer entertained, but in the end fell ridiculous and contrived. a lot of the mystery of the show is ruined as the many of the clues are just handed to them or solved in to most convenient way that it just feels impossible.  also the antagonist just reveals who they are by the end of the show through exposition and info-dumping and their motivation for all this being plain ridiculous. only for that to be topped of by the ending that is a bit sour&sweet but is mostly lacking and inconclusive.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- what the show does better than it's predecessor is with its characters. Takaru is more of a  proactive character as he wants to investigate these murders even if they might be dangerous. you get an idea for his motivation, but the failure in that is that it is revealed by another person. most of the cast like the previous show mostly consist of women. what sets them apart is that several do extend a bit beyond the usual arc-type that they are placed in, although this a for a few which leads to other characters having limited screen time and dialogue(if they had any at all) then what they needed in order to become proper characters. since most of the show is riddled with plot twist so are the characters in the show as several characters have personality switches in order to appease the plot, because it was a ruse all along. in the end most if not all the characters are 2-dimensional at best.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nart/animation- the art and animation are better than it's predecessor. the background setting and the character designs look a bit more polished. the animation looks more fluid even if there's not much happening in the show in terms of actions. yet than again this is pretty standard more modern anime standards which I've said enough times that it's not even worth repeating for each modern anime now\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- not much worth mentioning. the soundtracks are mostly plain and forgettable. the voice acting is decent and better than the annoying voice acting from chaos;head.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment- the show was rather interesting at first, but as soon as it hit the halfway mark it was very unsatisfactory.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\noverall it's better than Chaos;Head, but being better still doesn't make this show any good\\n\r\n4/10",

But, alas, it did just that and apparently, the inane nature of the show turned off tons of people who were previously big fans of the undisputed champ, Steins;Gate. \r\nSo, here we have a show that, at first glance, was going to be just as disorienting and confusing. The first episode did a pretty terrible job of fusing a sort of synopsis of what happened in Chaos;head with the beginnings of what will be the main plot ofthe current show, Chaos;Child. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you can get passed that first little clusterfuck, then you will be rewarded with what is shaping up to be a pretty awesome story. A murder mystery of sorts that involves PTSD, body switching, a sort of magic that is acquired from MK ULTRA type experimentation...so yeah, a lot is going on so far and we are only at the 8th Episode. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nStick with it, try to remember who is who (since the characters sometimes can blend into each other- which, in hindsight, seems to be intentional,  given that the show is based on delusions) and let yourself be sucked into the crazy ass conspiracy.",

            "content": "This review has spoilers, HUGE SPOILERS!\r\nEnglish Version:\r\nonce Upon a time, an anime called ChaoS: HEAd came out, everyone hated and I wanted to know why, the result of it was one of the worst anime I've ever seen, when ChaoS; Child, the sequel, came out, I tried to avoid it, but now that I saw, I can finally tell you all about this abomination called ChaoS; Child:\r\nStory (3):\r\nThe premise was interesting, but the execution was terrible, the mysteries of the \"next gen\" are back, murders are happening and no one knows who is committing the crimes, Takuru, MC and his high school friends try tosolve it, plot starts very well, the first 7 episodes were very well done, with plot twists, plot points and the mystery getting more and more interesting, but in the end, it all went to shit. As if you did discharge and the shit clogged the toilet, even if you call the plumber, he could not unclog and all that exploded and hit the wall and never left, as a punishment for you, that was how I felt after finishing seeing ChaoS;Child. So all that happens throughout the anime was because the MC wanted to do something to enjoy it, all of the deaths, tragedies, blood was because the MC made a stupid desire, not only that, the decisions he takes throughout the story were made because he forgot his own desire, I wonder if he has amnesia to forget something so specific...\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation (3): \\n\r\nWeak, typical of every horrible anime season, a simple and bland animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6): \\n\r\nAverage, the tracks are very good and some are beautiful, but forgetful because of how bad the anime is. the ED is medium and the OP is good, nothing relevant and that can stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1):\\n\r\nMiyashiro Takuru: An idiot boy who made a wish and foolish decisions leaving all stupid, not only that, knowing the person who killed his younger sister and tried to murder his middle sister, tried to dialogue with, showing how he was feeling hatred for her , then kill her, and then apologize for killing her, as if it was a wrong decision to kill the person who married all this pain and who made his life a hell, beyond himself.\\n\\n\r\nOnoe Serika: A girl who had no importance in the story until the last episodes, she is the person who kills Takuru's younger sister and tried to kill the middle sister, with the justification that it was all for him, all for his desire , because it is very interesting to kill the family you love and then to say that it was all for you and to say that you will always be by your side, what a beautiful sense of love right... a stupid desire needs a stupid character to perform it.\\n\\n\r\nKurusu Nono: The middle sister of Takuru, a person who decides to die to also leave things more interesting to Takuru's desire deserves no better description than this, and of course, decided that instead of, perhaps, KILLING THE PERSON THAT KILLED HER SISTER.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters: No one cares, zero importance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1):\\n\r\nit was painful, it took 1 hour to watch the last episode, watching this was like being tortured for hours and hours.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2):\\n\r\nExactly what I expected, crap, do not waste your time on this, ever.\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nBrasilian Portuguese Version:\\n\\n\r\nEra uma vez, um anim\u00ea chamado ChaoS:HEAd que todo mundo odiou e eu queria saber o porqu\u00ea, o resultado disso foi um dos piores anim\u00ea que eu j\u00e1 vi, quando saiu sua sequ\u00eancia, ChaoS;Child, eu tentei evita-la, mas agora, finalmente falarei dessa abomina\u00e7\u00e3o chamada ChaoS;Child.\\n\\n\r\nStory (3): \\n\r\nA premissa era interessante, mas a execu\u00e7\u00e3o foi terr\u00edvel, os mist\u00e9rios da \"next gen\" est\u00e3o de volta, assassinatos est\u00e3o acontecendo e ningu\u00e9m sabe quem est\u00e1 cometendo os crimes, Takuru, o Protagonista e seus amigos do ensino m\u00e9dio tentam resolve-lo, o enredo come\u00e7a muito bem, os 7 primeiros epis\u00f3dios foram muito bem trabalhados, com plot twists, plot points e o mist\u00e9rio ficando cada vez mais interessante, mas no final, tudo isso foi para a merda. Como se vc desse descarga e a merda entupisse o vaso, e mesmo vc chamando o vizinho, ele n\u00e3o conseguiria desentupir e tudo aquilo explodisse e batesse na parede e colasse la, eternamente, como uma puni\u00e7\u00e3o para vc, foi como me senti ap\u00f3s terminar de ver ChaoS;Child. Ent\u00e3o tudo aquilo que acontece durante todo o anime foi porque Takuru queria fazer algo, se entreter. Todas as mortes, trag\u00e9dias, sangue foi porque o PP fez um desejo est\u00fapido, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 isso, as decis\u00f5es que ele toma durante toda a hist\u00f3ria foram feitas porque ele esqueceu de seu pr\u00f3prio desejo e n\u00e3o sabia das consequ\u00eancias disso, me pergunto se ele tem amn\u00e9sia para esquecer algo t\u00e3o especifico...\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (4): \\n\r\nFraca, tipica de todo anime de temporada horr\u00edvel, uma anima\u00e7\u00e3o simples e sem gra\u00e7a.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6): \\n\r\nMediano, as tracks s\u00e3o muito boas e algumas s\u00e3o lindas, mas esquec\u00edveis por causa do qual ruim o anime \u00e9. a ED \u00e9 mediana e a OP \u00e9 \u00f3tima, nada de relevante e que possa se destacar.\\n\\n\r\nPersonagens (1): \\n\r\nMiyashiro Takuru: Um garoto idiota que fez um desejo e decis\u00f5es idiotas deixando tudo idiota, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 isso, sabendo da pessoa que matou sua irm\u00e3 mais nova e tentou assassinar sua irm\u00e3 do meio, tentou dialogar com, mostrando como ele estava sentindo \u00f3dio por ela, depois a mata, e ent\u00e3o pede desculpa por mata-la, como se fosse uma decis\u00e3o errada matar a pessoa que causou toda essa dor e que fez de sua vida um inferno, al\u00e9m dele mesmo.\\n\\n\r\nOnoe Serika: Uma garota que n\u00e3o teve import\u00e2ncia na hist\u00f3ria at\u00e9 os \u00faltimos epis\u00f3dios, ela \u00e9 a pessoa que mata a irm\u00e3 mais nova de Takuru e tentou matar a irm\u00e3 do meio, com a justificativa de que foi tudo por ele, tudo por seu desejo, por que \u00e9 muito interessante matar a fam\u00edlia de quem vc ama e depois falar que foi tudo por vc e falar que sempre vai estar ao seu lado, que belo conceito de amor... um desejo idiota precisa de uma personagem idiota para realiza-lo. \\n\\n\r\nKurusu Nono: A irm\u00e3 do meio de Takuru, uma pessoa que decide morrer para tamb\u00e9m deixar as coisas mais interessantes para o desejo de Takuru n\u00e3o merece nem descri\u00e7\u00e3o melhor do que essa, e claro, decidiu isso ao inv\u00e9s de, talvez, MATAR A PESSOA QUE ASSASSINOU SUA IRM\u00c3.\\n\\n\r\nOutros personagens: Ningu\u00e9m liga, import\u00e2ncia zero.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1): \\n\r\nFoi doloroso, demorei 1 hora para assistir ao \u00faltimo epis\u00f3dio, assistir isso foi como ser torturado durante horas e horas.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2): \\n\r\nExatamente o que eu esperava, um lixo, n\u00e3o perca seu tempo com isso, nunca.",

            "content": "Here is an example of how a prequel could ruin a new addition to a series. For all of those who watched Chaos;Head before this one you surely understand what i mean.\r\nThe only mistake this anime made was being a sequel. However, that doesn't really matter since it's not related to Chaos;Head except in order of events. From my point of view, Chaos;Head was like the introduction or trial version before creating this anime. (No I'm serious and a proof of that is the recap at the beginning of Chaos;Child where the entire season of Chaos;Head was wrapped in 20 minutes. That was not asummary that was essentially the entire season in 20 minutes!).\\n\\n\r\nOkay now that it's clear how unrelated this season is to the last one let's me explain what this one has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT! (No not what you're thinking of) I mean real plot with twists at every single corner. Just as you think you got the idea of the anime you get hit with a plot twist that changes everything then another one afterwards and so on.\\n\\n\r\nWait, but plot twists aren't enough to make an anime all that different,no? Yep, you're absolutely right. We've got better art style now. Although I guess that's to be expected since the last season was about 10 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so we got plot and art anything else? Yeah, character development as well. Chaos;Head MC character,Takumi, Was basically GAME-> HALLUCINATE -> SCREAM -> BLAME RIMI FOR IT. However our new refurbished MC, Takuru, Is an active detective-like person. He's not that much different than your typical protagonist but in comparison to Takumi he's much more suitable as a MC.\\n\\n\r\nYou keep on criticizing Chaos;Head all the time why did you even get into the series, dude? Psychological that is! Away with your mainstream! True that Chaos;Head wasn't my cup of tea but all the Sci-Fi candy in it encouraged me to continue with it. However, after Chaos;Child being published and since it offers almost the same amount of Sci-Fi material I thought of letting whoever wanted to continue through with Chaos;Head just for the Sci-Fi or psychological as I did. DON'T! You've got a better option now that is Chaos;Child.",

We picked this anime in hopes that...it would provide entertainment, but honestly...I'm disappointed. \r\nThis anime feels incredible rushed. It starts out with the plot of murder mystery, and while it \"technically\" keeps that storyline...it's as if the writers/directors threw in a bunch of convenient excuses to make things stretch out to appease the ending. It had a lot of potential, giving me the type of feelthat the anime \"Another\" did. The murders were gruesome as hell and immediately hooked you in. Then...it just kinda fell off. They introduced a weapon-mechanic to the anime with no explanation, got rid of a main character by the 8th episode and she was never seen again...EVEN THOUGH she had a huge part in the anime...man, I don't know..there's a serious lack of explanation during several parts of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI want to like the anime, I really do. But it just fell short. If you're looking for a murder-mystery anime...Another would be the way to go. By the 6th episode of Chaos Child, I had a hunch that I was going to be disappointed by the ending, and I was. \\n\\n\r\nI have a feeling that if you've seen Chaos Head, things might make more sense...but it gave you the sensation that it could be a 'stand-alone' anime. They even provided their first episode as a break-down of Chaos Head, but yeah. Weird. Watch at your own risk.",

This rating will be based solely on my bias, and this review will be unstructured.\r\nUp to ep 8, how's ;Child been doing, you ask? Well, in order to answer that. Let's start from the beginning of the show, I mean, before it. Remember the 'Chaos;Head' episode, more known as Chaos;Child ep 0? Sorry but without prior knowledge of Chaos;Head it was just hard to grasp even the easy-to-get parts in that cram session (of course I know Chaos;Head's ending is different from this alternative version).Now, this sequel, being the aftermath of the C;H's male lead's alternative decision, tries to make a lot more things a lot crazier and even a lot more than a lot of that. That's definitely a lot, isn't it? Now if you paid attention to what I just said, it didn't make them a lot crazier.... but rather.. it tried to. Lucky for it, it wasn't all for nothing. Now, let's go back to the question, \"Up to ep 8, how's ;Child been doing?\". It's has been doing very good! At first, it may seem like all WTF in the head but try not to bother making sense out of a lot of stuff too much since the confusions are intentional. By the time you get to ep 7, you'll thank yourself for not giving up on this one. And oh, that's not all!!!! Watch ep 8!!!! Don't let your attention span get you bored this early in the series, you won't regret it. The story is getting better (I mean, BETTER). Again, were you paying attention? I said \"better\", meaning that the story was already good to begin with, okay? The art is maintaining its quality. The sound is getting more important and related (relatable?), mainly because of the story. Speaking of the characters well, here's where you can find a lot of setbacks. I don't know how many episodes this is going to have but clearly the pacing is handicapping the development of most characters. This is significantly evident when something terrible happens to someone important. How about my enjoyment? Well, I'm afraid to say that my enjoyment came from the latest episodes since stuff from the previous eps is made logical sense by them. I understand that the main setback is the pace \u2014 one reason why this show is a highly potential hit-or-miss. Hi Steins;Gate and Neon Genesis Evangelion! Overall, my highly biased rating for now is 8. It could go lower or higher depending on the next episodes (and probably I'll re-watch this anytime before the series finishes).",

It's not easy to sum up an entire and long visual novel in so few episodes. \r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story is very fascinating, there are so many hidden things and mysteries that involves and trasmit great curiosity, it manages to hit the point of the entire opera. \r\nArt: 8\r\nIts graphic style is a little different from the original opera in my opinion, but still I think that is pretty enjoyable. Some scenes are really impressive.\r\nSound: 8\r\nThe music is good, but it's very hard tolisten during the anime. It's very atmospheric and dark but it can guarantee good moments in the situations. The opening and ending are pretty good, and some vocals work are made by Kanako Itou, awesome and talentuous voice singer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here ar poorly developed due to the number of episodes, someone of them is very lacking and it's not possible to understand or emphatize with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is slow in the start, like as the other works of its producers, but it slowly grows with the succession of the events. It gets emotional in most of the parts of it tries to do, and it does well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI think that the best way to enjoy this work is to play the related visual novel, and if you like the plot, the story, you will find all you need in this. There are so many things that are missing, and some events are changed, but in the end it's been very flowing and enjoyable till the end.",

            "content": "TL;DR - Watch the entirety of Science Adventure if you want to watch this.\r\nThis anime alone, in theory, is pretty awful, but, saying this anime is awful because it doesn't lead anywhere, make any sense, or have any purpose is like taking a random chapter out of a book, calling it it's own story, and then saying it's awful because it doesn't lead anywhere, make any sense, or have any purpose.\r\nFor those who don't know, this anime is basically the 4th season in a series of anime called Science Adventure, which is based off of the visual novels of the same name. The series isstill being released, but so far we have (in order): Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate, Robotics;Notes, Chaos;Child, and Steins;Gate 0 (still being aired). Ultimately, a huge theme in this anime series is mystery. We have really no idea where the plot is going, but each season definitely plays some part in the overall story. Chaos;Child just seems to have no actual point to it or any way of majorly affecting the entire plot, but that's what makes it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I enjoyed this anime so much is because it makes you want to figure out how it's all going to affect the world, from the characters of Steins;Gate to those of Robotics;Notes.\\n\\n\r\nMost people give Steins;Gate major praise, although most of those people are clueless to the fact that it is in fact the second season in the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, basically, if you are watching this series as a whole, this anime is amazing, but, if you are, for some reason, just watching this part of it alone, then don't waste your time, as it won't make any sense nor will it bring any satisfaction. As I stated before, watching this alone is like picking up a book, reading a random chapter, and then calling it good. No reason, point, satisfaction, seemingly interesting plot. No. Just a lackluster of mysteries to be discovered in further chapters.\\n\\n",

Having experienced the visual novel this is pretty much a fair review of this series, taking it into account both as a standalone series and as an adaptation.\r\nYou might be familiar with the phrase \"There is no Tsukihime anime\" which is pretty much used to describe the anime adaptation of Tsukihime and to make fun of how bad it was. It is pretty much a prime example of an adaptation gone wrong.\r\nTaking this into account the phrase \"There is no Chaos;Child anime\" should also exist (Same applies for Chaos;Head)\r\nSTORY: 5\r\nJust like with Chaos;Headthis anime butchers the storyline of its visual novel and even as a standalone anime it still isn't all that good. The plotline was just way too long for a 12 episodes anime and it pretty much skips any kind of character development, which results in plot twists being ruined and characters being mere stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever i can give the staff credit for at least trying to do something good unlike Chaos;Head's adaptation. It was faithful at the very least and was somewhat coherent for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are quite nice to look at. They pretty much have the same aesthetic as the visual novel. It isn't as good as Steins;Gate or Occultic;Nine in this aspect but it was pretty much fine and had some really nice moments.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting and sound effects were handled quite well but what reallly stands the most is the musical aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIts pretty much the same soundtrack for the visual novel but it doesn't really matter since that one is amazing. Takeshi Abo did a good job as always and its definitely his best score along with Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0.\\n\\n\r\nOnoken's part in the soundtrack isn't as good as Takeshi Abo's work but it still works to some effect.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 4\\n\\n\r\nLike i said before the anime avoided any kind of character development and ruined what made these characters so good. The characters are pretty much empty shells of their VN counterparts, which were actually fleshed out as the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6\\n\\n\r\nDespite all its flaws i actually enjoyed this anime and it was quite entertaining to watch. It adapted the game perfectly in some parts and managed to have the unsettling atmosphere of it. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : 5\\n\\n\r\nWhile this adaptation isn't really that bad it doesn't manage to make the source material justice. Hopefully it gets a remake in the same way Fate/Stay Night did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall just read the VN, which is actually translated and might get a PC release soon. Not only is it a great story but its also slightly better than Steins;Gate and its pretty much the best entry in the Science Adventure franchise so far.\\n",

            "content": "The story is fantastic. The intro song is great. The art is good. Most of the characters are decent; But the direction is absolutely HORRIBLE. It completely ruins everything!\r\nThe director gave the characters realistic reactions, but it just comes over as appaling and pathatic. They scream all the time and they do it in a unpleasant manner. The direction feels like a B-class horror movie, with tons of suspence and jumpscares. Furthermore they skip some parts of the story and expect you to just connect the dots, which in itself isn't a bad thing, but they also use it to hide the fact that theydidn't properly explain some things.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint about this anime is the main character. This anime was based on a visual novel so the anime studio had to create a main character themself and it was a disaster. The main character(takeru) is a weak/realistic human, but not in a good way. He always yells at people and is stressed out. That could be funny and amuzing like in Chaos;Head and eva, but in this case it is not, probably because of the tone he speaks with (he sounds pissed off, stressed out and annoying).\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing they've screwed up are the key scenes. There are some really cruel situations in this series, but the scenes where the're shown aren't properly directed. The director didn't consider the feelings off the viewers and you notice it really well. Instead off finding those scenes beatifull or sad you just feel angry and disgusted. It can easely traumatise you. The best anime to compare those scenes to is corpse party.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime by far is the story. The story is a mystery thriller with a few brilliant plottwist (which were actually pretty difficult to predict), but unfortunatly this anime isn't directed as a thriller at all and parts of the story are skipped which gives the story no impact.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like suspence horror films, you might like it. Also if you don't like corse party you wont like this anime either.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way this is a sequel to Chaos;Head, but there is no need to watch that before watching this. The two are nothing alike and I like Chaos;Head better.",

            "content": "The show needed two seasons. I'm not even judging it based on its source material.\r\nIt's like they had a bullet-point list of what needed to be adapted, and checked each item off as they went. It's like a summary, a Wikipedia page put into TV. The story is told, but that's about it. None of the characters are well developed or developed at all, and the plot just moves along. \r\nAbout halfway through I forgot everyone's names, which I felt awful about because in several touching scenes, I would be wiping away a tear while in my head I'm like \"B-but who was this person?\"But can you blame me? Everyone seemingly existed as plot devices save for the main character, Takuru and another one, can't mention due to spoilers. Even then, they're very clearly only there so the plot moves, there's no attempt at making them seem \"real\" or possibly relatable, so their faces just blended in. Even those who are given a lot of screen time and conversations, feels like I barely know 'em.\\n\\n\r\nFurthering my complaints about the story is how jumpy things started to be. Often I would start a new episode and wonder if I skipped something. Again, a clear indication of rushed adaptation and desperately needing a second season. There are awesome moments and scenes, but a majority of them are plot dump moments, or just exist because that was on the bullet point list, meaning the scene is done and that's it, with no lasting impression. This really hurts some poignant scenes because there's a distinct lack of finesse to them. It makes you emotional but at the same time go \"what? But why, again?\" Again there are amazing scenes towards the end, and they bring up this show massively, especially the music, which fits every moment to a T. \\n\\n\r\nEven after all of that, it's enjoyable, because the plot, as summary-ish as it is, is thrilling, the mystery is, well, mysterious, and the small moments of brilliance brings everything together at times. It's just that it's too rushed to truly immerse yourself, the true sin of every Sci;ADV adaptation that's not Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown of Ratings:\\n\r\nStory- 7: Plot is enjoyable and told, but it's like a summary of events that had a checklist of things to adapt, and they simply marked each bullet point off as they went. Moments of brilliance bring it up towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 7: Looks good enough, very clearly budget constrained with some stiff movements, but it's adequate. Poignant scenes, especially the delusions are insanely good though, and subtle show-not-tell moments are done well.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9: It's a Sci;ADV series. The music is stunningly good, the sound effects are appropriate. Really enhances the mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 6: Everyone is too damn underdeveloped and rushed for you to really care for, save for the one character at the end and whoever dies, but it's purely for emotional shock. Everyone is a plot device.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 7: It's still a good thriller, as summary-ish as the plot is told. Gripping moments brought down by per-episode disconnect and names that don't stick.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 7: It's a good show to watch, but not to revel in, immerse yourself in, gush about, or to remember down the line. You don't really remember that Wikipedia article you scanned over for info, so it's the same deal here.",

The ending was just.. wow. You may have to research some stuff at the end on your own, as the anime doesn't give you much of a lift off point at the end. I'm sad it's ended and may not come back.\r\nDisliked: I did not dislike much to be honest, the only thing i hope they had expanded upon more is his reasoning and thought processes at the end, or just the story at the end. They should've made an episode13, explaining the situation afterwards. Perhaps how *she* felt or if *she* remembered any of the previous selves past, perhaps how they acted around each other, as-well as the events taking place immediately afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly hope for another season, i had a ship ready to sail, as well as my emotional investment now implemented in this story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n10/10 in my opinion.",

Chaos;Child does everything that Chaos;Head could not. The art is good, the characters are much more interesting and detailed, and there are much better plot devices which were just not present in Chaos;Head. As someone who has not watched Chaos;Head, I  still find Chaos;Child pretty easy to follow with.\r\nIt contains aspectsof Sci-Fi and Psychological Horror.

If you\u2019re a normal person, who doesn\u2019t like edgelord/shock value shlock, then stay far away from this series. This is the worst representation of visual novels ever, for those who think that visual novels are all over-the-top gross-out fiestas with porn, i.e. Saya no Uta, then this series just reaffirms that bias. \r\n\t\u2022 I don\u2019t like negative representations of visual novels, most are bad, but sometimes they can be accurate representationsof what it\u2019s like to be stuck inside of your own head. If you like this series, you may enjoy the visual novel Sweet Pool. Wait, no, don\u2019t play that! Ch\u00e4oS;Child feels smashed together and hard to follow, probably because they took the gameplay of the visual novel and tried to abridge it as much as possible. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There\u2019s far too many characters to keep up with and too many plot points that are injected into its vein.I had to constantly remind myself of all of the plot points and logic that the show explained\u30fcwhen going into each episode. Or else, I was just baffled and confused as to what was going on. The twist at the end, the climax, is probably the only interesting part of the show, but that also seems weirdly contrived.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Ch\u00e4oS;Child is yet another example of a show that has some good ideas, but over-saturates itself with everything that SOUNDS cool, leaving viewers like me, who didn\u2019t play the visual novel in somnambular confusion while there\u2019s a heap of bile climbing up our throats. Oh, look, there\u2019s a pretty twin-tail girl! Since she\u2019s from a porn game, let\u2019s have the most graphic scene of her pissing herself ever!\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The \u201cmovie\u201d, if that\u2019s what you want to call it. Is equally as confusing, more laughable, and has barely any semblance of a budget to stand on. Ch\u00e4oS;Child is a low peg in the Scientific semi-colon series, but that\u2019s not really saying much. BUT Steins;Gate is really only the okay one, so far, and the anime lags where the visual novel succeeds.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I have the Steins;Gate visual novel to thank for the many lucid dreams I\u2019ve had about time travel. But back to Torture Porn: The Animated Series. I give the film a 2/10 and the series a 3/10.",

It manages to be simultaneously boring and unbearably melodramatic, which would be impressive if it wasn't so awful. It is only natural to expect that its offspring, Chaos;Child would be just as terrible. \r\nAnd then suddenly WHAM PLOT TWIST!!!! It kinda isn't!\r\nThe same old shit from the first one is still going down: people are getting killed in bizarre, overly art-designed ways and a group of children with relatively poor social skills and a penchant for doing stupid stuff and being in the right place at the right timeseem to be more proficient at solving the mystery of whodunit than the police. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike its predecessor, and almost miraculously, Chaos;Child actually feels like a mystery. This is in contrast to the original Head season's feeling more like a bad School Days fanfic. It has atmosphere and an ominous tone, and the characters of Child are actually pretty good this time as opposed to being UNBEARABLE (re. Chaos;Head). It has been genuinely unsettling at a couple points with some fairly macabre subject matter and implied graphic violence, and the narrative has been moving along at a pretty good pace. It even made me gasp and clutch my pearls at one point. \\n\\n\r\nChaos;Child isn't the best mystery/psychological/horror anime out there. It isn't even the best anime in the series that includes itself, Steins;Gate, Robotics;Notes, Occlutic;Nine, and the much maligned Chaos;Head.It's chaotic and confused, and the story is all over the place. It is not, by any means, a perfect show. What it is is pretty good, and it deserves a watch if you are inclined to enjoy something dark in the vein of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\n\\n\r\nBonus Game: Try to come up with some names for new entries in the series of works linked by the Random word;random word title. My ideas include Avocado;Surprise and Taxidermy;Birthday. \\n",

It's a direct extension from Chaos;Head, so I was going into this trying to find answers. However, the problem with this show is that the explanation for things isn't exactly logical due to the lack of direction put into it and lackluster writing. Quite simply, it's a huge mess. \r\nYou have your typical high schoolers that are somehow involved in this big case that turned out to be incredibly pointless in the end. If you've seenthe last episode, you'll know what I'm talking about. It was explained, with an obnoxious info-dump, that the whole reason the case even exists was because MC wanted to do something he enjoyed. But you know what's hilarious? He wished for this directly after seeing people die in an \"earthquake.\" And I'm supposed to believe he \"forgot\" his wish when he literally begs for it out in the open? How is that even logical? That seems like something a bored kid would wish for, to be honest. It makes no sense whatsoever and just goes to show how the writer doesn't even remember half of his/her script. \\n\r\nThe show also includes characters that don't necessarily need to be there, such as cute girl from hospital. She was probably necessary for about an episode - that's it. You're supposed to use your characters effectively throughout the story, not have them as cute props in the background for cheap appeal 95% of the time. I could say the same thing for other characters, as well. \\n\r\nLet's not even get into the fact that literally NOTHING was solved by the end of this show. The \"evil organization\" still exists, we don't know what will happen to any of the characters after the final scenes, and this entire season was just unnecessary to the plot in general because some boy made a stupid wish. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nThe appearance or \"art\" itself is okay for today's standards, maybe even on the mediocre side. With that being said, I think the animation is terrible beyond words. When I say this, I'm also referring to the fight scenes throughout the show - which was very minimal. The swords or \"weapons\" each person with powers had looked totally out of touch with the original artwork. When comparing the weapons to the characters, the differences were incredibly off-putting and underwhelming. The fight scenes themselves were hilarious, in my opinion; I'm just being honest here. I wouldn't even call the last episode's fight scene a climax or worthy of being watched at all - it was just that boring. At one point, MC's finishing move literally was out of no where, had no sound, and was replaced by a quick black screen filter of sorts. If I could describe it in one word, it would be: underwhelming, again. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, this was probably my favorite aspect out of this show, which is not a compliment. In fact, it's an insult. If your soundtracks are the only thing you'll be known for in a series, then you're probably doing something wrong and not focusing on everything equally. I'll be sure to look into the singers and sound director's other works for my own personal enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOr as I like to call it.. How To Create A Boring Character 101. \\n\r\nStep 1) Include dialogue that is so basic it doesn't reflect the character's personality at all. \\n\r\nStep 2) Include zero depth, because adding depth is too much work.\\n\r\nStep 3) Include only flashbacks to create character's past. \\n\r\nStep 4) Include cliche lines with predictable actions. \\n\r\nStep 5) Profit. \\n\r\nAnd voila! You're finished. \\n\\n\r\nAll joking aside, there was nothing memorable about these characters. What were their names, someone may ask? I wouldn't know because I don't consider it relevant. In fact, the entire show was irrelevant. I feel as if though this was all just an elaborate detour and we still don't know anything. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a waste of time. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. I only completed it because I was already halfway through it anyway.\\n\r\nI don't grade each category like we're \"supposed to\" because I find it pointless, and it wouldn't really convey my points accurately either. My philosophy is that whatever the show gives me, I give back in return. In other words, if you give me minimal effort, I'll give you a minimal score. I would give this show the lowest possible score, but it at least tried to do something different - which I do acknowledge.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 2/10.",

            "content": "As a fan of the semicolon series, Chaos;Child was initially my 2nd most anticipated anime of Winter 2016 (after Rakugo Shinju). It was heartening to hear that this new adaptation was by a completely different creative team to the disastrous Chaos;Head anime, but its short length raised questions about how faithful and complete the adaptation could be. \r\nTwo disclaimers: Firstly, this is a review of only the first 4 episodes. Secondly, I haven't played the VN since it is only in Japanese. However, the very few western people who have played it seem pretty pleased with this adaptation so far. For those who haven't playedor watched Chaos;Head - doing so is recommended to fully understand this, but there is a recap episode that pulls up the most important points. \\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\\n\r\nChaos;Child is a murder mystery crossed with psychological horror, set within the larger SciAdv universe. That description may already mean you know this anime is, or  isn't, for you. Nonetheless, so far this is a particularly strong example of these genres.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't as immediately memorable as those in Steins;Gate, though they fit the darker tone that C;C has had from the beginning. Taku doesn't appear a typical semicolon series protag, being apparently well adjusted, though it seems with many pychological issues under the surface. The other two main characters are Kurusu, Taku's sister in law, who is more down to earth and attempts to dissuade him from his investigations, and Onoe, a childhood friend who is the main one pushing Taku onwards. \\n\\n\r\nChaos;Child excels at what it needs to: psychological horror. The murder mystery is not really a \"whodunnit\", instead a device to showcase ever more gruesome murders and advance the plot via the main characters's investigations. The murders and other horror elements are memorable, without overusing gore. \\n\r\nSuch moments are about once an episode, leaving the rest to atmospheric buildup, character development, and the furthering of the investigation. \\n\\n\r\n-Technical-\\n\\n\r\nChaos;Child's animation and visual design is another strong suit. The studio is Silver Link which typically does strong work; here they were given a VN to adapt, not the easiest of tasks compared to a manga. Thankfully though everything here, from the character designs to the backgrounds to the mood lighting to the environments looks very good. \\n\\n\r\nSo far there isn't much music to speak of, other than the (catchy) OP, more along the lines of background noises and ambience to build the atmosphere. The voice acting, both in the Japanese and English dubs, is suitable to the tone of the anime, with each VA sounding suitable to their character, apart from Takeru's English VA who IMO sounds a little on the immature side. \\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\\n\r\nThe first 3rd of Chaos;Child has got off to a very strong start, leaving me highly intrigued into what will come in the remainder. This certainly isn't an anime for everyone; a liking for both the horror genre and the SciAdv series is likely a requirement for enjoyment, but if the descriptions I've given so far have piqued your interest, this is an anime worth checking out. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Just like its predecessor, Chaos;Child was very interesting to watch despite all the weird random events.   There just times when having random things occur actually makes the show more interesting and attention grabbing.  \r\nThe story flows better than it did in Chaos;Head.  There's still a set of New Generation Madness murders, which happen on the exact same dates as the old ones, just occurring 6 years later.  Takaru is the new main character who tries to solve these new cases along with help from his and members of his school's newspaper club.  A bunch of weird events occur asthey try to solve these cases and there is pretty distinct ways that most of the characters fit into the case.  Unlike Chaos;Head though, the events in Chaos;Child flow much better, especially since  there is not a few episodes around the start and middle that are centered around specific girls.  Since the episodes flowed better, it allowed the psychological aspect to flourish much better. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very well done.  I noticed how well every background fit the scene along the way, but I really noticed how well done the art is during the last episode.   The animation is very good as well and it's pretty consistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great.  Every piece of music enhanced the mysterious tone of the anime and or helped to calm you down during more friendly scenes.  I love the opening theme and the ending theme is really good.\\n\\n\r\nThe character aspect is another area where Chaos;Child beats out chaos;Head.  Takaru was a bit more believable in terms of his actions and development.  He was still somewhat easily frightened, at the beginning, but didn't isolate himself as much or deny everything that happened around him.  Both Chaos;head and Chaos;child have protagonists that fit their roles very well, but Takaru is just a bit better.  Serika was probably the second most developed.  Her personality almost completely changes towards the end from how she was at the start, but it improved her character and added a lot more detail that helped the anime progress smoothly.  Besides those two, I didn't find many faults in other characters, but I'd rather not write about a third or half page just describing the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I looked forward to watching the new episodes every week and I never felt like an episode was just a huge disappointment.  I love Chaos;head too, but Chaos;child just has higher quality stuff in every category; my scores only differ by 1 point though so no offense if you like Chaos;head better.  I definitely recommend watching this if you like psychological anime, since it's not filled with tons of worthless information that seems to only have the purpose of making fake drama/suspense; I'm talking about a so called, \"classic\" anime here, that will remain nameless in this review.  So check it out if you like the genre and don't worry, the harem part is pretty much non-existent; I don't even know why the show has the tag.",

            "content": "Chaos;Child is the sequel to the anime to Chaos;Head that aired 8 years ago which is more or less the time gap between the two shows in series. The show starts about 6 years after chaos;child where at the end of that show a major earthquake had struck the town, but by the time Chaos;child starts most of the city has already been rebuilt.\r\nStory- the story follows Takaru and the all the members of the newspaper club as they start to notice and investigate strange deaths that have occurred in the city recently. after connecting some dots they realize that the murders happening right noware similar to the ones that occurred 6 years ago in Chaos;head. the show than follows the group investigating the deaths and where the next possible murder will take place. the show reveals that there's more to the murders than a simple copycat as human experimentation and psychic powers into the mix which is all well into you remember that this is chaos;child. the show reverts back to gilgomaniac and di-swords while also puling of plot twists after plot twist to keep the viewer entertained, but in the end fell ridiculous and contrived. a lot of the mystery of the show is ruined as the many of the clues are just handed to them or solved in to most convenient way that it just feels impossible.  also the antagonist just reveals who they are by the end of the show through exposition and info-dumping and their motivation for all this being plain ridiculous. only for that to be topped of by the ending that is a bit sour&sweet but is mostly lacking and inconclusive.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- what the show does better than it's predecessor is with its characters. Takaru is more of a  proactive character as he wants to investigate these murders even if they might be dangerous. you get an idea for his motivation, but the failure in that is that it is revealed by another person. most of the cast like the previous show mostly consist of women. what sets them apart is that several do extend a bit beyond the usual arc-type that they are placed in, although this a for a few which leads to other characters having limited screen time and dialogue(if they had any at all) then what they needed in order to become proper characters. since most of the show is riddled with plot twist so are the characters in the show as several characters have personality switches in order to appease the plot, because it was a ruse all along. in the end most if not all the characters are 2-dimensional at best.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nart/animation- the art and animation are better than it's predecessor. the background setting and the character designs look a bit more polished. the animation looks more fluid even if there's not much happening in the show in terms of actions. yet than again this is pretty standard more modern anime standards which I've said enough times that it's not even worth repeating for each modern anime now\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- not much worth mentioning. the soundtracks are mostly plain and forgettable. the voice acting is decent and better than the annoying voice acting from chaos;head.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment- the show was rather interesting at first, but as soon as it hit the halfway mark it was very unsatisfactory.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\noverall it's better than Chaos;Head, but being better still doesn't make this show any good\\n\r\n4/10",

But, alas, it did just that and apparently, the inane nature of the show turned off tons of people who were previously big fans of the undisputed champ, Steins;Gate. \r\nSo, here we have a show that, at first glance, was going to be just as disorienting and confusing. The first episode did a pretty terrible job of fusing a sort of synopsis of what happened in Chaos;head with the beginnings of what will be the main plot ofthe current show, Chaos;Child. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you can get passed that first little clusterfuck, then you will be rewarded with what is shaping up to be a pretty awesome story. A murder mystery of sorts that involves PTSD, body switching, a sort of magic that is acquired from MK ULTRA type experimentation...so yeah, a lot is going on so far and we are only at the 8th Episode. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nStick with it, try to remember who is who (since the characters sometimes can blend into each other- which, in hindsight, seems to be intentional,  given that the show is based on delusions) and let yourself be sucked into the crazy ass conspiracy.",

As if you did discharge and the shit clogged the toilet, even if you call the plumber, he could not unclog and all that exploded and hit the wall and never left, as a punishment for you, that was how I felt after finishing seeing ChaoS;Child. So all that happens throughout the anime was because the MC wanted to do something to enjoy it, all of the deaths, tragedies, blood was because the MC made a stupid desire, not only that, the decisions he takes throughout the story were made because he forgot his own desire, I wonder if he has amnesia to forget something so specific...\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation (3): \\n\r\nWeak, typical of every horrible anime season, a simple and bland animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6): \\n\r\nAverage, the tracks are very good and some are beautiful, but forgetful because of how bad the anime is. the ED is medium and the OP is good, nothing relevant and that can stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1):\\n\r\nMiyashiro Takuru: An idiot boy who made a wish and foolish decisions leaving all stupid, not only that, knowing the person who killed his younger sister and tried to murder his middle sister, tried to dialogue with, showing how he was feeling hatred for her , then kill her, and then apologize for killing her, as if it was a wrong decision to kill the person who married all this pain and who made his life a hell, beyond himself.\\n\\n\r\nOnoe Serika: A girl who had no importance in the story until the last episodes, she is the person who kills Takuru's younger sister and tried to kill the middle sister, with the justification that it was all for him, all for his desire , because it is very interesting to kill the family you love and then to say that it was all for you and to say that you will always be by your side, what a beautiful sense of love right... a stupid desire needs a stupid character to perform it.\\n\\n\r\nKurusu Nono: The middle sister of Takuru, a person who decides to die to also leave things more interesting to Takuru's desire deserves no better description than this, and of course, decided that instead of, perhaps, KILLING THE PERSON THAT KILLED HER SISTER.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters: No one cares, zero importance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1):\\n\r\nit was painful, it took 1 hour to watch the last episode, watching this was like being tortured for hours and hours.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2):\\n\r\nExactly what I expected, crap, do not waste your time on this, ever.\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nBrasilian Portuguese Version:\\n\\n\r\nEra uma vez, um anim\u00ea chamado ChaoS:HEAd que todo mundo odiou e eu queria saber o porqu\u00ea, o resultado disso foi um dos piores anim\u00ea que eu j\u00e1 vi, quando saiu sua sequ\u00eancia, ChaoS;Child, eu tentei evita-la, mas agora, finalmente falarei dessa abomina\u00e7\u00e3o chamada ChaoS;Child.\\n\\n\r\nStory (3): \\n\r\nA premissa era interessante, mas a execu\u00e7\u00e3o foi terr\u00edvel, os mist\u00e9rios da \"next gen\" est\u00e3o de volta, assassinatos est\u00e3o acontecendo e ningu\u00e9m sabe quem est\u00e1 cometendo os crimes, Takuru, o Protagonista e seus amigos do ensino m\u00e9dio tentam resolve-lo, o enredo come\u00e7a muito bem, os 7 primeiros epis\u00f3dios foram muito bem trabalhados, com plot twists, plot points e o mist\u00e9rio ficando cada vez mais interessante, mas no final, tudo isso foi para a merda. Como se vc desse descarga e a merda entupisse o vaso, e mesmo vc chamando o vizinho, ele n\u00e3o conseguiria desentupir e tudo aquilo explodisse e batesse na parede e colasse la, eternamente, como uma puni\u00e7\u00e3o para vc, foi como me senti ap\u00f3s terminar de ver ChaoS;Child. Ent\u00e3o tudo aquilo que acontece durante todo o anime foi porque Takuru queria fazer algo, se entreter. Todas as mortes, trag\u00e9dias, sangue foi porque o PP fez um desejo est\u00fapido, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 isso, as decis\u00f5es que ele toma durante toda a hist\u00f3ria foram feitas porque ele esqueceu de seu pr\u00f3prio desejo e n\u00e3o sabia das consequ\u00eancias disso, me pergunto se ele tem amn\u00e9sia para esquecer algo t\u00e3o especifico...\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (4): \\n\r\nFraca, tipica de todo anime de temporada horr\u00edvel, uma anima\u00e7\u00e3o simples e sem gra\u00e7a.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6): \\n\r\nMediano, as tracks s\u00e3o muito boas e algumas s\u00e3o lindas, mas esquec\u00edveis por causa do qual ruim o anime \u00e9. a ED \u00e9 mediana e a OP \u00e9 \u00f3tima, nada de relevante e que possa se destacar.\\n\\n\r\nPersonagens (1): \\n\r\nMiyashiro Takuru: Um garoto idiota que fez um desejo e decis\u00f5es idiotas deixando tudo idiota, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 isso, sabendo da pessoa que matou sua irm\u00e3 mais nova e tentou assassinar sua irm\u00e3 do meio, tentou dialogar com, mostrando como ele estava sentindo \u00f3dio por ela, depois a mata, e ent\u00e3o pede desculpa por mata-la, como se fosse uma decis\u00e3o errada matar a pessoa que causou toda essa dor e que fez de sua vida um inferno, al\u00e9m dele mesmo.\\n\\n\r\nOnoe Serika: Uma garota que n\u00e3o teve import\u00e2ncia na hist\u00f3ria at\u00e9 os \u00faltimos epis\u00f3dios, ela \u00e9 a pessoa que mata a irm\u00e3 mais nova de Takuru e tentou matar a irm\u00e3 do meio, com a justificativa de que foi tudo por ele, tudo por seu desejo, por que \u00e9 muito interessante matar a fam\u00edlia de quem vc ama e depois falar que foi tudo por vc e falar que sempre vai estar ao seu lado, que belo conceito de amor... um desejo idiota precisa de uma personagem idiota para realiza-lo. \\n\\n\r\nKurusu Nono: A irm\u00e3 do meio de Takuru, uma pessoa que decide morrer para tamb\u00e9m deixar as coisas mais interessantes para o desejo de Takuru n\u00e3o merece nem descri\u00e7\u00e3o melhor do que essa, e claro, decidiu isso ao inv\u00e9s de, talvez, MATAR A PESSOA QUE ASSASSINOU SUA IRM\u00c3.\\n\\n\r\nOutros personagens: Ningu\u00e9m liga, import\u00e2ncia zero.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1): \\n\r\nFoi doloroso, demorei 1 hora para assistir ao \u00faltimo epis\u00f3dio, assistir isso foi como ser torturado durante horas e horas.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2): \\n\r\nExatamente o que eu esperava, um lixo, n\u00e3o perca seu tempo com isso, nunca.",

            "content": "Here is an example of how a prequel could ruin a new addition to a series. For all of those who watched Chaos;Head before this one you surely understand what i mean.\r\nThe only mistake this anime made was being a sequel. However, that doesn't really matter since it's not related to Chaos;Head except in order of events. From my point of view, Chaos;Head was like the introduction or trial version before creating this anime. (No I'm serious and a proof of that is the recap at the beginning of Chaos;Child where the entire season of Chaos;Head was wrapped in 20 minutes. That was not asummary that was essentially the entire season in 20 minutes!).\\n\\n\r\nOkay now that it's clear how unrelated this season is to the last one let's me explain what this one has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT! (No not what you're thinking of) I mean real plot with twists at every single corner. Just as you think you got the idea of the anime you get hit with a plot twist that changes everything then another one afterwards and so on.\\n\\n\r\nWait, but plot twists aren't enough to make an anime all that different,no? Yep, you're absolutely right. We've got better art style now. Although I guess that's to be expected since the last season was about 10 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so we got plot and art anything else? Yeah, character development as well. Chaos;Head MC character,Takumi, Was basically GAME-> HALLUCINATE -> SCREAM -> BLAME RIMI FOR IT. However our new refurbished MC, Takuru, Is an active detective-like person. He's not that much different than your typical protagonist but in comparison to Takumi he's much more suitable as a MC.\\n\\n\r\nYou keep on criticizing Chaos;Head all the time why did you even get into the series, dude? Psychological that is! Away with your mainstream! True that Chaos;Head wasn't my cup of tea but all the Sci-Fi candy in it encouraged me to continue with it. However, after Chaos;Child being published and since it offers almost the same amount of Sci-Fi material I thought of letting whoever wanted to continue through with Chaos;Head just for the Sci-Fi or psychological as I did. DON'T! You've got a better option now that is Chaos;Child.",

We picked this anime in hopes that...it would provide entertainment, but honestly...I'm disappointed. \r\nThis anime feels incredible rushed. It starts out with the plot of murder mystery, and while it \"technically\" keeps that storyline...it's as if the writers/directors threw in a bunch of convenient excuses to make things stretch out to appease the ending. It had a lot of potential, giving me the type of feelthat the anime \"Another\" did. The murders were gruesome as hell and immediately hooked you in. Then...it just kinda fell off. They introduced a weapon-mechanic to the anime with no explanation, got rid of a main character by the 8th episode and she was never seen again...EVEN THOUGH she had a huge part in the anime...man, I don't know..there's a serious lack of explanation during several parts of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI want to like the anime, I really do. But it just fell short. If you're looking for a murder-mystery anime...Another would be the way to go. By the 6th episode of Chaos Child, I had a hunch that I was going to be disappointed by the ending, and I was. \\n\\n\r\nI have a feeling that if you've seen Chaos Head, things might make more sense...but it gave you the sensation that it could be a 'stand-alone' anime. They even provided their first episode as a break-down of Chaos Head, but yeah. Weird. Watch at your own risk.",

This rating will be based solely on my bias, and this review will be unstructured.\r\nUp to ep 8, how's ;Child been doing, you ask? Well, in order to answer that. Let's start from the beginning of the show, I mean, before it. Remember the 'Chaos;Head' episode, more known as Chaos;Child ep 0? Sorry but without prior knowledge of Chaos;Head it was just hard to grasp even the easy-to-get parts in that cram session (of course I know Chaos;Head's ending is different from this alternative version).Now, this sequel, being the aftermath of the C;H's male lead's alternative decision, tries to make a lot more things a lot crazier and even a lot more than a lot of that. That's definitely a lot, isn't it? Now if you paid attention to what I just said, it didn't make them a lot crazier.... but rather.. it tried to. Lucky for it, it wasn't all for nothing. Now, let's go back to the question, \"Up to ep 8, how's ;Child been doing?\". It's has been doing very good! At first, it may seem like all WTF in the head but try not to bother making sense out of a lot of stuff too much since the confusions are intentional. By the time you get to ep 7, you'll thank yourself for not giving up on this one. And oh, that's not all!!!! Watch ep 8!!!! Don't let your attention span get you bored this early in the series, you won't regret it. The story is getting better (I mean, BETTER). Again, were you paying attention? I said \"better\", meaning that the story was already good to begin with, okay? The art is maintaining its quality. The sound is getting more important and related (relatable?), mainly because of the story. Speaking of the characters well, here's where you can find a lot of setbacks. I don't know how many episodes this is going to have but clearly the pacing is handicapping the development of most characters. This is significantly evident when something terrible happens to someone important. How about my enjoyment? Well, I'm afraid to say that my enjoyment came from the latest episodes since stuff from the previous eps is made logical sense by them. I understand that the main setback is the pace \u2014 one reason why this show is a highly potential hit-or-miss. Hi Steins;Gate and Neon Genesis Evangelion! Overall, my highly biased rating for now is 8. It could go lower or higher depending on the next episodes (and probably I'll re-watch this anytime before the series finishes).",

It's not easy to sum up an entire and long visual novel in so few episodes. \r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story is very fascinating, there are so many hidden things and mysteries that involves and trasmit great curiosity, it manages to hit the point of the entire opera. \r\nArt: 8\r\nIts graphic style is a little different from the original opera in my opinion, but still I think that is pretty enjoyable. Some scenes are really impressive.\r\nSound: 8\r\nThe music is good, but it's very hard tolisten during the anime. It's very atmospheric and dark but it can guarantee good moments in the situations. The opening and ending are pretty good, and some vocals work are made by Kanako Itou, awesome and talentuous voice singer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here ar poorly developed due to the number of episodes, someone of them is very lacking and it's not possible to understand or emphatize with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is slow in the start, like as the other works of its producers, but it slowly grows with the succession of the events. It gets emotional in most of the parts of it tries to do, and it does well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI think that the best way to enjoy this work is to play the related visual novel, and if you like the plot, the story, you will find all you need in this. There are so many things that are missing, and some events are changed, but in the end it's been very flowing and enjoyable till the end.",

            "content": "TL;DR - Watch the entirety of Science Adventure if you want to watch this.\r\nThis anime alone, in theory, is pretty awful, but, saying this anime is awful because it doesn't lead anywhere, make any sense, or have any purpose is like taking a random chapter out of a book, calling it it's own story, and then saying it's awful because it doesn't lead anywhere, make any sense, or have any purpose.\r\nFor those who don't know, this anime is basically the 4th season in a series of anime called Science Adventure, which is based off of the visual novels of the same name. The series isstill being released, but so far we have (in order): Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate, Robotics;Notes, Chaos;Child, and Steins;Gate 0 (still being aired). Ultimately, a huge theme in this anime series is mystery. We have really no idea where the plot is going, but each season definitely plays some part in the overall story. Chaos;Child just seems to have no actual point to it or any way of majorly affecting the entire plot, but that's what makes it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I enjoyed this anime so much is because it makes you want to figure out how it's all going to affect the world, from the characters of Steins;Gate to those of Robotics;Notes.\\n\\n\r\nMost people give Steins;Gate major praise, although most of those people are clueless to the fact that it is in fact the second season in the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, basically, if you are watching this series as a whole, this anime is amazing, but, if you are, for some reason, just watching this part of it alone, then don't waste your time, as it won't make any sense nor will it bring any satisfaction. As I stated before, watching this alone is like picking up a book, reading a random chapter, and then calling it good. No reason, point, satisfaction, seemingly interesting plot. No. Just a lackluster of mysteries to be discovered in further chapters.\\n\\n",

Having experienced the visual novel this is pretty much a fair review of this series, taking it into account both as a standalone series and as an adaptation.\r\nYou might be familiar with the phrase \"There is no Tsukihime anime\" which is pretty much used to describe the anime adaptation of Tsukihime and to make fun of how bad it was. It is pretty much a prime example of an adaptation gone wrong.\r\nTaking this into account the phrase \"There is no Chaos;Child anime\" should also exist (Same applies for Chaos;Head)\r\nSTORY: 5\r\nJust like with Chaos;Headthis anime butchers the storyline of its visual novel and even as a standalone anime it still isn't all that good. The plotline was just way too long for a 12 episodes anime and it pretty much skips any kind of character development, which results in plot twists being ruined and characters being mere stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever i can give the staff credit for at least trying to do something good unlike Chaos;Head's adaptation. It was faithful at the very least and was somewhat coherent for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are quite nice to look at. They pretty much have the same aesthetic as the visual novel. It isn't as good as Steins;Gate or Occultic;Nine in this aspect but it was pretty much fine and had some really nice moments.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting and sound effects were handled quite well but what reallly stands the most is the musical aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIts pretty much the same soundtrack for the visual novel but it doesn't really matter since that one is amazing. Takeshi Abo did a good job as always and its definitely his best score along with Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0.\\n\\n\r\nOnoken's part in the soundtrack isn't as good as Takeshi Abo's work but it still works to some effect.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 4\\n\\n\r\nLike i said before the anime avoided any kind of character development and ruined what made these characters so good. The characters are pretty much empty shells of their VN counterparts, which were actually fleshed out as the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6\\n\\n\r\nDespite all its flaws i actually enjoyed this anime and it was quite entertaining to watch. It adapted the game perfectly in some parts and managed to have the unsettling atmosphere of it. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : 5\\n\\n\r\nWhile this adaptation isn't really that bad it doesn't manage to make the source material justice. Hopefully it gets a remake in the same way Fate/Stay Night did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall just read the VN, which is actually translated and might get a PC release soon. Not only is it a great story but its also slightly better than Steins;Gate and its pretty much the best entry in the Science Adventure franchise so far.\\n",

            "content": "The story is fantastic. The intro song is great. The art is good. Most of the characters are decent; But the direction is absolutely HORRIBLE. It completely ruins everything!\r\nThe director gave the characters realistic reactions, but it just comes over as appaling and pathatic. They scream all the time and they do it in a unpleasant manner. The direction feels like a B-class horror movie, with tons of suspence and jumpscares. Furthermore they skip some parts of the story and expect you to just connect the dots, which in itself isn't a bad thing, but they also use it to hide the fact that theydidn't properly explain some things.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint about this anime is the main character. This anime was based on a visual novel so the anime studio had to create a main character themself and it was a disaster. The main character(takeru) is a weak/realistic human, but not in a good way. He always yells at people and is stressed out. That could be funny and amuzing like in Chaos;Head and eva, but in this case it is not, probably because of the tone he speaks with (he sounds pissed off, stressed out and annoying).\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing they've screwed up are the key scenes. There are some really cruel situations in this series, but the scenes where the're shown aren't properly directed. The director didn't consider the feelings off the viewers and you notice it really well. Instead off finding those scenes beatifull or sad you just feel angry and disgusted. It can easely traumatise you. The best anime to compare those scenes to is corpse party.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime by far is the story. The story is a mystery thriller with a few brilliant plottwist (which were actually pretty difficult to predict), but unfortunatly this anime isn't directed as a thriller at all and parts of the story are skipped which gives the story no impact.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like suspence horror films, you might like it. Also if you don't like corse party you wont like this anime either.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way this is a sequel to Chaos;Head, but there is no need to watch that before watching this. The two are nothing alike and I like Chaos;Head better.",

            "content": "The show needed two seasons. I'm not even judging it based on its source material.\r\nIt's like they had a bullet-point list of what needed to be adapted, and checked each item off as they went. It's like a summary, a Wikipedia page put into TV. The story is told, but that's about it. None of the characters are well developed or developed at all, and the plot just moves along. \r\nAbout halfway through I forgot everyone's names, which I felt awful about because in several touching scenes, I would be wiping away a tear while in my head I'm like \"B-but who was this person?\"But can you blame me? Everyone seemingly existed as plot devices save for the main character, Takuru and another one, can't mention due to spoilers. Even then, they're very clearly only there so the plot moves, there's no attempt at making them seem \"real\" or possibly relatable, so their faces just blended in. Even those who are given a lot of screen time and conversations, feels like I barely know 'em.\\n\\n\r\nFurthering my complaints about the story is how jumpy things started to be. Often I would start a new episode and wonder if I skipped something. Again, a clear indication of rushed adaptation and desperately needing a second season. There are awesome moments and scenes, but a majority of them are plot dump moments, or just exist because that was on the bullet point list, meaning the scene is done and that's it, with no lasting impression. This really hurts some poignant scenes because there's a distinct lack of finesse to them. It makes you emotional but at the same time go \"what? But why, again?\" Again there are amazing scenes towards the end, and they bring up this show massively, especially the music, which fits every moment to a T. \\n\\n\r\nEven after all of that, it's enjoyable, because the plot, as summary-ish as it is, is thrilling, the mystery is, well, mysterious, and the small moments of brilliance brings everything together at times. It's just that it's too rushed to truly immerse yourself, the true sin of every Sci;ADV adaptation that's not Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown of Ratings:\\n\r\nStory- 7: Plot is enjoyable and told, but it's like a summary of events that had a checklist of things to adapt, and they simply marked each bullet point off as they went. Moments of brilliance bring it up towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 7: Looks good enough, very clearly budget constrained with some stiff movements, but it's adequate. Poignant scenes, especially the delusions are insanely good though, and subtle show-not-tell moments are done well.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9: It's a Sci;ADV series. The music is stunningly good, the sound effects are appropriate. Really enhances the mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 6: Everyone is too damn underdeveloped and rushed for you to really care for, save for the one character at the end and whoever dies, but it's purely for emotional shock. Everyone is a plot device.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 7: It's still a good thriller, as summary-ish as the plot is told. Gripping moments brought down by per-episode disconnect and names that don't stick.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 7: It's a good show to watch, but not to revel in, immerse yourself in, gush about, or to remember down the line. You don't really remember that Wikipedia article you scanned over for info, so it's the same deal here.",

The ending was just.. wow. You may have to research some stuff at the end on your own, as the anime doesn't give you much of a lift off point at the end. I'm sad it's ended and may not come back.\r\nDisliked: I did not dislike much to be honest, the only thing i hope they had expanded upon more is his reasoning and thought processes at the end, or just the story at the end. They should've made an episode13, explaining the situation afterwards. Perhaps how *she* felt or if *she* remembered any of the previous selves past, perhaps how they acted around each other, as-well as the events taking place immediately afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly hope for another season, i had a ship ready to sail, as well as my emotional investment now implemented in this story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n10/10 in my opinion.",

Chaos;Child does everything that Chaos;Head could not. The art is good, the characters are much more interesting and detailed, and there are much better plot devices which were just not present in Chaos;Head. As someone who has not watched Chaos;Head, I  still find Chaos;Child pretty easy to follow with.\r\nIt contains aspectsof Sci-Fi and Psychological Horror.

If you\u2019re a normal person, who doesn\u2019t like edgelord/shock value shlock, then stay far away from this series. This is the worst representation of visual novels ever, for those who think that visual novels are all over-the-top gross-out fiestas with porn, i.e. Saya no Uta, then this series just reaffirms that bias. \r\n\t\u2022 I don\u2019t like negative representations of visual novels, most are bad, but sometimes they can be accurate representationsof what it\u2019s like to be stuck inside of your own head. If you like this series, you may enjoy the visual novel Sweet Pool. Wait, no, don\u2019t play that! Ch\u00e4oS;Child feels smashed together and hard to follow, probably because they took the gameplay of the visual novel and tried to abridge it as much as possible. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There\u2019s far too many characters to keep up with and too many plot points that are injected into its vein.I had to constantly remind myself of all of the plot points and logic that the show explained\u30fcwhen going into each episode. Or else, I was just baffled and confused as to what was going on. The twist at the end, the climax, is probably the only interesting part of the show, but that also seems weirdly contrived.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Ch\u00e4oS;Child is yet another example of a show that has some good ideas, but over-saturates itself with everything that SOUNDS cool, leaving viewers like me, who didn\u2019t play the visual novel in somnambular confusion while there\u2019s a heap of bile climbing up our throats. Oh, look, there\u2019s a pretty twin-tail girl! Since she\u2019s from a porn game, let\u2019s have the most graphic scene of her pissing herself ever!\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The \u201cmovie\u201d, if that\u2019s what you want to call it. Is equally as confusing, more laughable, and has barely any semblance of a budget to stand on. Ch\u00e4oS;Child is a low peg in the Scientific semi-colon series, but that\u2019s not really saying much. BUT Steins;Gate is really only the okay one, so far, and the anime lags where the visual novel succeeds.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I have the Steins;Gate visual novel to thank for the many lucid dreams I\u2019ve had about time travel. But back to Torture Porn: The Animated Series. I give the film a 2/10 and the series a 3/10.",

I watched these two series after learning they are in the Steins;Gate universe, and I watched them fully expecting them to be terrible.  Ultimately, I was blown away by Chaos;Child.\r\nChaos;Child is one of the smarter psychological thrillers out there.  It has a likable cast of characters, a disturbing mystery, and a well-conceived resolution.  It fundamentally improves on the anime Chaos;Head in almost every way (except maybe being a little more narratively straightforward).  If I had to compare the tone to anything, I would probably compare it to Persona 3.  WhileChaos;Head was a little bit of a slog to push through, Chaos;Child often ended in cliffhangers or twists that kept making me want to watch 'just one more episode'.\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend giving this show a chance and being open-minded.  There is one fatal flaw with the show, and that is that it is best watched after Chaos;Head, which isn't the most enjoyable series.  There is also a Chaos;Child Episode 0 that summarizes Chaos;Head, but I think it cuts too much out, unless you tried Chaos;Head and really couldn't tough it out.  Chaos;Head is not a 'bad' show, but it is a slog, and I wrote a review on it if you want my take on that too.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, one last thing to note.  I've heard Chaos;Child has an amazing Visual Novel.  I have not played it, so I am viewing this anime in a vacuum and not comparing it to its source material.  I know adaptations often suffer from not being able to live up to the original work.  I cannot comment on that with Chaos;Child.  I really enjoyed it for what it is.",

So overall I liked it a fair bit, it still wasn't amazingbut it was a damn good sequel.",

            "content": "*spoilers*\r\nIt seems incomplete. The character development leaves much to be desired and the story ends in a weird way. At the very least, it doesn't end in a common TV troupe. The premise is not as interesting as the first, the characters are kind of boring. It has a really wacky ending which is halfway between a bad end and inconclusive. I guess I will need to watch the sequel. Probably shouldn't have made the cutest character the arch villain though, that kind makes me dislike the show. It's kind of weird because it leaves you with an emptiness, the feeling that there was noconclusion and that the evil guys actually won even though they didn't. People don't un-die after all. The main character even gets fucked over at the end. Bit of an awkward story, very fucked up villain who takes \"obsessed\" to a new level, and is too cute to be a villain. Seriously.\\n\\n",
