            "content": "IRL relationships are sometimes exhausting. They require us to constantly give a good image of ourselves, although this is not always the case. At work, we must always do our job as best possible, to evolve in the company, to get satisfaction from our boss (and prevent him from getting angry with you), and of course our livelihood and to provide needs of our family. With friends, we strive to behave in the most appropriate way possible and relationships can sometimes seem rigid and distant. There are things that we don't allow ourselves to tell (being a NEET for example) because we are afraid toappear as a person too different, too weird, from the point of view of society.\\n\\n\r\nThus virtual relationships gain in importance. Since we don't know most people we meet on the net, it is easier to confess and to reveal our real thoughts.. We avoid a little more the \"politically correct\" and we express more sincerely. Not everyone does it but for many, online relationships are a way to escape the suffocation of everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nNet-juu no Susume tells the story of Morioka Moriko, a 30-year-old woman who self-proclaimed NEET. Very exhausted psychologically, she resigned because she couldn't stand her working conditions. (We notice that she was working until 11 pm) She decided to start a netoge titled \"Fruits de Mer\" which is a RPG-fantasy universe in which she'll meet many people. In the game, she plays with a male character named Hayashi. She meets Lily, a girl, , and gets closer and closer to her.\\n\r\nMeanwhile, IRL, Moriko accidentally meets Yuuta Sakurai. He is a young blond man (supposedly of foreign origin) who works in a trading company.\\n\\n\r\nWhat to say about those characters? Moriko is really a well-written character. She is a young woman who lacks self-confidence, is not cute in appearance since she never pays attention to her hair or clothes when she goes out to do her shopping. I was delighted to see an adult character not particularly beautiful for once. We don't have a cute otaku completely unrealistic but a character who seems much more human. In game, she is very funny to follow because she (= Hayashi) tells a lot of lies about her private life and also mentions that she is a man in real life. She will run later into some difficulties but I can't tell you all the details not to spoil your fun.\\n\\n\r\nSakurai Yuuta is a less attractive character than Moriko, less amusing. He is more normal because he adapted to his working conditions. He had a period of depression further to the death of his parents and has been living alone ever since. Online games have been a way to meet, chat with people. I mentioned that this character was blond because he was adopted by a Japanese family. Unfortunately, we had no more information and especially about the discrimination that Sakurai may have suffered as a child since it was different from other classmates/students to all appearances.\\n\\n\r\nFor secondary characters, they are mainly used to support our two main characters. They have no background or development that deserves more attention. They weren't irritating and that's enough. (In 10 episodes, it was not easy to develop all the characters)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Moriko-Sakurai relationship, it is very predictable. Who really doubted Lily's IRL identity? (Same for Kanba) Lily-Hayashi relationship develops gradually and parallel to that of Moriko and Sakurai. Subsequently, Sakurai will understand who is the user behind Hayashi through some events that I won't tell. (no spoil) The other predictable aspect is the fact that Moriko and Sakurai already knew each other in a previous game. At the time, Moriko was still working and Sakurai was going through a difficult period.\\n\r\nRegarding romance, it seems a little forced at times despite the insane interventions Koiwai interferes in the relationship Moriko-Sakurai. They sometimes look embarrassed but it's not excessive. Moriko and Sakurai are not very confident individuals so it makes sense to see them a bit hung-up. The scene when Sakurai finds Moriko (who was waiting for Koiwai for a date) was very powerful. Some dialogues seem a little empty and repetitive but overall it was very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThe net game is a RPG fantasy. You have quests to succeed, monsters to fight, a guild where you find your friends. Nothing really original and the universe is almost unexplored. Some people will surely complain but this is not the goal of this series. We understand this from episode 1. I'm glad we don't have the usual powerful, arrogant (and annoying) MC for once but characters who play normally, who can also lose, and prefer to spend a pleasant moment to forget their daily worries. (Warning, I never said they are mediocre players.)\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspects, the animation is not inferior to other shows, nothing really impressive, nothing bad either. The game and the real world stand out: colorful for the fantasy-RPG, dull for the real world. The chara-design is classic except for Moriko who has an original appearance in the first episodes at least. Bushy eyebrows, tousled hair, pajamas (or jogging) when she goes out to the supermarket. Completely natural! Honestly this character was great and probably one of my favorite characters of the year. It is not designed to play in the waifu game. The opening is excellent. Dynamic with a composition reminiscent of certain games. The ending is nice but not memorable either. As for the soundtrack, it is suitable for the series but I won't listen to regardless of the series. If you have some interesting titles, do not hesitate to tell me.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally this series was like a panacea. I watched the 9 episodes in one go without being bored once. Glad to see that we have adult characters and we come out of the traditional high school couple. Unlike many series released this year (I won't mention them), Net-juu no Susume addresses the issue of video games and its place in our daily life in a realistic and interesting way. You should try this series once, why not with family. (Christmas is coming)",

            "content": "Often There comes a show which we find ourselves enjoying more and more by the passing episode, But when asked, we find it difficult to describe in words,that  what is it that we actually like about it. It is something most of us experience and, it all just might feel weird , to like something without a reason.The same had happened with me while watching this anime,I am not really sure why, Maybe it was the characters, the story, the music, or rather the entire show itself, however, in the end, It doesn't  really matter, as long as one enjoys whatever they arewatching.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime, net juu no susume, starts off as a MMORPG parody, with some generic elements and run off the mill jokes, However, slowly the game theme starts to fade away, to a point where it seems like a side aspect , But in return, what we get to see later is a show, with one of the finest pace of story progression and character development we've seen in a while. The anime starts with a  \"person\", starting a new life,and not a one you would expect, but rather an Online one. She uses games, not as a means to escape reality, but rather to reject it, to a point where it fades away to almost nothing. However, the world around that her begins to change due to a string of coincidences, which you might call fate,that slowly  amalgamate both her online and offline lives together to a point, where both of them just seem unreal to her, and to a certain extend, to us too. \\n\\n\r\nNeet is a term which is gaining more an more popularity in anime, This is clearly evident in most of the recent anime we have been receiving. Of course, it is not a good idea to just sit around at home all day doing nothing,but secretly, its somthing that most of us desire to do, and this desire within us is what makes us relate to these people. The main character, Morioka san, is  also a neet, who has left her job in private sector and now dedicates her full time in playing RPGs and making new friends online. The interesting part is how she plays as a male character in the game, and some people despite knowing this, treats her as a normal person and not a freak, which comes to show the acceptance and etiquette of the internet. The show focuses on how she , by meeting new people, is able to come out of her shell and becomes a more social and active person in the society, which in other words means how she recovers from her neet behavior.\\n\\n\r\nNow, It has become quite common to see young high school characters in most anime,especially romance, who have no experience in life and behave like dimwits whose lives are  a tragedy. Net juu no susume offers a more   mature and sensible cast of characters whose approach to life and the events that happen, are more realistic and makes sense. We see the characters behave in realistic way and not like dimwits , and this is also a major appeal of the anime and also  reason for the smooth progression of the story. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like Morioka, sakurai is shown as a person with his own problems, despite having a job and friends, he is actually more similar to Morioka san than anyone else. Both are portrayed as MMO junkies who are fed up of their routine and escape off into a world of RPG to relieve themselves. Its also funny how both of them are more closer to one another , than they realize. And as the story progresses, They find that they are tied by a  string of fate. The other characters are also not cast aside and the have a pretty well developed personality to show and a good role to play. Characters like Koiwai, Kanbe have provided with a help to both parties in improving the relationship with the other. Honestly, I was also not a fan of Koiwai, because he is pushy and just a big jerk. But, still he was the major reason in bringing Morioka san close to sakurai, And the real reward is when you watch the last episode and realize how far they have reached from just being strangers, It still surprises me, or rather it shows the real power of online games, and how they are able to bring strangers more closer to each other than one can imagine \\n\\n\r\nIts actually these shows, which truly highlight the role played by good characters in an anime and which kind of impact they can have, even on a not so well written story line. The rate of development and character building has been really perfect since the fist episode. Through small encounter, to exchanging email , to going drinking,and finally just getting even more closer , The development being done is something which surprises me the most. Its all too fast and yet seems natural  . It truly shows how much we can achieve , in very amount little episodes.\\n\\n\r\n The MMORPG, as I alredy mentioned, is not exactly the main focus of the anime, especially for the later half,however it has also not been completely ignored. We can see some good parody elements just being thrown around casually, Like the Loot box episode. Also we should see that, It is the Game only which started it all and was a major portion of the story development at first. The MMORPG theme in total here, is used really well to be honest, it has not overshadowed the anime but is also not got overshadowed itself or we can say that it was simply used in the most appropriate way .\\n\\n\r\nThe art is something I usually don't talk about, as it is quite subjective in itself. From my point of view, The art is pleasant and simple with a good use of cooler color palette , which is pleasing to eyes. The music is very simple and elegant, More than the OP, i am a bigger fan of the ed. It closes up everything very well and is a good way to wrap up things, but Other than that , there is nothing special in the art and music part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The anime is surprisingly well made and it is much better than what u would expect it to be. It seemed to me as a very generic and simple show at first, but soon it exceeds my expectations and becomes a show which I would look forward to every friday. From the well developed characters to a good story line, almost everything about it is perfect which ,in my eyes, makes it worthy of the score i have given, And also Sakurai and Morioka san are one of the cutest pair you will ever see in anime. Its something everyone should experience at least once, because It will exceed your expectation, more than you would expect it to",

            "content": "Our society is made up of all sorts of people. The everyday working man, prodigies, movie icons, singing legends, book smarts, street thugs, leaders, professional gamers, ladies\u2019 man, creative innovators. You name it. There\u2019s always someone you\u2019ve met in today\u2019s society that you may be familiar with or completely contrasts who you are. There\u2019s one type of people that our society doesn\u2019t have a keen impression on though. That would be NEET. Know what it stands for? At its most generic definition, it\u2019s a person that is \u201cnot in education, employment, or training\u201d. The stereotype about \u201cgamers that stay in their mom\u2019s basement\u201d applies there.In a show like this, we get a first inside look at the life of a NEET and how their social life applies to their norms.\\n\\n\r\nJumping into this anime was actually quite easy. This is determined by the female protagonist, Moriko Morioka. She is what most people would define as a \u201cNEET\u201d. After quitting her job, Moriko decided to play an MMO called \u201cFruit de Mer\u201d in order to embrace the NEET lifestyle. I find this choice of the main character rather interesting as there\u2019s sort of gender swap with her role. Most people would imagine a nerdy male protagonist but instead, we have a single unmarried female character who isn\u2019t bad looking in the beauty department either. Some people may also feel relatable to Moriko because of her straightforward timid personality. As a show that examines the lifestyle of a NEET, Moriko fits perfectly for that role because she is socially awkward. In the meantime, Moriko also creates a character in the MMO world named \u201cHayashi\u201d. In contrast to her real life image, she makes Hayashi as a male knight character with a handsome look; in general, an antithesis of herself. As such, this anime sets up a lot of storytelling as her lifestyle blends between fiction and reality.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly to Moriko, there\u2019s also another character in the series that doesn\u2019t come far off when compared to her. His name is Yuta Sakurai. Compared to Moriko, Sakurai often has hard time talking with people in real life although he does maintain a decent job at his company. This is extremely similar to Moriko as both characters often fret over at what they should say or how others may judge them based on their words. In the MMO world, Sakurai adopts the character name \u201cLily\u201d. By storytelling elements, he plays a gender bender role as a female character in that fictional world and meets Hayashi. Lily also happens to be an attractive young female in-game and is sociable compared to Sakurai\u2019s real life image. Get the picture here? It basically designates both their characters being completely different between their real life and MMO character persona. However, I do find the character chemistry to be very well executed. From the MMO world, they manage to connect to a personal level and share quite a decent amount of memorable moments together. In fact, character chemistry is what I value this show the most. Through social commentary, character dialogues, and personality dynamics, Moriko and Sakurai stands out as a memorable pair. They aren\u2019t just similar but really bring out their honesty towards each other. It\u2019s like fate often has the two meet together through coincidences as they connect with their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this anime isn\u2019t just about them as the show also adds other characters to fulfill certain roles. A noticeable character is Homare Koiwai who has a very outgoing personality. In fact, he can be interpreted by some people as a ladies\u2019 man. Unlike either Moriko or Sakurai, Koiwai has little trouble speaking with others and often initiates a conversation. It shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to realize that he is a foil character for the both of them. There\u2019s also Kazuomi Fujimoto, a stereotypical college working student who also has an in-game MMO character. While I can\u2019t say his role is very dynamic in this show, he does make up an empty void for filling the shoe of the merchandise seller. You ever need some in-game items? He\u2019s your guy. \\n\\n\r\nEven as a show that explores a lot of social norms, this anime still fulfills a lot of MMO gimmicks and mechanics that gamers may be familiar with. The idea of character classes, customized gear, lootbox, dungeon conquering, world exploration, etc fits into their game world. However, don\u2019t mistake this anime as one about characters trapped in a world in order to defeat some demon overlord or survive. It\u2019s more of a series that satires the NEET lifestyle in a lighthearted way. In addition, the storytelling gives us insight about Moriko\u2019s life in small but vivid details. It shows how exactly she lives her lifestyle as you would picture as a NEET. The anime also gives some background storytelling about Moriko and Sakurai so it doesn\u2019t just rely on the present timeline to do all the talking and showing. On the other hand, I do find that there\u2019s some problem with the storytelling\u2019s pacing. This anime adapts from a web manga and only consists of 10 episodes. The majority of the first half establishes the characters and ideas while the latter half seems to focus more on Moriko and Sakurai\u2019s relationship. It often flirts with the idea of \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they become a couple\u201d. No, I\u2019m not just talking about an in-game romance relationship because that comes off as way too cheesy. Instead, it makes the viewers wonder if there\u2019s a future for them in a real relationship. This anime will test a viewers\u2019 patience as it slowly builds up more and more each episode. Some of them end in cliffhangers that can be a letdown. As such, I\u2019d recommend watching this as a marathon rather than on a week to week basis. \\n\\n\r\nOn the visual front, Net-juu no Susume isn\u2019t anything to write home about when it comes to raw quality. Signal. MD\u2019s track record consists of a small group of projects that people don\u2019t talk about often. To me, this was their first anime project that people may have taken more notice. The visual quality itself can also be questionable as everything looks very simple. If this anime was marketed as a game in our world, it would be an indie compared to AAA games that you\u2019d see from high budget studios. However, if you look past the quality, you may notice that the anime appeals to more than just quality itself. With its MMO elements, this show is a smart flick that uses its artwork to prove what it means to be a gamer. If you take a look at Moriko\u2019s home, she has everything set up from dual screens to high quality keyboard. In-game character designs, monsters, and items disguises the mediocre quality if you look carefully as it satires the gaming culture. Moriko\u2019s character design can also look appealing especially in later episodes when she gets a makeover. Character expressions also sell a good degree of humor especially with reactions to certain situations. To be honest, this anime will be viewed differently from every viewer but it possesses an innate ability to shine for what it has to offer despite the budget.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the soundtrack isn\u2019t memorable by any means but it\u2019s more of the characters\u2019 voice lines that do the work. Moriko\u2019s voice fits effectively for her role as both in-game and real life. Even when crossplaying, Hayashi still has some of her traits that can be easily recognized. The theme songs for the show speaks for themselves as it comes as colorfully decorated.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this anime, I can safely say that it exceeded my expectations. The first few episodes took me some time to accept but after realizing what it really had to offer, it changed my mind from a mediocre afterthought to a show that I looked forward to every week. However, I think it\u2019s preferably to watch this anime as a marathon as the storytelling can test the patience of the viewers at many times. The comedy can be a hit or a miss depending on what you\u2019re looking for. But for me, Net-juu no Susume turned out to be a dark horse that went beyond and over.\\n",

(Which would never happen in real life scenario cos there is no possibility of meeting) .\\n\\n\r\nYou know what's going to happen next in the story and you know that it is silly but still you would love watching it because the atmosphere in the anime makes you feel that way.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode might be boring but after 2nd and 3rd episode you start liking it and it keeps getting more and more interesting.There is no dragging which happens in most love stories (you would understand what I meant at the end of episode 8).\\n\\n\r\nIt did help bring few smiles and laughs as it exactly depicts how stupid we behave when we live in that virtual world or social networks, as we cant talk to the same person whom we met in social network properly if met face to face. It also makes sarcastic jokes about MMO gaming.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is Good, I mean since it represents about a game, obviously the characters are designed to be colorful and interesting.The Main character even though with her messy long hair is really cute and there is bit drawback in male characters of real life because most of them look almost same, just the hair color or spectacles vary lol.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOpening and Ending tracks are good and create a gaming feel scenario,\\n\r\nThe soundtracks aren't worth remembering, except for 1 or 2, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is the main important feature that makes this anime special, Character development Of the main character is good. I fell in love with the MC as her character is just like me who does clumsy things and speak in monosyllables when talking with opposite sex. Other characters aren't much developed( like other gamers)...We only come to know 3 people from the game outside...So it focuses mainly on the Two MC's and their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall :\\n\r\nI would say to watch this anime if you want to see someone like you existing in an anime world and laugh at yourself. It's a good time pass anime if you are bored of high school romance and bloody thrillers. \\n\\n\r\nMy advice before watching: \\n\r\nPlease don't start this anime with any expectations, Watch it with a free mind and at a time when you don't have anything to do.",

            "content": "I get it, Recovery of an MMO Junkie is cute and all, but is that really enough to overlook a piss-poor story writing, shallow characters, and mediocre visuals?\r\n[Story: 3/10] \r\nMoriko Morioka is a 30something business dropout who has chosen to become a self-proclaimed \"NEET\" and plays games all day instead of working. Why did she choose this life? She felt like it, despite being good at her job she opted to throw it away playing video games instead\u2026 Don\u2019t expect to understand what motivates the characters because their only reason for existing is to be cute.\r\nMoriko enters the MMO game and chooses to play asa male character, why? Because she wanted to. A potentially interesting start to the protagonist that goes right into the gutter because it's only used as an excuse to hide her true identity from her in-game friends, the first of many misunderstandings to fuel the lazy story. In the MMO world, she meets a kind girl named Lily, who has an air of mystery surrounding her. They grow close to each other quickly within the first episode, but keep their feelings on the down low because relationships are (for some reason) not allowed in the guild they\u2019re in. In real life, Moriko bumps into a man on the streets and they gradually become friends as time goes by with hints at a romance that could form. Their burgeoning relationship gave her a chance to stop being a NEET. Occasionally it\u2019s endearing to see them awkwardly try to talk to each other, but as they run through the same routine over and over I just wanted them to get on with it and skip the charade. However, the other half of me knew that the show would fall to pieces once there was no more misunderstanding to drag out. That\u2019s why MMO Junkie is so predictable, you know that they can\u2019t have the big reveal until the very end, lest they actually come up with an engaging plot to compel the audience for the rest of the runtime.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the more annoying contrivances the show dishes out:\\n\r\n1. Supporting characters who understand the misunderstanding between the two leads and willingly choose to confuse and misguide them, preventing them from discovering each other's true identities and also move the plot along.\\n\r\n2. In response to most awkward situations that would reveal either of the leads identities they say, \u201cI\u2019m too embarrassed to say I\u2019m a gamer/ I have a crush on that person / I am a woman but playing as a man.\u201d If only the characters were actually had the self-confidence to be called role models, I might consider it to be cute and pleasant, but they\u2019re not there to help you but to pander to you. Pure Junk food. \\n\r\n3. Phone Batteries. Why can\u2019t they just charge their damn phones??\\n\r\n4. \u201cWhat if they find out that I\u2019m a NEET?\u201d You aren\u2019t a damn NEET! Getting nervous around boys and being too lazy to go to work doesn\u2019t make you a NEET.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of these flaws is the wasted potential of the MMO counterpart to the real world, along with the supporting cast of Moriko's online friends who she's in a guild with (but they get no development whatsoever). Some of the engagement of watching MMO Junkie comes from trying to figure out which characters in the real world are players in the MMO world and seeing them work together in the game. However, the actual gameplay itself is almost never shown, most likely due to budget constraints. So we are forced to listen to the boring recounts of the gameplay, losing a connection with the characters in the process. Come on, even Sword Art Online got this right. Watching people play games without any reason to care is boring, but being told about people playing games is mind numbing.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 3/10]\\n\r\nThe fact that the characters are adults changes nothing, they all act just as stupid as the high schoolers in your average school harem anime. Their sole purpose is to perpetuate the frustratingly predictable plot about finding out who likes who. Each character in the show is added to the cast before they\u2019re introduced, the show just expects you to recognize what archetype they fall into and fill in the blanks yourself. The incredibly lazy characterization that only further alienates the audience. Starting with the main character; she tells us she is a neet who quit her job, why? Who knows, she omitted that part, and thus gave the audience no reason to get invested in her character other than being a lady with big boobs who likes video games and cute girls (namely the one who she latches onto in the game). \\n\\n\r\nThe characters could have just as easily been high schoolers, them being adults adds nothing to them. When I saw that they were in their 20s and 30s I thought we\u2019d get to see interesting dynamics of responsibilities that the main character would face being an adult neet. Disappointingly, the responsibilities of adulthood are mostly ignored and swept under the rug. Despite Moriko not having a job, she is able to pay rent, living expenses, and her MMO subscription. 90% of the issues the characters face could be fixed if they simply communicated with each other and solved their problems like the adults that they are. However, it would be too much to ask for characters who have actual common sense, wouldn't it?\\n\\n\r\nMy least favorite character by a mile was Koiwai. Even as just a supporting cast member he stands out as being particularly unsettling and he totally defuses any potential comedy in the scenes he's present in. What makes him so unbearable is how creepy he acts, in one episode he takes a picture of Moriko while she's sleeping then texts it to Sakurai and to top it off, Koiwai makes a rape joke. Yes, it was a rape joke. Even if it was meant as some sort of off-beat joke, it put me off from his character entirely. I was constantly wondering why he even hangs around the kind and innocent lead characters while he is so malicious. I'm honestly shocked that more people haven't mentioned how grotesque he is as a character. The worst part about him is that the creators of the show acknowledge him as a good person and build him up to be this great guy through Moriko commenting on his \"kindness,\" truly sickening. \\n\\n\r\nThis sadly isn't too surprising of a (dark) turn for MMO Junkie considering the director, Kazuyoshi Yaginuma, is openly a neo-nazi and promotes anti-semitism. I wouldn't recommend this show before knowing about the Yaginuma's appalling beliefs. But knowing who had their filthy hands on this show makes it flat out impossible to recommend. \\n\\n\r\n[Art: 4/10] \\n\r\nI could understand if they intended for the scenes in real life to look bland, but the scenes in the game world are just as flat which leads me to believe that this show just didn't have the budget to handle a project like this. I\u2019ve never heard of the studio that made this show, Signal. MD, and that\u2019s probably a blessing considering how low in quality the show is.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound 5/10]\\n\r\nThe op and ed are catchy but become grating over time, not something I would listen to individually. Another place affected by the low budget is the music, I expected it to be mediocre and I wasn't disappointed. Don't go into it expecting anything great, just your bog standard repetitive romcom-ish soundtrack that adds very little to the show. To spice it up a bit the show would use the MMO specific music in the real world to symbolize how Moriko was taking on life as if it was an in-game challenge, which was a good creative choice, but it me think of how they're just running out of music.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 5/10]\\n\r\nI almost never found the jokes to be funny, they try way too hard to be relatable and often feel redundant in an oversaturated genre. The \"comedy\" is just a constant stream of Moriko shouting in her head \"Ahhg!! I'm so embarrassed for x-reason!!\" over and over. She can't face life head on like an adult and instead tortures herself (and the audience) by constantly complaining about small issues that make her seem petty. If you think finding out which character in the real world is a player in the MMO could be exciting then look elsewhere, it is very obvious who is who. Like the derivative rom-com of last season \u201cGamers,\u201d this show is full of head shaking contrivances to keep characters from figuring out who is who. At least Gamers made the effort to include commentary on video games. This show didn\u2019t even bother to go beyond \u201cI can make man character but I am a woman teehee.\u201d \\n\r\nGod forbid the audience actually have to think at all while watching a show about adults. \\n\\n\r\nAll that MMO Junkie offers in the way of meaningful commentary (if you can even call it that) is characters mentioning from time to time, \"I bought my gear in a loot box~!\" It shows that the characters like to spend lots of money on the game, but damn, it's so unself-aware for a show about video games to actually embrace microtransactions rather than criticize them, especially with Battlefront II and other offenders only recently releasing to overwhelming audience outcry.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score 4/10]\\n\r\nDespite being only 10 episodes long it overstays its welcome, becoming incredibly repetitive and predictable as it desperately claws at the audience screaming out \u201cTELL ME IM CUTE!!\u201d And it made no effort to hide its intentions. \\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t care if she finds out who he is in the game or not. \\n\r\nI didn\u2019t care if he confesses to her or not.  \\n\r\nI just wanted it to be over. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I expected too much from it, but forgive me for hoping for a mature romance from a show about adults. If you can overlook the lackluster plotting, poorly realized game world, and shallow characters then perhaps you may find some enjoyment in the cloyingly saccharine non-romance. Otherwise, I\u2019d say Recovery of an MMO Junkie is best left forgotten.",

            "content": "(Possible minor spoilers ahead, if you haven't seen the first ep you have been warned)\r\n To start off, this show title doesn't give a very good description of what the actual content entails, \u201cRecovery of an MMO Junkie\u201c would make many think (well at least what I thought) a show entailing possible game rich functions, ideas and the such. Unfortuantly though it has more come across as more a pre-tense for the show and it revolves around a RomCom based structure, if you liked \u201cKiss Him, Not Me \u201d there's a good chance you'll like this show, they show many similar things and the comedyaspect is roughly the same.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\n MC meet MC2 out of random thing, they for some reason click, they have some comedic events and some down spells, standard structure for a RomCom, but what adds from that? So far nothing. Besides ye ol gender bender trick its pretty straight forward.\\n\r\n5 outta 10 you say? Man that doesn't sound that high, and no it doesn't but that's mainly because of my own pet peeves I might add. The show points out the MC is a previous MMO nut, and claims to be an \u201celite NEET\u201d, from there the MC proceeds to need constant assistance on basic MMO structures and proceedings, doesn't sound super \u201celite MMO nut\u201d to me. \\n\r\nMC runs into someone who wants to help from seeing them fail too often, this screams Deus ex machina, but its needed for the plot to progress, which is kinda annoying to swallow but it will be allowed. From here its just happy go lucky RomCom standard, you know whats going to happen, you know how its gunna turn out, there's not a lotta variety going on. For the comedy aspect, id say your usual troupes are had, the embarrassment to get a couple giggles, but I only really felt anything in one or two scenes over 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\n The characters are there, and they each have their own feel about them, but it's more a each has their \u201cthing\u201d than each having different personality's, It has a very RomCom feel setup which is a given, MC1 is nervous about everyone and talking about things making them bashful/embarrassed when doing anything. MC2 just playing the tough card but inside they too act the same. MC3 is like MC2 but plays the envy card, and finally MC4 for the laughs, more confused to how there was a lacking of the tsundere card, gets a thumbs for that atleast. \\n\\n\r\nSound: ?/10\\n\r\n Wouldn't be able to give you a rating for sound, because I haven't really noticed it, besides the opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\n Flat art style is very generic, in game looks like every other show on the market, and when this is 90% of the show representation kinda doesn't help out. A lot of the time spent is still background shots and talking phases in basic settings (A tree, a blue brick castle, a fountain) Not a lot going on, nor does it really stick out as creative or interesting. Outside of the game MC art style is a little more creative which gives some nice flair but not enough to out weigh the previous problem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\n It's not bad bad, but its got a ways of being good, if I hadn't have seen \u201cKiss Him, Not Me\u201d I probably would have thought more of it, but it feels very similar in design THUS far, it could change in one episode and become a 9 you never know.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR\\n\r\n If you like RomComs, give it a go you may like it, but don't start this show if you are thinking it will have a decent gaming environment aspect. Seems very generic based with some tweaking, this is my opinion and you might like it, as they say each to their own, I will watch it through till the end but so far its seeming like shows I've already seen.",

            "content": "Net-juu no susume is a wonderfully crafted romance. The series' ambitions are not immediately apparent, as the story opens with a very generic MMO-registration sequence. It would be easy to write Net-juu off as just another typical virtual/alternative reality anime that fails to establish a personality and a mission statement in the first crucial minutes. After the first episode you're most likely wondering which direction the story is heading, as there is nothing inherently interesting about the game world or its mechanics. \r\nThe real point of interest is, of course, the characters. The online guild friends our MC encounters are charming, as are their realworld personas. Everything about the characters and their interactions is so pleasant and likable that you can't help falling in love with them. This wouldn't work if there were no struggles, of course. Net-juu tackles real, working world issues. The way humans use games to alleviate stress and escape human problems is a central motif.\\n\\n\r\nNet-juu puts multiplayer games into an interesting light. It doesn't deny their addictive and harmful properties, but it doesn't try to paint them as evil either. Even though the characters of this anime have different backgrounds and spend varying amounts of time in their game, all of them have a deep appreciation for the experiences and connections it has allowed them to make.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual production has a raw feeling to it, which somehow seems to elevate the romantic feelings it spurs inside me (Net-juu is similar to RE:life also in this regard). The soundtrack is similarly low-key, although both the OP and ED make a very strong mark with music and visuals that work in a perfect harmony.\\n\\n\r\nNet-juu is is worth checking out even if romance isn't your go-to genre. It's filled with love, and has one of the most charming main characters I have ever had the pleasure to watch.",

            "content": "Story: Average\r\nBeing predictable isn't a shortcoming, but being predictable without any charm is.\r\nWe know right from the start what is the goal of the series and we are there just to lay down and enjoy the ride, and I sure didn't. \r\nMost of the reason for that comes from the characters, but the plot is also at fault. If you make your end goal known to the public at least make your journey until there fun. \r\nI mean, I'm pretty sure that I have watched this already. Isn't this just a mixture of ReLIFE, NetoYome, and Gamers! ? \r\n- Romance involving two main adult characterswhile having some sort of \"rehabilitation\". \u2714\\n\r\n- Having characters that know each other in a game meeting irl. \u2714\\n\r\n- A bunch of misunderstandings or slow progression that could have been easily solved if they talked with each other. \u2714\\n\\n\r\nSound/Art: Fine/Bad\\n\\n\r\nI don't have much to say, I found the music a bit above average while the art being somewhat bad. It's more or less consistent, but I don't think that it has any appeal. Backgrounds and characters designs are really generic and I don't have any memorable moment where I thought that the show looked good. On the other hand, I have several memories where it was meant to look good, but it wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Very Bad\\n\\n\r\nSo, let me see if I got this right. For a change instead of high school age characters we have adults, but instead of making any good use of that we just use them as if they were still high school age characters. \\n\r\nYes, we have this huge superficial difference while everything else that really matters is the same as any other anime out there. \\n\r\nThis story could easily have been made without them being adults while having almost no differences, just changing some events to something similar or changing them to something different while getting a similar purpose/intent. \\n\r\nI just feel like it was a waste on that part.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, they are not even the only characters, we have more which we know absolutely nothing about and were always there. I guess that we shouldn't expect much since not even the main characters were that well developed. We known about Sakurai's past and we kinda know about Morioka's. But it's in a superficial manner. Sakurai only has that going for him because it was needed. Otherwise, he could not share a bound with Morioka, and the exact same thing with the MC. A superficial plot point for them to have some sort of connection while making it \"so beautiful\", otherwise they would have 0 reasons to want to get to know one another. Especially taking in considerating both their personalities, especially Morioka's. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Average\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I made this series seem worse than it is. I honestly just found it average. I ended up focusing on the bad points of the series since most of the reviews are positive with some high scores and I wanted to give some \"balance\" to it since I really don't think that this series was as good as people make it out to be.",

            "content": "The first half of Net-Juu no Susume, otherwise known as Recommendation of The Wonderful Virtual Life (Not Recovery of an MMO Junkie), was actually quite a joyous watch. Typically romance is a genre that lacks variety and intrigue. NJnS takes the additive route of just applying an MMO on top of the bland   cliche scenarios you'd normally find and, surprisingly, it creates some level of appeal.\r\nGloriously followed up by the characters, Morioka or \"MoriMori\", is a shut-in who quit her job to play MMOs all day everyday. Well, really it is to escape the real world that is filled with anxiety and depressionbut... y'know how it goes. Inside this MMO, she eventually meets the pink barfbag that is Lily and since Mori created a male character; the obvious conclusion is that Lily is also a man.\\n\\n\r\nBut keep in mind, predictability isn't always a bad thing. If anything, trying to work around keeping Lily's identity a secret for a given period of time likely would've complicated things and that is a common problem many other anime make. Anyways, Sakurai, who we can already guess is Lily, comes to an understanding that the situations happening with MoriMori in real life is awfully similar to the situations described by Hayashi, Mori's avatar in the MMO. In this scenario, anime has portrayed male characters very stupidly by just having them chalk it all up to sheer coincidence. Not Sakurai, he mans up and investigates what is going on, uncovering the identity behind Hayashi actually being Morioka! And that's really cool! I, very much, appreciated how intelligent and proactive Sakurai's character has been... Up until this point.\\n\\n\r\nBut post episode 4 it really falls downhill. A lot of slow dialogues of that do nothing for the show and even though Kowai seems to have read \"The Bro Code\" front and back, his attempts to set up Sakurai and Morioka together fails time and time again simply because Sakurai lost his pair and decides that he isn't going to go after Morioka because fuck logic. After all this, it is just a slow decline of pointless dialogue to pad the show's run time. Oh and the other characters really don't matter. It is mainly a story between Morioka and Sakurai with actual assistance by Kowai.\\n\\n\r\nI personally wouldn't recommend a virtual life. MMOs are a pain and gets boring very quickly with the repetitive gameplay and pointless dialogue; much like this anime.",

            "content": "Recovery of an MMO Junkie quickly became one of my favorites and I can say with full confidence that there has never been a romcom anime like it. There's nothing convoluted about the story, there are no gimmicks, and no long-lasting misunderstandings. These are stable adults, making responsible decisions, and fostering healthy relationships. The creators masterfully portray 30-year-olds feeling deep-seated, heart-racing, butterflies in your stomach romance. And it's a treat.\r\nMoriko Morioka is a self-certified NEET and Yuta Sakurai is a company man with a good heart; both have shared interests and a chance encounter that changes the course of their relationship. Unlike most heroines, Morikois extremely polite yet headstrong. She's at the age where she understands that if she compromises too much of herself to appease a potential partner's sensibilities, they will never be happy together. She loves herself and knows how society views her as a woman NEET. Yes, she cleans up well; however, she knows that if her partner can't stand her unkempt self\u2014her most comfortable self\u2014then she's better off without them. I appreciate that more than anyone can say because it's such a rare thing to see in anime, especially in a character who's a woman. It's a really important message, especially for young girls.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many things that lead to satisfying affirmations and the way conflicts get resolved is terrific. For example, Sakurai tries to retrace his steps in order to bump into Morioka again. Koiwai, Sakurai's friend, calls him out on his actions as stalkerish. He denies it at first but then realizes he's overstepping boundaries and stops\u2014and I love that! Not enough creators acknowledge a realistic problem with their characters and then confront it with such nuance. There's a great cast of supporting characters, many of whom are guild members (MMO clubs). They act as any good online friends would; they're always there for the main characters, they listen and give advice when asked, and they have fun together whether it's at the in-game pub or in a dungeon. This is neither here nor there but I also appreciate that gender isn't as huge an issue as other game-related anime make it seem. There's a gay couple who are lovable and affectionate and, at one point, Morioka developed a crush on another woman. It wasn't written to serve as some kind of shocking plot point or tokenism either; made my heart swell with joy.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is simple and the art style looks a little bit older than most anime nowadays but it's bearable. The coloring on the other hand is fantastic; whoever does the coloring is amazingly talented! The quality of the voice acting, the music and sound production, and the storytelling makes everything worth it. I especially appreciate that the anime doesn't rely on ridiculous tropes. Nobody goes out of their way to be horrifically sinister and all of the characters are incredibly supportive of each other. There are many relatable things that happen that many adults can relate to. Recovery of an MMO Junkie is one for the ages and, if you enjoy a heartwarming slice of life-romcom or if you enjoy video games, I implore you to give this a try. Knowledge of MMORPG's help but isn't necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is perfect, especially for gamers who love slice of life-romcoms. I'm surprised it took this long for producers to utilize online gaming and pair it with the genres when there are hundreds of millions of players who also watch anime. There is so much potential to create something for gamers to relate to and it's great to illustrate that healthy, longlasting bonds between players is possible. Recovery of an MMO Junkie portrays that well. It wrapped up neatly and left me wanting more; there's an 11th episode OVA and 2 shorts set to release. After this, hopefully this anime inspires other producers to create more stories like it. Please, give it a try and support them by watching on Crunchyroll!",

            "content": "After many years of stressful and unfulfilling work, Moriko decided to quit her job and is now a NEET playing a MMO game, what awaits her (and us, the viewers) is a fantastic experience totally worth watching.\r\nNet-juu no Susume is in my opinion one of the most solid executions of the romance genre and a very interesting take of the game one. The ingame world is well developed and has a good number of scenes that really showed the feelings that provide playing this type of games, like trying out clothes and how they looked depending on the character, the \u201cwtf dude\u201d moment when someonequits during a raid boss without warning, or just the endless talks with the other people in the anonymity that the Internet provides, and even more in this case since our protagonist is using a male character and interacts with the others from that point of view. These scenes are also very funny since the reactions of the characters to what happens ingame are quite priceless.\\n\\n\r\nWhile quitting her job gave her a breath of fresh air, that still affected Moriko, who is quite self-depreciating and feels disappointed for things like how she doesn't take as much care of herself as before or just going to a shop to buy random things to eat while passing the day playing the game. While the series doesn't make it overly dramatic, one can see that even if she has a lot of fun playing, that lifestyle still affects her. Thankfully, things start to change once she bumps into an employee from a trading company.\\n\\n\r\nThe mix of the gaming parts with the in real life scenes also includes the romance element of the series, that is well executed and smoothly paced thanks to Sakurai, our male protagonist, and his friend and co-worker Koiwai, these two characters soon enter Moriko's life and their interactions both between them and with her are fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nSakurai needs a special mention for how much he deserves a medal for his awareness of the situation. If you have been watching anime for a while, I'm sure that you have experienced the frustration of a character being overly dense, which can be pretty funny in comedic settings depending on the viewer but very infuriating in some other cases, don't worry for that in this anime because he will not disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does a good job in the artistic and musical parts without standing out, the reactions of the characters are well done and funny, while the music sets well the tone of each scene, including the always necessary fantasy tone for the ingame scenes in that type of setting. The opening, Saturday Night Question, provides a nice song with visuals that show pretty well the difference in feelings between the ingame and real life parts of our protagonist, while the ending theme, Hikari, Hikari, shows us various reactions of the characters from the other side of the screen they are interacting to, very neat idea.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Net-juu no Susume gave us a nice story, creating an interesting ingame world that interacts with the reality of our lovable cast and how they develop over the course of the story. I really recommend to give it a try!\\n\\n",

I am gonna be short and on point with this review.\r\nThe story follows our main female character(30 years old) after she quits her job and decides to relieve her stress by playing a MMO game.  Those who are familiar with the MMO games will like this genre and get easy attached to the story, characters and plot . The main focus is not the game itself if you wonder but the characters and how they influence each others daily lives  after interacting with each other in the game. A little romance andcomedy is added  to increase the enjoyment . You will wanna watch episode after episode out of curiousity for  what will  happen next.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters strong points are how natural they behave in each situation and don't lose their personality traits across the show. The funny moments between them and their akward face reactions behind the screen will give you a good laugh.Our main heroine changes and manages to overcome her own problems with each encounter during her journey in the game.What i didn't liked as many of you will notice after watching this anime are some side characters who didn't get enough attention despite the fact that they were quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a relaxing and enjoyable 10 episode anime that you will not regret wasting your time watching and it also portrays a glimpse of how most people social  interact  in our nowadays society.\\n\\n",

If there is such a thing as a polar opposite of a power fantasy, it would be this show in how its mere existence demonstrates there is a demographic of people who want to see helpless protagonists win at life because of their uselessness. (The show not-so-subtly suggests that if you choose to quit your job and do nothing with your life except sit around in a virtual fantasy, then all your dreams will come true and you'll even meet the man or woman of your dreams!)\r\nCynicism aside, I loved this show. Most of thestory's best moments center around secret identities and the fear of being discovered. At this point everyone has a hobby they're not particularly keen on advertising to the world, so it's easy to identify with the main characters. Romance junkies will probably get a huge kick out of this show but will be disappointed in how short it is. The upside to that however is that the pacing is good and there's no filler.",

            "content": "Think of this as a simplified-SAO with the no-nonsense typical romance \"coincidence\" anime. An impressive feat for Signal.MD and a sleeper hit alongside the ongoing Houseki no Kuni in this fall season (and the Tsuki ga Kirei MAL scoring effect plays here too).\r\nGoing through the short 10 episode series makes me feel like this show isn't best at its storytelling, but it makes up for it through the \"coincidental\" character development and endless comical rom-com that has fans like us welcome and finding it enjoyable from an unknown starting to a short but fulfilling ending.\r\nSo the main characters, the 30 year old NEET Morika Moriokaand the casual but shy Sakurai Yuuta, at times they aren't as close to knowing each other's feelings, but through Fruits de Mer (their MMO equivalent to knowing more of each other online), they unknowingly expose more of their behaviour through their online guild, and from start to end. Even with best wingman Homare Koiwai (Sakurai's partner in crime, which was lucky that I thought his intent to steal Morimori away was the ONLY link between both Sakurai and Morioka, encouraged the former more to reach out to her), all the characters, each with their own motives, work for the best for their partners or each other.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, the storytelling isn't the flare of the show, but the character development ups the notch for what this show became to be towards the end. The art and animation direction might look basic and it isn't great to begin with, but it humbly gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as always, the OST is a delight to listen to. The OP, ED and the gaming-BGM are some of the best for the Fall 2017 season, and for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum this short but impressive anime IMO, the Fall 2017 season has some good shows, and this is one that stands out for the progressive aspect. As summed up during the preliminary season, a lot of people will only take notice at the midpoint of the show after hearing the \"progressive, or better yet\" praises of the show. If you love rom-coms without the nonsense that you've been watching for a lot of typical romance shows that do otherwise, give this one a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised at what it can deliver, and is comical and \"coincidental\" rom-com at it's funniest and finest.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review might contain spoilers on the anime \"Net-juu no Susume\". Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don't understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.\r\nNet-juu no Susume: A well-cared anime that fulfilled what it promised\r\nAfter watching the 10 episodes of Net-juu no Susume I can not help feeling that the anime lasted very little. However, now it's time to share my impressions.\r\nI mentioned in my first impressions that what difference does it make in a series that the protagonists are not the usual sappy teenagers. And I do not say this because of the factthat they are young, but because of the way in which Japanese authors are currently representing them.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nTherefore, an anime that is not \"Isekai\", where the protagonist is not a prince, where there is no harem, where romance is handled without falling into teasing; and above all, where there is no fanservice, it does not stop being a very pleasant surprise these days.\\n\\n\r\nI must admit that the premise gave me some fear because I thought they would take advantage of both being otaku gamers to use all the aforementioned clich\u00e9s. However, I loved that they handled the two characters very realistically, even at the cost of constantly evading falling into the predetermined formulas of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget that it is a romantic comedy with touches of fantasy, so clich\u00e9s to follow are in heaps. However, every time it seemed that the series would fall into one, suddenly a rudder was given and the course recovered. I'll give some examples later, so let's start the analysis.\\n\\n\r\nThe argument was interesting, although as I said, I had things to be cautious about. A thirty-something woman who by her own becomes a NiNi elite (considering that she has enough money, earned by herself, to maintain that lifestyle), gave rise to many things, good and bad.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the series chose an appropriate approach considering the age of the characters. It is true that the protagonists did not have normal social skills, but at least they were mature enough to deal with it looking to improve. In fact, in the end the series was just about that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here I go to the next point, the script was handled very well to create a good development of both the story and the characters. In fact, I was pleased that they were not afraid to use the whole MMORPG issue as an accessory; to the point that in the final episodes hardly appears.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a risky move considering that most of the current anime looks for the opposite, highlighting its fantasy / videogame elements as much as possible. However, in the case of Net-juu no Susume, this decision proved to be totally correct because it was possible to maintain an adequate rhythm for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the issue of the game was necessary because it served as a motor and link between the two protagonists; not to mention that almost from the start it was left to glimpse that both had previously coincided in another MMORPG. However, by evading the clich\u00e9s that were presented, the logical result was that the game should lose prominence in favor of reality.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do I mean? Let's not forget that part of the plot was that both played with characters of the opposite sex; so it was very easy to fall into the formula of keeping this as the great secret and reveal it in the end, if at all. However, instead, it was decided to handle it realistically by having this discovered relatively quickly.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there was the other huge secret, the matter of which both had already played together another MMORPG. This is a classic clich\u00e9 of the romantic series. The protagonists who have known each other for a long time, even coming to fall in love, but who \"miraculously\", when they rediscover themselves, do not remember each other.\\n\\n\r\nIn Net-juu no Susume this was more credible because Moriko and Yuta never saw each other in real life at that time. However, and paradoxically, soon circumstances forced Morioka to have to create an account using a female character; and for the speed and pressure she decided to use the avatar of her previous game. In addition, Sakurai saw that avatar in the act and noticed that it was very similar to that game.\\n\\n\r\nThere were many clich\u00e9s that were broken in all that sequence and obviously, then simply followed the natural flow of events. All this made me loved the script, to the point of considering it the best of the year. Whenever an author dares to break the formulas he will have my attention; and if he does it in a good way then he wins.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go into the characters now. This was the other strong point of the series. Let's start with Yuta Sakurai, even though he is a young man with \"normal\" behavior, his social skills are not very good. Which is not unreasonable, there are many shy people who are insecure despite age.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as events progress, he begins to make adjustments in his personality. In fact, after a brief period in which he acted on his fears, he decided to listen to his heart and act accordingly. That's why I loved when he saw Moriko's avatar that reminded him so much of that game, he did not hesitate to use a similar avatar to confirm if she was that same person.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a crucial point in the plot. Had he chosen another path, we would have followed the classic formulas of keeping the secret until the end. However, Yuta's decision to put pressure in a certain way represented the will of the creators to go against the preset structures.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLet's now talk about Moriko Morioka. Here there are more delicate matters because even when she was a functional woman; in the end she ended up leaving work and becoming a NiNi because of his insecurities and inferiority complex. Only the MMORPGs gave her the opportunity to break free and act with more confidence without fear of what they would say.\\n\\n\r\nThis escape was maximized by using an avatar of the opposite sex in the new game that started (Fruits de Mer); However, her attitude when circumstances led her to face reality was very mature, although at first she also tried to flee (which at that moment was logical), then decided to face the facts. After all, for 30 years she was a functional woman, she was not going to forget how to act for a few months of NiNi.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, at the moment Yuta confirms to Moriko the name of that avatar that looked so similar to the one she remembered from the game NanterSG; the way the woman ties all the capes was brilliantly represented by mixing her design in real life and in the Fruits de Mer game.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just as for Yuta was to step forward when using that avatar, for Moriko was to give another by daring to call him and ask him directly if it was him. And the best thing is that the development of both until then made their actions never be forced, but natural within all their insecurities.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point the creators flirted with following a clich\u00e9 by having the call cut off just when Yuta confessed that it was Lily; nevertheless, that literally lasted minutes because then he himself managed to explain everything in person, which gave much more weight to the revelation; and it took away all possibility of Moriko's escape.\\n\\n\r\nThe other character to stand out without doubts is Homare Koiwai. Why? Because it was he who served as a guide and catalyst to take Moriko and Yuta along the right path. In fact, many times when the plot threatened to follow conventional formulas, it was him who came to put order breaking the clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nEven his presence was interesting because for many moments it seemed that it would be the third side of a possible love triangle; although later it was clear that he only wanted to help his friend to build up the courage to fight for the girl he liked.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the best of all, that the feelings of both were always firm and little by little both Yuta and Moriko got the strength to fight for that. This became very clear when it was learned that they played Nanter SG together; That revelation gave depth and weight to their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, the waters continued their course and everything ended in an emotional and rewarding end. First because there was a lot of comedy, second because both reached the peak of their insecurities having to share in the same house; and third because Yuta managed to say the words that Moriko so much needed to hear.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the manager confused them as a couple in the convenience store, all those insecurities returned to Morioka who suddenly felt that his company embarrassed Sakurai. It was here when I thought that the series would leave everything unresolved in an open ending (considering that the manga continues to be published)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Yuta managed to let Moriko know that he did not see her that way and that she needed to value herself more. That for me was stronger than a confession of love, because before starting a relationship, she needed to see herself differently. In fact, those words clicked and gave her the courage to remain at her side.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the moment he gets the courage to take her hand, it was great to see that she did not run away and decided to take the next step (technically she had already decided seconds before); and it was here where those words of Yuta reflected their importance because they became the engine for Moriko to leave that comfort zone that she had created fleeing from the world.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical section, here there is not much to highlight. The character design was nice and the animation was regular; although it did his job by not looking horrible to the point of removing the viewer from the plot. From the soundtrack I do want to highlight the ending, \"Hikari, Hikari\" played by Yuuka Aisaka (voice of Lilac in the series). It was a subject with a lot of feeling and every time an episode ended I could not stop replaying it a couple of times more.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the video that accompanies it was very well prepared and I feel that it captured the essence of the series; Even, in my opinion, it represents a lot better than the opening itself.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a series well taken care of, with a plot that went out of the normal thing and that was written without fear to run risks. This, in an industry where there is so much fear of failure is always a positive point. In addition, the execution was great and the whole made this trip a very rewarding one.\\n\\n\r\nI only regret that it lasted so little, this series deserved at least 26 episodes. Net-juu no Susume promised good things and fulfilled. And the best? Which is precisely now that both began to look as a couple when there are infinite possibilities for history to continue narrating their adventures in the game and in real life. See you in the next review.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nA series that dared to break schemes to give us a fresh, credible, interesting and fun story.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating:\\n\\n\r\n8/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

How it manages to keep me watching even thou the stories are sometimes predictable. But some stories are meant to be predictable in a loving way. \r\nHere we got an anime that revolve around two lovely people that are meant to be with each other.It doesn't have any lewd scene in it. Rather tame in a cute way and there is no kissing scene even thou it should. So feel free to watch it with your lovers, friend or sibling. I highly recommend it.\r\nThe art ofthe animation is super safe and there were no boundaries broken.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special but I do have to give a round of applause to the sound director because it feels like a legitimate fantasy MMORPG games.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and the ending song could be better but what can you expect from this kind of limited budget from a first time director.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not really memorable because of limited on-screen presence and I feel like there are saving them for another season which is good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do enjoy every aspect of the show even though I think it could be done better. The ending is not bad and not good either because we all know they're rushing the animation out as fast as they can but can't blame them for trying to make a good show.\\n\\n\r\nThus, I will leave you with the best fantasy phrase ever created ...

            "content": "Just as you think you're gonna have another NEET, who seemly wasted his or her life or has dedicated his life to live in a virtual world of MMORPG, along come this and yes, it's RECOMMENDATION OF A WONDERFUL VIRTUAL LIFE, unlike any anime that has a Hokikomori NEET/ MMO Junkie where one would wanna go in there to drag that guys or gal's ass into the real world , this one features an MMO junkie Mori Mori, who quits her jobs cu'z she disillusioned with the real world and finds meaning in a gaming site Fruits de Mer but in the end she cameback into the real world were she had help from someone who is as awkward as she is. Ok, so at first she maybe annoying where one would pity such girl with a good career only to waste all of it in a game......but you know what, as one goes on watching this, there are things that would make you give her a second thought:\\n\\n\r\nSo............................\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Story:\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime's plot soooo good , was that it features such gender bender in the virtual world where we see the girl playing a guy and a guy playing a girl. The thing about the story plot was that it focuses on each of  character's alter ego where in the game they become someone else which is completely different from who they were. Another thing that make this part soooo good was that it really happens in real life it may not be in a game but it would also be in any form of social site in the internet . Also, the romance between two players in the game whom have from a relationship in the virtual world only go have their relationship takes it's course for real. \\n\\n\r\nDecent 4, Art:\\n\\n\r\nOk, so there were no fanservices around, and there were no moe thing that goes around here, though there is Liliy san being this maho shoujo in the virtual game, her illustrations isn't something to be given such malice.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Sound:\\n\\n\r\nWell for a 37 year old seiyu Noto Mamiko to sound very mature wasn't much of a surprise  cu'z she doesn't have to struggle being a teeny booper, we can say for sure that she is using her natural voice, the same thing with seiyuu Sakurai Takahiro who is in his 40's also uses her natural tone given that he has to play a mature role.......it's not just those two it's every seiyuu that does the voices for the real world characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Character: \\n\\n\r\nWhen we talk about the characters here, we certainly would love to hate Mori-Mori for being this women with a promising career only to throw it all away to become a useless NEET. We would also find Sakurai being this good looking bishonen to only fall for a socially awkward NEET like Mori Mori, but you know,the only character who made such impact around here is Kpwai Homare, whom at first we thought is gonna be an asshole, but it turns out that he's a blessing in disguise who somehow knew the situation of Mori Mori and Sakurai and has to play this go between with the two in order to get them together, never-mind  if he has the gift of foresight as long as he did what he was need to do in order that his former colleague Mori Mori would have finally have a life in a real world and not rot away being a penniless NEED for the rest of her life and for his colleague Sakurai to be in a relationship and not be lonely for the rest of his life, at this point the score is for Kowai......nice job , man.\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Enjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing, the enjoyment itself is the part where Mori Mori and Sakurai meet up and get to know each other's secret, which live up to what was expected.\\n\\n\r\nGREAT 9, Overall:\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime like this to only run for 10 episodes, was well worth it, something like this need not be extended to 12 episode only to ruin the anime as a whole, in fact you can say that it is the best 10 episode that you'll watch, kudos to studio Signal MD. So should this have a season 2??????Ans, no, it has to end the way it is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMichael Flynn OUT!!!!!!!          \\n",

            "content": "A woman walks into the convenience store wearing a plain jacket and blue sweatpants.  She has dark circles under her eyes and her dark purple hair looks like it hasn\u2019t been combed in a week. She grabs two beers in the drink section and walks over quietly to the gift card area, making sure that she doesn\u2019t bump into someone along the way, and picks up a prepaid game card for an MMO. She leaves quietly but always comes back.\r\nThis woman is Morioka Moriko, a thirty-old-year shut in.\r\nAt first glance Net juu no Susume seems like a mediocre show, and I wouldn\u2019t blame anyonewho did think that way. The Mmo aspect is not fleshed out, the plot features a mountain of coincidences, and nothing really seems to stand out. Yet I think this is possibly one of the best shows this season, for the one thing that Net Juu does extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s unwavering focus on our main character\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why Moriko is such an endearing character is because unlike other shows that will straight will either shoehorn in a tragic backstory or completely ignore it afterward, we see the aftermath of Moriko\u2019s unemployment through her mental state. From the million apologies that she makes to her despairing image of herself, we can see the toll that her previous job and current unemployment has taken on her simply through how she interacts with others and how she acts alone. It\u2019s these small details like her rubbing the floor with a lint roller whenever she feels happy or nervous that really makes the character feel closer to us. These details sell the viewers on the character.\\n\\n\r\nThings brings me to the second thing that Net Juu does well, crafting a believable adult setting. Unlike the adolescent driven hot headed edgy High School students that you see in 90% of other anime, we finally get to have level headed adults for once. Going off of this the dialogue in this show is done very well. Characters are much more formal when talking with others. It was honestly refreshing to see a social recluse that doesn\u2019t automatically start blaming the world for her own problems. \\n\\n\r\nI do think the best part of this setting is that it allows for this story of an office woman who quit her stressful job to become a NEET. There is far too few anime that are told from the point of view of an adult, even less that comment on the stressful environment of the workforce in Japan. Even though this wasn\u2019t especially fleshed out, I really enjoyed the backstory of Moriko, and I can only hope that future shows will also try to convey similar themes in their stories rather than just focusing on an overdone High School Setting.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile Moriko is fleshed out as a character, the same can\u2019t be said for the other characters. The characters that Moriko plays MMO\u2019s with, while interesting, aren\u2019t very developed and mainly serve as side characters that she interacts with when she is playing. Yuuta himself also feels a little flat, not being given enough screen time for his problems to really stand out.\\n\r\nPeople who were planning on watching the show for the MMO aspect may be sorely disappointed to know that the MMO world takes a backseat to give more time to romance. Unlike some other people, I don\u2019t think this is a bad thing. The MMO setting of the story mainly serves as a hub for character interaction and a setting made for the main plot, and with ten episodes it would have been nigh impossible to flesh out a real MMO game without hindering the story itself. \\n\\n\r\nI do think that the way the MMO was drawn was very nice. The colors of the MMO world are vibrant, and there are small details here and there that makes it so the world looks interesting. While the mechanics of the MMO are not fleshed out, I think the world was unique enough that it doesn\u2019t bring down the rest of the show at all. On the topic of art, one thing that Net Juu does very well is it uses chibi art design very well. The chibi scenes are all very expressive and are well timed to add to the comedic parts of the show.  \\n\r\nNet Juu is a simple show, but unlike many other shows, it knows what it wants to do and it does it extremely well. While there are many small things that I wished it would touch on a little more I think Net Juu no Susume is an enjoyable adult-romance that will make your tiring day a little better. It\u2019s nothing exceptional, but you know what, it will do. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and Lily is cute af.\\n\\n",

            "content": "IRL relationships are sometimes exhausting. They require us to constantly give a good image of ourselves, although this is not always the case. At work, we must always do our job as best possible, to evolve in the company, to get satisfaction from our boss (and prevent him from getting angry with you), and of course our livelihood and to provide needs of our family. With friends, we strive to behave in the most appropriate way possible and relationships can sometimes seem rigid and distant. There are things that we don't allow ourselves to tell (being a NEET for example) because we are afraid toappear as a person too different, too weird, from the point of view of society.\\n\\n\r\nThus virtual relationships gain in importance. Since we don't know most people we meet on the net, it is easier to confess and to reveal our real thoughts.. We avoid a little more the \"politically correct\" and we express more sincerely. Not everyone does it but for many, online relationships are a way to escape the suffocation of everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nNet-juu no Susume tells the story of Morioka Moriko, a 30-year-old woman who self-proclaimed NEET. Very exhausted psychologically, she resigned because she couldn't stand her working conditions. (We notice that she was working until 11 pm) She decided to start a netoge titled \"Fruits de Mer\" which is a RPG-fantasy universe in which she'll meet many people. In the game, she plays with a male character named Hayashi. She meets Lily, a girl, , and gets closer and closer to her.\\n\r\nMeanwhile, IRL, Moriko accidentally meets Yuuta Sakurai. He is a young blond man (supposedly of foreign origin) who works in a trading company.\\n\\n\r\nWhat to say about those characters? Moriko is really a well-written character. She is a young woman who lacks self-confidence, is not cute in appearance since she never pays attention to her hair or clothes when she goes out to do her shopping. I was delighted to see an adult character not particularly beautiful for once. We don't have a cute otaku completely unrealistic but a character who seems much more human. In game, she is very funny to follow because she (= Hayashi) tells a lot of lies about her private life and also mentions that she is a man in real life. She will run later into some difficulties but I can't tell you all the details not to spoil your fun.\\n\\n\r\nSakurai Yuuta is a less attractive character than Moriko, less amusing. He is more normal because he adapted to his working conditions. He had a period of depression further to the death of his parents and has been living alone ever since. Online games have been a way to meet, chat with people. I mentioned that this character was blond because he was adopted by a Japanese family. Unfortunately, we had no more information and especially about the discrimination that Sakurai may have suffered as a child since it was different from other classmates/students to all appearances.\\n\\n\r\nFor secondary characters, they are mainly used to support our two main characters. They have no background or development that deserves more attention. They weren't irritating and that's enough. (In 10 episodes, it was not easy to develop all the characters)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Moriko-Sakurai relationship, it is very predictable. Who really doubted Lily's IRL identity? (Same for Kanba) Lily-Hayashi relationship develops gradually and parallel to that of Moriko and Sakurai. Subsequently, Sakurai will understand who is the user behind Hayashi through some events that I won't tell. (no spoil) The other predictable aspect is the fact that Moriko and Sakurai already knew each other in a previous game. At the time, Moriko was still working and Sakurai was going through a difficult period.\\n\r\nRegarding romance, it seems a little forced at times despite the insane interventions Koiwai interferes in the relationship Moriko-Sakurai. They sometimes look embarrassed but it's not excessive. Moriko and Sakurai are not very confident individuals so it makes sense to see them a bit hung-up. The scene when Sakurai finds Moriko (who was waiting for Koiwai for a date) was very powerful. Some dialogues seem a little empty and repetitive but overall it was very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThe net game is a RPG fantasy. You have quests to succeed, monsters to fight, a guild where you find your friends. Nothing really original and the universe is almost unexplored. Some people will surely complain but this is not the goal of this series. We understand this from episode 1. I'm glad we don't have the usual powerful, arrogant (and annoying) MC for once but characters who play normally, who can also lose, and prefer to spend a pleasant moment to forget their daily worries. (Warning, I never said they are mediocre players.)\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspects, the animation is not inferior to other shows, nothing really impressive, nothing bad either. The game and the real world stand out: colorful for the fantasy-RPG, dull for the real world. The chara-design is classic except for Moriko who has an original appearance in the first episodes at least. Bushy eyebrows, tousled hair, pajamas (or jogging) when she goes out to the supermarket. Completely natural! Honestly this character was great and probably one of my favorite characters of the year. It is not designed to play in the waifu game. The opening is excellent. Dynamic with a composition reminiscent of certain games. The ending is nice but not memorable either. As for the soundtrack, it is suitable for the series but I won't listen to regardless of the series. If you have some interesting titles, do not hesitate to tell me.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally this series was like a panacea. I watched the 9 episodes in one go without being bored once. Glad to see that we have adult characters and we come out of the traditional high school couple. Unlike many series released this year (I won't mention them), Net-juu no Susume addresses the issue of video games and its place in our daily life in a realistic and interesting way. You should try this series once, why not with family. (Christmas is coming)",

            "content": "Often There comes a show which we find ourselves enjoying more and more by the passing episode, But when asked, we find it difficult to describe in words,that  what is it that we actually like about it. It is something most of us experience and, it all just might feel weird , to like something without a reason.The same had happened with me while watching this anime,I am not really sure why, Maybe it was the characters, the story, the music, or rather the entire show itself, however, in the end, It doesn't  really matter, as long as one enjoys whatever they arewatching.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime, net juu no susume, starts off as a MMORPG parody, with some generic elements and run off the mill jokes, However, slowly the game theme starts to fade away, to a point where it seems like a side aspect , But in return, what we get to see later is a show, with one of the finest pace of story progression and character development we've seen in a while. The anime starts with a  \"person\", starting a new life,and not a one you would expect, but rather an Online one. She uses games, not as a means to escape reality, but rather to reject it, to a point where it fades away to almost nothing. However, the world around that her begins to change due to a string of coincidences, which you might call fate,that slowly  amalgamate both her online and offline lives together to a point, where both of them just seem unreal to her, and to a certain extend, to us too. \\n\\n\r\nNeet is a term which is gaining more an more popularity in anime, This is clearly evident in most of the recent anime we have been receiving. Of course, it is not a good idea to just sit around at home all day doing nothing,but secretly, its somthing that most of us desire to do, and this desire within us is what makes us relate to these people. The main character, Morioka san, is  also a neet, who has left her job in private sector and now dedicates her full time in playing RPGs and making new friends online. The interesting part is how she plays as a male character in the game, and some people despite knowing this, treats her as a normal person and not a freak, which comes to show the acceptance and etiquette of the internet. The show focuses on how she , by meeting new people, is able to come out of her shell and becomes a more social and active person in the society, which in other words means how she recovers from her neet behavior.\\n\\n\r\nNow, It has become quite common to see young high school characters in most anime,especially romance, who have no experience in life and behave like dimwits whose lives are  a tragedy. Net juu no susume offers a more   mature and sensible cast of characters whose approach to life and the events that happen, are more realistic and makes sense. We see the characters behave in realistic way and not like dimwits , and this is also a major appeal of the anime and also  reason for the smooth progression of the story. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like Morioka, sakurai is shown as a person with his own problems, despite having a job and friends, he is actually more similar to Morioka san than anyone else. Both are portrayed as MMO junkies who are fed up of their routine and escape off into a world of RPG to relieve themselves. Its also funny how both of them are more closer to one another , than they realize. And as the story progresses, They find that they are tied by a  string of fate. The other characters are also not cast aside and the have a pretty well developed personality to show and a good role to play. Characters like Koiwai, Kanbe have provided with a help to both parties in improving the relationship with the other. Honestly, I was also not a fan of Koiwai, because he is pushy and just a big jerk. But, still he was the major reason in bringing Morioka san close to sakurai, And the real reward is when you watch the last episode and realize how far they have reached from just being strangers, It still surprises me, or rather it shows the real power of online games, and how they are able to bring strangers more closer to each other than one can imagine \\n\\n\r\nIts actually these shows, which truly highlight the role played by good characters in an anime and which kind of impact they can have, even on a not so well written story line. The rate of development and character building has been really perfect since the fist episode. Through small encounter, to exchanging email , to going drinking,and finally just getting even more closer , The development being done is something which surprises me the most. Its all too fast and yet seems natural  . It truly shows how much we can achieve , in very amount little episodes.\\n\\n\r\n The MMORPG, as I alredy mentioned, is not exactly the main focus of the anime, especially for the later half,however it has also not been completely ignored. We can see some good parody elements just being thrown around casually, Like the Loot box episode. Also we should see that, It is the Game only which started it all and was a major portion of the story development at first. The MMORPG theme in total here, is used really well to be honest, it has not overshadowed the anime but is also not got overshadowed itself or we can say that it was simply used in the most appropriate way .\\n\\n\r\nThe art is something I usually don't talk about, as it is quite subjective in itself. From my point of view, The art is pleasant and simple with a good use of cooler color palette , which is pleasing to eyes. The music is very simple and elegant, More than the OP, i am a bigger fan of the ed. It closes up everything very well and is a good way to wrap up things, but Other than that , there is nothing special in the art and music part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The anime is surprisingly well made and it is much better than what u would expect it to be. It seemed to me as a very generic and simple show at first, but soon it exceeds my expectations and becomes a show which I would look forward to every friday. From the well developed characters to a good story line, almost everything about it is perfect which ,in my eyes, makes it worthy of the score i have given, And also Sakurai and Morioka san are one of the cutest pair you will ever see in anime. Its something everyone should experience at least once, because It will exceed your expectation, more than you would expect it to",

            "content": "Our society is made up of all sorts of people. The everyday working man, prodigies, movie icons, singing legends, book smarts, street thugs, leaders, professional gamers, ladies\u2019 man, creative innovators. You name it. There\u2019s always someone you\u2019ve met in today\u2019s society that you may be familiar with or completely contrasts who you are. There\u2019s one type of people that our society doesn\u2019t have a keen impression on though. That would be NEET. Know what it stands for? At its most generic definition, it\u2019s a person that is \u201cnot in education, employment, or training\u201d. The stereotype about \u201cgamers that stay in their mom\u2019s basement\u201d applies there.In a show like this, we get a first inside look at the life of a NEET and how their social life applies to their norms.\\n\\n\r\nJumping into this anime was actually quite easy. This is determined by the female protagonist, Moriko Morioka. She is what most people would define as a \u201cNEET\u201d. After quitting her job, Moriko decided to play an MMO called \u201cFruit de Mer\u201d in order to embrace the NEET lifestyle. I find this choice of the main character rather interesting as there\u2019s sort of gender swap with her role. Most people would imagine a nerdy male protagonist but instead, we have a single unmarried female character who isn\u2019t bad looking in the beauty department either. Some people may also feel relatable to Moriko because of her straightforward timid personality. As a show that examines the lifestyle of a NEET, Moriko fits perfectly for that role because she is socially awkward. In the meantime, Moriko also creates a character in the MMO world named \u201cHayashi\u201d. In contrast to her real life image, she makes Hayashi as a male knight character with a handsome look; in general, an antithesis of herself. As such, this anime sets up a lot of storytelling as her lifestyle blends between fiction and reality.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly to Moriko, there\u2019s also another character in the series that doesn\u2019t come far off when compared to her. His name is Yuta Sakurai. Compared to Moriko, Sakurai often has hard time talking with people in real life although he does maintain a decent job at his company. This is extremely similar to Moriko as both characters often fret over at what they should say or how others may judge them based on their words. In the MMO world, Sakurai adopts the character name \u201cLily\u201d. By storytelling elements, he plays a gender bender role as a female character in that fictional world and meets Hayashi. Lily also happens to be an attractive young female in-game and is sociable compared to Sakurai\u2019s real life image. Get the picture here? It basically designates both their characters being completely different between their real life and MMO character persona. However, I do find the character chemistry to be very well executed. From the MMO world, they manage to connect to a personal level and share quite a decent amount of memorable moments together. In fact, character chemistry is what I value this show the most. Through social commentary, character dialogues, and personality dynamics, Moriko and Sakurai stands out as a memorable pair. They aren\u2019t just similar but really bring out their honesty towards each other. It\u2019s like fate often has the two meet together through coincidences as they connect with their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this anime isn\u2019t just about them as the show also adds other characters to fulfill certain roles. A noticeable character is Homare Koiwai who has a very outgoing personality. In fact, he can be interpreted by some people as a ladies\u2019 man. Unlike either Moriko or Sakurai, Koiwai has little trouble speaking with others and often initiates a conversation. It shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to realize that he is a foil character for the both of them. There\u2019s also Kazuomi Fujimoto, a stereotypical college working student who also has an in-game MMO character. While I can\u2019t say his role is very dynamic in this show, he does make up an empty void for filling the shoe of the merchandise seller. You ever need some in-game items? He\u2019s your guy. \\n\\n\r\nEven as a show that explores a lot of social norms, this anime still fulfills a lot of MMO gimmicks and mechanics that gamers may be familiar with. The idea of character classes, customized gear, lootbox, dungeon conquering, world exploration, etc fits into their game world. However, don\u2019t mistake this anime as one about characters trapped in a world in order to defeat some demon overlord or survive. It\u2019s more of a series that satires the NEET lifestyle in a lighthearted way. In addition, the storytelling gives us insight about Moriko\u2019s life in small but vivid details. It shows how exactly she lives her lifestyle as you would picture as a NEET. The anime also gives some background storytelling about Moriko and Sakurai so it doesn\u2019t just rely on the present timeline to do all the talking and showing. On the other hand, I do find that there\u2019s some problem with the storytelling\u2019s pacing. This anime adapts from a web manga and only consists of 10 episodes. The majority of the first half establishes the characters and ideas while the latter half seems to focus more on Moriko and Sakurai\u2019s relationship. It often flirts with the idea of \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they become a couple\u201d. No, I\u2019m not just talking about an in-game romance relationship because that comes off as way too cheesy. Instead, it makes the viewers wonder if there\u2019s a future for them in a real relationship. This anime will test a viewers\u2019 patience as it slowly builds up more and more each episode. Some of them end in cliffhangers that can be a letdown. As such, I\u2019d recommend watching this as a marathon rather than on a week to week basis. \\n\\n\r\nOn the visual front, Net-juu no Susume isn\u2019t anything to write home about when it comes to raw quality. Signal. MD\u2019s track record consists of a small group of projects that people don\u2019t talk about often. To me, this was their first anime project that people may have taken more notice. The visual quality itself can also be questionable as everything looks very simple. If this anime was marketed as a game in our world, it would be an indie compared to AAA games that you\u2019d see from high budget studios. However, if you look past the quality, you may notice that the anime appeals to more than just quality itself. With its MMO elements, this show is a smart flick that uses its artwork to prove what it means to be a gamer. If you take a look at Moriko\u2019s home, she has everything set up from dual screens to high quality keyboard. In-game character designs, monsters, and items disguises the mediocre quality if you look carefully as it satires the gaming culture. Moriko\u2019s character design can also look appealing especially in later episodes when she gets a makeover. Character expressions also sell a good degree of humor especially with reactions to certain situations. To be honest, this anime will be viewed differently from every viewer but it possesses an innate ability to shine for what it has to offer despite the budget.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the soundtrack isn\u2019t memorable by any means but it\u2019s more of the characters\u2019 voice lines that do the work. Moriko\u2019s voice fits effectively for her role as both in-game and real life. Even when crossplaying, Hayashi still has some of her traits that can be easily recognized. The theme songs for the show speaks for themselves as it comes as colorfully decorated.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this anime, I can safely say that it exceeded my expectations. The first few episodes took me some time to accept but after realizing what it really had to offer, it changed my mind from a mediocre afterthought to a show that I looked forward to every week. However, I think it\u2019s preferably to watch this anime as a marathon as the storytelling can test the patience of the viewers at many times. The comedy can be a hit or a miss depending on what you\u2019re looking for. But for me, Net-juu no Susume turned out to be a dark horse that went beyond and over.\\n",

The online communities keep growing larger and larger, and whenever a community grows larger, some potential can be noticed (look at MAL for example).\r\nNet-Juu no Susume notice that potential, bringing the same concept as last year's NetoYome, Net-Juu no Susume brings us a tale of a female voluntary unemployed, Morioka Moriko as shestumbles up to one of the online game from internet's recommendation, as she plays as a 'he' in that game. She gets along with Lilly, a female character who turns out to be a young male employee in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a good example of 'Good anime didn't need certain complexity to be enjoyable'. With that simplistic concept, this anime didn't need a long time to make us (the audience), feel attached to the story and characters in the series. It may be not as original as we hope, but the execution was marvelous. It flows easily and perfectly placed without forcing it to be understandable. The anime makes us want to see more even though the art and sound itself is not as god-tier as other anime these days. Characters are awesome, main characters interaction is always more interesting than we could ever expect. I believe these lovebirds personality can fill each other blackness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Net-Juu no Susume is perfect for those who like light-hearted.

            "content": "(Note: This review contains both positives and negatives, but it helps you decide to watch it or not. 8/10 is just my view)\r\nIn this present Internet-dominated world, We spend lots of time on social networks, gaming etc and we forget how we behave in the real world and become clumsy, silly and awkward...That's depicted really well in this anime...and it also shows how we want to stay and dream to be in that dream world...\r\nPlease don't be deceived by the title \"Recovery of MMO junkie\" , To be honest I thought it must be a story of a recovering MMO addict and it might helppeople with addictions get motivated, but to my disappointment, Its a story about an MMO addict who was forced to quit playing the game as the game was shut down and she finds a new game...so that's what recovery means in this case.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIt's a common MMO gaming type anime where MC plays the game and interacts with other characters and obviously falling in love with them or developing a crush and accidentally they meet in the real world but they do not know that they are playing the same game. (Which would never happen in real life scenario cos there is no possibility of meeting) .\\n\\n\r\nYou know what's going to happen next in the story and you know that it is silly but still you would love watching it because the atmosphere in the anime makes you feel that way.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode might be boring but after 2nd and 3rd episode you start liking it and it keeps getting more and more interesting.There is no dragging which happens in most love stories (you would understand what I meant at the end of episode 8).\\n\\n\r\nIt did help bring few smiles and laughs as it exactly depicts how stupid we behave when we live in that virtual world or social networks, as we cant talk to the same person whom we met in social network properly if met face to face. It also makes sarcastic jokes about MMO gaming.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is Good, I mean since it represents about a game, obviously the characters are designed to be colorful and interesting.The Main character even though with her messy long hair is really cute and there is bit drawback in male characters of real life because most of them look almost same, just the hair color or spectacles vary lol.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOpening and Ending tracks are good and create a gaming feel scenario,\\n\r\nThe soundtracks aren't worth remembering, except for 1 or 2, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is the main important feature that makes this anime special, Character development Of the main character is good. I fell in love with the MC as her character is just like me who does clumsy things and speak in monosyllables when talking with opposite sex. Other characters aren't much developed( like other gamers)...We only come to know 3 people from the game outside...So it focuses mainly on the Two MC's and their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall :\\n\r\nI would say to watch this anime if you want to see someone like you existing in an anime world and laugh at yourself. It's a good time pass anime if you are bored of high school romance and bloody thrillers. \\n\\n\r\nMy advice before watching: \\n\r\nPlease don't start this anime with any expectations, Watch it with a free mind and at a time when you don't have anything to do.",

            "content": "I get it, Recovery of an MMO Junkie is cute and all, but is that really enough to overlook a piss-poor story writing, shallow characters, and mediocre visuals?\r\n[Story: 3/10] \r\nMoriko Morioka is a 30something business dropout who has chosen to become a self-proclaimed \"NEET\" and plays games all day instead of working. Why did she choose this life? She felt like it, despite being good at her job she opted to throw it away playing video games instead\u2026 Don\u2019t expect to understand what motivates the characters because their only reason for existing is to be cute.\r\nMoriko enters the MMO game and chooses to play asa male character, why? Because she wanted to. A potentially interesting start to the protagonist that goes right into the gutter because it's only used as an excuse to hide her true identity from her in-game friends, the first of many misunderstandings to fuel the lazy story. In the MMO world, she meets a kind girl named Lily, who has an air of mystery surrounding her. They grow close to each other quickly within the first episode, but keep their feelings on the down low because relationships are (for some reason) not allowed in the guild they\u2019re in. In real life, Moriko bumps into a man on the streets and they gradually become friends as time goes by with hints at a romance that could form. Their burgeoning relationship gave her a chance to stop being a NEET. Occasionally it\u2019s endearing to see them awkwardly try to talk to each other, but as they run through the same routine over and over I just wanted them to get on with it and skip the charade. However, the other half of me knew that the show would fall to pieces once there was no more misunderstanding to drag out. That\u2019s why MMO Junkie is so predictable, you know that they can\u2019t have the big reveal until the very end, lest they actually come up with an engaging plot to compel the audience for the rest of the runtime.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the more annoying contrivances the show dishes out:\\n\r\n1. Supporting characters who understand the misunderstanding between the two leads and willingly choose to confuse and misguide them, preventing them from discovering each other's true identities and also move the plot along.\\n\r\n2. In response to most awkward situations that would reveal either of the leads identities they say, \u201cI\u2019m too embarrassed to say I\u2019m a gamer/ I have a crush on that person / I am a woman but playing as a man.\u201d If only the characters were actually had the self-confidence to be called role models, I might consider it to be cute and pleasant, but they\u2019re not there to help you but to pander to you. Pure Junk food. \\n\r\n3. Phone Batteries. Why can\u2019t they just charge their damn phones??\\n\r\n4. \u201cWhat if they find out that I\u2019m a NEET?\u201d You aren\u2019t a damn NEET! Getting nervous around boys and being too lazy to go to work doesn\u2019t make you a NEET.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of these flaws is the wasted potential of the MMO counterpart to the real world, along with the supporting cast of Moriko's online friends who she's in a guild with (but they get no development whatsoever). Some of the engagement of watching MMO Junkie comes from trying to figure out which characters in the real world are players in the MMO world and seeing them work together in the game. However, the actual gameplay itself is almost never shown, most likely due to budget constraints. So we are forced to listen to the boring recounts of the gameplay, losing a connection with the characters in the process. Come on, even Sword Art Online got this right. Watching people play games without any reason to care is boring, but being told about people playing games is mind numbing.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 3/10]\\n\r\nThe fact that the characters are adults changes nothing, they all act just as stupid as the high schoolers in your average school harem anime. Their sole purpose is to perpetuate the frustratingly predictable plot about finding out who likes who. Each character in the show is added to the cast before they\u2019re introduced, the show just expects you to recognize what archetype they fall into and fill in the blanks yourself. The incredibly lazy characterization that only further alienates the audience. Starting with the main character; she tells us she is a neet who quit her job, why? Who knows, she omitted that part, and thus gave the audience no reason to get invested in her character other than being a lady with big boobs who likes video games and cute girls (namely the one who she latches onto in the game). \\n\\n\r\nThe characters could have just as easily been high schoolers, them being adults adds nothing to them. When I saw that they were in their 20s and 30s I thought we\u2019d get to see interesting dynamics of responsibilities that the main character would face being an adult neet. Disappointingly, the responsibilities of adulthood are mostly ignored and swept under the rug. Despite Moriko not having a job, she is able to pay rent, living expenses, and her MMO subscription. 90% of the issues the characters face could be fixed if they simply communicated with each other and solved their problems like the adults that they are. However, it would be too much to ask for characters who have actual common sense, wouldn't it?\\n\\n\r\nMy least favorite character by a mile was Koiwai. Even as just a supporting cast member he stands out as being particularly unsettling and he totally defuses any potential comedy in the scenes he's present in. What makes him so unbearable is how creepy he acts, in one episode he takes a picture of Moriko while she's sleeping then texts it to Sakurai and to top it off, Koiwai makes a rape joke. Yes, it was a rape joke. Even if it was meant as some sort of off-beat joke, it put me off from his character entirely. I was constantly wondering why he even hangs around the kind and innocent lead characters while he is so malicious. I'm honestly shocked that more people haven't mentioned how grotesque he is as a character. The worst part about him is that the creators of the show acknowledge him as a good person and build him up to be this great guy through Moriko commenting on his \"kindness,\" truly sickening. \\n\\n\r\nThis sadly isn't too surprising of a (dark) turn for MMO Junkie considering the director, Kazuyoshi Yaginuma, is openly a neo-nazi and promotes anti-semitism. I wouldn't recommend this show before knowing about the Yaginuma's appalling beliefs. But knowing who had their filthy hands on this show makes it flat out impossible to recommend. \\n\\n\r\n[Art: 4/10] \\n\r\nI could understand if they intended for the scenes in real life to look bland, but the scenes in the game world are just as flat which leads me to believe that this show just didn't have the budget to handle a project like this. I\u2019ve never heard of the studio that made this show, Signal. MD, and that\u2019s probably a blessing considering how low in quality the show is.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound 5/10]\\n\r\nThe op and ed are catchy but become grating over time, not something I would listen to individually. Another place affected by the low budget is the music, I expected it to be mediocre and I wasn't disappointed. Don't go into it expecting anything great, just your bog standard repetitive romcom-ish soundtrack that adds very little to the show. To spice it up a bit the show would use the MMO specific music in the real world to symbolize how Moriko was taking on life as if it was an in-game challenge, which was a good creative choice, but it me think of how they're just running out of music.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 5/10]\\n\r\nI almost never found the jokes to be funny, they try way too hard to be relatable and often feel redundant in an oversaturated genre. The \"comedy\" is just a constant stream of Moriko shouting in her head \"Ahhg!! I'm so embarrassed for x-reason!!\" over and over. She can't face life head on like an adult and instead tortures herself (and the audience) by constantly complaining about small issues that make her seem petty. If you think finding out which character in the real world is a player in the MMO could be exciting then look elsewhere, it is very obvious who is who. Like the derivative rom-com of last season \u201cGamers,\u201d this show is full of head shaking contrivances to keep characters from figuring out who is who. At least Gamers made the effort to include commentary on video games. This show didn\u2019t even bother to go beyond \u201cI can make man character but I am a woman teehee.\u201d \\n\r\nGod forbid the audience actually have to think at all while watching a show about adults. \\n\\n\r\nAll that MMO Junkie offers in the way of meaningful commentary (if you can even call it that) is characters mentioning from time to time, \"I bought my gear in a loot box~!\" It shows that the characters like to spend lots of money on the game, but damn, it's so unself-aware for a show about video games to actually embrace microtransactions rather than criticize them, especially with Battlefront II and other offenders only recently releasing to overwhelming audience outcry.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score 4/10]\\n\r\nDespite being only 10 episodes long it overstays its welcome, becoming incredibly repetitive and predictable as it desperately claws at the audience screaming out \u201cTELL ME IM CUTE!!\u201d And it made no effort to hide its intentions. \\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t care if she finds out who he is in the game or not. \\n\r\nI didn\u2019t care if he confesses to her or not.  \\n\r\nI just wanted it to be over. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I expected too much from it, but forgive me for hoping for a mature romance from a show about adults. If you can overlook the lackluster plotting, poorly realized game world, and shallow characters then perhaps you may find some enjoyment in the cloyingly saccharine non-romance. Otherwise, I\u2019d say Recovery of an MMO Junkie is best left forgotten.",

            "content": "(Possible minor spoilers ahead, if you haven't seen the first ep you have been warned)\r\n To start off, this show title doesn't give a very good description of what the actual content entails, \u201cRecovery of an MMO Junkie\u201c would make many think (well at least what I thought) a show entailing possible game rich functions, ideas and the such. Unfortuantly though it has more come across as more a pre-tense for the show and it revolves around a RomCom based structure, if you liked \u201cKiss Him, Not Me \u201d there's a good chance you'll like this show, they show many similar things and the comedyaspect is roughly the same.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\n MC meet MC2 out of random thing, they for some reason click, they have some comedic events and some down spells, standard structure for a RomCom, but what adds from that? So far nothing. Besides ye ol gender bender trick its pretty straight forward.\\n\r\n5 outta 10 you say? Man that doesn't sound that high, and no it doesn't but that's mainly because of my own pet peeves I might add. The show points out the MC is a previous MMO nut, and claims to be an \u201celite NEET\u201d, from there the MC proceeds to need constant assistance on basic MMO structures and proceedings, doesn't sound super \u201celite MMO nut\u201d to me. \\n\r\nMC runs into someone who wants to help from seeing them fail too often, this screams Deus ex machina, but its needed for the plot to progress, which is kinda annoying to swallow but it will be allowed. From here its just happy go lucky RomCom standard, you know whats going to happen, you know how its gunna turn out, there's not a lotta variety going on. For the comedy aspect, id say your usual troupes are had, the embarrassment to get a couple giggles, but I only really felt anything in one or two scenes over 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\n The characters are there, and they each have their own feel about them, but it's more a each has their \u201cthing\u201d than each having different personality's, It has a very RomCom feel setup which is a given, MC1 is nervous about everyone and talking about things making them bashful/embarrassed when doing anything. MC2 just playing the tough card but inside they too act the same. MC3 is like MC2 but plays the envy card, and finally MC4 for the laughs, more confused to how there was a lacking of the tsundere card, gets a thumbs for that atleast. \\n\\n\r\nSound: ?/10\\n\r\n Wouldn't be able to give you a rating for sound, because I haven't really noticed it, besides the opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\n Flat art style is very generic, in game looks like every other show on the market, and when this is 90% of the show representation kinda doesn't help out. A lot of the time spent is still background shots and talking phases in basic settings (A tree, a blue brick castle, a fountain) Not a lot going on, nor does it really stick out as creative or interesting. Outside of the game MC art style is a little more creative which gives some nice flair but not enough to out weigh the previous problem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\n It's not bad bad, but its got a ways of being good, if I hadn't have seen \u201cKiss Him, Not Me\u201d I probably would have thought more of it, but it feels very similar in design THUS far, it could change in one episode and become a 9 you never know.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR\\n\r\n If you like RomComs, give it a go you may like it, but don't start this show if you are thinking it will have a decent gaming environment aspect. Seems very generic based with some tweaking, this is my opinion and you might like it, as they say each to their own, I will watch it through till the end but so far its seeming like shows I've already seen.",

            "content": "Net-juu no susume is a wonderfully crafted romance. The series' ambitions are not immediately apparent, as the story opens with a very generic MMO-registration sequence. It would be easy to write Net-juu off as just another typical virtual/alternative reality anime that fails to establish a personality and a mission statement in the first crucial minutes. After the first episode you're most likely wondering which direction the story is heading, as there is nothing inherently interesting about the game world or its mechanics. \r\nThe real point of interest is, of course, the characters. The online guild friends our MC encounters are charming, as are their realworld personas. Everything about the characters and their interactions is so pleasant and likable that you can't help falling in love with them. This wouldn't work if there were no struggles, of course. Net-juu tackles real, working world issues. The way humans use games to alleviate stress and escape human problems is a central motif.\\n\\n\r\nNet-juu puts multiplayer games into an interesting light. It doesn't deny their addictive and harmful properties, but it doesn't try to paint them as evil either. Even though the characters of this anime have different backgrounds and spend varying amounts of time in their game, all of them have a deep appreciation for the experiences and connections it has allowed them to make.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual production has a raw feeling to it, which somehow seems to elevate the romantic feelings it spurs inside me (Net-juu is similar to RE:life also in this regard). The soundtrack is similarly low-key, although both the OP and ED make a very strong mark with music and visuals that work in a perfect harmony.\\n\\n\r\nNet-juu is is worth checking out even if romance isn't your go-to genre. It's filled with love, and has one of the most charming main characters I have ever had the pleasure to watch.",

            "content": "Story: Average\r\nBeing predictable isn't a shortcoming, but being predictable without any charm is.\r\nWe know right from the start what is the goal of the series and we are there just to lay down and enjoy the ride, and I sure didn't. \r\nMost of the reason for that comes from the characters, but the plot is also at fault. If you make your end goal known to the public at least make your journey until there fun. \r\nI mean, I'm pretty sure that I have watched this already. Isn't this just a mixture of ReLIFE, NetoYome, and Gamers! ? \r\n- Romance involving two main adult characterswhile having some sort of \"rehabilitation\". \u2714\\n\r\n- Having characters that know each other in a game meeting irl. \u2714\\n\r\n- A bunch of misunderstandings or slow progression that could have been easily solved if they talked with each other. \u2714\\n\\n\r\nSound/Art: Fine/Bad\\n\\n\r\nI don't have much to say, I found the music a bit above average while the art being somewhat bad. It's more or less consistent, but I don't think that it has any appeal. Backgrounds and characters designs are really generic and I don't have any memorable moment where I thought that the show looked good. On the other hand, I have several memories where it was meant to look good, but it wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Very Bad\\n\\n\r\nSo, let me see if I got this right. For a change instead of high school age characters we have adults, but instead of making any good use of that we just use them as if they were still high school age characters. \\n\r\nYes, we have this huge superficial difference while everything else that really matters is the same as any other anime out there. \\n\r\nThis story could easily have been made without them being adults while having almost no differences, just changing some events to something similar or changing them to something different while getting a similar purpose/intent. \\n\r\nI just feel like it was a waste on that part.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, they are not even the only characters, we have more which we know absolutely nothing about and were always there. I guess that we shouldn't expect much since not even the main characters were that well developed. We known about Sakurai's past and we kinda know about Morioka's. But it's in a superficial manner. Sakurai only has that going for him because it was needed. Otherwise, he could not share a bound with Morioka, and the exact same thing with the MC. A superficial plot point for them to have some sort of connection while making it \"so beautiful\", otherwise they would have 0 reasons to want to get to know one another. Especially taking in considerating both their personalities, especially Morioka's. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Average\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I made this series seem worse than it is. I honestly just found it average. I ended up focusing on the bad points of the series since most of the reviews are positive with some high scores and I wanted to give some \"balance\" to it since I really don't think that this series was as good as people make it out to be.",

            "content": "The first half of Net-Juu no Susume, otherwise known as Recommendation of The Wonderful Virtual Life (Not Recovery of an MMO Junkie), was actually quite a joyous watch. Typically romance is a genre that lacks variety and intrigue. NJnS takes the additive route of just applying an MMO on top of the bland   cliche scenarios you'd normally find and, surprisingly, it creates some level of appeal.\r\nGloriously followed up by the characters, Morioka or \"MoriMori\", is a shut-in who quit her job to play MMOs all day everyday. Well, really it is to escape the real world that is filled with anxiety and depressionbut... y'know how it goes. Inside this MMO, she eventually meets the pink barfbag that is Lily and since Mori created a male character; the obvious conclusion is that Lily is also a man.\\n\\n\r\nBut keep in mind, predictability isn't always a bad thing. If anything, trying to work around keeping Lily's identity a secret for a given period of time likely would've complicated things and that is a common problem many other anime make. Anyways, Sakurai, who we can already guess is Lily, comes to an understanding that the situations happening with MoriMori in real life is awfully similar to the situations described by Hayashi, Mori's avatar in the MMO. In this scenario, anime has portrayed male characters very stupidly by just having them chalk it all up to sheer coincidence. Not Sakurai, he mans up and investigates what is going on, uncovering the identity behind Hayashi actually being Morioka! And that's really cool! I, very much, appreciated how intelligent and proactive Sakurai's character has been... Up until this point.\\n\\n\r\nBut post episode 4 it really falls downhill. A lot of slow dialogues of that do nothing for the show and even though Kowai seems to have read \"The Bro Code\" front and back, his attempts to set up Sakurai and Morioka together fails time and time again simply because Sakurai lost his pair and decides that he isn't going to go after Morioka because fuck logic. After all this, it is just a slow decline of pointless dialogue to pad the show's run time. Oh and the other characters really don't matter. It is mainly a story between Morioka and Sakurai with actual assistance by Kowai.\\n\\n\r\nI personally wouldn't recommend a virtual life. MMOs are a pain and gets boring very quickly with the repetitive gameplay and pointless dialogue; much like this anime.",

            "content": "Recovery of an MMO Junkie quickly became one of my favorites and I can say with full confidence that there has never been a romcom anime like it. There's nothing convoluted about the story, there are no gimmicks, and no long-lasting misunderstandings. These are stable adults, making responsible decisions, and fostering healthy relationships. The creators masterfully portray 30-year-olds feeling deep-seated, heart-racing, butterflies in your stomach romance. And it's a treat.\r\nMoriko Morioka is a self-certified NEET and Yuta Sakurai is a company man with a good heart; both have shared interests and a chance encounter that changes the course of their relationship. Unlike most heroines, Morikois extremely polite yet headstrong. She's at the age where she understands that if she compromises too much of herself to appease a potential partner's sensibilities, they will never be happy together. She loves herself and knows how society views her as a woman NEET. Yes, she cleans up well; however, she knows that if her partner can't stand her unkempt self\u2014her most comfortable self\u2014then she's better off without them. I appreciate that more than anyone can say because it's such a rare thing to see in anime, especially in a character who's a woman. It's a really important message, especially for young girls.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many things that lead to satisfying affirmations and the way conflicts get resolved is terrific. For example, Sakurai tries to retrace his steps in order to bump into Morioka again. Koiwai, Sakurai's friend, calls him out on his actions as stalkerish. He denies it at first but then realizes he's overstepping boundaries and stops\u2014and I love that! Not enough creators acknowledge a realistic problem with their characters and then confront it with such nuance. There's a great cast of supporting characters, many of whom are guild members (MMO clubs). They act as any good online friends would; they're always there for the main characters, they listen and give advice when asked, and they have fun together whether it's at the in-game pub or in a dungeon. This is neither here nor there but I also appreciate that gender isn't as huge an issue as other game-related anime make it seem. There's a gay couple who are lovable and affectionate and, at one point, Morioka developed a crush on another woman. It wasn't written to serve as some kind of shocking plot point or tokenism either; made my heart swell with joy.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is simple and the art style looks a little bit older than most anime nowadays but it's bearable. The coloring on the other hand is fantastic; whoever does the coloring is amazingly talented! The quality of the voice acting, the music and sound production, and the storytelling makes everything worth it. I especially appreciate that the anime doesn't rely on ridiculous tropes. Nobody goes out of their way to be horrifically sinister and all of the characters are incredibly supportive of each other. There are many relatable things that happen that many adults can relate to. Recovery of an MMO Junkie is one for the ages and, if you enjoy a heartwarming slice of life-romcom or if you enjoy video games, I implore you to give this a try. Knowledge of MMORPG's help but isn't necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is perfect, especially for gamers who love slice of life-romcoms. I'm surprised it took this long for producers to utilize online gaming and pair it with the genres when there are hundreds of millions of players who also watch anime. There is so much potential to create something for gamers to relate to and it's great to illustrate that healthy, longlasting bonds between players is possible. Recovery of an MMO Junkie portrays that well. It wrapped up neatly and left me wanting more; there's an 11th episode OVA and 2 shorts set to release. After this, hopefully this anime inspires other producers to create more stories like it. Please, give it a try and support them by watching on Crunchyroll!",

            "content": "After many years of stressful and unfulfilling work, Moriko decided to quit her job and is now a NEET playing a MMO game, what awaits her (and us, the viewers) is a fantastic experience totally worth watching.\r\nNet-juu no Susume is in my opinion one of the most solid executions of the romance genre and a very interesting take of the game one. The ingame world is well developed and has a good number of scenes that really showed the feelings that provide playing this type of games, like trying out clothes and how they looked depending on the character, the \u201cwtf dude\u201d moment when someonequits during a raid boss without warning, or just the endless talks with the other people in the anonymity that the Internet provides, and even more in this case since our protagonist is using a male character and interacts with the others from that point of view. These scenes are also very funny since the reactions of the characters to what happens ingame are quite priceless.\\n\\n\r\nWhile quitting her job gave her a breath of fresh air, that still affected Moriko, who is quite self-depreciating and feels disappointed for things like how she doesn't take as much care of herself as before or just going to a shop to buy random things to eat while passing the day playing the game. While the series doesn't make it overly dramatic, one can see that even if she has a lot of fun playing, that lifestyle still affects her. Thankfully, things start to change once she bumps into an employee from a trading company.\\n\\n\r\nThe mix of the gaming parts with the in real life scenes also includes the romance element of the series, that is well executed and smoothly paced thanks to Sakurai, our male protagonist, and his friend and co-worker Koiwai, these two characters soon enter Moriko's life and their interactions both between them and with her are fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nSakurai needs a special mention for how much he deserves a medal for his awareness of the situation. If you have been watching anime for a while, I'm sure that you have experienced the frustration of a character being overly dense, which can be pretty funny in comedic settings depending on the viewer but very infuriating in some other cases, don't worry for that in this anime because he will not disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does a good job in the artistic and musical parts without standing out, the reactions of the characters are well done and funny, while the music sets well the tone of each scene, including the always necessary fantasy tone for the ingame scenes in that type of setting. The opening, Saturday Night Question, provides a nice song with visuals that show pretty well the difference in feelings between the ingame and real life parts of our protagonist, while the ending theme, Hikari, Hikari, shows us various reactions of the characters from the other side of the screen they are interacting to, very neat idea.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Net-juu no Susume gave us a nice story, creating an interesting ingame world that interacts with the reality of our lovable cast and how they develop over the course of the story. I really recommend to give it a try!\\n\\n",

If there is such a thing as a polar opposite of a power fantasy, it would be this show in how its mere existence demonstrates there is a demographic of people who want to see helpless protagonists win at life because of their uselessness. (The show not-so-subtly suggests that if you choose to quit your job and do nothing with your life except sit around in a virtual fantasy, then all your dreams will come true and you'll even meet the man or woman of your dreams!)\r\nCynicism aside, I loved this show. Most of thestory's best moments center around secret identities and the fear of being discovered. At this point everyone has a hobby they're not particularly keen on advertising to the world, so it's easy to identify with the main characters. Romance junkies will probably get a huge kick out of this show but will be disappointed in how short it is. The upside to that however is that the pacing is good and there's no filler.",

            "content": "Think of this as a simplified-SAO with the no-nonsense typical romance \"coincidence\" anime. An impressive feat for Signal.MD and a sleeper hit alongside the ongoing Houseki no Kuni in this fall season (and the Tsuki ga Kirei MAL scoring effect plays here too).\r\nGoing through the short 10 episode series makes me feel like this show isn't best at its storytelling, but it makes up for it through the \"coincidental\" character development and endless comical rom-com that has fans like us welcome and finding it enjoyable from an unknown starting to a short but fulfilling ending.\r\nSo the main characters, the 30 year old NEET Morika Moriokaand the casual but shy Sakurai Yuuta, at times they aren't as close to knowing each other's feelings, but through Fruits de Mer (their MMO equivalent to knowing more of each other online), they unknowingly expose more of their behaviour through their online guild, and from start to end. Even with best wingman Homare Koiwai (Sakurai's partner in crime, which was lucky that I thought his intent to steal Morimori away was the ONLY link between both Sakurai and Morioka, encouraged the former more to reach out to her), all the characters, each with their own motives, work for the best for their partners or each other.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, the storytelling isn't the flare of the show, but the character development ups the notch for what this show became to be towards the end. The art and animation direction might look basic and it isn't great to begin with, but it humbly gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as always, the OST is a delight to listen to. The OP, ED and the gaming-BGM are some of the best for the Fall 2017 season, and for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum this short but impressive anime IMO, the Fall 2017 season has some good shows, and this is one that stands out for the progressive aspect. As summed up during the preliminary season, a lot of people will only take notice at the midpoint of the show after hearing the \"progressive, or better yet\" praises of the show. If you love rom-coms without the nonsense that you've been watching for a lot of typical romance shows that do otherwise, give this one a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised at what it can deliver, and is comical and \"coincidental\" rom-com at it's funniest and finest.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review might contain spoilers on the anime \"Net-juu no Susume\". Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don't understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.\r\nNet-juu no Susume: A well-cared anime that fulfilled what it promised\r\nAfter watching the 10 episodes of Net-juu no Susume I can not help feeling that the anime lasted very little. However, now it's time to share my impressions.\r\nI mentioned in my first impressions that what difference does it make in a series that the protagonists are not the usual sappy teenagers. And I do not say this because of the factthat they are young, but because of the way in which Japanese authors are currently representing them.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nTherefore, an anime that is not \"Isekai\", where the protagonist is not a prince, where there is no harem, where romance is handled without falling into teasing; and above all, where there is no fanservice, it does not stop being a very pleasant surprise these days.\\n\\n\r\nI must admit that the premise gave me some fear because I thought they would take advantage of both being otaku gamers to use all the aforementioned clich\u00e9s. However, I loved that they handled the two characters very realistically, even at the cost of constantly evading falling into the predetermined formulas of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget that it is a romantic comedy with touches of fantasy, so clich\u00e9s to follow are in heaps. However, every time it seemed that the series would fall into one, suddenly a rudder was given and the course recovered. I'll give some examples later, so let's start the analysis.\\n\\n\r\nThe argument was interesting, although as I said, I had things to be cautious about. A thirty-something woman who by her own becomes a NiNi elite (considering that she has enough money, earned by herself, to maintain that lifestyle), gave rise to many things, good and bad.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the series chose an appropriate approach considering the age of the characters. It is true that the protagonists did not have normal social skills, but at least they were mature enough to deal with it looking to improve. In fact, in the end the series was just about that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here I go to the next point, the script was handled very well to create a good development of both the story and the characters. In fact, I was pleased that they were not afraid to use the whole MMORPG issue as an accessory; to the point that in the final episodes hardly appears.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a risky move considering that most of the current anime looks for the opposite, highlighting its fantasy / videogame elements as much as possible. However, in the case of Net-juu no Susume, this decision proved to be totally correct because it was possible to maintain an adequate rhythm for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the issue of the game was necessary because it served as a motor and link between the two protagonists; not to mention that almost from the start it was left to glimpse that both had previously coincided in another MMORPG. However, by evading the clich\u00e9s that were presented, the logical result was that the game should lose prominence in favor of reality.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do I mean? Let's not forget that part of the plot was that both played with characters of the opposite sex; so it was very easy to fall into the formula of keeping this as the great secret and reveal it in the end, if at all. However, instead, it was decided to handle it realistically by having this discovered relatively quickly.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there was the other huge secret, the matter of which both had already played together another MMORPG. This is a classic clich\u00e9 of the romantic series. The protagonists who have known each other for a long time, even coming to fall in love, but who \"miraculously\", when they rediscover themselves, do not remember each other.\\n\\n\r\nIn Net-juu no Susume this was more credible because Moriko and Yuta never saw each other in real life at that time. However, and paradoxically, soon circumstances forced Morioka to have to create an account using a female character; and for the speed and pressure she decided to use the avatar of her previous game. In addition, Sakurai saw that avatar in the act and noticed that it was very similar to that game.\\n\\n\r\nThere were many clich\u00e9s that were broken in all that sequence and obviously, then simply followed the natural flow of events. All this made me loved the script, to the point of considering it the best of the year. Whenever an author dares to break the formulas he will have my attention; and if he does it in a good way then he wins.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go into the characters now. This was the other strong point of the series. Let's start with Yuta Sakurai, even though he is a young man with \"normal\" behavior, his social skills are not very good. Which is not unreasonable, there are many shy people who are insecure despite age.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as events progress, he begins to make adjustments in his personality. In fact, after a brief period in which he acted on his fears, he decided to listen to his heart and act accordingly. That's why I loved when he saw Moriko's avatar that reminded him so much of that game, he did not hesitate to use a similar avatar to confirm if she was that same person.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a crucial point in the plot. Had he chosen another path, we would have followed the classic formulas of keeping the secret until the end. However, Yuta's decision to put pressure in a certain way represented the will of the creators to go against the preset structures.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLet's now talk about Moriko Morioka. Here there are more delicate matters because even when she was a functional woman; in the end she ended up leaving work and becoming a NiNi because of his insecurities and inferiority complex. Only the MMORPGs gave her the opportunity to break free and act with more confidence without fear of what they would say.\\n\\n\r\nThis escape was maximized by using an avatar of the opposite sex in the new game that started (Fruits de Mer); However, her attitude when circumstances led her to face reality was very mature, although at first she also tried to flee (which at that moment was logical), then decided to face the facts. After all, for 30 years she was a functional woman, she was not going to forget how to act for a few months of NiNi.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, at the moment Yuta confirms to Moriko the name of that avatar that looked so similar to the one she remembered from the game NanterSG; the way the woman ties all the capes was brilliantly represented by mixing her design in real life and in the Fruits de Mer game.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just as for Yuta was to step forward when using that avatar, for Moriko was to give another by daring to call him and ask him directly if it was him. And the best thing is that the development of both until then made their actions never be forced, but natural within all their insecurities.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point the creators flirted with following a clich\u00e9 by having the call cut off just when Yuta confessed that it was Lily; nevertheless, that literally lasted minutes because then he himself managed to explain everything in person, which gave much more weight to the revelation; and it took away all possibility of Moriko's escape.\\n\\n\r\nThe other character to stand out without doubts is Homare Koiwai. Why? Because it was he who served as a guide and catalyst to take Moriko and Yuta along the right path. In fact, many times when the plot threatened to follow conventional formulas, it was him who came to put order breaking the clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nEven his presence was interesting because for many moments it seemed that it would be the third side of a possible love triangle; although later it was clear that he only wanted to help his friend to build up the courage to fight for the girl he liked.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the best of all, that the feelings of both were always firm and little by little both Yuta and Moriko got the strength to fight for that. This became very clear when it was learned that they played Nanter SG together; That revelation gave depth and weight to their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, the waters continued their course and everything ended in an emotional and rewarding end. First because there was a lot of comedy, second because both reached the peak of their insecurities having to share in the same house; and third because Yuta managed to say the words that Moriko so much needed to hear.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the manager confused them as a couple in the convenience store, all those insecurities returned to Morioka who suddenly felt that his company embarrassed Sakurai. It was here when I thought that the series would leave everything unresolved in an open ending (considering that the manga continues to be published)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Yuta managed to let Moriko know that he did not see her that way and that she needed to value herself more. That for me was stronger than a confession of love, because before starting a relationship, she needed to see herself differently. In fact, those words clicked and gave her the courage to remain at her side.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the moment he gets the courage to take her hand, it was great to see that she did not run away and decided to take the next step (technically she had already decided seconds before); and it was here where those words of Yuta reflected their importance because they became the engine for Moriko to leave that comfort zone that she had created fleeing from the world.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical section, here there is not much to highlight. The character design was nice and the animation was regular; although it did his job by not looking horrible to the point of removing the viewer from the plot. From the soundtrack I do want to highlight the ending, \"Hikari, Hikari\" played by Yuuka Aisaka (voice of Lilac in the series). It was a subject with a lot of feeling and every time an episode ended I could not stop replaying it a couple of times more.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the video that accompanies it was very well prepared and I feel that it captured the essence of the series; Even, in my opinion, it represents a lot better than the opening itself.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a series well taken care of, with a plot that went out of the normal thing and that was written without fear to run risks. This, in an industry where there is so much fear of failure is always a positive point. In addition, the execution was great and the whole made this trip a very rewarding one.\\n\\n\r\nI only regret that it lasted so little, this series deserved at least 26 episodes. Net-juu no Susume promised good things and fulfilled. And the best? Which is precisely now that both began to look as a couple when there are infinite possibilities for history to continue narrating their adventures in the game and in real life. See you in the next review.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nA series that dared to break schemes to give us a fresh, credible, interesting and fun story.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating:\\n\\n\r\n8/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

How it manages to keep me watching even thou the stories are sometimes predictable. But some stories are meant to be predictable in a loving way. \r\nHere we got an anime that revolve around two lovely people that are meant to be with each other.It doesn't have any lewd scene in it. Rather tame in a cute way and there is no kissing scene even thou it should. So feel free to watch it with your lovers, friend or sibling. I highly recommend it.\r\nThe art ofthe animation is super safe and there were no boundaries broken.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special but I do have to give a round of applause to the sound director because it feels like a legitimate fantasy MMORPG games.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and the ending song could be better but what can you expect from this kind of limited budget from a first time director.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not really memorable because of limited on-screen presence and I feel like there are saving them for another season which is good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do enjoy every aspect of the show even though I think it could be done better. The ending is not bad and not good either because we all know they're rushing the animation out as fast as they can but can't blame them for trying to make a good show.\\n\\n\r\nThus, I will leave you with the best fantasy phrase ever created ...

            "content": "Just as you think you're gonna have another NEET, who seemly wasted his or her life or has dedicated his life to live in a virtual world of MMORPG, along come this and yes, it's RECOMMENDATION OF A WONDERFUL VIRTUAL LIFE, unlike any anime that has a Hokikomori NEET/ MMO Junkie where one would wanna go in there to drag that guys or gal's ass into the real world , this one features an MMO junkie Mori Mori, who quits her jobs cu'z she disillusioned with the real world and finds meaning in a gaming site Fruits de Mer but in the end she cameback into the real world were she had help from someone who is as awkward as she is. Ok, so at first she maybe annoying where one would pity such girl with a good career only to waste all of it in a game......but you know what, as one goes on watching this, there are things that would make you give her a second thought:\\n\\n\r\nSo............................\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Story:\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime's plot soooo good , was that it features such gender bender in the virtual world where we see the girl playing a guy and a guy playing a girl. The thing about the story plot was that it focuses on each of  character's alter ego where in the game they become someone else which is completely different from who they were. Another thing that make this part soooo good was that it really happens in real life it may not be in a game but it would also be in any form of social site in the internet . Also, the romance between two players in the game whom have from a relationship in the virtual world only go have their relationship takes it's course for real. \\n\\n\r\nDecent 4, Art:\\n\\n\r\nOk, so there were no fanservices around, and there were no moe thing that goes around here, though there is Liliy san being this maho shoujo in the virtual game, her illustrations isn't something to be given such malice.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Sound:\\n\\n\r\nWell for a 37 year old seiyu Noto Mamiko to sound very mature wasn't much of a surprise  cu'z she doesn't have to struggle being a teeny booper, we can say for sure that she is using her natural voice, the same thing with seiyuu Sakurai Takahiro who is in his 40's also uses her natural tone given that he has to play a mature role.......it's not just those two it's every seiyuu that does the voices for the real world characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Character: \\n\\n\r\nWhen we talk about the characters here, we certainly would love to hate Mori-Mori for being this women with a promising career only to throw it all away to become a useless NEET. We would also find Sakurai being this good looking bishonen to only fall for a socially awkward NEET like Mori Mori, but you know,the only character who made such impact around here is Kpwai Homare, whom at first we thought is gonna be an asshole, but it turns out that he's a blessing in disguise who somehow knew the situation of Mori Mori and Sakurai and has to play this go between with the two in order to get them together, never-mind  if he has the gift of foresight as long as he did what he was need to do in order that his former colleague Mori Mori would have finally have a life in a real world and not rot away being a penniless NEED for the rest of her life and for his colleague Sakurai to be in a relationship and not be lonely for the rest of his life, at this point the score is for Kowai......nice job , man.\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Enjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing, the enjoyment itself is the part where Mori Mori and Sakurai meet up and get to know each other's secret, which live up to what was expected.\\n\\n\r\nGREAT 9, Overall:\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime like this to only run for 10 episodes, was well worth it, something like this need not be extended to 12 episode only to ruin the anime as a whole, in fact you can say that it is the best 10 episode that you'll watch, kudos to studio Signal MD. So should this have a season 2??????Ans, no, it has to end the way it is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMichael Flynn OUT!!!!!!!          \\n",

            "content": "A woman walks into the convenience store wearing a plain jacket and blue sweatpants.  She has dark circles under her eyes and her dark purple hair looks like it hasn\u2019t been combed in a week. She grabs two beers in the drink section and walks over quietly to the gift card area, making sure that she doesn\u2019t bump into someone along the way, and picks up a prepaid game card for an MMO. She leaves quietly but always comes back.\r\nThis woman is Morioka Moriko, a thirty-old-year shut in.\r\nAt first glance Net juu no Susume seems like a mediocre show, and I wouldn\u2019t blame anyonewho did think that way. The Mmo aspect is not fleshed out, the plot features a mountain of coincidences, and nothing really seems to stand out. Yet I think this is possibly one of the best shows this season, for the one thing that Net Juu does extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s unwavering focus on our main character\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why Moriko is such an endearing character is because unlike other shows that will straight will either shoehorn in a tragic backstory or completely ignore it afterward, we see the aftermath of Moriko\u2019s unemployment through her mental state. From the million apologies that she makes to her despairing image of herself, we can see the toll that her previous job and current unemployment has taken on her simply through how she interacts with others and how she acts alone. It\u2019s these small details like her rubbing the floor with a lint roller whenever she feels happy or nervous that really makes the character feel closer to us. These details sell the viewers on the character.\\n\\n\r\nThings brings me to the second thing that Net Juu does well, crafting a believable adult setting. Unlike the adolescent driven hot headed edgy High School students that you see in 90% of other anime, we finally get to have level headed adults for once. Going off of this the dialogue in this show is done very well. Characters are much more formal when talking with others. It was honestly refreshing to see a social recluse that doesn\u2019t automatically start blaming the world for her own problems. \\n\\n\r\nI do think the best part of this setting is that it allows for this story of an office woman who quit her stressful job to become a NEET. There is far too few anime that are told from the point of view of an adult, even less that comment on the stressful environment of the workforce in Japan. Even though this wasn\u2019t especially fleshed out, I really enjoyed the backstory of Moriko, and I can only hope that future shows will also try to convey similar themes in their stories rather than just focusing on an overdone High School Setting.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile Moriko is fleshed out as a character, the same can\u2019t be said for the other characters. The characters that Moriko plays MMO\u2019s with, while interesting, aren\u2019t very developed and mainly serve as side characters that she interacts with when she is playing. Yuuta himself also feels a little flat, not being given enough screen time for his problems to really stand out.\\n\r\nPeople who were planning on watching the show for the MMO aspect may be sorely disappointed to know that the MMO world takes a backseat to give more time to romance. Unlike some other people, I don\u2019t think this is a bad thing. The MMO setting of the story mainly serves as a hub for character interaction and a setting made for the main plot, and with ten episodes it would have been nigh impossible to flesh out a real MMO game without hindering the story itself. \\n\\n\r\nI do think that the way the MMO was drawn was very nice. The colors of the MMO world are vibrant, and there are small details here and there that makes it so the world looks interesting. While the mechanics of the MMO are not fleshed out, I think the world was unique enough that it doesn\u2019t bring down the rest of the show at all. On the topic of art, one thing that Net Juu does very well is it uses chibi art design very well. The chibi scenes are all very expressive and are well timed to add to the comedic parts of the show.  \\n\r\nNet Juu is a simple show, but unlike many other shows, it knows what it wants to do and it does it extremely well. While there are many small things that I wished it would touch on a little more I think Net Juu no Susume is an enjoyable adult-romance that will make your tiring day a little better. It\u2019s nothing exceptional, but you know what, it will do. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and Lily is cute af.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Online interactions are an interesting thing. While for many it\u2019s a supplement, something to do when they\u2019re bored. For others it\u2019s an outlet for the things they wouldn\u2019t say in person, lest they be judged. And for another group of the population it\u2019s something much more. Something beautiful in itself. Something so very important to one\u2019s life, one that allows them to live the life that they want to lead.\r\nIt is this latter part that Net-juu no Susume gets so well. Real life can be hard and painful. Work and school are stressful, and interaction with people in real life that seem to have solittle in common can also be a struggle more than a savoir. And that is where MMOs and other forms of escapism come in. And while the show is focused on MMOs, it\u2019s experience translates very well to anyone who has spent a good deal of their time and interactions online. I personally rarely played MMOs, but because I\u2019ve been online for so long I could understand exactly what she was going through and exactly how she felt.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, one of the benefits of these online personas is it enables the user to showcase themselves in ways that they can\u2019t in real life. For example for the two main characters they are able to play as characters whose genders are different from what they are. And this is quite important, it allows for a more wider view of the world as well as lets one experience life in a way that they may feel more comfortable with or more in tune with. It\u2019s another part of them that they\u2019re able to expose and act upon, one that might be locked up if interactions were purely in person. I know this very well from personal experience as my online persona is different from my offline one. And honestly I\u2019d say my online persona is more true to how I am, especially considering some groups that I interact with. It\u2019s hard to exhibit traits that go against the socieital norms in person but online it\u2019s easy. No one has to know how you\u2019re supposed to bound, you get to act however you feel like. And that power goes a long way to show the bonds that the characters have and it\u2019s unique authenticity. \\n\\n\r\nBonds are not just exhibits of proximity but something that can transcend time and space. And in Net-juu they show that very clearly with the bond that the guild has. They don\u2019t know each other in real life. They all came together on a shared interest and with that they\u2019re able to make friends and get close. So close to the point that Lily and Hayashi are able to have deep and meaningful conversations about their lifes and the struggles that each of them face. It\u2019s a touching relationship and it\u2019s wonderful to see two friends that trust and care for each other so much.\\n\\n\r\nNet-juu isn\u2019t trying to judge, it\u2019s accepting of the different factors that lead people to choose the life that they decided to choose. Why can\u2019t the two main characters meet online and form a strong bond with that? Why can\u2019t Moriko decide to give up her business life in favor of becoming a NEET? Being a NEET isn\u2019t only about being talent-less and lazy, it\u2019s about stress and all sorts of issues that one might not be able to deal with. For Moriko there is a clear understanding of the issues of business life and the effect that it had on her mental state. It is also clear how much the game means to her as a release, as somewhere where she can feel happy. She isn\u2019t a talent-less loser, and in fact she was great at her job by all accounts, but it just goes to show what issues and problems that one can have that leads them down the life that they choose.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Net-juu\u2019s strength is in communicating these atypical lifestyles it also creates a great romance as well. Because we get to see the main love interests interact with each other without pretense, in a format that allows them to truly bond, we\u2019re able to see the natural connection and chemistry that is exhibited between them. So while the love interest parts in real life may be a bit samey and tropey, they\u2019re only enhanced by how real and meaningful it feels in the game.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that but it\u2019s able to make a unique show by focusing on a woman who had been well established in the work force rather than the proliferation of young teens that usually dominate romcoms. And while I have no problem with them (and in fact quite like them) this certainly comes as a breath of fresh air while also providing a different perspective that is easier for some to relate to. The characters are also well designed and showcase an array of strengths and weaknesses. Moriko has strengths and weaknesses, and her insecurities related to her position, despite the skills that she does have, is one elements that most people who are jobless can relate to. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this does wonders for establishing their relationship as one to root for. The show may stick itself in common romance tropes but the things it does different are done different enough to make the show impactful and heartwarming. And that\u2019s all that it really needs. It\u2019s not a masterpiece of art design or sound quality, and in fact is more around average in those two criteria, but rather a well designed romance that showcases a unique experience while also providing loveable characters to get engrossed in. I recommend this to any romance fan, or anyone who wants to see how bonds online can work. Because this show nails it. After all it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s online or offline, love is love, and while the show explores both, it shows a unique experience that can only be made online. One that I\u2019ve myself experienced and enjoyed. And to be a good romance on top of that? Wonderful.",

To the point where I would actively skip most of the in game interactions not between the two mains because they were hard to watch, they were also predictable too so I wasn't missing anything.\r\nWhy is this? To put it bluntly, no one in game acts like an actual human being.\r\nI'man avid MMO player myself, I did myhic raiding in WoW earlier this xpac and have a max level character in most of the good MMO's available today. Throughout all my time playing those games I've never ran into anyone who acts like or speaks the way the characters in this story do. It's flat out cringey. While a lot of people, especially on role-playing servers, go to MMO's for escapism and to be someone you're not, they still talk like and act like real people.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if it's like this in Japan (I doubt it), but these characters don't talk like or act like real people, which is crazy to me because the real life storyline feels very human and genuine because they act like real people.\\n\\n\r\nThat's really the point I wanted to hit home with this review: In game, the characters don't feel human, while they feel exceptionally human in real life. \\n\\n\r\nThe game they're playing too also looks like it kinda sucks, to be perfectly honest.",

            "content": "There are three problems with Net-Juu no Susume:\r\n1. The supporting characters: they're practically scenery. They serve no purpose other than to talk to Morioka about herself.  Even when they're the only ones in a scene, all they do is talk about Morioka. They're entirely flat.\r\n2. The in-game scenes: they're simply nowhere near as endearing or interesting to the viewer as the real-life scenes. \r\n3. Over-reliance on coincidence: this isn't as major as the first two. However, Sakurai and Morioka sharing the previous game felt unnecessary. The anime had already done a well enough job showing their connection through the current game, already a largecoincidence in and of itself.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, if this anime had far less in-game focus and were two episodes or so shorter because of it, it would have been better. It's not lost on me that issues like #1 often come from adaptations of the likes of manga (which this is) losing some of the author's original intention, I should add.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, 5 isn't a bad score: Net-Juu no Susume has its own charm, and I certainly don't regret watching it. As cliche as it is to watch two characters be ridiculously awkward about romance in anime, it's a refreshing change of pace to see it from the girl's perspective as the main character. How sweet the main characters are will tickle you once or twice, too.",

            "content": "I must admit, this review will be slightly biased, because I am a 28 year old life-long anime fan, and I often feel isolated in my interest, as I predominantly only talk anime with friends significantly younger than I. As a result, I'd like to think that I connect a bit too much with a character who is older and in a rather shameful relationship with her passion, so I will try to abstain from being too melodramatic in my review and criticism.\r\nStory: 9.\r\nInasmuch as I absolutely adored this series, I gave it a 9 for one very specific reason: as a 10 episode series,the tension the series builds ends significantly quicker than I might have liked. Do not misunderstand, I HATE when series milk tension and do so by utilizing lazy storytelling and plot holes. Net-Juu no Susume, admittedly, wonderfully sidesteps this issue by stopping the rising tension at a serviceable moment, I just simply wish we got a full 12 episodes, perhaps to better flesh out the characters I came to love.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.\\n\\n\r\nStylistically, Net-Juu is pretty, but not gorgeous. Admittedly, I might be biased because this season, Ancient Magus Bride came out and since then I struggle to view art elsewhere as perfect, but Net-Juu still does a great job. Morimori is a wonderful character, but where the show excels, in my opinion, is the way it can cohesively break between portraying slapstick anime-esque comedy bits alongside legitimate moments in which her social anxiety creeps up around her. The art style comically shows her anxiety as darkness swirls around her, etc, but the mannerisms she portrays when talking to people, when she is starting to fall into self-loathing are visible and masterful. While the artwork might not be flashy, I think there is something to be said about the masterful use of refrain and balance in the art direction.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.\\n\\n\r\nAs usual for my reviews, I do not stress too much on this area as it is not within my general knowledge. I can say that I loved the voice acting, and the music helped scenes move along, but never to the point of drawing my attention to their brilliance. I did not care for the opening or closing music, and so I just give it a solid 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10.\\n\\n\r\nAs my review has suggested thus far, character is where this series excels. It shouldn\u2019t surprise you as a reader to assume that in a well-received slice-of-life anime, the characters are what truly keep everything afloat, but this takes it one step further. Many SoL anime I\u2019ve watched revolve around Japanese high schoolers, and for many of us (from English-speaking countries or backgrounds, as I imagine you to possibly be, dear reader) this is only escapism, there is no real connection as we don\u2019t necessarily understand Japanese school systems or share those experiences. However, a series about becoming cripplingly bogged down by the pressures of life and escaping to things like video games (or anime) might be something a little more universally understood by watchers. Perhaps embarrassing to admit, but I certainly understand this predicament. I think this connection makes Morimori\u2019s character arc personal to an audience, and as we watch and hope that her life situation turns around, we\u2019re enthralled by her humanity. There is also something to be said about the fact that unlike the NEET stereotype seen in other anime, Morimori chooses this life after having been in the \u201creal world,\u201d and does not bog down her family or friends with her irresponsible behavior, as wonderfully portrayed in \u201cWelcome to NHK\u201d. She chooses this retreat from society because she is lonely, and the watcher does not want her to succeed so that she can make \u201csomething of herself,\u201d but rather we want her to succeed solely because we love her. That is a beautiful creation as far as characters go.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be straight with you, I neglected homework (ironically) and binged this in a single sitting. I felt awful having wasted so much time consistently, but this was the rare kind of anime that just speaks to me on a personal level and does not allow me to walk away. I might have felt awful about wasting the time, but on a much larger scale, I felt as though I too were undergoing a change of character as I watched the main character work through her troubles. Real life doesn\u2019t work as smoothly as anime, of course, and I would not even begin to suggest that this anime has the power to immediately change a life, but I can at least suggest that watching this anime made me feel better about myself and my own personal sorrows, and that is something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.\\n\\n\r\nI think I\u2019ve said everything I\u2019ve wanted to say, in a meandering and melodramatic fashion. This show just stuck with me, and took two fantastic ideas (struggling with social anxiety and developing relationships with people) and perfectly bound them together. It was funny, it was touching, and it was thought-provoking. It had some small faults perhaps, some of which I don\u2019t even really feel like listing down, but it was damn near perfect. I am very happy to suggest that this show is a solid 9, and only because I do not think there exists a perfect show. Watch it if you\u2019ve ever struggled with shame for being a nerd (and also, knock that off because being a nerd is the best possible way to live your life :D)\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations:\\n\\n\r\n1. Welcome to the N.H.K.: These two are entirely different shows, both in content and direction, but they both fundamentally pivot around the idea of adults who become shut-ins due to the stresses of life. Watch if you like the topic, do not watch expecting the same sort of feels.\\n\\n\r\n2. Knight's & Magic: Again, entirely different tone, but both shows are about 30+ year old office workers who find joy by escaping the real world to a fantasy one. Of course, K&M sends him to a real world, and Recovery is only a video game, but this idea of learning how to happily socialize in an escapist scenario is present in both.\\n\\n\r\n3. Gate: This anime has nothing to do with Recovery of an MMO Addict, but the main character is a 30 year old man who would much rather play his mobile game than chase a career honestly, even when he is sent into an honest-to-goodness fantasy realm. I honestly just recommend it because it is rare to see a 30+ year old character represented in an anime that isn't more serious.",

            "content": "Net-juu no Susume shows us the struggles of life of a 30 years old woman who has had \"enough\" of it all. Anime about adults are not very common which makes this anime special in it's own way.\r\nThe story starts with our 30 years old maincharacter \"Morioka Moriko\" who has quit her job and starts her life as a gamer, or as she calls it, she becomes an \"Elite Neet\". \r\nWhat is noticeable about this anime is the fact that the game she plays comes alive in the anime. The gamecharacters show their own story, not like they are in a game but as ifthe anime itself was truly set in an alternate world. The gamecharacters have their own voices, different from the people who play them, and because of this Net-juu no Susume shows us two worlds: The real world and the game world. This anime switches on a good base between real life and the game world, which gives it this unique vibe.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing about Net-juu no Susume is the story progression. It's not just set on showing the daily life of our maincharacters but more as to how their daily lives develop and how it keeps developing into something greater. It's incredible well written and every episode just makes you want to see more and more.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of the maincharacters is also great, especially for Morioka. Morioka's character development is incredible because in these 10 episodes she transforms from a woman who didn't take care of herself at all and kept gaming, to someone who takes care of herself and found a reason to live in real life again, instead of hiding herself in the game world. Sakurai also needs to be mentioned, he didn't have as much characterdevelopment, however you will see that over the time he grows into a stronger person with stronger feelings. Hayashi and Lily are the gamecharacters, you can't really include them into the development thing as they are just... well... gamecharacters.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters also have a strong influence towards the character development of the maincharacters, and there's not even one supporting character that you'd want to miss. Because of their appearances the story went the direction it went, which is a good one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall is Net-juu no Susume a really good and unique anime that I'd personally recommend to anyone",

            "content": "Well considering that this anime\u2019s only 10 episodes long, and considering how sweet it is, you can probably spare 3 hours of your life to watch something that you\u2019ll most likely end up enjoying.\r\nYes, there is a lot of fluff. Yes, sometimes the sugary sweet scenes can actually be a bit much, and end up making you cringe from the awkwardness. And yes, there are a few frustrating moments when you wish the pace would move slightly faster, particularly near the end (although on the whole it wasn\u2019t too bad).\r\nRegardless, it was a cute, fun and entertaining anime, and the fact that it featured moremature characters than normal was only a bonus.\\n\r\nThe title for the anime is kind of misleading, as it\u2019s not actually about anyone being cured of their MMO addiction. In the sub I was watching, the title was actually translated as \u2018recommendation of the wonderful virtual life\u2019 which I think fits it much better. It\u2019s basically about a group of people who really enjoy playing MMOs. Some of them do it to escape real life problems, some do it to find a place where they fit in, and some do it for relaxation. \\n\\n\r\nAll the players really enjoy and are invested in their MMOs, which I\u2019m pretty sure anyone who plays one can relate to. The games are portrayed really realistically (I mean, I\u2019d actually quite like to play Fruits de Mer after watching this), and so are the friends made through games. As this was a light-hearted anime, it didn\u2019t really cover the darker side of being online, instead focussing on the companionship that arises from shared interests and the friends you develop a relationship with over time. I really enjoyed watching that aspect of the anime; it reminded me of my own experiences in MMO guilds. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n\r\nGreat opening and ending, nice art, and Morioka\u2019s voice actor was just plain awesome (the others were really good too, but hers stood out the most). \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned earlier, this show is about more mature characters (late 20s/early 30s) which was refreshing. A few of the situations were a bit over the top \u2013 I mean, they did act like high schoolers on their first date a lot of the time \u2013 but that was excusable on Morioka\u2019s part because it fitted her character so well.\\n\\n\r\nThere were parts of the anime that did feel flat, and some of the coincidences in the storyline could have been handled better (in particular the big reveal near the end), but overall this was a sweet little show, and I\u2019d highly recommend it to any fans of either MMOs or slice-of-life/rom-com anime out there. \ud83d\ude0a\\n",

Either you like it a lot or think it is promising, or it falls flat and you drop it.\r\nFor me, Net-juu's first episode definitely fell into the second category. However, I still stuck around and it payed off.\r\nUsually the first episode of an anime includes, in any combination, content and promise. It might be a flashy introduction to the series - throwing you head first into the main conflict, or it might subtly hint on these future themes without giving too much away yet.\r\nThe first episode of this show waslacking to say the least. The content was weak: the main character arriving in a game void of atmosphere, and the promise was even weaker: hinting that the rest of the show would revolve around this lifeless game.\\n\\n\r\nI am glad to say, however, that it does pick up after a few episodes. Without giving anything away, let's just say that the theme of the show emerges later than expected. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're thinking about dropping it after the first episode: don't.

            "content": "Sorry for the below average quality of my review but I haven't written many reviews. \r\nThere's only be 4 episodes of the anime aired as of this review.\r\nIf you're considering this anime, I'd highly recommend it. The official plot and genres for this anime did not interest me. I'm NOT a fan of MMO based anime. I like  Sword Art Online but it can be hit or miss for some people. A friend who always gives good anime recommendations, told me I should watch Net-juu even if it doesn't sound appealing, he was right. This anime is different because it doesn't revolve around actionbut funny ,interesting characters and possibly romance and it involves mature(subjective ;) ) characters around their 30's in age. It's not a slice of life anime but people who enjoy those anime will probably enjoy this too.  I've only written one or two reviews but I HAD to write one for this anime because I want to spread the word out there that \"I WANT MORE ANIME LIKE Net-juu.\" \\n\\n\r\nA  lot of anime try too hard to come up with weird forced drama to create tension and struggles and most just feel awkward. This show is entertaining and I really like how the characters once joked about their associates turning everything into a rom-com. I should mention that this anime will probably be highly appealing to people who enjoy immersive settings.  The atmosphere will make you feel like you're right there with the main character watching her play MMO's and watching her life change because of the people she meets in her online game.   \\n\\n\r\nI think the story is a 10 because they pay attention to small and large details and the changes it can make. Some anime talk REALLY BIG about changes but the last episode will show the character doing the exact same routine with assumed character development, it's still too early to say how this anime will turn out but it drew me much earlier than most anime.\\n\\n\r\nI think the art is great but they focus on the beauty of the MMO which I'm ok with because I'd prefer them to focus on the characters like they are right now. The characters are well detailed, pretty, unique looking where needed and the animation smooth and fluid.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing in terms of voice actors, I really like the main characters. I think the music is ok but I don't remember anything stand out. It's still too early , there may be stand out music during some more intense scenes later in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters get a 10 in my book ,from character design details, to their personalities, they get a 10. They feel like real people with many different sides. I don't want to spoil anything so I don't want to mention anything specific.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before I really enjoy the anime, it's funny, interesting, and immersive. From oh Sh!@ moments to awwwww moments. They don't bother with too much action, the anime isn't about action or even character growth. They do go through that a bit to demonstrate a bonding experience but like I said, that's not what this anime is about, not going through that means the anime doesn't use filler and gets to focus on it's strengths and the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nUnless they fundamentally change some elements that are enjoyable right now, I doubt I'd want to downgrade the anime from a 10. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Recovery of an MMO Junkie\r\nI really enjoyed this short series! it really captures what MMO's are all about which is to escape from real life and to be someone else you want to be or inspire to be. \r\nThe story really gripped me on how people share different lives but can come ultimately come together and be happy. The story line was superb! it really captured the essence of shyness and social awkwardness of how our lives can be today with how much social media is an influence now.\r\nThe Comedy element was excellent too, I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe music as well is very peaceful and relaxes you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave it a 9/10 as for such a simple plot, I found myself very engaged. This anime is a little Gem. I would definitely recommend it.\\n",

            "content": "Much like the simple story of this anime, there isn't a lot to say about it as a whole, because really it's quite a sweet, adorable, and easy show to watch/binge. This anime is about an \"Elite NEET\" (self-proclaimed) named Morioka Moriko who decides to play as a male character named Hayashi in an attempt at escapism, who finds her real life and her online life clashing when she meets a player named Lily ingame who appears to not be all that she seems. When she realizes that she has been playing MMOs in an attempt to escape reality and quickly becomes unable to doso even in the game world, she finds that her life begins turn on its head.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I like the most about this anime is how refreshingly calm and simple it all feels. There isn't a large cast of characters, and only about 4 are actually relevant to the story. The romance is sweet and progresses satisfyingly, and best of all the anime is paced brilliantly. There isn't a boring episode or moment that doesn't want you wanting to find out what happens next, which is pleasantly surprising given the premise of the show which has arguably been seen quite a few times before and the aforementioned simpleness of the plot. While I say it's simple, the story does become a little convoluted at a certain point trying to figure out what characters know what about each other, but it becomes cleared up quickly and doesn't at all detract from the anime as a whole. Like I said before, the romance is satisfying and progresses at a pleasant pace, and the characters are likable. Although one thing that did stick out was the amount of lucky coincidences. Again, this didn't bother me personally but it did at times feel a little bit TOO convenient. However this just made for a slightly more satisfying experience when things go the way you want them to.\\n\\n\r\nMy gripes with the show only really come down to how simple and easily digestible it is. It has great characters, great chemistry, and a satisfying, linear plot that is executed well but isn't particularly memorable or new. It's a good spin on a used premise but doesn't really do anything much new except capture this incredibly gratifying sense of calmness and relaxation. The characters don't develop much as people and really the only story was for the two main protagonists to become romantically involved. This is why it doesn't go much beyond an 8 for me, I felt it could've been even higher had it been longer or included further character development, particularly in the side characters that are EXTREMELY sidelined for long periods of time and not given much of anything to do. \\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, Net-juu no Susume is a great and easy to watch/binge show if you're looking for a cute romance between two adults that deals with the fact that at base level, the real world and game world really aren't all that different and that in the end, the relationships you forge no matter where they are should be cherished for a lifetime.",

            "content": "\"Recovery of an MMO Junkie\"?? More like \"The Awkward and Mediocre Love Life of an MMO Junkie\"! The only reason I went ahead to watch this show was due to a campaign that Crunchyroll had, which made me watch a couple of stupid shows that I would normally did not watch. As I knew some were not to my tastes. This show being one of them. I knew from episode one that this wasn't going to be a great show per say, but since at the time I wasn't watching a lot of shows, I would go ahead and see it.\r\nStory: 5\r\nBased on the titleand Opening and Ending songs, I presumed this would be about how Morioka would meet her online friends in real life. Who would mend her past emotional trauma (that led her to become a NEET), and help reintroduce her back into society. But again I was deceived... although I wouldn't have been so disappointed had the direction of the show were for the better.\\n\\n\r\nInstead around the first half it shows Morioka, as Hayashi, after quitting her job, having fun with her MMO pals in Fruits de Mer. Especially with Lily, who she forms a close bond with online. Through a series of coincidences she unknowingly meets Lily's real life counterpart Sakura. And blah, blah, blah later they fall in love.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I liked most of the beginning as with the humor of Hayashi constantly getting killed by a giant hamster, or when Kanbe took over the guild because it was maxed out, or when the team were trying for loot boxes. They were things I could relate to (even though I have never played an MMO before). However it never dived too deep into the MMO, like Log Horizon or other shows. It was more of a platform of expressing the idea of the show, which were online and real-life connections. But even so its portrayal of this was superficial and mediocre. Even though there is a colorful cast (literally) we have very little screen time for them. Mainly focusing on Sakura (and Koiwai I guess). Which I felt was for shame, as this show could have been more!!! Showing the intricate web of connections Morioka has made, and how she has changed as a person from it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with the present story I was frustrated, empathetic, and equally as awkward at Sakura's shrewd attempts to get close with Morioka. Which I kinda liked, as it isn't easy to meet with online friends. Although I was very skeptical at the highly coincidental events and relations between the two, but it was something I got over quickly. Since they have to progress the story somehow...\\n\\n\r\nAlso the love blossoming between Morioka and Sakura is a very bland and boring It's almost as if they intended to make the most short and superficial rom-com love story. I won't deny I was rooting for them to get together, but I admit it was pretty shoddy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nIt's there??? I guess...\\n\r\nIt has very simplistic backgrounds.\\n\r\nAnimation looks okay when still, but there are many frames when the characters look out of model.\\n\r\nCharacters look slightly awkward when moving, especially involving some sakuga (fighting) scenes.\\n\r\nCharacter design is ok, but I really hated it when Hayashi and Lily wore black armor. As it didn't match their avatars hair.\\n\r\nThe design of the monster in the MMO were uninspired, but some are kinda hilarious (again giant Hamster).\\n\r\nBut it becomes very expressive when switching to cartoonish faces. So 1 point for that!\\n\r\nConclusion: Nothing amazing\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 4:\\n\r\nThe opening was good. I liked the guitar riffs that occur sequentially throughout the song, but otherwise 5/10\\n\r\nThe conclusion I didn't like so I always skipped it.\\n\r\nAnd the OST I vaguely remember... It was pretty generic. A few fantasy/gaming songs there, a few sad piano songs there... \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5:\\n\r\nMorioka/Hayashi:\\n\r\nAt first she was fine. But I couldn't get back on how she viewed herself and brought herself to the NEET lifestyle. As all we get was that she stressed past the breaking point. I don't need some deep backstory, but just a little bit more wouldn't help. As it would better justify her actions, especially in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nSakura/Lily:\\n\r\nHe seemed too perfect: Kind, Caring, and Empathetic, and most importantly PLAYS VIDEOGAMES!!\\n\r\nThis kinda eerked me, but don't get me wrong he has communication issues so he isn't \"perfect\". However, there wasn't much for him except I play female characters online, \"I like cute stuff\", and I'm super nice and understanding.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else: doesn't really matter... they don't have a lot of screen time anyway except Koiwai. And Koiwai is the BEST wingman.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall and Enjoyment: 6 & 6\\n\r\nIt was ok, nothing amazing, new, or groundbreaking. I won't deny I enjoyed it, but there is better content out there that grasped the ideas that I yearned for in this show. Then there are also better romantic comedies that have more \"romantic-based\" comedy than this one (most of the jokes are based on the MMO, who guessed...). \\n\\n\\n\r\nEdit: I know this is pretty late from when the show finished. I originally wrote this a few months ago but neglected to finish some parts. I thought it would be pointless to post it now; however, I didn't want my hardworking to go to waste.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nWhen it comes to the gaming aspect of anime's, they rarely concentrate on the relationship between characters. Apart from And you thought there is never a girl online? , which does focus on a gaming relationship, but still has a strong connection to actual gaming. Recovery of an MMO Junkie decides to concentrate primarily on a romantic relationship between gamers.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nThe story begins with Moriko Morioka, a 30 year old NEET, who decides to start playing a game called Fruits de Mer where she meets a player called Lily. However as their relationship grows a whole bunch of coincidences suddenly arise.\r\nWhat I reallyloved about the story and plot is definitely how relatable it is. This might not be true to everyone, but the events that unfolded felt very familiar to myself and it gave me a warm feeling seeing a awkward 30 year old NEET finding true love irl. The chemistry between Moriko and Sakurai was also very well done, every moment between them just warmed my heart and made me want to support them all the way, which hasn't happened for a good while between certain characters in anime.\\n\r\nI also like how the story begins by focusing on the gaming side of things with Hayashi and Lily's relationship, before focusing more on the relationship between Moriko and Sakurai as they become closer and start seeing each other more, showing they have become more comfortable in their lives.\\n\r\nI think the really weak point of the story is probably how coincidental everything was, because Moriko would flashback to a previous game she played and also had a friend there, who also turned out to be Sakurai. Now this has never happened to me and I'm sure it has happened somewhere, but this felt a bit weak for the story, plus we all probably figured out it was Sakurai very quickly.\\n\r\nThe story did end in a satisfying way though, true there wasn't a kiss, but not all anime's need something like this. You can see how the relationship has progressed between Moriko and Sakurai and that they gotten to a point where they are fine with each others company.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere is a bunch of characters in this show, however only a few are really good, but their performance definitely leaves an impact.\\n\\n\r\nMoriko is the female MC and she is a definite example of what a NEET is like, spending all day on games, not getting enough sleep and only going outside for food and other essentials. Her quirky and awkward personality made her a very likeable character, especially when she was interacting with other people leading to some really funny moments. She's a kind person too and is willing to help her other gaming buddies out, plus for a 30 year old woman she can be pretty adorable sometimes with how she reacts to certain things.\\n\r\nSakurai is the male MC, he is a gentleman of sorts and can be a protective guy especially when he grows closer to Moriko. He's very relatable too as there are many times where he was uncertain with what to do about Moriko and whether he should pursue a relationship with her, which he manages to pluck up the courage to do so.\\n\r\nI have to mention Koiwai, because this guy is fu*king hilarious. it's rare finding the best friend character incredibly funny like this guy and the way he constantly teases Sakurai always gets a laugh from me. Despite being a big joker, he is actually a very good friend as he tries a lot just to make sure Sakurai ends up together with Moriko.\\n\r\nYou also have Moriko and Sakurai's merry band of gamer friends, who all seemed kind and helpful (definitely not like gamers these days), they would help with Moriko and Sakurai's problems the best they could and always gave them decent enough advice from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was fairly run of the mill stuff, much like a lot of other anime's I've seen from 2017, but I did like some of the little things that stuck out. For example Morikos pupils were actually white instead of black which seemed like a nice touch to show how the NEET life has affected her, plus it also makes her stand out amongst the other characters. I did like the variety of the character designs in the gaming reality, but some of the outfits seemed pretty meh and I really didn't like the outfits Hayashi and Lily wore when they became partners, they looked pretty ugly. I did like when the style reverted to the chibi aspect whenever a comedic moment happened which fitted the scene nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op was actually pretty good, it had some pretty good music and was a really good metaphor for how Moriko's character acted around people and how it made her think of herself, before she eventually found that person, who made her take risks and become more active.\\n\r\nThe ed was alright too, showing how Moriko's day would go behind the computer screen as she tries to desperately keep herself awake, it was a nice comedic touch.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack did have it's moments especially those moments between Moriko and Sakurai which added a nice touch to their characters and interaction with each other.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThe Romance in this show is probably one of the best that I have seen from 2017, because for once it felt relatable. The awkward way Moriko and Sakurai would talk and interact with each other was very sweet to see and made me like their relationship more and more as the series progressed. I thought a love triangle was going to be introduced when Koiwai started to interfere, but luckily he was just a friendly device to help get Moriko and Sakurai together.\\n\r\nThe comedy was pretty damn good too, especially whenever Koiwai was on screen, because he was the funniest character of the show, true Moriko was funny too, but she was relatably funny whereas Koiwai was absolutely funny with most of whatever he said, plus I really liked the scene where he sneezes from his name being mentioned and actually realises it, which is something I have wanted to see broken for ages.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a nice change from the usual gaming anime's that focus on the game and action, plus the relationship was really relatable too, which was great to see as well. I really hope a season 2 is made, because I want to see where Moriko and Sakurai's relationship will go next.",

            "content": "The fact that i enjoyed this series is a testament to how modern anime has numbed all of our brains and lowered our standards to levels that we would've never thought possible.  This is an ultra-safe \"story\" where minuscule events are blown out of proportion to make it seem like things are happening, but truly there is almost no development.  Any Disney movie will achieve more in 15 minutes than this series in 3 hours.  It will pretty much never surprise you.   Everything just follows the path of least resistance, free of any twist or conflict, and you are leftwith a non-ending, in typical nu-anime fashion.  Cause hey, maybe this show will get popular and we can milk it for another season right?  Can't just end it cleanly, there is money to be made.  \\n\\n\r\nSo why do you watch it?  Because it does MMOs properly.  It's the only anime that does MMOs properly.  It doesn't try to follow this insane fad that these games are riveting adventures packed with action that the players are completely immersed in.  No, Net-juu understands what MMOs are all about.  Mundane repetitive tasks, chatrooming, pseudo-romances, outfit whoring, cash shop whales, crafting, emojis, holding on to a max level guild, etc.  It brought me right back to my teenage Ragnarok Online days.  The way people play the game and what it represents to them is a very loyal portrayal of how it happens in real life.  The only difference is that the players are adults, who would probably not behave like flustered teens the way they do in this anime.   In general, this made the viewing very comfy and nostalgic, even though i was pretty far from the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead sucks.  She has absolutely nothing going for her, in my opinion.  Unattractive with those silly white pupils, personality boring like a slab of concrete, a non-existent backstory and no explanation on how she can support herself with no income (as is usual for these unicorn-like NEET creatures they have in Nipland).   The other characters are, while not original or impressive, fairly likable.  Lily is very very cute with one of the sweetest voices that i hope to hear more in future animes.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation are mediocre, there is very little eye candy in here.  Occasionally it succeeds at being funny and cracking a smile out of you.  \\n\\n\r\nAll around mediocre but endurable anime, but i would only recommend it if you've spent a lot of time playing MMOs and have diverse and cherished memories of them.",

            "content": "There's many anime out there about being stuck in a video game, like Log Horizon, and there's also a few about playing video games, Quanzi Gaoshou comes to mind here, but none of them really explore what happens when you fall in love with an online personality, a character. Net-juu no Susume tells the story of Morioka Moriko and Sakurai Yuuta who fall in love with each other through the power of MMOs.\r\nGoing into the show the first thing you're going to notice is how bright and colourful and welcoming everything is. The visuals immediately should tip you off that this isn't going to bea very heavy romance with a lot of drama. \\n\r\nThe backgrounds look really good and that the character designs are quite unique and creative and give the show a sense of personality that pulled me in from the first second. The animation on the other hand is nothing to write home about, it works and there's no moments that it's bad, but it never shines either.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core Net-juu no Susume is a love story; a love story which is told in two different \u201cworlds\u201d, so to speak: the world of the MMO and the real world.\\n\r\nWhile both characters eventually meet and fall for each other in the real world, we first get to see Moriko's perspective and how she progressively falls more and more for Sakurai's character. And as the pieces start falling into place for Sakurai he eventually develops feelings for Moriko in real life.\\n\r\nIt's a sweet story that doesn't try to insert needless drama though it has heavy amounts of coincidences to make everything possible. Should you be able to look over those coincidences the show will reward you with one of purest love stories I can think of in anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the love story is pure and very sweet there's some faults that I can point out and the most glaring one is the fact that neither Sakurai nor Moriko really act like adults at any point in the show. It doesn't make a difference that they're both around their thirties, they still act as if this was a high school romance. So if a mature love story is what you came here for then I am sorry to disappoint.\\n\r\nAnother fault would be the way the show writes in side-characters only to have them do absolutely nothing. Out of all the side-characters introduced, and there's plenty, only two really have any actual purpose while the others are mostly window-dressing to make the world feel more populated.\\n\r\nI've mentioned before how the show uses a lot of conveniences and coincidences to move itself along at a reasonable pace and here comes another one of the problems: it's not a realistic portrayal of what a relationship over the internet would be like. Depending on what you expect from the show this may be a huge downside. As an example: all of the major players in the show live in the same town and can meet whenever they want, often times this is exactly the opposite of the situation that two people dating online have where they usually have an insurmountable distance separating them.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Net-juu shines, I think is in its characters. Yes they're not realistic and yes they aren't very deep as characters, but taking them at more or less face value you will be able to enjoy a very adorable main couple that perfectly fits the shows overall tone. The show is worth watching if only to see Moriko stumble through life as she tries her best to live her life the way she wants to (which just means playing MMOs all day).\\n\\n\r\nNet-juu no Susume is a rather short anime with quite a few flaws and only really one trick up its sleeve. It tries to present the cutest most fluffiest romance story you have ever seen and it manages to do it really well. Some people might find the lack of depth to be a detriment and I can't blame them, but if you're looking for an anime to help you unwind or relax then I think it's great for that.\\n\r\nSometimes I just need an anime like this to help me look on the bright side of life and it came at just the right time which is why I gave it such a high score.",

            "content": "Net-juu no Susume is a romance anime that puts its own particular twist on the romance genre by incorporating aspects of online gaming which aims to bond the MCs in the anime. With each episode becoming increasingly pleasurable to watch, i found myself entranced by the series and letting out occasional romance squeals because of how cute the romance developed. However, with it being an anime that only has 10 episodes, there would be imminent flaws such as a lack of character development which would be further discussed in the points to come.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nI'll start off with the execution of the plot and then moveon to evaluating the content of the plot itself. Net-juu no Susume had a pretty rocky start IMOin terms of execution and i found myself cringing a lot at episode 1 and nearly wanted to drop the series. However, due to this anime being a friend's recommendation, i continued watching the series and it definitely improved and i eventually got hooked onto the series. Execution of the plot became more professional and less awkward, which led to it being less cringy. \\n\r\nMoving on to the plot itself, with it being a romance anime, it was imminent that its plot would be predictable to satisfy the fangirls and fanboys of the romance. However, this shouldn't turn you away from watching this series because I honestly believe that for romance and SOL animes its not really about the plot but rather the execution of the series and the lessons we can derive from the series. After all, there has not been any ground breaking romance series that incorporated amazing plot twists and actually has interesting content like the currently trending Isekai genre. So judging the anime's plot relative to other romance animes, it did pretty ok.\\n\r\nWith that said, i'd focus on grading the series' story by its execution rather than its plot, and because it picked itself up and became pretty well executed from episode 2 onwards, I'm giving its story an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nHonestly its art is one of its strongest factors, with attractive looking characters like Sakurai Yuta himself and Morioka Moriko(With make-up on), pleasantly colored backgrounds that are light on the eyes, and ample detail to facial expressions, i'd say it did pretty well on art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending of the series were mediocre in my opinion and i found myself skipping it all the time. But of course, judging openings and ending songs are subjective. \\n\r\nI'd more want to focus on its OSTs and how it is used in the series. I would say that throughout the series, the OSTs were also mediocre and pales far in comparison to other OSTs from other anime such as Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso with amazingly emotional OSTs such as \"Yuujin-A\". So yeah all in all its quality and its use of sound can only be argued as mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10\\n\r\nI often find myself cheering the MCs on in this series, they each have their flaws such as Sakurai's lack of confidence when it comes to hitting on the female MC, and Morioka's inferiority complex where she deems herself as inferior to many other individuals and choosing to interpret their words and condescending comments made at her. However, behind its flaws were really attractive personalities that were pleasant to watch. \\n\r\nAs i also said, with Net-juu no Susume being only a 10-episode anime, it lacked the time to delve into issues that the characters faced. Most of the issues merely scratched the surface and were superficially addressed. This made the characters seem borderline shallow. \\n\r\nHowever, taking into account the fact that it had 10 episodes, it did sufficiently well, and i could say this because i did find myself being really attracted to the characters and thus, i'd give its characters a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI highly recommend this series if you want something relaxing and chill. Its romance is cute and its characters are attractive. More work could be done to further develop its characters and not resolve their issues in a lacking amount of time and in a shallow manner. Overall, KAWAII ROMANCE THAT I QUITE ENJOYED.",

At any rate, I think it would be best to give Signal.MD the benefit of the doubt since 3 OVA specials have been announced as soon as the anime stopped airing so my criteria could be subject to change.",

Despite going against the odds with weak animation and a new director, I was more excited for new episodes more than any other show this season. Similar to Ore Monogatari, everyone is just there to have a good time, with enough heartwarming moments to make me smile through the entirety of every episode. I was so disappointed when I found out there would only be ten! Well, I guess I'll just have to wait for the OVA and read the manga!

            "content": "I loved this series, just finished watching the last episode today.\r\nEver since I heard the premise I immediately knew I would enjoy this anime and to my surprise I loved it with its cutesy art and funny characters. \r\nOne can not talk about this anime without mentioning the OP done by Megumi Nakajima which was just beautiful and I loved getting to the next episode to hear that OP every week; It was a great song to look forward to. As for the rest of the OST its generally great all round and helped certain scenes tones which is important as this is a comedyanime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters can be summed up in two words: simple and lovable. What I like about Recovery of an MMO junkie is just its carefreeness which allows me to just sit back and enjoy it. Lily and Hayashi's interactions were engaging and enjoyable to watch as they quest through their adventures in the MMO. What I liked about the interactions between Lily and Hayashi is that it reminded me a lot of when I started to play MMO's and watching them both work together was just pleasing. However the interactions between Sakurai and Moriko are priceless and in my opinion making this series a great comedy to watch. Watching them get emotional over the littlest of things is hilarious and how they react to each other is even better.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art style I would immediately give it a 10/10 no doubt about it. The art style helps maintain the theme and tone of the anime. Bright and colourful which really helps the characters shine and separate it from others of its genre. This is mostly seen with Lily to ethicise her cuteness(#LiliyBestGirl).\\n\\n\r\nThis animes theme shares a lot of similarities to Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omottaso if you liked that anime then you most likely will enjoy this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I loved this anime, its simple but fun and I loved coming back every week to watch another episode. If you don't like simple animes then this might not be for you but its worth a try anyway. Give it three episodes then see what you think. Its such as shame its ended and only had 10 episodes. Lucky they seem to be releasing a Special as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score 9/10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Net-juu no Susume was the standard romance-comedy most may be accustomed to seeing but it had some little changes to that formula here and there to differentiate itself from its contemporaries. Where this anime really excels in though is in its execution. It kept a really good consistency in its quality throughout its run time which was slightly shorter than usual at ten episodes.\r\nThe story centers around the 30 year old Moriko as she withdraws from society and begins to interact with people in the online world of games where she feels more comfortable. It is interesting to note that the potential romance that takesplace with the main pair in the story are between two grown adults so that in itself lends itself to differences in how the story will be handled with the caveat being that both of them are socially awkward people. While I thought everything ended of nicely in the show, I thought it would have benefited greatly if the side characters maybe got a little more development seeing as some potential story lines were already set up from early on.\\n\r\nI thought the art style was well done in that it was very colorful yet I didn't feel like it was overdone. The soundtrack for the most part was unnoticeable but at the very least I can't say that it was bad.\\n\r\nNet-juu no Susume had a nice cast of characters. Moriko was very adorable and funny in all her awkward glory. Yuuta has a heart of gold which matched his various online personas. Homare has a good and infectious kind of personality and is the best wingman Yuuta could ever ask for. The rest of characters that didn't get much development within the season are all likable in their own right. \\n\r\nI got a lot of enjoyment from this show and it was a nice show to look forward to each week. If you're looking for a new rom-com to watch then I recommend that you give Net-juu no Susume a try.",

Well, on first episode I could see it is much more.\r\nStory: 7\\10 - The premisse is simple, it is a romance between a couple that are friends on a mmo and happen to met in real life, but the surprise is how amazingly it is executed. The romance is great, the comedy, really good and the display of real world\\game is really well done. On the other hand, there are exceeding coincidences that makes the show look a bit contrived and the ending, although making ckearwhat will happen, it isn't conclusive at all and don't look like a real ending (I know the manga isn't over yet, but I'm giving a score on the anime and there probably won't be a season 2, so not being conclusive harms it).\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: 7\\10 - Again, simple but creative and effective. I really like the opening, both song and animation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\10 - All the characters are charismatic, funny, at least bit complex and the relations between them, be it friendship or romance, are well displayed, relatable and surprisingly clear (and thank God, at least in this show there isn't a fucking love triangle). Even the dynamics between the character in real world and their characters in the game are realistic (they aren't exactly the same in real and virtual life, but similar and recognizable), but the best is that they really resemble real people and they are adults facing different problems if compared to the usual highschool couple. It really deserved a 9, but, besides 4 of them, the other characters didn't get much screentime or development. This was the right choice since the show have only 10 episodes and really should focus on the main couple, but still... It would be better with 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\10 - It was really good to watch, heartwarming and funny, but clearly a bit more than that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\10 - Not the greatest show or best anime of the year, but still a really good one.",

It was a really nice surprise that they put effort and through in making this since this could have easily became very cliched run of the mill anime. But with vivid characters with their own faults and strengths and not to mention all the awkwardness that came with them made this very cute, compelling, realistic and humane. Both main characters were similar in ways but with their unique strengths they complemented each other and managed to handle these awkward situations and managedwork around them. It was nice to see how the main characters history and passion towards games and gaming lead them through different ways to this particular setup. We also got to know these characters and some of their friends and people close to them that really forwarded and benefited the plot in their own way. Since this story was centering mainly on handful of characters it was very intimate-feeling and this made buying their relationship more easier. \\n\r\n     Story and characters were the strengths of this anime, art and sound were ok-good. Since this was really heartwarming, cute and humane its core it gets 8.3/10 ~ 8.

I love the storyline. Romance in this series is quite unique. The feelings, misunderstandings, conversations, and everthing just makes you want to know what's going to happen next. \r\n The characters were so close yet so far.Each and every character is unique in their own way.The life of the main characters is shown very well but still I would like to know about other supporting characters too. \r\nUsually my predictionson what's going to happen next are right but this time most of them were wrong. That's how I knew that this anime will be unique(at least for me. I dont know about others.)\\n\r\nWell if anyone is looking for a short and enjoyable anime series then this one is definetely for you.\\n",

            "content": "The pleasant suprise about this anime are the characters - they are increadibly believable, adult enough to avoid unecessary drama and awkward enough to get themselves into enough drama to make you excited about their story.\r\nVERY MILD SPOILERS AHEAD.\r\nThe story itself develops as most people would expect, but at certain milestones it positively suprised me to see them resolve the most obvious conflict maturely. Those of us who have some experience with social anxiety and self-esteem issues will probably relate well with both characters. \r\nI enjoy Moriokas struggle. She has a well shown and hard case of the burn-out and it's the primary obstacle inher relationships. Both Sakurai and Koiwai each in their own way don't pick up just how much it has affected her self-worth because they like and respect her. Compared to most highschool romances this is quite refreshing; it's not some ominous insecurity the character seems born with or an overly dramatic background that makes everything hard whenever the plot demands it. It doesn't feel forced that the reason the characters don't understand each other is because they have different perspectives on reality. Morioka is hyper-sensitive about how she comes across because holding up appearances made her snap in half and the people she interacts with don't understand it because from the outside it really isn't all that bad. \\n\\n\r\nNow some words on the Art: I initally planned to give it an average rating because it's not very flashy. But it suits the story very well and I'll acknowledge that. I will also give them credit for the notable nuances in the age of the many adult characters. \\n\\n\r\nI loved their take on showing the MMO - it's reflects both the player immersion and ingame mechanics. One of my favourite scenes is where Hayashi and Pokotarou talk about their issues and Pokotarou is non-stop-crafting because that's what players do when they just hang out in a town chatting with another player: have their character do some afk-able, stationary task.\\n\\n\r\nThis should have been tagged Romance and Slice of Life before it was tagged Game or Comedy. \\n",

            "content": "Story: For me seeing a woman in her thirties becoming a neet is entirely new for me. I think it is a kinda funny concept where she starts to meet new people online and begins to meet them in real life too. I like how Morioka and Sakurai are slowly becoming to like each other because of the characters that they had played online. Not only using the characters Lily and Hayashi like they are Morioka and Skaurai is great in the first couple episodes, It really helps with the story.\r\nArt: For me I like the art of the game that they are playing andhow the characters they play look really cute and likable, but the people in the anime also have great looking eyes in this art style, as well as the hair. Those are the first things I look at in a character and a person in real life, so to get that down makes the art looks nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: For someone who listened to the people actually talking as well as reading the subtitles the sound of the characters are great. They do good transition talking when they go from a game character talking to the person in real life. With and without headphones was nice to listen too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I like Morioka and the other characters. I love how Morioka can have her cute and funny moments in this anime. She, just like the rest of the characters, give almost the same reactions as I do when there is some kinda cute or romance moment in the anime, which makes it more fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall I give it a 9. It shows me funny and romantic parts enough to get me attached to the show. This may be my first review on here and I maybe overdoing the score a bit, but I haven't laughed and had fun watching an anime in a while. I normally just space out when watching anime's(unless its showing funny or eye catching moments), but this one did a good job keeping me on my toes. I would give it a 9 because I love it that much, but to make it look like I'm not overpraising this anime because of the \"Clique\" moments I will give it a 9.",

Talking about your problems?! \\n\r\nJust for that point this anime its worth of a try. Especially if you are also a salty bastard who hates anime like myself.\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI\u2019ve written about my World of Warcraft days in the past. How I would obsessively get lost within its continents as I raided dungeons, finished quests, and earned achievements. I remember it vividly. I hailed from Ironforge, taking on the guise of an old, gentlemanly dwarf with a formidable white beard.\r\nBelieve it or not, I\u2019m neither short in stature (but instead slightly over six-feet tall) nor at such a wizened age (but instead as spry as ever). But that was part of the fun of playing the game: being somebody else within a fantastical land.I would venture a guess that Net-juu no Susume concurs. That it would even go so far as to advocate that games can \u2013 and do \u2013 lead to even greater happiness.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nIn a medium rife with high-school settings and teenage-centric dramas, anime romance stories tend to revolve around people of a relatively younger age. Not that that\u2019s a bad thing, for some of the best shows ever derive from such a premise. Still, when Net-juu no Susume pushes back against this norm, crafting an adult romance story instead, the change of pace is no doubt a welcome feeling for fans of the genre wishing for a tale a tad bit fresher than usual.\\n\\n\r\nTo get at that new-car smell, the anime splits its time between its two important halves: the game world and the real world. An imbalance exists, though, as the real world receives the most emphasis while the game world acts as little else besides the initial bridge for the plot to occur. Yes, the anime provides common details about item drops and fighting enemies, but Fruits de Mer (the title of the MMORPG they play) cannot exactly be called unique let alone substantial.\\n\\n\r\nThis imbalance isn\u2019t so much a slight against Net-juu no Susume as it is an observation that this story revolves less around the game they play and more around the \u201cgame\u201d they play. However, this sense of imbalance does carry over into much of the rest of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the vital romantic elements can go either way. On the one hand, watching Moriko and Sakurai slowly stumble into their respective lives, struggle with their feelings, learn more about each other, and ultimately find solace in the love shared between them stands as a major positive throughout the season. On the other hand, it can seem unsatisfying at times. Despite the adult premise, the actual romance hardly goes anywhere spectacular, and the overall payoff amounts to very little (with the finale coming quite close to giving nothing at all).\\n\\n\r\nSuch trepidation is likewise imbalanced. The direction of the narrative follows a gradual pace because of Moriko and her lack of self-worth, so it makes sense that the events themselves commit to slow changes, baby steps towards a better life for the female lead. Yet it can also encounter a trouble or two. Uncanny plot conveniences. Weak dramatic moments. While the story does move along in a purposeful manner, these issues can occasionally hinder Net-juu no Susume and its straightforward path.\\n\\n\r\nThis imbalance once again leads to another imbalance regarding its themes. On the surface, the anime includes several talking points about social anxiety, problems in the workforce, and the value in having a passion. And, to some extent, the show tries to incorporate them more readily as they translate into that earlier game world or otherwise feature as specific scenes throughout the season in that narrative direction. But these potential themes appear to go to waste as their exploration only reaches so far, lightly touching on these ideas without truly delving into them. They no doubt drive the story; they just don\u2019t put it into high gear.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, across its ten episodes, Net-juu no Susume certainly has its moments and its aspects worth praising. However, its noticeable flaws keep the show in check, preventing it from excelling beyond a middling ground.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Net-juu no Susume, its artistry can lag in similar fashion to its story.\\n\\n\r\nBut first some positives are in order. The jokey style which squashes the characters\u2019 looks and gives them a sillier representation throws in another twinge of comedy for the anime\u2019s benefit. Moriko\u2019s reactions of incredulity and of embarrassment are common examples as to how this style is used to strong effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also a nice sight. Their looks within the video game they play \u2013 different outfits, varying physical builds, color choices \u2013 create an easy dichotomy between the fantasy and the reality of the situation. Once again, though, it\u2019s Moriko who offers the best example with a contrast of her own. After she cleans herself up a bit, she moves away from appearing like a disheveled shut-in and towards a beautiful woman, highlighting a wonderful transition for her character on a visual level.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, however, the anime swings to the opposite side with difficulties in other parts of its art. For instance, not a whole lot of fluid actual animation in the daily actions they take goes on. Even their mouth movements tend to be subpar at times. Moreover, lighting and shadow details aren\u2019t the most refined as the normal brightness tends to be too bright and the heavy blackness underneath jawlines tends to stick out too much. And the background pieces are usually very plain both in and out of the game, leaving much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, the collective artistry within Net-juu no Susume is not horrible by any means. But it is also fair to say that the presentation isn\u2019t the most impressive either. So, at the end of the day, what the anime offers is certainly serviceable \u2013 but that\u2019s about it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nNet-juu no Susume is a story centered on two everyday people: Moriko Morioka and Yuuta Sakurai. While nearly every other side character goes underutilized, either in their involvement or in their own connections within the group, these two receive a worthwhile amount of attention.\\n\\n\r\nMoriko describes herself as an \u201celite NEET\u201d, a person who has voluntarily chosen to resign herself to a life filled with no job and no prospects but fun in the form of indulging in her addicting hobby. This hobby? Playing massively multiplayer online role-playing games (or MMORPGs for short). When she isn\u2019t using her lint roller, apologizing profusely, or sleeping, she is almost always found sitting down at her gaming station for another long night of key presses and mouse swings.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the anime does not divulge much of Moriko\u2019s past (e.g., with a flashback episode or the like), but it does provide glimpses of what she has experienced as well as slight traces of how her previous difficulties have haunted her. She revels getting lost in her \u201csafe\u201d world where she must only deal with imaginary monsters within its rolling fields and its quaint atmosphere as opposed to the \u201cmonsters\u201d which reside outside. In fact, she creates a character unlike herself \u2013 a happy male hero named Hayashi \u2013 to accomplish her goals even further.\\n\\n\r\nCombined with her fear of social interaction, it\u2019s clear that she uses video games as an escape, to hide herself from problematic possibilities. Her feelings of ineptitude and her general sense of depression thus push her away from living in a healthy manner and towards a secluded, lonely existence with only the lights from her computer screen to keep her company. Harsh? Absolutely. But, as they say, \u201cthe truth hurts.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not all negative amongst the pixels. Her guildmates value her presence and offer advice here and there. And, most importantly, she forms a tight bond with her best in-game friend: Lily, the caring female healer who sits atop the trees with her.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, unbeknownst to Moriko for quite a while, Lily is actually Sakurai, the man who she accidentally bumps into on a day like any other. He likewise does not have much of a past to speak of, and he does not have nearly as many worries or personal conflicts to manage, so he is thus not as intriguing of a character when compared to his crush. Nevertheless, Sakurai (as Lily) becomes a huge source of support for Moriko (as Hayashi), sincerely listening to her troubles and closely working with her as fabled partners.\\n\\n\r\nThe parallels run deeper between Moriko and Sakurai, for they both (subconsciously or not) wish to be more like their respective game personas when out in the real world. She hopes to be more outgoing and regular; he hopes to be more caring and supportive for another.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully for them, they have a cheerful, mutual friend named Koiwai. He spurs them on from afar, wishing only for the best between these two lovebirds. He pokes at Sakurai to have him come to terms with his thoughts and feelings. He goes on a date with Moriko to simultaneously boost her confidence and pump up Sakurai even further. He puts effort into playing their online game and scheduling indirect meetups to go the extra mile. Koiwai is without a doubt a true companion and an awesome person in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nHis actions help Moriko and Sakurai along, and their intertwined moments do so for each other as well. Over the course of Net-juu no Susume, they realize their connection is worth its weight in (in-game) gold and then some. Moriko explains how she is extremely grateful for everything he has done for her, and Sakurai in turn confesses how he cherishes the fact that he even met her in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, Moriko gains some self-esteem, and Sakurai gains the opportunity to watch over her directly. The two of them moving hand-in-hand towards a brighter future together.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nAfter hearing the show\u2019s many audio offerings, it\u2019s clear that they are one of the best parts at its disposal.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Net-juu no Susume perhaps relies on its main fantasy piece of music overly so from its original soundtrack. But the nostalgic tune carries a lot of emotion regardless due to its simplistic nature and its docile instrumentation. The \u201cscary\u201d, carnival-esque music which accompanies Moriko\u2019s downtrodden feelings makes for a nice aural way to convey said feelings. Even the simple little jingle between the A and the B parts of every episode \u2013 to which one cannot help but whistle along \u2013 has a spring to it that provides the anime with that extra bit of finesse.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting performances also deserve some praise. Reina Ueda continues to have one of the cutest voices in her field, giving Lily a heartfelt tone that soothes the soul. Takahiro Sakurai as (coincidentally enough) Sakurai speaks with a very calm cadence which allow his words to comfort Moriko that much more. And speaking of the female lead (and somewhat coincidentally again) Mamiko Noto wins the trophy out of the three. Her various responses, deliveries, and noises capture the sensitive yet mature woman as well as could possibly be.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the opening track \u201cSunday Night Question\u201d and the ending track \u201cHikari, Hikari\u201d both shine in their own ways, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP blends synthesized and grander sounds, bringing about a duality of a song. Its somber first half hints at optimism in its second half, and the opposing instrumentals somewhat mirror the gaming-versus-reality motif of the show itself. Also worth mentioning, the catchy notes and the soft vocalizing go a long way towards making the piece a treat.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ED, it plays out as if it were a sweet jam session with tons of heart. The shifting pace. The multiple guitars. The smooth bass. The playful lyrical delivery. The nifty solo to ride it out. It all combines into a fun-filled song, leaving the audience more smiley and more uplifted than they had been before listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Net-juu no Susume doesn\u2019t necessarily create anything incredible across its music and sound choices. However, they work quite well within the context of the anime, and they\u2019re well-executed enough earn a shout-out or two even after finishing the series up.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m writing this review months after major controversy plagued this show. I haven\u2019t yet talked about it myself, so I figure I should throw my own two cents into this well as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor those not in the know or needing a quick refresher, observant individuals noted that the director for this anime committed to some rather awful ideas on Twitter. That is to say, his Antisemitic remarks and other related comments were obtuse, vitriolic, or otherwise unbecoming.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was liked by a sizable chunk of the community, and so this debacle sparked a necessary debate. Specifically, if someone loves a piece of media, only to later discover that the creator behind it took part in reprehensible behavior, should this new, truthful fact influence his or her attachment to said media?\\n\\n\r\nEven simpler, should we separate the art from the artist?\\n\\n\r\nStrangely enough, my younger brother, my brother-in-law, and I had an extensive conversation about these questions over a family dinner at a restaurant not too long ago. We debated both extremes, but, in the end, we agreed on somewhere in the middle. That a person must always try to keep both sides separated \u2013 but that everyone has a line of tolerance which, once crossed, makes it almost impossible to fully appreciate the body of work as its own entity.\\n\\n\r\nThis line changes in location and shape for many reasons. It depends on the content and whether that person\u2019s views influenced or affected the work. It depends on how much value is placed on the 99% of others who contributed their efforts and who uphold legitimate goodness (or, at the very least, do not spit such vile statements). It depends on the consumer\u2019s personal life and the variables they deem relevant. And so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I consider this viewpoint, it makes for a tough predicament since I like this anime. Moriko is a super-likable character and an attractive lady to boot. The romance had me all giddy with excitement since I\u2019m a huge, huge romance fan. The miniscule video-game traits got the gamer in me nodding my head. In other words, this anime entertained me for sure.\\n\\n\r\nYet the lameness still lingers. While I\u2019m not Jewish myself, I find the rhetoric completely cruel and lacking in sympathy for those who were persecuted and who were mistreated. Moreover, I get upset at people who spout such gross misinformation since it only harms and misleads others.\\n\\n\r\nBut we also shouldn\u2019t forget about those other factors involved. The studio overseeing the show denounced and distanced the director, refusing to let him tarnish the project anymore (which could be argued as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d). And the original author of this story (as far as I am aware) does not hold remotely similar views, meaning that, at its core, the anime does not derive from an evil place.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in total, it doesn\u2019t fully cross that proverbial line for me personally. I was forced to move closer to it than I ever needed to, of course. Plus, I would be lying if I wrote that this incident would never be linked to this project during my own discussions about it from here on out. Regardless, let\u2019s hope that we do not encounter a similar debacle again anytime soon, for a good show like this one deserves better.\\n\\n\r\nNet-juu no Susume promises an adult-romance tale, and it follows through on that statement plus a little bit more. While the controversy surrounding it cannot be outright ignored, and certain parts are mediocre at best, the characters, the audio, and the entertainment in general put the anime above the median. No guises, no white beards. Just an interesting experience.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, while imbalances in execution exist throughout the narrative, it has enough going for it romantically, structurally, and thematically to not fall behind\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Fine, a set of nice designs and the occasional jokey art style offset the plain, unadventurous visuals which persist throughout its entire run\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Moriko and Sakurai grow a lot from their relationship, Koiwai is a friend everyone deserves, but the rest of the supporting cast are sidelined to a noticeable extent\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Good, the OST, the VA performances, the OP, and the ED are a strong positive, even if next to nothing sticks out as outstanding\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, a likable project which inadvertently caused an important discussion within the community itself about separating the art and the artist\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Okay, so here we have a very slow-paced romance story about two innocent adults that both love MMORPGs and somehow have quite some history with eachother, live in the same town and even meet eachother! What are the odds, right? Well, I can't really say much positive about this thing more than that it's somewhat fresh to me and wasn't that boring along with having just a few relatively touching moments that made me smile a bit. So, let's get onto why I couldn't possibly give this more than a 6/10 and that's me being generous.\r\nThe first thing is that it is supposed to berealistic yet it feels way too unrealistic, there is a limit to my ability to suspend disbelief even after all I've read but the coincidences here are baffling, stuff like not only knowing eachother from a previous game but also living in the same town, meeting without knowing and knowing eachother in the game and somehow ending up in the same server and meeting eachother almost instantly when logging on for the first time? Come on. \\n\\n\r\nIt's meant to be a touching romance story, but it just lacks zest and the story is too slow for its own good, maybe compressing these 10 episodes to 5 episodes would've been better(about the size of a movie), removing superfluous parts and ending up with a slightly more intense story. As it is right now, I just don't feel much about them and their story is too shallow. The way the author wrote it, there's nothing more to do and the story just ends abruptly after they get together(or almost does), because there is literally nothing else that matters here, the only thing this story was about and the only thing that made it readable was the short story about their experiences together and how they end up getting together. It has nothing more to offer than that, no comedy, no good romance, nothing. This isn't bad per se, but it just doesn't leave any lasting impression, there just isn't any impact or parts that would make me feel immersed and for me to care about the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the idea of this being a MMORPG world. This would've been more interesting and realistic if it was a futuristic VRMMORPG, but a normal MMORPG? Might've been a bit better if I was still playing MMORPGs like I did several years ago, but I also feel like it's also because I've played a lot of MMORPGs that I feel so put off by the ridiculous relationship these players have and that they somehow can express emotions and know what someone is thinking when they're just writing some messages, they're not even in voice chat or anything. It feels so damn forced and unrealistic and all these little weird, out of place and pretty much impossible things add up until I feel it's hard to enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't make it better that the MMORPG element was clearly there only to make a story, the MMORPG thing was never really used, it never mattered much, they never did anything in-game except talk and talk and talk and talk as if they were meeting up IRL, giving tips and talking about their IRL issues as if they're best buddies from school/work... Never before have I seen a \"game\" anime where the game part was so utterly irrelevant. They might as well have chatted in a chat app or something and it wouldn't have made much of a difference. It truly feels like the author has little to no experience with MMORPG's and just wanted something easy to write about, just the idea that \"people get online, meet, play and talk!\" thing and everything else was unimportant. Why even make it into a game anime in the first place? That's just annoying.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this doesn't deserve to be called a \"comedy\", the \"funniest\" thing that happened was when the guy playing lily elbowed the mc IRL by mistake, knocking her out cold. This might've been way better if more focus was put on the humorous element, which would balance out the unrealistic/illogical parts and also make it way more interesting overall but instead we have a dull anime masquerading as both a \"game\" and \"comedy\" anime despite having pretty much none of either. It's kind of sad.\\n\\n\r\nIt was no doubt watchable, but it was a fairly monotone journey. It earned a 6/10 because I didn't feel so bored as to drop it and it had some touching moments, it was also refreshing to see an anime that had properly grown-up characters that truly acted their age even if their personalities and thoughts were a bit too dreary for my liking. A more accurate score of 5/10 for \"average\" might've been a better score, but despite making it sound as if it's a horrible anime, I did enjoy watching it, at least I didn't feel truly bored(where you want to drop it altogether). Give it a try, but expect nothing of the \"game\" or \"comedy\" tag, it has none. It's just a slow-paced romance story with shallow story and where every single character is extremely shallow except for the mc and perhaps lily/sakurai.",

            "content": "MMO Junkie is one big build-up to a finale which is totally unsatisfying. Right off the bat, an impending \u201creveal\u201d is set up that will be used as the fuel for all of the dramatic tension of the series. The reveal consists of the main characters realizing that they are actually long-time friends in an online game \u2013 which will undoubtedly result in the beginning of a romantic relationship. The problem is that the reveal is held off until so late into the story that there is no time to explore the aftermath, and that it\u2019s dealt with in the most juvenile and unrealistic waypossible. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the show sets up a nice little opening to a story: Morioka has quit her job due to anxiety and spends her days playing an MMO when she begins bonding with someone in-game, only to meet that person in real life \u2013 unbeknownst to her. They take an interest in each other in the real world, but are too shy and dependent on gaming to advance their relationship. With that premise established, all that\u2019s left to do is reveal their identities and watch as they develop as a couple and overcome their issues in life. Instead, the reveal occurs at the very end of the series, amidst a bunch of forced misunderstandings and delays, so that nothing really happens until literally the final seconds of the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis is disappointing for a number of reasons; for one, it\u2019s all build-up and no payoff \u2013 we don\u2019t get to see how the characters are affected by this reveal. For another, none of the major problems affecting the characters are resolved:  Morioka\u2019s crippling anxiety, addiction to gaming,  lack of a job, and the various problems arising from a relationship between socially-deficient gaming addicts who hardly know eachother are completely swept under the rug.\\n\\n\r\n That\u2019s what makes the show frustratingly and offensively simple \u2013 the audience is expected to believe that love literally solves everything. Two characters love eachother, therefore there\u2019s no need to deal with any of their problems on-screen because the audience just knows it will all fix itself somehow. This is juvenile fantasy to the extreme and an insulting finish to a story that was promising so much more.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else in the story is left untouched after 6 episodes; the videogame itself, the numerous side-characters, and Morioka\u2019s future are just kind of forgotten and never explored again. What should have been a 15-minute scene in the middle of series instead consumes the entire latter half by spending 2 hours showing Morioka idly sitting around while she builds up the courage to do the thing that ends the show.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the writing is generally mediocre; the whole premise is built off of impossible coincidences and stereotypes played completely straight. It's like the writer knows how to set up a good story but has no idea how to finish it, and hasn't had a relationship since the fifth grade. The fact that the characters are well into adulthood makes their childish behavior that much harder to stomach",

The story begins with best girl Moriko Morioka, a newly NEET, who's decided to join an MMO \"Fruit de Mer\". The anime is based on following things that subsequently happen to her. At points, the anime can be hilarious yet cute and romantic at the same time. Recovery of an MMO junkie can also be very relatable to gamers at points.\r\nArt: 8\r\nI personally really liked the art, at some points, it changed for small periods of time, whether that be just before the midwayad or just at other points, it was all still great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OP was amazing in my opinion, I barely ever skipped it, which is really rare for me with most anime.

However, characters like Sakurai, and Morioka (because they're main characters), Koiwai, and Fujimoto got a lot more screen time, so were more easy to connect with. The characters that did get screen time were pretty well developed, so that's good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThe humorousness of the show was super enjoyable, along with the slight romance that begins arising during the series work well together to create a light-hearted, lovely anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIf you're wondering whether or not to watch this anime, I recommend you give it a try, if you enjoy romantic, light-hearted, comedic anime. I would definitely re-watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading",

            "content": "Recovery of an MMO junkie makes an attempt to portray the nature of online relationships and how to bond with people when you don't know their real name or even their real gender. It shows how a MMO can be a place to go when you aren't happy with the situation of your real life and why so many people become addicted to this feeling without portraying it as something completely bad. A strong reason for that is the fact that the protagonist stresses that she isn't someone who became addicted but someone who chose to spend their life gaming and staying isolated at home.She calls it being a \"elite neet\".\\n\\n\r\nWhile there certainly is a focus on romance and finding love online there are also many other aspects like friendship, MMOs in general, the separation and intersection between online and real life. There are also many aspects that allow a fresh take on the genre of video game anime like having parts that feel like an Isekai without actually being one and the comedic moments relying on this fact or having a cast of mostly working adults.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first few episodes we follow Moriko meeting friends in the game and discovering that not everyone is playing the game nonstop, most players go to college or have a job. To avoid being judged, she lies about her life. Because she quit her job to not having to fit into social exspectations, this is an interesting discovery for her. While your identity may be hidden online, you are playing with other people and you don't want to lie to your friends.That aspect is supported by some characters using a different gender online, complete with different VAs. There are many examples like this in the show and shows that, in some aspects, the game is not the thing that makes people keep playing MMOs, it's the relationships you build and spending a fun time with your friends while not having to worry about problems you might have with your life.\\n\r\nThe romance builds slowly, first between the online characters and later between the players in real life. The speed really picks up in the last few episodes so much that is almost feels too fast, but the events still make sense from what we know and lead to a satisfying conclusion.\\n\r\nThe art of the show is nice, the MMO parts look really good and the design of the avatars tells us something about the players behind them, for example Moriko building a character so different from herself to escape from her old life.\\n\r\nRecovery of an MMO junkie is an interesting show with topics not often presented in anime and talks about a topic I've rarely seen being discussed in any media.",

            "content": "Recovery of an MMO Junkie was just what I needed for a light and fluffy anime to clear away some mind cobwebs  of the darker shows that I had been junking out on. Stories about MMO players can be a hit or miss for me. Mainly that they miss out on the human experience of the characters. Maybe an odd thing to say for shows focusing on people playing games in an online world, but it's true. One of my favorite Dramas out there happens to revolve around online gaming and it's true strength is from it's characters. It was a treat to realizethat Recovery of an MMO Junkie was such a story.\\n\\n\r\nMoriko Morioka (AKA Mori Mori) is a refreshing female lead. She's a woman who has had it with her horrible job and dealing with the stress of the living in the real world. She just doesn't give one iota anymore and  is entering the world of being a NEET. She's just gonna play games all day and find her bliss. I think the best part of this drama is how it handles Mori Mori's (I just love that nickname!) fears of social situations and anxiety of dealing with people. It's realistic which is so refreshing as anime tends to take this subject to crazy places where it becomes something of a trope. Even so is that she's still a positive person and wants to give her all. A nice touch! \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to address tropes that are clearly here, such as the male and female leads connections and meet queue. Even going as far as to having them have met before the current story line. Many characters are ones we've seen before and know well. Still they're so well fleshed out and interact wonderfully I can't begrudge it. There's a lot packed into this story and it does a great job with what it's doing. Timing, it's all well played out.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for me was lovely and I loved the adorableness of the online game. It fit the story so well. While I wasn't blown away by the music it was decent and fun as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis was such a treat for me! The nuances to the story and the cast of characters were so much fun. This is one of those romances that builds up and makes you cheer joyfully. The pacing of the story and time frame is so well done. The last episode felt like a cheat as it is a happy ending, but teases us. Don't get me wrong the weird online dream was hilarious! However, how dare they tease me with the hot springs trip and deny it to me. Still a better ending than most anime.\\n\\n",

At first I thought it was gonna be a rip off .hack or SAO but instead I feel like it's in it's own category. The story isn't like .hack or SAO where they get stuck but instead incorporates both their irl and ingame life. I personally play a lot of  MMO and currently have a relationship that started through an MMO so I relate to a lot of what happens. Overall it's a fun, cheerful, embarrassing anime that will want you wanting more. I can't wait forthe next season (I believe there is a 2nd season in the works).",

I'll try get to the point with my review though.\r\nStory: The story follows Morioka Moriko, a 30 year old recently turned NEET who just wants to play MMO's for the rest of her life. She meets Lily another more experienced player online and their relationship as friends starts to blossom. Now my initial thoughts were that, oh wait it's gonna be like other types of virtual animes I've watched and to some extent it is.But the fact that we're dealing with an older character and older characters interacting with her, it makes this anime much more enjoyable. That doesn't mean it escapes the cliches of romance anime, for example a misunderstanding being exaggerated but If I look at this from an adults perspective these cliches don't really bother me as much. I like how the anime bridges the two worlds of virtual and real life seamlessly, it doesn't feel like it's unnatural and in fact I genuinely feel it's realistic to some extent. I'll give the story a solid 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm not too well versed on art, but I think it generally looked good. I never ever saw any muckups with animation or any lack of effort on it. I like the OP animation a lot though. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP and ED for this anime is sooo goood. I love it. Sound is generally is pretty good, the voice actors did a pretty good job, as their respective characters. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I loved Moriko's character so much. The two sides of her being her quiet shy side and her passionate, carefree and cheerful side are great to watch. I don't really want to spoil much of her. The support characters are good too, but Moriko as the MC is really solid. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I truly enjoyed this anime up to this point and I can't wait to watch the last episode soon. I hope there is another season of this. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I give this anime an 8/10. This was a big surprise and I enjoyed this a lot. Go give it a watch.\\n\r\n(I'm gonna update this review at a later point because I feel like I could have written this much better.)\\n",

            "content": "So the first episodes of Net-juu no Susume really made me want to drop it. I had read a review where someone said that the first episode was kinda of boring so even though I didn't care for the first episode I watched the next one. But I didn't care for the second neither, nor for the third one. So why did I keep watching this anime? I guess I wanted to give it a chance and believe what other people had said about it.\r\nIt is only around the 5th episode that things start to get better. I think this has to do with thefact that the story starts to focus more in the real world than in the game the characters play. So the action is slip between the mmo Moriko Morioka plays and the real world. And the real world scenes are just so much better than the ones in the game. I thought the game scenes were really annoying. It just felt like whoever made those scenes does not understand how games and online relationships work in general. People don't log into games to hang out and chat. People log in to play. The friendships made while playing are made while playing, not while admiring the game scenarios and graphics. I know these scenes were supposed to be like a caricature but it felt like the show also wanted to be an isekai besides being a show about a NEET in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nSo when the story starts to take place mainly in the real world it stats improving a lot and it becomes rather endearing. Sakurai and Koiwai are pretty good characters and their interactions with each other are really nice. But that brings me to the other  problem I have with this show: how weak the main character is. We never really understand what kind of person Morioka is because she is always just reacting to what other people tell her. The only moment she seems like having made a decision for herself is when she quits her job but we don't see that happening and never completely understand it. We know why she quit but when we don't see Morioka struggling or talking about it, we can't completely empathize. \\n\r\nWe can't really understand why Sakurai would be interested in her either. His friend on the other hand, it is quite obvious why he would want to get to know her: because he got to talk to her while they were both going through similar situations.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's not a bad show. The mmo scenes are certainly cringy but towards the last episodes it seems like the show became more self aware and started mocking some of these situations. It has nice animation going for it and some comedy here and there. The story is nice and the whole coincidence thing is actually entertaining. It also doesn't make use of the misunderstandings that could easily been avoided cliche, which is a relief because with this plot it could've easily fallen into that trap. Overall, it's entertaining and, for the most part, a pleasant watch.",

In particular I liked that, for the most part, Morioka was actually a non-superficial person, unlike the vast majority of stereotypical anime characters. There was still a little bit of the \"women have to care about their looks\" thing, but the frequent normalcy was refreshing. Finally a female character who isn't trussed up and stereotypically gorgeous. As a result, I could relate to her a lot more, and her character became much more believable. \r\nThey also took care not to alienate theactual MMO junkies who might be watching by not turning it into the expected \"recovery\" story of someone who quits his/her job and is somehow a \"failure\" because of his/her NEET lifestyle. While it does conclude with a vague reference to her potentially pursuing a job in order to be \"successful\", it's really up for interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the representation of gamers and gaming, it did some things well and others not so well. As a gamer myself, there were plenty of cringe-worthy moments where I thought \"Uh yeah, no, that just isn't even close to how games and their social aspects work.\" But there were some accurate representations as well, plus a line that really stuck with me: that MMOs are where you can be alone without being lonely.",

            "content": "Story: 7/10\r\nDespite having \"MMO\" in the title, It's not really an Isekai/MMO-centered story like SAO or Log Horizon. Rather, it's about the players, and how their online life and real life are connected. In my opinion, the concept was a breath of fresh air. However, the execution of the story wasn't the best, as there were times that the plot became uninteresting, as well as lacking in any emotional nuance. This isn't to say that the story was bad, it could have been better, if the writer had put in more thought into developing the current story rather than rush into new events.\r\nArt : 9/10\r\nTheartistic value of an anime is always subjective, and depends on personal tastes. However the art in my humble opinion, is very nice, the color palette was nice, and the animation panels were fluid and consistent. It really gave that warm fuzzy feeling when watching.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I absolutely loved tge opening, \"Saturday Night Question\", the overall use of sounds in the anime wasn't special nor memorable. The OST was meh, at best, but it wasn't bad enough to be noticable. I would say the execution of sound in this is anime is good, but not great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I really liked about the anime. The character development was very nice. It showed us how Morioka-san mathred as a person, along with those around her, and the whole process of maturing was enjoyable and felt natural. We saw her ups and downs in life, how she resolved them. The show brought perspective on the issue of overworking and Karoshi in an indirect manner. We also saw a very human side of the MC, her awkwardness in interacting with others, something we could all relate to. (Most of us). Other characters didn't get too much development due to the small number of episodes, but the interaction between multiple characters with the MC made the whole story feel very natural and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the show was easy to enjoy, for any individual. For casuals or hard-core anime fans, this anime had many to offer. Its humour, romance and relaxed slice-of-life feel made watching the show very enjoyable indeed.",

            "content": "Story: I'll start off with my negatives about the story. First and foremost they never really explain why Moriko is a NEET. They just show her quit her job and that's that. No explanation. Luckily they made up for it with great character development and super cute moments.\r\nThe realism was a little off as well, while it does happen in real life it's Super rare to meet someone who plays the same MMO you do in real life. I get it's for the sake of the story but again pretty rare.\r\nMoriko being a Neet though shows the struggles of people who do not have ajob or any kind of goals or activity they want to do outside of their home. So her development from the beginning to end was really something special to watch. Just slight improvements with the help of others was really something.\\n\\n\r\nAdd in Sakurai and his struggles and the hurdles he had to climb and you get two stories which come together into something really special.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The Art and Animation wasn't anything too great. It was simple but sometimes simple works. In this case it did. they didn't over do it with the graphics when it came to them being in MMO version, and the extra details at certain times was really good. Such as when Moriko would dress up, the emphasis on her make up. Or when she didn't wear make up.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: Opening and Ending were two  of the best of the YEAR. Plus using the MMO music during real life moments was awesome. Something I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I mean Moriko was my favorite female lead of the season, she was just so awesome! Sakurai was pretty great as well, and the supporting cast were great in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this a lot. Probably my favorite anime of the Fall 2017 season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall I would recommend this anime to anyone and everyone. It has a good balance of real life issues along with a great story as well.",

            "content": "Sometimes you got to keep things simple. \r\nNet-juu no Susume is an anime that just hit the spot with relatable situations and characters, even if they are not properly developed at the end of it's run. After all there's not much room for backstory with just 10 episodes.\r\nCharacters:\r\nOur two main characters are down-to-earth persons, even if the protagonist is a NEET. Doing this we, as the viewers, relate to all their situations and problems like time consuption of time, work, relationships, etc. After watching the show I realized I didn't need a proper backstory of Morioka, since her actitude speaks for herself: she makes herselfless on every kind of situation and since she doesn't want to be a bother she just leaves. It bothered me a little the abandonment of the sub-romance plot between other two party members and the misteryous Nico, but by this point I'm familiar with the \"read the source material\" genre.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nLight-hearted, simple and effective. It creates for a good romance with cheesy situations and, since our main character is a (fine) 30 year old woman, more mature concerns in what the start of a relationship is.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to talk about concerning art or sound: it's pretty average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Net-juu no Susume is an average show with a good premise that will leave a smile on your face at the end. I highly recommend it after a stressful day at work",

I enjoy watching animes about living in an alternative virtual world (think SAO, Is it Okay to Pick up Girls in a Dungeon, Accel World, etc). I think the anime serves its purpose for those kinds of fans and those who like romance. I'm not sure how well such a simple plot was dragged out 10 episodes (even though 10 is short). I enjoyed the story though and was very engaged until the episode Hayashi/MoriMori-chan had her big \"transformation\". \r\nI'm not so sure if this is a good introductory animeto romance but it sure is a good fan one. The story also has an interesting art style, something about it has a much simpler style than some of the more recent animes. The art style is unique like \"Say I love you\" in which it follows the style rules (unlike Attack on Titan, IMO). The characters have really interesting eyes, they're more square than circular. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me just say this: Net-juu no Susume left me WEAK. I clutching my chest as I watched it just because of how much I want Morioka and Sakurai to get together. And I was EXTREMELY happy with the ending.\r\nStory\r\nThis is what I really like about Net-juu and this is where I feel it's place in the Josei genre really works for it. The main couple gets together, and the series doesn't waste time with five episode long \"misunderstandings\" that only work to give the show a few more episodes. Want to know why this anime is only 10 episodes? BECAUSE YOU DONT NEED 10EPISODES OF BS MISUNDERSTANDINGS TO MAKE A GOOD LOVE STORY! I'm looking at you Kimi ni Todoke!\\n\\n\r\nThe plot moves at a reasonable place and isn't stalled by anything that would ruin the viewer's enjoyment. It's not complex or hard to understand but it is highly enjoyable. It's also not too serious, which I like, a lot. It has it's conflicts and its moments where the characters have their pensive looks but knows when to break the tension or just let out so that everything's out in the open.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nI like the art of the show the designs of the characters in Fruits de Mer are nice and colorful. The colors for the show in general are vibrant but not too bright, which is good. I like the character design for Morioka in particular as it changes as she changes. We can still clearly tell that it's her but as her relationships in real life get better, her appearance gets better to match it, which is good.\\n\\n\r\nI also like that halfway through the episode they put pictures to mark the commercial break that's supposed to be there. The art for them is really pretty and honestly, many of them I want to keep as backgrounds. They're very well drawn\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI fricken love the OP and the ED. The OP in particular I find to be very unique due to the first 20 seconds or so of it. I'd listen to it all day. The OSTs aren't bad either and are rather good for setting the mood of each scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nAs for characters.....I never found a 30 year old woman so cute. Move over moe high school girls: I want Morimori-chan.\\n\\n\r\nI just love how she develops as a character and it's nice that her personality doesn't just boil down to \"NEET\". She is such a sweet woman and want the best for her. \\n\\n\r\nI also want her and Sakurai to Kiss, get married, make sweet, sweet love, and live a happy domestic life forever.\\n\\n\r\nI like Sakurai. He treats Morioka-San so well, such a gentleman. He's also not stupid. He figured out who Morioka was a lot quicker than most romantic leads would and he also made a move a lot sooner than they would've too. Gold Star right there.\\n\\n\r\nI also find him cute. There's just something about a grown man getting a crush and being a blushing mess that makes me completely melt.\\n\\n\r\nKoiwai is a total bro. He's the best wingman ever! He knew Sakurai had caught feelings before Sakurai even fully realized. He's also really funny and I would love to have a friend like him in real life.\\n\\n\r\nAs for everyone else, I like them too but those were the 3 that stood out the most.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt is very rare that a show makes me ship characters so hard my chest hurts. This is one of them and I love it. I also finished it within 3 days which may not seem like much to others but I have a tendency to take forever to finish stuff. I also laughed a lot while watching. High quality Comedy gives a show a thumbs up in my book.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nWatch it. This is one of the few anime that focus on a realistic adult romance. It is also one of the few anime that focus on both the real world and a fantasy world. I'd hate to see this anime be forgotten.",

            "content": "Continuing the trend of taking alternative approaches to the whole \"fantasy world/MMO\" niche, Recovery of an MMO Junkie follows Moriko Morioka, a 30-year old woman and recently-turned NEET, and her foray into a popular MMO game. Rather than filling up its running time with heart-pumping action scenes or in-game world-building, the show takes a decidedly novel approach to the genre, concerning itself especially with slice-of-life and romance elements instead. Seeking refuge in her newly-found virtual home, Morioka chooses to play as a male avatar, and her fate in the game takes an interesting turn upon meeting Lily, a character she rapidly befriends, and joining aguild of kindred spirits. As the series progresses, Morioka's virtual life and personal life inevitably get tied up, which inspires her to reconsider the path she has chosen, both professionally and romantically.\\n\\n\r\nWhile inside the game, both avatars and world pop with vibrant colours, serving its purpose as a place of fantastical refuge for our low-spirited protagonist. Certain backgrounds appear a bit crude and lacking in detail, but again, this is more to do with the nature of the show, which places an emphasis on the real-world players and their interpersonal relationships than the world itself. Character designs are a bit basic, especially for the majority of the in-game avatars, but still serviceable seeing as MMO characters generally come with limited customization options, and tend to follow a one-note color palette. Real-life Morioka's design stands out as most memorable outside of the game, and does its job quite effectively, with her lifeless eyes and dreary color scheme accentuating her reclusive personality.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is nothing to write home about; it's simplistic and just barely enough for a show of this nature. The only snippets of action present throughout the entire series are generally played to comedic effect so the mediocre animation poses no problem in getting its point across.\\n\\n\r\nRecovery of an MMO Junkie is without a doubt a character-driven narrative. Morioka's personal shortcomings and interactions with her fellow players drive the beginning of the story and eventually, a certain budding relationship takes over until the show's conclusion. What makes the series a success is that it knows exactly what kind of story it wants to tell, and it just does. No toying with the idea of an overarching narrative, or introducing useless character after useless character to get something else going. The confidence and certainty with which things unfold plays a big role in keeping the viewer invested and appreciative of what they are watching.\\n\\n\r\nMMO Junkie maintains a lighthearted vibe throughout, thanks to fun slice-of-life moments and interactions between the guild members. The slightly more intense/emotional moments have to do with the romantic development at the core of the story, but these are never serious enough to induce a complete tonal shift.\\n\\n\r\nA surprising tidbit about the show is that it is fairly cognizant of \"gamer\" culture and incorporates a few MMO elements into the story without stretching it or making stuff up. It also refrains from painting the characters as stereotypical gamers and functioning as a type of anti-gaming propaganda, instead depicting them as the diverse and realistic group of people that gamers can be in real life.\\n\\n\r\nMoriko works well as a protagonist, being just likeable enough for viewers to root for her, and just miserable enough to make her internal struggle an interesting one to watch. Watching her jump through the various hoops she encounters as a gamer with an oppositely-gendered avatar, while dealing with the burden of social interaction in the outside world, is a unique and entertaining experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast, namely the other guild members who support Moriko both personally and game-wise, are a fun group and have their share of enjoyable moments here and there without interfering with the primary narrative too much. Which is a good thing, seeing as some of their antics may have become a bit repetitive and annoying had they been featured more prominently.\\n\\n\r\nAll-adult casts are rare in anime (especially romance anime) so MMO Junkie's is a very welcome change of pace. Characters are emotionally more mature, and there are way less silly misunderstandings (though still some), illogical decisions and clich\u00e9d bouts of blushing present to impede any and all romantic development.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is Sakurai, the deuteragonist of MMO Junkie, and a salaryman by day, MMO gamer by night. The main problem is that he is a tad too dry and milquetoast to carry all of the POV scenes he receives; were he to be featured primarily through his interactions with Moriko in the real world, this problem may have been fixed. The fact that I found myself more interested in his in-game avatar than Sakurai himself goes to show you how dull he is as a character.\\n\\n\r\nFans of both gaming and slice-of-life/romance anime will likely flock to this title as soon as they hear of it, but, while the latter will likely not regret their decision to invest their time, the former almost certainly will if they are misinformed about what to expect. The show's primary motivation is to tell a story of a romantic nature, not one deeply rooted in MMO mechanics and epic adventures/battles. Unless you enjoy romances or at least lighthearted slice-of-life stories, don't expect this show to appeal to you simply because you are a gaming fan. In this case, the MMO setting is more of a flavor than a key element.\\n\\n\r\nAnybody looking for a refreshing take on the isekai/gaming genre should definitely give MMO Junkie a try because it is a (mostly successful) attempt at exactly that. Both the time spent within the game world and that spent in the real world are entertaining and fulfilling in their own ways. Best of all, the characters continually grow, there is actual romantic and emotional progress, and all without ever taking itself too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThough the series falls into a lull about halfway through, it is overall a fun ride and will, at least, hook you in at the beginning and leave you with a smile on your face by the time the final episode is over.\\n\\n\r\nBlending slice-of-life, romance, and gaming elements, Recovery of an MMO Junkie deserves points just for its unique endeavour to provide an original viewing experience. Moriko's growth as a person is conveyed in an entertaining way, making use of both the real and the virtual. While it doesn't merit any artistic accolades nor transcend genre boundaries to win over too many fans of faster-paced narratives, the show still has a very enjoyable story to tell, helped along by an entertaining, mature cast, a decent interweaving of gaming culture, and a healthy serving of romantic and personal development for our NEET heroine.",

            "content": "Story\r\nFrom a story perspective MMO Junkie is a well paced one, it\u2019s just 10 episodes too so it\u2019s such a quick series to complete and get through. And because of its 10 episodes the story really nails down MoriMori pretty well. She\u2019s our main character, and it\u2019s about her really trying to find herself again, and take that next step to find love as well. MMO Junkie takes a bunch of genres like Romance and Slice of Life and somehow takes that and blends it into gaming and creates a romance anime with a modern twist to it. It\u2019s unique because this kind of storyhasn\u2019t really been told yet either, but more on that in a moment. I really enjoyed this story because it felt natural, and because of that everything was so fluid in its delivery. The voice actor for Moriko was just so fantastic in portraying this character. She\u2019s a spaz, a person who has social anxiety and probably has experienced some really heavy stuff in her life. Mamiko Noto was just terrific in portraying in this character, and it does shine a light on anxiety and other heavy things that aren\u2019t talked about. People don\u2019t understand social anxiety, and as a person who has social anxiety, and believe me legit social anxiety, this anime really understands social anxiety and how it manifests itself in just a small corner of society. Moriko to me is someone I can truly relate with throughout the story because I am right there with her. Everything in this anime she goes through, I\u2019ve at the very least experienced before. So because of this, this anime holds a special place in my heart, and I want to thank Rin Kokuyou for making this story and characters, and for Kazuyoshi Yaginuma for beautifully directing it. And to everyone else working on this anime, thank you.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I find so great about the story is the fact it\u2019s so relatable and it\u2019s cute because of that. Let\u2019s take for example the use of the MMO in this story, and how they use that to make the character relatable, and more human. Our main character, MoriMori, is a 30 year old woman, yet she plays a hot guy on an online MMO and roleplays as him. Now how many times have you guys or girls done this? I\u2019m going to guess that if you\u2019ve played an MMO it\u2019s likely you have done it at least one time before. The show uses this extremely well known thing in the fandom of MMO to reward the viewers who have played MMO\u2019s or videos games where they\u2019ve roleplayed as a character to make our main character seem that much more relatable. But let\u2019s also take for example some other real world elements that are at the forefront of gaming culture. Loot Boxes and Microtransactions, and no, I\u2019m not here to complain about EA or GTA Online, I\u2019m instead going to not talk about that and tell you why this is brilliant them implementing these elements into the story. Through small moments in the dialogue and sometimes visually, MoriMori will go and buy this points to buy Loot Boxes for the game she plays. There is even an episode where she decides to fix her appearance and she equates accessory prices to how many loot boxes she could have gotten. It\u2019s a great way to endear the character towards the viewer as like I said, this is something that\u2019s been HUGE in the news for the last two years, and right now may be at it\u2019s fever pitch. This story is one that 10 years ago could have never been told, and I\u2019m glad that this story has been told so well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterizations\\n\\n\r\nIn MMO Junkie, the characters of this series have to be a key focus of your vision. Not just because it\u2019s a Slice of Life, but because it\u2019s a Romance. You see, I think Romance anime need to have a couple things to be well received. What you really need to focus on first is giving your characters a sense of realism, like they could exist. Because how many anime have you watched that has a romance where the characters aren\u2019t really all there, they\u2019re just hollow bodies and the dialogue they speak tries to fill that void. But MMO Junkie has characters you want to like, you remember their names and their roles. How many character names do you remember in Just Because and Girls\u2019 Last Tour? The last thing I look for with romance though is if these characters grow and change, are they human? This could be something as simple as the character thinking they\u2019re undesirable at first, but as time goes on they realize they are desirable. MMO Junkie has this in many ways, Moriko when being caught with a friend runs away because she thinks that her being around people would cause a burden. And honestly, that hits the relatability factor with me here too, as I have felt this way before. But characters that grow are incredibly detrimental, and there aren\u2019t that many great romance in anime like this, so I welcome it.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art for MMO Junkie surprised me, as just looking at it you can tell it\u2019s not meant to be this crazy detail filled rich world. But the backgrounds while sometimes just being static images to save on cash, there are also moments where the backgrounds are really detail. For example, in one of the episodes MoriMori is in front of a store, and the windows are blurred out, but just enough to see what\u2019s on display in those windows\u2026 handbags! There is also the convenience store in this show which really shows that while incredible detail wasn\u2019t something they wanted to completely focus on, they did it to make this world come to life. Another aspect I loved is character designs though, they are really great for this show. MoriMori\u2019s lifeless cold eyes really shows that her character isn\u2019t in the right head space emotionally, and on top of that her design of looking like a slob with unkempt eyebrows and bed head really fill out her character visually. Even when she decides to change her look there are great moments with the art, as MoriMori only dresses up for certain people in different ways. For example let\u2019s take Koiwai, and Sakurai. MoriMori usually dresses up and goes out of her way to look good for Sakurai, while with Koiwai she still wants to look good, but doesn\u2019t put in near as much effort as she does with Sakurai.\\n\\n\r\nBut for the MMO side of things, it looks great as well. Hayashi and Lily\u2019s character designs change throughout the series except for the bracelets which they both vowed to never remove, and are there until the very last episode. Another thing I liked about those two characters thought is that their costumes changed to represent, I assume, their experience level. They don\u2019t remain static throughout the whole series at all, and change pretty regularly. I think this is a nice touch, as you change gear in MMO\u2019s pretty regularly. As for the design of the MMO world, it\u2019s not anything special, and I do wish there was some more depth added to it. As is there is really only one episode where you get a feel for its depth, from then on it\u2019s kinda shoved to the side in favor of the real world and all of that. Overall though, I think the art direction for MMO Junkie was terrific, probably better than a lot of anime this season like Inuyashiki. I would put this right up there with Magus\u2019 Bride though, but that\u2019s not saying too much as there just weren\u2019t many anime that were visually great this season.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly here, the animation is very good for this anime. It fits the comedic style it\u2019s going for, let\u2019s take for example the facial expressions of this series. MoriMori who is playing games practically all day, so to me the way she reacts to things in her facial expressions are really well done here. When Lily-san and Hayashi give each other gifts, she is practically on the edge of her seat, she is invested in this emotionally. Her facial expressions in this scene are exquisite, she is blushing and she\u2019s staring at the screen in anticipation. There aren\u2019t any unique facial expressions here, it\u2019s mostly one of anticipation. Which to me is how I would be reacting in this situation, I\u2019m eagerly awaiting a response just like MoriMori is. In other parts of the show though, we have great moments like Hayashi and Lily under the sea and how things are animated there do seem a little cheap, but even then they put enough into it to make out individual details. Things like bubbles and fish in the background really help make this scene animation wise. Another good one where on paper the animation isn\u2019t anywhere where it needs to be is the scene where they are training against a giant rat or gerbil, I can\u2019t remember which. But they re-use a pretty major key animation multiple times. The animation that\u2019s reused is the one where the rat attacks Hayashi, but instead of this being a scene that\u2019s serious, it\u2019s comedic, so the re-use of the animation doesn\u2019t come off as bad as it would otherwise. Overall, it\u2019s pretty good animation everything considered, but you can easily nitpick flaws in most episodes, so don\u2019t expect Evangelion levels of detail, but at the same time don\u2019t go in expecting something awful like Black Clover.\\n\\n\r\nEnglish Dub\\n\\n\r\nNet-juu no Susume is of course licensed by FUNimation, which means it\u2019s apart of FUNimation\u2019s FUNimation Now program. FUNimation Now is basically FUNimation\u2019s version of Simuldub, which aims to dub anime with only a short delay to when it airs in Japan, usually just a two week delay. For this anime, the dub is basically your standard FUNimation affair, it isn\u2019t bad by any means, we have great talent like; Aaron Dismuke (Chihiro from Sankarea), and Josh Grelle. But I think this anime was just simply miscast. We have Terri Doty playing our MC MoriMori, and it just doesn\u2019t fit her. And honestly, Terri isn\u2019t a bad voice actor and she does a great job acting the lines. But when I think of MoriMori I don\u2019t think of Terri Doty, I think a more matured voice like Terri\u2019s but a little more smooth, if that makes sense. But I think this criticism can be leveled at other characters like Lily-san and Koiwai. The way they were cast, the voices just don\u2019t match what I think they would match in my head. So in my opinion, stick with the Japanese subtitles, as you\u2019ll find it just flows better. But don\u2019t get me wrong, the English Dub is fine if you want to just experience the story without reading, but if you want to go that extra mile for a good experience, then subtitles are for you.\\n\\n\r\nScore\\n\\n\r\nThe score for this anime is done by Conisch, who is has worked on Appleseed, Hetalia, Yu-Gi-Oh Zexals! (Hurray for Yu-Gi-Oh). And first off I got to say, this guy did a really decent job with the score. It isn\u2019t anything that will blow you away by any means, but it will certainly impress you. The score for this anime is really calm though, as to fit the comedy style that this anime obviously has. But what surprised me even more is that even during small dramatic scenes, it didn\u2019t really lay in on the score at all. Instead there are scenes where the score isn\u2019t even noticeable until it\u2019s pointed out. I think this was done to give the dialogue more room to breath and have more impact. As technically, the dialogue here isn\u2019t really anything new, as this is a romance comedy. I think scoring it the way he scored it was perfect for the series, and while there were no scenes in particular that carried them, I don\u2019t think it was meant to. This is almost certainly a show that is scored minimalist for a lot of scenes where you\u2019d think otherwise. I think people can really appreciate the opening and ending songs though, as I did too. Saturday Night Question is undoubtedly behind Inuyashiki for best opening of this season. It\u2019s fun, catchy and doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. To contrast that, the ending song is your more straightforward Alternative Rock style of rock music we\u2019ve come to enjoy from Japan. It even has a kickass solo in it that I love too. So yeah, I really like the score for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 8/10",

The story is less about the MMO playing, though there are some things they get right, and more about the relationshipof the main character to the guy she meets in-game.

            "content": "Net-juu no Susume has ended after a mere 10 episodes. I for one enjoyed it quite a bit. This anime was about a 30 year old woman who goes through immense stress at work and ultimately quits her job. After which she becomes a self declared NEET. In her newfound free time, she then plays the MMO's that she loves so dearly all day every day. In her game, she meets a girl named Lily. That's what it basically says in the synopsis. This anime is quite, in a word, pure. No ill intentions sexually or otherwise. The art and animation is nothing special, butthe character designs for the in game characters are interesting. Unfortunately, only about 2 or 3 of the characters are interesting. The supporting cast is really forgettable, even though its not about them. A comparison that I would draw to MMO Junkie is Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? a similar gaming anime. Where instead of just 2 interesting characters that are adults, its a high school anime where the characters are more diverse. I give MMO Junkie a 7 out of 10, watch it if you have free time, its quite heartwarming. This has been your spoiler free but not really of Net-juu no Susume.",

Which makes following them quite easy both as their online persona and real life selves. \r\nStory - The story had a good flow to it and felt quite organic as it progressed. \r\nOpening Song - Personally, I really enjoyed the song. Maybe even more than the current season's favourite of \"My hero\" from Inuyashiki. It fits the overall mood of the anime and sets it up well.\r\nNegatives:\r\nSocial Awkwardness - Due to the show taking place between an MMO game and real life. It defaults the main character ofMoriko to the socially awkward personality during the real life segments. Some people are like that but it does seem to be a trend of someone who plays a game has to be socially awkward outside of the game within anime.  \\n\\n\r\nNot Positive or Negative things:\\n\\n\r\nArt Style - The art style is fine overall, no complaints about it but nothing particularly good.\\n\\n\r\nSound - None of the sounds within the show were out of place, but nothing really stood out apart being very generic sounds that you would usually hear.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: Recommended\\n\\n\r\nThe show as a whole works quite well. The story progresses in a way that seems somewhat organic. With an ending that may not be satisfying to some but gives enough progression that I enjoyed it, plus gives a nice way to end the season. The characters aren't over blown personalities, which fits the show, as they come across more realistic that way. While the social awkwardness at times is a bit off putting to me, it helps with the comedy for those who enjoy that kind of comedy. The opening song I really liked, while the ending song wasn't bad as well. The art style and sound aren't amazing, but it does what it needed to be for this kind of anime which is basically serviceable.",

            "content": "The 'NEET' and hikikomori pandemic in Japan has been on the rise in recent years.  Due to stress and pressures in the workplace, many people have either quit to pursue a more secluded life, or dropped dead due to the stresses of having to be in a workplace.  So why am I talking about this?  Well, that's the plot of the show.\r\nStory:\r\nWhile not as dark as the reality of the topic at hand, Net-juu no Susume (or Net-juu as I'll be calling it from now on), touches on the story of Morioka Moriko, a 30 year old NEET who recently quit herjob and begins playing an MMO called 'Fruits de Mer'.  Now a newbie at the game going by the name 'Hayashi', she meets a player who goes by the name of 'Lily', and the two kindle a partnership in the game.  Unbeknownst to each other, their two real world selves crash into each other in a fate encounter, beginning a relationship that spans both the real world, and the digital world.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Net-juu comes off a bit as a standard romcom.  As the episodes roll by, we're shown the progression of the relationship between Moriko and Yuuta at a steady pace as they inch their way towards the end goal however sluggish that may be.  The problem here lies in the presentation.  Sure the gradual romance is cute and all, but the two main characters are so introverted in a comedic sense that more often than not, they fluster when around each other and that can get vaguely annoying rather fast.  Indeed this style of comedy is an acquired taste, and while I think it was cute at the beginning, it got kinda irritating the more and more the two shared scenes together.\\n\\n\r\nHowever despite that, the introverted aspects with the characters, particularly with Moriko, plays a large part into why the show's story excels ahead of its other romance half.  Gradually we're shown why Moriko became a NEET with information delivered at a consistent rate.  The show swaps between its more comical side to its more serious side rather effortlessly and is genuinely an aspect of the show that I like.  Not only that, but the bridge between online where you hide behind a facade and reality comes into play quite frequently, meshing a lot of the themes and aspects of the show together.  It's here where I feel the show is at its best, and proves itself to be more than just an awkward romcom with two gamers in their late 20's early 30's spending real money on in-game currency and playing their weekends away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Net-juu no Susume has a story that while seemingly cutesy on the surface, has a deeper message within itself that delivers on what it set out to do through and through.  The ending if you ask me is less satisfactory than it should've been (partially because the show just cannot for the life of itself decide if its main couple should stay passive and awkward or note), but can mostly be forgiven because the progression throughout the whole show made that up in dividends.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Balances comedy and serious\\n\r\n+ Serious tones feel genuine and are well executed\\n\r\n+/- Unsatisfactory end (if you ask me)\\n\r\n- Romance is sluggish and/or lacking\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nMorioka Moriko, our 30 year old NEET is the star of the show.  Recently quitting her office job, she spends day and night eating away at her savings on loot boxes and beer while she spends the waking hours grinding and playing her newfound love, Fruits de Mer.  An extremely awkward character who violently switches between a 'normal demeanor' to filling herself with intense, almost frightening self guilt, Moriko's story is the brunt of the series and takes up most if not all of storytelling of the series.  Everything from the cast's motivation and participation in the series to series focus is solely put on who and what Moriko is and does as a person, and the end result is well-paced growth that eventually blossoms into a relatively satisfactory end result.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the flipside, we have Sakurai Yuuta, who despite being the main male protagonist, doesn't really get as much screentime as that title might say he does.  As mentioned before, practically every character spends their screentime and attention on Moriko and her story, leaving very little for anyone else.  Yuuta indeed does get a decent amount of time dedicated to himself, as we see him grow more and more confident with meddling in Moriko's affairs with a backstory of his own put in there, but pales in comparison to what Moriko gets in the series.  The imbalance makes the character feel a lot less important despite how crucial he is to the series, and I honestly wish we got more of him, or at the very least, not make him a copycat of Moriko when it comes to love.  I get why she gets flustered, but this man acting like a 'cinnamon roll' and getting flustered as well just unnecessarily pads out the runtime.\\n\\n\r\nOf course I would be remised if I didn't mention their avatars, Hayashi and Lily, but they're more or less just gender-swapped versions of their real world selves, so there's not much to say there.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is a bit of a crying shame.  Not much can be said for them because their importance to the series is honestly quite minimal.  In a show dedicated to comparing real world vs. digital avatars, the guild members that're featured get surprisingly little screentime.  Hell, all we see is their digital avatars without much of an inkling as to who they are in the real world.  Indeed their purpose is to make the cast feel more vibrant and lively, but I wanted to at least see who these people were irl instead of just Kanbe.  And that guy's relevance to the story is almost mute.  The only side character that's worth mentioning is Koiwai, but even he's rather pointless cause he just serves to drive the plot as the 'wingman' character.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Well-developed main protagonist\\n\r\n-  Secondary main protagonist feels lacking\\n\r\n-  Supporting cast feels very lacking and almost non-existent aside from 'cast filler'\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Signal. MD, the art for Net-juu is...average.  Or as I like to sugarcoat it: standard fare.  Honestly, the art isn't anything really worthy of noting.  Looks pretty good up-close, farther away you start to notice the low quality frames that come with distance, and comedic moments display blush, simplified, exaggerated expressions, the lot.  Again, not bad, but not amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n\"Saturday Night Question.\"  I honestly didn't expect a rock song as the show's OP.  Personally I feel like the show is a bit out of place in a romcom-esque show, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the song is actually...pretty good.  It's worth at least a listen to, and it's kinda catchy.  \"Hikari, Hikari\", the show's ED sung by Aisaka Yuuka (who also voices a character who really should've gotten some expansion.  Cause that'd be nice) is similar to the OP by being a rock song but releases some of its energy for being more mellow than its counterpart.  Again, the show feels a little out of place being a rock song in a show about fantasy gamers, but hey, it's still pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nI do want to give special mention to Moriko's seiyuu, Noto Mamiko.  Her performance being able to dramatically change her vocal range at the drop of a dime from high to low to high again and back and forth, etc, etc...not only made Moriko more believable that she has comical social anxiety, but made her a lot more entertaining to watch.  Seriously though, she made the character.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good tracks\\n\r\n+ Mamiko's performance as the protagonist\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I expected Net-juu to just be your standard romcom.  I did pique my interest, so I did have a decent amount of hope going into it, coming out of it feeling like it did meet the expectation that I had of it, but also relieved that they did more than just a standard romcom.  I would've liked more expansion on the cast and potentially the runtime, as usually, 10 episode long shows don't do too well because of the rush to fill in that time gap.  Thankfully Net-juu didn't fall into that trap, but there were still things that were left to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  While not my favorite of the season, the show had a number of aspects of itself that came off as genuine and had a good chunk of storytelling and character development that I both didn't expect and was glad was a thing that happened.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nOk, I actually have a number of vague annoyances with this show, Koiwai being a main contributor.  I don't know why, but the guy just comes off as creepy to me.  He's so overly cheerful that it's kind of off-putting and having him on-screen just gives me bad vibes.  Aside from that, the passiveness of the romance and how often the two fluster is annoying.  Very often they use this to break the tension in the show being as subtle as a sledgehammer on glass.  It's so sudden that it actually breaks the immersion and just...why.  Seriously, we get enough cockblocking with characters who're still in high school.  You're telling me in animeworld that shit doesn't end even when you're a full-grown adult?  Also Lilac, the chitoge clone, Pokotarou, and Himeralda seriously needed some time to themselves.  I would've loved to see at least their real world selves touched upon to give the show some variety aside from NEETs, officer workers, and a college student working a convenience store.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're an introvert, I would recommend this series.  A lot of its content is something introverts like myself are able to relate to on a personal level and as mentioned many times before, has surprisingly good story despite its seemingly comedic exterior.  Honestly though, this is a show that I would recommend anyone to watch just to watch.  Despite its problems I feel like it has enough positive merits to itself to warrant having a spot on peoples' lists.",

            "content": "I picked this anime up after watching some trailers and... well, who doesn't play MMORPG at least once in their lifetime these days? This is one of those stories that would call out to you as relatable. And I would say it had been a fun watch so far.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nCharacter: 6/10\r\nI would say the story overall is relatable, except the MC's bold decision to quit her job and be an elite NEET for the year. It was a fun watch, jokes being a relaxing laugh for the day, and ships you would want to see sailing. \r\nThe only thing that make me feel a bitoff is the amount of coincidences the author put together in this story and the fact that the main character did not show even slightest distrust towards her net game-mates. Although MC used gaming as an escape from real life and that she did not enjoy her real-life work, I would expect MC to be more proper in making decisions and act mature for her age, even more so with her approximate 10 years of work life in addition to normal approximate 13 years of school life. Instead, MC suddenly became socially inept as a 30 years old. Discussing everything from what to wear to a drinking party to anything with an online \"partner\" from the gaming world where everyone is unknown... Although I get the idea that she wants to \"totally escape\" from real life... I feel that this aspect is totally unrealistic and makes me feel totally off about the story.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, just how lucky can you get in an MMORPG to have every member of the same guild living in the area near the MC and they all met at least once in the lawson convenience store? I get the fact that the story is moving so nicely this way and I see the possible small reverse-harem and ships around the MC (I personally have a ship I wanted to see sailing for the MC). But to have a \"partner\" in a random MMORPG be the friend of a colleague... The amount coincidences are too stacked up that the story feels too unrealistic. \\n\\n\r\nI am not saying everything must be realistic because this is an anime. But unlike series like re-zero and konotsuba, this series uses realism as a theme and relativity as an attractive mechanism for the fun watch and I feel those two pillars are just barely preventing themselves from crumbling. I would be expecting something close to relife or tsuki ga kirei style even if it is slight.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile I do feel that male protagonists are quite realistic as working adults including the fact that they are not the typical super dense guys you see in a romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside pretty much would be that it is 10 episodes and that we will hardly see proper development for MC's background. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I do enjoy it nonetheless for the small laughs I get from this anime, hence giving it 7/10 for the story and 6/10 for characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nArt is pretty okay. I like how they make the change obvious for the NEET MC and the MC when attending social gathering. And it is obvious that there is a distinction between the real life and MMORPG, for the enemies you see is MMORPG are very random and not as appealng as 'real life' in the anime, which are pretty good details. There is consistent art as well so far. Hence 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music is good, the beats are catchy and each time you watch an episode, it is one of those opening you would probably want to continue to listen. The same applies for the ending. But I can't say it is very great. Hence giving it 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoyed the jokes and the developments despite the flaws. It is a recommendation if you want stress-relieving jokes in your life, with not serious themes like shounen, I would say this would be a good remedy. But as a fan of shows such as these and slice of life, I can't say this is very good with all the loopholes... hence the overall score of 7/10 .",

Honestly, when I read the synopsis of this anime, I thought that it would be your another typical MMO anime with a bit of fanservice and moe scenes. Man, I was wrong! The plot of this show might seem average but it has been delivered beautifully. You will be eagered to know each of the game's characters IRL faces! \r\nAs for the art, it was beautiful. Not too much colourful or dull, just the perfect art style one might like. The sound is mediocre so I won't say anything about it.\r\nThe characters of thisshow are the strong point of making this seemingly average plot enjoyable. Each one of them have a unique personality and their own problems which makes this show livelier. The characters are all adults so you wont be seeing any highschool boy/girl (you might in the upcoming episodes) but this show is better that way.\\n\\n\r\nI have watched 5 episodes so far and I definitely had enjoyed it.

Thankfully, after being disillusioned with the latest Fruits Basket anime and reading reviews praising this anime instead, I continued. I am glad 9 episodes later of watching back to back I continued. Aside from disliking the main MC in Fruits Basket, this anime is an anime that I can relate my life to personally. It's this anime that reminds me there's hope! There's still animes I can not only watch but see myself it! I'm not in my 30s yet, but I am close. The main MC, Morimori-chan is super relatable and down to earth. Sheis a real person with very real insecurities and feelings of guilt that I could really relate to. This is surprising - since I find myself unable to do that with a lot of anime characters... (Looking at you Tohru.) \\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend this anime if you are like me, and burnt out from college/graduate school/work. I like how this anime does a lot of showing instead of necessarily telling. For me, I have entered a period of time where I am needing to take time off due to burn out. This anime is worth a watch because of how human the characters are. I like how awkward the relationship between the 2 MCs are. It's straight to the point. He likes her, but she unknowingly blows him off because she's that awkward. Again super relatable! There is a sort of cathartic moment for Morioka-chan at the end that I needed to hear. It's basically that it's okay to feel guilty all the time whether or not what you're doing is okay, or how you are spending your time is really okay. And noticing I put myself down a lot when perhaps the people around me don't see me that way at all. That I am okay just the way I am. \\n\\n\r\nLooks are deceiving.",

I really couldnt get intoit, I tried my best and tried to keep an open mind but seriously I cant wrap my brain around this. It is an interesting idea but in execution this anime falls short. It's like they tried to keep the balance between real life and video game but you either find yourself just forcing yourself to watch the parts you dont really like until they play out the latter. 5/10 Its a nice idea, but nothing I ever plan on watching again.",

Also, it is quite good comedy.\r\nI don't really know how to write about story and storytelling without spoilers.\r\nSettings are of course based on story story, but the storytelling is what makes it work. And it works hella good. Combination of those two (setting is inherently dependent on story) make this anime quite unique and very enjoyable. Especially visually. I can't even hope to describe, how good it was, within this short review.\r\nYou have to experience for yourself . . .\r\n[minor SPILERS]\r\nButafter this admiring paragraph , I want to write about the few thing that bothered me about this anime. That would be males MC lack of initiative throughout first half of anime and shyness of MCs throughout second half.\\n\r\nWhile watching, those two things really bothered me, enough to not give it more than 8/10. But then I realised, that those things are big contributors to what makes this anime THIS ANIME. Because they are absolutely possible, sometimes maybe irrational, but perfectly fine at their context. But, it required me to reflect over it. So the true shortcoming of this anime is that those things were not polished enough . . . I can imagine that this would not be a problem for some people, but even bigger problem for others than me.",

Both really love playing MMO games and as the anime progresses a lot of coincidences seem to happen. There are actually that many coincidences that this must be fate :P We mainly see how those two slowly but steadily get to know each other better and discover something really important to them that has also to do with the MMO games and why they love these games so much.\r\nEspecially the last3 episodes were very funny and moe but in most episodes there where moments where I had to giggle laugh or smile. The two MCs are not only kinda fun when they are together but they are also extremely cuteee. The last episode had a cuteness overload xD although im not 100% happy with the end. I think 1 more episode just to really see how the relationship between Yuta and Mori has developed would be nice since everything happened a bit fast in the end. But for just 10 episodes the pace was good and it didnt seem particularly rushed. :)",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Net-juu no Susume. Honestly it wasn't bad, but wasn't great. \r\nThe story revolves around Moriko and Yuuta. Moriko was a business woman who decided to quit her job and become a NEET. While living the stay at home life she discovers a new mmo as the one she used to play is no longer available. Yuuta is a business man who works and finds time to play the same mmo as Moriko. \r\nMost of the episodes revolve around them talking in the mmo world with their gender reversed characters. When they are not on the game talkingthey are coincidentally outside bumping into each other and spinning this fake feeling string of fate story line.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters have some good moments, but both of them feel a bit too tailored for this story. Moriko is super self conscious and apologetic all the time. She only ever shines in the mmo world. This is a cool plot point but after awhile its just repetition. It goes from feeling genuine to \"how can we possibly drag this encounter out so nothing comes from it\". Yuuta is the insanely loyal and thoughtful other half of the story. Sometimes he can be incredibly forward and brave, then other times falter and turn the confession moment into something else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a fun watch, but it becomes a bit taxing as the episodes continue. They are really heavy handed with the \"will they discover each other\" story line. It takes far too long to progress as is, but they take steps to elongate this silly plot. They decide to add in some side characters which both help and hinder the main characters discovering one another. Add this to the already timid characters and an anime that could have wrapped up in 5 episodes lasts 10.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Fun watch, but they go out of their way to stretch the story thin.",

            "content": "Net-juu susume  follows the story of Moriko Moriaka a 30 year old woman who quit her job to basically become a NEET, in other words a person almost completely cut out from the real world who spents most her/his time online. \r\nThe anime focuses on her relationship with the people from her guild in an online mmo, and her romance with one of the members.\r\nStory : 6/10\r\nThe story itself was pretty interesting, also the fact that we were following the life of adult characters in their late twenties and early thirties was refreshing. But the execution was not that great. Most of the animeat least early on takes play online in an mmo. And most of the online scenes felt too fake and cheesy to the point where you would start to wonder if these characters were actually adults or kids. \\n\r\nBesides that the anime  criticized japanese corporations; and it showed how meeting people online can actually help people cut out from society. Aside from that the story didn\u2019t really have lot of depth when it could have had more.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound : 6/10\\n\r\nPretty normal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters :  7/10\\n\r\nOn paper the cast looked pretty interesting, but I just wish the anime had spent less time in the mmo and more time outside in the real world. Aside from Moriko and Sakura we don\u2019t really get any character development which is unfortunate. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, this anime was entertaining, and tried to give us an original romantic story which was refreshing but, I truly feel like it focused too much on the online aspect of the characters lifes and not enough on their personalities dreams and struggles in real life. They were probably trying to appeal to a younger audience and mmo players by focusing story on the game and I can understand that but I can\u2019t help but imagine how this anime would have been if it had taken itself more seriously since the deeper messages the anime was trying to share with us were actually intesresting..\\n\\n\r\n(I actually enjoyed the show my review was little harsh but I hope it helped, sorry for any mistakes I might have made, english is not my first language)\\n",

However, here in Net-juu no Susume we have actual gaming scenes that fit in the atmosphere of the anime giving it an excellent vibe to both my gamer and anime watcher personalities.\r\n>Spoiler free<\r\nStory: The story revolves around Morioka-san, an adult female who quit her job and decided to take the life of a NEET *add respect*. However, a big number of unexpected coincidences occur that connect her real life to her online life andwe see what this turns out to be like. You have all your favorite side-dishes here: Hot boys, awkward romance moments, teasing and much more. And the main dish is.. GAMING SCENES. Yep, actual gaming scenes that give you a nostalgic feeling of your gaming moments. They have the same vibe you get while playing so you'd feel a strong connection with those scenes, probably.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Not this anime's best suit. It doesn't look anything special, but if you ask me, that's to be expected and might even be better this way. I mean, that's how we'd expect a NEET to be right? She'd not feel like a NEET if she looked fabulous. The show itself doesn't contain that much of scenery as well, but they seem to have nailed it whenever scenery shows up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development: Not going to add a lot of detail here since this is the main focus of the anime and writing here would basically spoil the entire thing. However, I'm willing to answer one question. Did the characters develop well?\\n\r\nYes *add Saitama poker face*.\\n\\n\r\nOverall experience: Good show, Good plot, Good Game. Would I add something else to the anime? Yes, actually I believe their should be a little bit more romance in the atmosphere. This show is one definitely enjoyable by gamers and anime-watchers alike giving a good vibe to both.",

            "content": "This anime was enjoyable~! Even though the story certainly isn\u2019t the best, I enjoyed seeing it through! Gaah I was disappointed, though, about how  Moriaka and Sakurai didn\u2019t become an official couple in the end,, ;v:\r\nAs for a more helpful review, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s very recommendable as an anime. Despite the not-so-clich\u00e9 characters, the plot is stocked with clich\u00e9s and somewhat lame. Hayashi and Lily are especially h e a d s  o v e r  h e e l s for each other, and it can be annoying for the people who don\u2019t like the ship. I was meh withthe ship, though, and I just came to like it! This anime\u2019s also really open with spoilers, haha. It was obvious about Sakurai\u2019s MMO identity, too (especially that cover pic, man!). I also found it kinda disappointing with how lucky Morioka eventually came to be, but hey, the SakuMori was worth it!\\n\\n\r\nAttempting to sum up my opinion:\\n\r\n+ Morioka\u2019s relatable and flawed character & appearance (i kinda even miss it-)\\n\r\n+ pretty nice art\\n\r\n+ the addition of a fat character\\n\r\n+ the creative way of showing online vs irl\\n\r\n+ the gradual unveiling and right timing used for Moriaka and Sakurai\u2019s pasts being revealed\\n\r\n+ how nothing about how playing games 24/7 are all oh so unhealthy and bad was emphasized, yet how enjoyable and wonderful games could be was emphasized quite a bit but not too much in my opinion \\n\r\n+ the lack of skin exposure during that one shower scene (im srry i had to-)\\n\r\n+ good voice-acting (i especially love morioka\u2019s sound effects and reactions omg)\\n\r\n+ pretty nice music\\n\r\n+ the unusually nice flow and progress in Moriaka and Sakurai\u2019s relationship\\n\r\n- Moriaka\u2019s tendency to quickly self-deprecate herself (which results to me thinking she must\u2019ve felt like a huge burden at work, considering how I\u2019ve lately been somewhat the same)\\n\r\n- too-flashy/big eyes? For girls like Lily and Lilac anyway\\n\r\n- the transition from online to irl can be distracting\\n\r\n- how obvious it was that Sakurai was ypu-know-who\\n\r\n- the coincidences\\n\r\n- Moriaka and Sakurai\u2019s somewhat overdone modest/humble traits\\n\r\n- the way certain character tropes were accented (wasn\u2019t it just mainly Fujimoto and his fancy Japanese house, tho? XD)\\n\r\n- some of the character tropes (idk man Lily and Lilac\u2019s voices aren\u2019t too much of my cup of tea, and I used to dislike Lilac\u2019s personality a little bit)\\n\r\n- some of the times where the characters turn into chibis for silly-ish moments can be slightly-unpleasantly distracting\\n\r\n- all those clich\u00e9s (saying things at same time, for example)\\n\r\n- the opening and ending doesn\u2019t seem to match the anime very much (not to mention, too much of Molly showed up)\\n\r\n- Nico (i actually like her, but for some reason she was useless and pointless in the end,,, it\u2019s a shame)(then again, himeralda and poko were just as useless-)\\n\\n\r\nI do apologize for having more cons than pros, but then again, I said this anime isn\u2019t very recommendable. I definitely want a second season, though! Please! I might lose interest by the time it comes out, though, haha T_T (then again, i planned to watch the third season of sao when it came out despite losing interest in it at the times)\\n\\n\r\nWhy don\u2019t you give it a try? ^^",

I honestly want to see them together. I like the idea of them getting married andwhat not.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenes where the girl is completely perplexed and has no idea what to do are probably some of the best. The reactions she gives is great too. I keep wanting her too wake up next to the guy naked, Just so i can see the hilarious reaction she'd be bound to give. \\n\\n\r\nSome things like how many big coincidences there are kind of bug me. But in the end i was easily able to overlook them. \\n\\n\r\nThe scenes where they are talking in game are easily the least interesting. Time spent with them playing the game i feel could've been better spent on the real life scenes. \\n\\n\r\nAlso things like how animated the game is when in actuality they are just talking in chat boxes and standing around seems weird once you start thinking about it.\\n\\n\r\nKind of wish we got to see more of the two other females in the show. One looks like a high school girl with blonde hair. I always that that it would be fun for the MC to have another female friend. Especially a younger kid more interactive with society then the MC. I imagine she'd help the MC come out of her shell.\\n\\n\r\nOverall an awesome show that i hope to see more of.",

            "content": "Can you feel your anxiety just wash away?\r\nRecovery of an MMO Junkie knows about the pain of anxiety/depression and the NEET life, but instead of showing you that pain, the anime conquers these issues with unbridled power of CUTE. In the MMO world, the world is bright and colorful and everyone has a good time hanging out, raiding dungeons, and trying on new outfits. In the real world, though MC Morioka's room is usually dark and lonely, the cute character design and chibi-art comedic punchlines make you forget just how hard Morioka's life is.\r\nPerhaps it glosses over it TOO much, but this anime isn't Welcometo the NHK and it doesn't want to be. The show never forgets about Morioka's issues, but it is also content to acknowledge them in the background while the foreground is filled with the fluffy stuff. The fluffiness is enough to make me smile and laugh while watching an episode, but it's such a different approach that I feel weird in retrospect. Maybe the anime could've been stronger if it made more explicit connections with Morioka's issues and the game world, but the fact that it doesn't at least makes it unique, and that's fine.\\n\\n\r\nMMO Junkie's real problem is its inability to juggle its characters and subplots with the romantic plot that starts during the second half. The guild members are all great, and it's sad to see them ignored for a romance that is honestly not very interesting. The romance is slow and a bit clich\u00e9 toward the end, and the show slowly moves out of the MMO world altogether and takes away from what made the show interesting in the first place. Some characters we only see once or twice, and others are left with their issues acknowledged and then forgotten soon after. The drama from the romance is too weak to justify moving away from the game setting, even though it is symbolically necessary. While the pairing itself works, the last few episodes were a bit disappointing in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the fun, fluffy MMO times and extremely understated adult themes make this anime a nice watch, especially if you've experienced some of these issues yourself. It's just so CUTE.\\n\\n\r\nAnd DEFINITELY watch the OVA 11th episode. It's a step up in quality and has a bunch of great moments, enough for me to like it more than the actual episodes.  If the romance plot had more of THAT, I would've liked this show better.",

And, yet, unlike a lot of anime comedies I've seen, the characters feel like they could be almost 100% real. Moriko is endearing right off the bat, and remains so through all 10 episodes. I haven't watched the OVA, yet (project at work tonight ;-) ), but I'm sure that remains true.\r\n(Okay, yes. I'm a grown man who still tends to develop a bit of a crush on anime characters. Sue me. :-D )\r\nAs someone who, much like Moriko, almost feels more at home in an MMOthan in the real world, I think the creator is definitely someone who \"gets\" online gamers.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, if you're an online gamer, like to laugh, and are a hopeless romantic, this is the show for you.",

The plot is rather well crafted with story elements introduced at appropriate timings with sufficient introductions to the characters. There is a good disposition of characters with no unnecessary filler content or underdeveloped characters. The story flows smoothly and connects well with the characters in a sweet and simple manner. Thankfully, this Rom-Com doesn't have any instances where the characters want to reveal their true feelings to each other but refuse to do so. The interactions between the characters are pretty cute and funny too. Hence, making it a sweet,pleasant, lighthearted and enjoyable experience. This anime, though only 10 episodes long somehow allows for a wholesome plot and development that leaves you satisfied, smiling and feeling warm and fuzzy at the end of every episode \\n\r\n(=^\uff65\u03c9\uff65^=)\\n\\n\r\nRegarding art and animation it's pretty up to standard compared to current animes. Voice acting is clear and pretty appropriate for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: The first half of episode one (or the first few episodes depending on your Cringe Tolerance) may be slightly cringy (in a funny and embarrassing way) so bear with it because it only gets better from there ^^\\n\\n\r\nSide note: If you're worried about a bad ending, worry not-this anime has a nice sweet ending :3\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I'm kinda sad the anime got a lower rating because of people who jumped the gun at episode 4 (hence missing the juiciest and best bits) and wrote negative reviews. ;-;\\n\\n\r\nP.P.S If you liked this anime for its lighthearted feel, cute character interactions and comedy, i HIGHLY recommend watching Acchi Kocchi (Place to Place).\\n",

            "content": "This has got to be one of the most disappointing shows of this season. I was very late into watching this anime so I decided to marathon all 10 episodes today.\r\nStory: (5/10): The story is basically about a man and women who had played a previous MMO in the past, and coincidentally reunite with each other digitally again, and physically for the first time. They eventually get to know each other and then it becomes a rom com. Not a bad concept, but the way they set the tone is what pisses me off. Most of the events that set the tone for other eventseither happen because of how staged the events are, or by pure coincidence.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (6/10) The art style is not bad, I like the different color palettes that distinguish the real world and the MMO world. I like how the character designs are also distinguishable by the 2 worlds; the ones in the MMO are colorful/fantasy like, while their characters in the real world are simplistic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (6/10) I don't care about the sound. It didn't leave any impression on me. I watched this anime without acknowledging its soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (4/10) Morioko is one of the most annoying characters in this show; she's always putting herself down because of how she thinks people see her as a NEET. She doesn't get out of that mindset until VERY late into the series. I know that Sakurai is suppose to be Morioko's sunshine, but his role is very repetitive and used in many romance anime that deal with a sad female protagonist. Personally Sakurai doesn't impact me in the slightest. I don't feel like any of the other MMO characters serve any purpose in the anime; they're just wasted character slots. Koiwai was a pretty cool character, I like his foxy personally and he serves many purposes in the anime; more than the main characters since he's the one who gets them together multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (4/10) I didn't enjoy it as much. Every episode felt like a chore to watch, and so many other anime do a better job of conveying romance and comedy. Nothing in this anime left an impression on me because of how plain it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (6/10) It's not that the anime was bad. It's not interesting, and nothing stands out to make an impression on you.",

This is the anime is perfect for one of those days. \r\nThe show has a simple and predictable plot. The protagonist is a single  30-year-old woman who becomes a shut-in after she quits her job (seemingly because of stress). She plays MMOs all day to run away from the real world eventually she and one of her online friends end developing feelings for each other after running into each other (literally) in the real world.\r\n One of the things Ireally like about this show is that it doesn't drag things out like other romance animes and the characters are actually able to figure things out when given the information and actually communicate. The characters are adults (not high schoolers) behaving like adults and reacting to situations in ways that actually make sense. \\n\\n\r\nMorioka (the protagonist) and Sakurai (the love interest) were very endearing to watch and Koiwai (the mutual friend) was a fun character. I would have liked to see more of the secondary characters we see in the MMO but given this show is only 10 episodes I understand why they didn't get much development.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this is a simple romance anime about MMO nerds and it\u2019s very good for what it is. If you don't like romance anime in general or if you were expecting something over the top you might not like it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this an 8 because while this show isn't anything spectacular it doesn't try to be and every episode put a smile on my face.\\n",

            "content": "Net-juu no Susume was one of my favourite series at the beginning of the season, and I thought that it could easily become my favourite anime of all time. The first few episodes suggested that it was more than the average romcom, that it was more something akin to Welcome to the NHK, with how Morioka's NEET status is presented. It's clear that she hated her job, and became a NEET due to that, and despite her claims of being a 'proud NEET' she tries her best to cover up that fact, and has very low self-esteem. But that was all ultimately pushed aside infavour of the romcom genre.\\n\\n\r\nBut, this is still a fantastic series. It's absolutely brimming with charm. It mocks MMOs in a way that isn't usually seen, poking fun at the various little features such as microtransactions and characters being AFK. The comedy overall is spot-on, mostly based on character humour.\\n\\n\r\nMost characters are underdeveloped in favour of developing Morioka and Sakurai, the two main protagonists. This much is somewhat expected in a ten-episode series, but there are some bizarre little facts about the characters scattered in, such as showing one of the MMO players in real life for less than thirty seconds during the entire series for no particular payoff, and developing Sakurai's backstory during one episode only for it to never be referenced again.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, this series is just beautiful. The art style is a little different to the standard style, which is nice to see, and the animation itself is very fluid. The character designs are also very nicely done - the MMO characters aren't overdesigned, and there's no sameface (at least, none that I noticed). The sound design is also very nice, with a fantastically done OP and ED, and a soundtrack that fitted the series well. Voice acting is also very good.\\n\\n\r\nMy only major complaint with the series is how it handles the NEET status of our protagonist. At first, it seems that the series is making a statement on how difficult it can be to find an enjoyable job, and discouraging the protagonist from being a NEET. The other characters also are shown to have a variety of different types of jobs, which I was expecting to be expanded on. But there are mixed messages being sent through the series. Morioka isn't encouraged to get a job and has no monetary issues either, and despite being a NEET nothing negative really happens out of consequence. And yet she still seems uncomfortable being a NEET and doesn't really think of it as okay, and by the end of the series the fact that she's a NEET seems to just become a device to let her be online all the time instead.\\n\\n\r\nIt may seem odd that I give this series a 9/10 after all the flaws I listed, but honestly, it's just so enjoyable. The character interactions are cute, our protagonist is cute, and overall it's just a comfy little series that I enjoyed watching on Friday nights with a cup of coffee and lying in bed. It's a cute little romcom, nothing more, nothing less, and as long as you aren't expecting it to carry any sort of important message it's a very fun series.",

This anime is not a heavy drama and the comedy is light hearted. Its an easy watch and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a short romance with a satisfying ending. However, even though gaming is a big part of the plot, it's not main point. This is not an adventure anime at all. My only complaint is the length and the lack of character development,especially for the side characters. There was a lot of potential to make this anime twice as long but instead it went straight down the main quest with out so much a second glance at the side quests. In conclusion, if you like romance anime with some comedy, watch it. But that's all you will get from it.",

            "content": "Animes that focus on online gaming usually aren't too good, but this one is clearly the black sheep of that genre. \r\nI'm not gonna waste too much time, so I'll head into the review.\r\nRabb2t's honest anime review (without ever looking over what I write) time begins!\r\nStory: The story of Net-juu no Susume (just gonna call it MMO Junkie) starts out with our main character, Moriko, who starts off as a socially inept NEET who uses the internet to escape reality. At first, the anime starts off showing how awkward she is, while focusing more on the fact that she is playing a game. However, afterher fateful encounter with Sakurai, Moriko is faced with the problem of telling her guildmates what happens in the real world, while attempting to still stay in character. Eventually, these events pile up more and more, developing the plot in a way that works well with the anime. But not long after, the entire game element switches main roles with a new element: a relationship. All of this is done well, with no room for holes anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this anime is kinda like what we're all used to, but there's a slight different in faces that help contrast feelings a bit better than other animes. MMO Junkie's art is pretty normal, but I do like the fact that the artists drew different styles for the 2 different games that Moriko plays.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Let me just say that Moriko's VA is amazing at this role, showing the awkwardness of her character fully. Sakurai's voice actor sounds more laid back, being the more mellow character he is. The guildmembers also are done nicely, with some having me wish I could hear them more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Here's the big section I know you're all going to love! Anyways, character. At the start of this anime, Moriko is the definition of a NEET, being socially awkward at all times. She uses her character, Hayashi, in order to escape this reality. Hayashi is the literal opposite of Moriko, which is a concept that is seen throughout MMO Junkie. Moriko then reveals the extent to her insecurity and lack of self-confidence. This lack of self-confidence is always there whenever Moriko goes online, but guildmate Lily is always there to help. Speaking of Lily, she's (?) also one of my favourite characters. Starting out as a helpful person in Fruits De Mer, Lily develops into a character that Hayashi can be around to talk to. But this relationship slowly turns into one that transcends into the real world, when the person behind Lily turns out to know Moriko in real life. The relationship between these 2 seems to strain in the middle of the anime, but is resolved in a satisfying way. Dramatic irony helped in building the suspense in this anime, and it kept me on the edge waiting for when they would find out who was who. The last thing I want to talk about before this review becomes 50% character is the fact that opposites are a recurring theme in this show. Not only is Hayashi the literal opposite of Moriko, but the roles between Moriko and Sakurai change too. In the first MMO that the 2 play, Moriko starts out as a busy worker, only being on on the weekends. Sakurai is a student in this time who can be on any day. Fast forward to the present, and this is now opposite. I just like how that worked.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If it wasn't obvious enough, I enjoyed this anime a whole lot. Not only did it make me stay at the edge of my seat waiting for that reveal of character, but it made me react similarly to a high school girl at prom. That one moment was the best part of the show for me, making it 10 times more enjoyable than it already was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime was one of the best animes that has come out this season, in my opinion. It starts off simple, eventually branching out until it became an anime different from when it began. I don't know if I'm a sucker for romance being built into a plot, but I probably am seeing as how I reacted to the development of that relationship between Hayashi and Lily. Anyways, I hope you liked my ramble.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGo watch Net-juu no Susume! \\n",

The story isn't anything special\r\nThe story is the high point, and even that I am being overly generous with the 7 (I'll include a 1 sentence summary at the end that is a complete spoiler/the entire story)\r\nI've watched it over the last 3 evenings and really was expecting more.\r\nWould I recommend it? . . . kind of? If you are in the mood for an alright anime that really doesn't have a complex story filled with twists, one that doesn't have fancy fightscenes or anything, but does occasionally have a funny moment and does have character development then yes. If that doesn't sound appealing to you I'd avoid it\\n\\n\r\nBut wait how do I rate the characters so poorly with development? Because that is the only appealing character trait. None of the characters are memorable. . . at all. The two main ones can be best described as 'shy NEET' and 'generic businessman'\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk one line spoiler: The MC falls in love with a character online, big shock it is someone she knows IRL and the two most awkward people ever start dating.\\n\\n\r\nYes that is honestly the entire plot of this anime. Yes there are other characters but they really don't matter much either in game or out of the game. One character has a job, but it really isn't important beyond the fact that the other character is a self-proclaimed NEET and constantly reminds herself that he is to good for her",

            "content": "This is an incredibly sweet anime with solid characters. \r\nThe romance, as it is in many similar wish-fulfillment anime, is contrived and predictable. There are times where \"fate\" controls things much too closely--how characters meet 'for the first time', how they really knew each other in the past, how they get to know each other again now--feels in some ways forced. There are also moments where the characters fail to take action simply because the plot demands it, when in reality that character wouldn't hesitate for a second.  \r\nIn this case, however, the contrivances are a forgivable fault - the predictability is in someways reassuring, and the characters are worth rooting for. There are much worse anime to waste your time on.",

            "content": "TLDR; Disappointing storyline and a letdown for something which could have been much more.\r\nAn anime about ~30 year olds is normally aimed at adults, and so I was expecting more of a storyline based in realism compared to your typical high-school anime.\r\nWhat I got was something which was almost the most contrived anime which I have ever watched. Yes, it was still about love, and yes, the characterisation was very nicely done in the main, which possibly made it even worse as characters which feel very realistic and are doing realistic things, put into unrealistic situations felt very 4th wall breaking for me.",
