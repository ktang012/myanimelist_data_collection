            "content": "These days we often misuse words in ways that sometimes don't make sense. Take \"epic\" for example, and think about all of the occasions where the term has been applied as a colloquialism that simply means \"I enjoyed it\" , \"it was very good\", or some other sentiment along those lines. It's actually surprising how many people don't know the meaning or usage of the word, but rather than comment on the failure of education systems, let's have a look at how \"epic\" applies to an anime like Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (or The Legend of the Legendary Heroes, whatever floats your boat).\r\nThe originaleleven volume light novel series by Kagami Takaya was published in Dragon Magazine from February 2002 until October 2006 and has spawned a sequel (The Legend of the Great Heroes of Legend), and two spin offs (The Legend of the Legendary Heroes Anyway, and The Legend of the Black Fallen Hero), as well as being adapted as a drama CD, a PSP game, a manga, and the recent anime rendition.\\n\\n\r\nNow aside from mild curiosity at the obvious addiction to using the words \"legend\" and \"hero\" in some manner, one has to wonder if the anime adaptation can really live up to the popularity of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with an attack by the Nelphan army on the person of Ryner Lute, a layabout who is on a mission for his trusted friend, boss, and cause of all of his problems, King Sion Astal of Roland. Accompanying him on his journey is the warrior and perpetual dango addict Ferris Eris, a woman who may be a genius with a sword, but is pretty clueless with almost everything else (except dango). The pair have been tasked with finding and acquiring the legendary artifacts known as the Relics of Heroes, which lie hidden in various places across the continent of Menoris.\\n\\n\r\nAs with any fantasy tale there's an element of derivation inherent in the plot which results in several very familiar scenarios being played out over the course of the series. This in itself isn't a bad thing though, as these staples are often used to drive home a particular point, or as support for the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this anime really does need the support.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issues with Denstsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (DenYuuDen), are the lack of coherency with the story and the constantly changing pace of the plot. Viewers may often find themselves wondering how a particular situation came about, and while there are efforts to tie up certain loose ends, these are nothing more than papering over the cracks. The narrative suffers from a distinct lack of timely explanations, and events can lead the audience on a merry dance as they struggle to keep up with the storyline. This is exacerbated by the constant mood swings that occur from one episode to the next, and the addition of seemingly random comedy scenes give the viewer the sense that even the show itself has no idea what's going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nThe heart of the problem is simply that ZEXCS, like many other studios, have made a screenplay that is nothing more than a \"cut and paste\" rendition of the original source material. While there are some anime that get away with summarily stringing together disparate events, it would have been better for everyone if they at least made the effort to stick to the story. Better yet, ZEXCS could have followed the example set by Satelight when they made Guin Saga, and only adapted a portion of the story to ensure there would be a continuous flow to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOne has to wonder what moment of \"genius\" would persuade director Kawasaki Itsuro and series composer Yoshimura Kiyoko to make such a disjointed narrative.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side the lack of care with the storyline isn't really reflected in the look of the show, and DenYuuDen has some nice, imaginative scenes that really show what ZEXCS are capable of if they put their backs into it. The series features some decent animation, but the design principle impinges on this to a degree, partly because of the bishounen aspect of the show, but mainly because of the costumes. While the various outfits and garments are creative in their own way, there are several scenes where things like cloaks would clearly be a hindrance to any actual combat. In addition to this the characters tend to be on the impassive side when it comes to facial expressions, although this becomes less of an issue as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nDenYuuDen also features some very nice lighting and visual effects that add an extra layer of atmosphere to particular events, giving them an elegant, decadent, or dramatic feel that requires little in the way of added audio. Unfortunately this is offset by a lack of attention with small, specific details which seem like they were pencilled in as afterthoughts (Ryner's two year old beard is one example of this). While it's sometimes easy to overlook these relatively minor flaws, every now and then they become impossible to ignore, and viewers may be left wondering why the studio didn't notice these discrepancies before releasing certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe series features two opening themes, LAMENT Yagate Yorokobi Wo by Yuuki Aira (episodes 1 to 12), and Last Inferno by Ceui (episodes 13 to 24). The first OP is a rather bland affair that is generally well timed and edited, but ultimately fails to inspire. The second track is an altogether different beast that has far better choreography, and possesses a more serious and dramatic air than before. As for the ending themes, Truth Of My Destiny by Ceui and Hikari no Filament by Takagaki Ayahi, neither is anything other than a reasonable pop ballad coupled with pointless visuals that have no bearing on the story proper.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is interesting is the manner in which the background music is utilised. The tracks are often subtle additions that never really come to the fore unless the situation warrants more drama or tension, and because of this there are very few clashes with the dialogue. In addition to this the effects are given precedence over the music during a number of action sequences, and given that this series is a relatively disjointed affair, the quality of the audio choreography is more than a little surprising.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problem areas for DenYuuDen is the dialogue, in particular the tendency towards oratory and the sudden changes between banter and seriousness that are extensions of the inherent issues with the storyline, so it's to the credit of the actors and actresses that they deliver some decent performances. Fukuyama Jun (Ryner Lute), Ono Daisuke (Sion Astal), Takagaki Ayahi (Ferris Eris), and the rest of the cast are able to inject a degree of personality into their characters, but this is limited by some truly cumbersome scripting.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately this, together with the compression of the story, has a knock on effect where the characters are concerned.\\n\\n\r\nLike so many other fantasy anime out there, DenYuuDen follows the tried and tested method of event driven development, but like many other shows it also falls into the trap of poor characterisation. From the beginning of the first episode the viewer is expected to not only identify with Ryner, Ferris and Sion without knowing anything about them, they are also supposed to wait for any explanations because of the disjointed nature of the story. Add to that the fact that much of the growth is dependent on specific events that are scattered throughout the narrative, and the lack of personality comes to the fore.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, while there is little to maintain the viewer's interest in the characters at the start of the show, things do take a turn for the better at the midway stage so that by the end of the series they are no longer cardboard cutouts. The events that drive the development also become a little more complex as the story develops, which is nice to see as the tendency in fantasy anime is to add more detail to the story while keeping these \"signposts\" simple.\\n\\n\r\nNow it may seem like I'm being unfair to DenYuuDen by picking up on so many of its flaws, but there is a reason for this. While there is a lot that could have been done to improve the series as a whole, it's actually a rather enjoyable romp too. The byplay between Ryner, Eris and Sion can be odd because of the poor scripting, but there is humour in there, enough to make the viewer smile at least. In addition to that, there is a concerted effort to improve the story in the second half of the show, with darker themes emerging and more focus on consequences. The action sequences are decent enough, but every so often there is a flash of brilliance, and the characters can sometimes show a surprising depth that really should have been there for most of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the rub. It really, really could have been so much better than it is. There is so much that ZEXCS could have easily done to improve DenYuuDen, and even something as relatively simple as deciding to adapt only a portion of the light novel series would have made a profound difference.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that should be touched on is the mistaken assumption that Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu is somehow an homage to Legend Of The Galactic Heroes due to the similarity in the naming conventions. The problem is that far too many people who have heard of, or watched, the latter anime have automatically decided that DenYuuDen should be just as good when, aside from the name and the fact that heroes, politics and war are involved, the two bear very few similarities. It's a bit like saying apples and apricots should taste the same just because they're both fruits that grow on trees and their names start with \"ap\".\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, leaving that aside, the one thing that really stands out about this anime is that it's effectively an unfinished product, especially as the light novels are still publishing. The disjointed storyline and initially lacklustre characters make this a much more difficult show to invest in, and this is a shame as there are several key plot elements that are interesting enough to warrant much more attention.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, ZEXCS' attempt at adapting the novels has some good points, and while there is enjoyment to be had, it's a far cry from being an epic.",

            "content": "[Edit Part A: This original review was written on the basis of what I have seen up until episode 18 and around that episode the anime had two options 1. stick with the original novel, which has a sequel to it and continue with it or 2. going for an \"anime-only\" ending with 8 episodes to spare (26 episodes).  I would recommend not to read Edit Part B at the end of the original review, unless you want to.]\r\nOkay I admit, the title is a bit... I mean it's really something that can put you off. Add to that, a very very ordinary firstepisode definitely led many to have a thought such as \"Oh! Okay. Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (Legend of the Legendary Heroes). I will watch it later.\" or most likely, 'Meh, it's definitely not my type.\"  And yes, I can tell that with the number of people actually dropping it after first couple of episodes, let alone placed it in their 'on hold/plan to watch' list which is staggering.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, before you even read this review, I would suggest to watch the first three episodes (you can seriously do without the FUNistreams, since it is actually nicely animated) and drop the show if you like, well its more like I dare you would drop it once you've seen episode three. \\n\\n\r\nSo much for an introduction, here goes the real deal:\\n\\n\r\nLegend of the Legendary Heroes is based on a novel of the same title which goes back some 8 years from now (first published in 2002). The anime is almost an exact adaptation of the novel. The novel and its anime adaptation are based on a feudal European setting, just that, blended with Magic and Monsters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for a brief introduction to where the story picks up, Ryner Lute (Fukuyama Jun), a magician of the Empire of Roland goes on a journey to find what they call the 'Hero Relics' scattered all over the continent. He is partnered with Ferris Eris (Takagaki Ayahi), a beautiful, arrogant and insanely skilled swords-woman. Both of them have been dispatched by Sion Astal (Ono Daisuke), the young Hero-King of the Roland Empire. If it wasn't for Sion's slave-running, as what both Ryner and Ferris see him to be, Ryner would have been enjoying countless number of days taking his afternoon naps while Ferris enjoying her share of dango, and only dango in all of her meals. Everyday! \\n\\n\r\nTo give an insight, Hero Relics are assumed to be sources of immense power that can overthrow an entire empire, something Sion desires to have available at his disposal so that he can make his empire a force to be recognized. You can easily understand Ryner and Ferris wouldn't be the only ones on the hunt. As Ryner and Ferris keep searching for the relics, putting his absolute faith on both of them, Sion follows his dream to make an empire where everyone would have a wonderful life. Something that comes with a price indeed; Coup d'\u00e9tat followed by numerous assassination attempts from time to time from power hungry nobles and their followers. I won't say anymore than this. Rest are for you to find out, because it goes far beyond anything as simple as it might seem as you've just read.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is surprisingly good. I always tend to enjoy anime with lots of flashbacks, past happenings which often help a story to grow. Denyuuden, as what it is called in short, really is impressive on that regard. While the first episode is more like an introductory episode that goes to show the main characters involved in the anime, the following couple of episodes show flashbacks from where it all began, why Ryner set for the journey to find the relics, why Ferris has been appointed as his companion, and how, young Sion came to throne. These two episodes (2 and 3) are basically the foundation of the story that will take so many turns here and there as more characters are blended in while making the anime all too enjoyable, that when you will look back, you will be thrilled to realize how simply it all started. The story has unimaginable twists and when you think a character was included just for the sake of it, they will surprise you with the role they are going to play in the development of the whole story. Story wise, this couldn't be any better. And I dare say, I have seen lots of anime already to make such a rather bold statement. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime can be seen as from both the characters' point of views, as well as from the political aspects involved, which makes it a very intelligent anime. For example, the decisions Sion makes as a King often conflict with his philosophy, but he shoulders everything as a King should, refusing to give in to his ideals. At the same time, the conflicting nature of the characters within themselves makes it a very heartfelt anime. Like Ryner, who has been through enough, shows lack of emotion, although he cares for every living thing around him, ironically though, he puts threat on those around him just through his very existence. Ferris, who is always mocking Ryner doesn't falter to hold him dearly when he really needs it the most. And the anime translates a society that is ruled by the so called nobles and their hunger for power, and a society where everyone brands certain people as 'monsters' for the inhuman power they possess, ironically again, something they wish they never have possessed, something they were born with in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nicely depicted. From the absolute loyalty of the subordinates of Sion, for instance General Claugh Klom, to the emotional involvements of the members of the Roland Taboo Hunter team, (yeah, you have to know Milk Callaud (Fujita Saki) and her reverse-harem :P) everything makes sense. Characters making their entrance halfway through the series, for instance, the Hero-King of Gastark, Riphal Edea (Nakai Kazuya), or even the late, very late introduction of Tiia Rumiblue (Sakurai Takahiro) has been intensifying. And there are mysterious characters like Ferris' older brother Lucile (Sugita Tomokazu), Sion's right hand Miran Froaude (Suwabe Junichi) and Milk Callaud's second in command Luke Stokkart (Hino Satoshi) will make you ponder to understand their every move and their motives. You must have been really annoyed by now to see all those seiyuus in the bracket. But the reason behind putting them there is to show the number of popular voice-casts have been working on this anime, justifying the weight of the characters being portrayed overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is really of top notch. The backgrounds are nicely animated and gives you the feel of a feudal European setting coupled with magical terrains and mysterious plains. The actions are simply put, stunning. From the magical circles that Ryner draws before unleashing the commands, to Ferris' sword fights are animated smoothly without any glitch. Like I warned before, watching online streams, or stream-rips will kill half the real enjoyment. The fierce battles, magic circles, blood gores; you really cant enjoy them over low quality streams. This is not an anti-FUNi claim, just a fact which you can clearly confirm if you google the anime's screenshots/screencaptures. I would rather you buy the DVD/Blu-rays when they are out.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, particularly the BGM of the anime is really good. They change and merge so nicely with the mood that it makes the anime vibrant. One of the major contributions of BGMs is to propagate the emotional state of mind of the characters involved and Denyuuden scores a perfect 10/10 in that aspect. I would also like to say that the OP/EDs are really good, and grow into you as you continue the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside of the anime is probably every time it wants to pull a comedy. I would say it failed miserably to make me laugh even once. \\n\\n\r\n[Edit X: the following bits under [Ignore][/Ignore] was a conclusion I came up at episode 18. So they don't carry enough significance for my overall entertainment of the anime up till that point. Of course it changed after episode 24. Regardless, it was a nice watch and I found the anime quite good compared to many other shows that came out in Spring 2010 anime calender.]  \\n\\n\r\n[Ignore]I hope this review helps you to pick an anime that gives you a negative vibe when it actually is one of the real gems out there. I am enjoying this anime like nothing else from the Spring 2010 season and the reason behind writing this review is to make YOU find out what you've been missing out!\\n\\n\r\nAgain a reminder: Please do watch the first three episodes at least before coming to any conclusion. And if you still think its not your plate of dango, I would rather see you finding this review I took my time to write on 'Not Helpful'. [/Ignore]\\n\\n\r\n[Edit Part B: The anime decided to stick with the original novel and follow it until the final episode. Which left the Anime highly open ended and a lot of things to be answered. According to forum reads, twitter feeds and blogs, I have reached to a conclusion that unless there is a significant improvement of the market of DVD/Bluray Disc, which is really poor at the moment, a sequel is highly unlikely. So if you don't intend to read the sequel novel, which is still ongoing, this anime is definitely not for you. Other than that, I would just say that there were bits in the original anime trailer which were never shown in the 24 episodes run of the entire show, leaving a bigger question, why those bits were there in the trailer when they were never in the anime series at all. Of course, I am referring to the bits that directly showed parts that collaborates with where the anime ended and giving a glimmer of hope to a sequel of the anime. You just never know.]",

            "content": "I often think that as long as I know what to expect from a show, it couldn\u2019t disappoint me. First impressions from the title alone gave a sense it was trying too hard to be epic, but that didn\u2019t matter since I expected \u201cLegend of the Legendary Heroes\u201d to be a fun, clich\u00e9d romp. But instead of creating a brainless fantasy flick for dumb people like myself, the show adopts a taste for complexities with writing that leaves a bad taste.\r\nThe story opens with two of the three main characters, the wizard Ryner and the knight Ferris, as they journey across the continent of Menorisin search of powerful Hero Relics to aid our third main character, the High King of Roland, Sion. The lazy Ryner and steadfast Ferris aren\u2019t anything beyond that in the first episode, with the only noticeable interplay between them being a scene where Ferris calls Ryner a pervert. Unfortunately, this scene is a running gag throughout the show that turns the Ryner and Ferris duo from simple to cringeworthy.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the show follows Ryner and Ferris\u2019 adventures, meaning much of that time focuses on their relationship, which is Ferris calling Ryner a pervert for no reason; Ryner doesn\u2019t so much as see a pantyshot from Ferris, so it\u2019s not even clich\u00e9d in the way it should be, but outright unbelievable. Their relationship is 70% one running joke and 30% serious moments with no real progress between them, because they\u2019re only sentimental when the show calls for it. Their relationship goes in a circle, or maybe it\u2019s a see-saw; I don\u2019t care, but neither do the writers.\\n\\n\r\nIn one of the show\u2019s scenes, Ryner is going out of control for plot reasons while Ferris is trying to snap him out of it. After she manages to get through to him, Ryner breaks down and starts crying in her arms as the rain suddenly pours. This scene of clich\u00e9s doesn\u2019t work since there\u2019s a lack of tells on their progress. Ferris blushes maybe once before this while Ryner shows no interest in her at all. And even if this scene did work, they go back into being a weightless comedy duo until the story demands their sentiments again. And this happens more than once.\\n\\n\r\nBut Ryner and Ferris\u2019 relationship is harmless compared to the threads in the rest of the show. Ryner\u2019s lack of personality outside his laziness can be made up for with his background, but the show\u2019s storytelling often jumps back and forth from present day to flashback without any tell it\u2019s done so, making it hard to follow. Even then, most of what little backstory he has is in the later parts of the show. It\u2019s hard to take his tragic past seriously when the show often glosses over it for attempted comedy.\\n\\n\r\nFerris is an even bigger joke than Ryner. When she\u2019s not wrongly calling him a pervert for whatever reason, she\u2019s going on about dango flavors without much else to her character. Somehow, she has even less background than Ryner, and it doesn\u2019t help that this background is little more than skin service that isn\u2019t even charming, but a forced attempt at being dark and edgy. But, it wouldn\u2019t be a forced attempt at being dark and edgy if Ferris was a character worth caring for, if she had real progress and most of her time didn\u2019t focus on failed comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe final main character, Sion, is also a big joke. His character arc is about learning to make tough choices that come with being High King, but his personality doesn\u2019t show it at all. He\u2019s equally serious and easygoing until the end of the show, which makes it easy to wonder whether story events are affecting him at all. Most of his background involves characters that have one or two lines of dialog, which isn\u2019t enough for it to be taken seriously like it\u2019s supposed to. He\u2019s also incomprehensible, saying he doesn\u2019t want to rule like a tyrant one moment, then leaves his assassin servant to take extreme measures so he can reach his goals the next moment.\\n\\n\r\nSorry, I tried jumping over one clich\u00e9 and fell onto another. When the story isn\u2019t being lazy with its characters\u2019 progress or background, it tries TOO hard and ends up being a war and politics philosophy discussion without compelling characters to distract from the fact. These heavy themes require a delicate touch, but unfortunately most of the villains\u2014villains, not antagonists\u2014are wealthy, evil people that take away from any social depth the show tries to have.\\n\\n\r\nNot that what depth the show does have is worth much anyway. There\u2019s a lot more going on in the story, but most of it amounts to nothing or is rushed. One of the characters shows a thirst for vengeance without any build-up leading to that moment. The character he wants revenge on wants revenge on another character. And that final character is dealt with so quickly it disrespects the passion and empathy the first two characters (try to) invoke. If that sounds like a short plot description, then don\u2019t worry, because the show doesn\u2019t give these multiple story threads more than a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBut even with a lot of episodes, one of the characters still proves ineffectual.\\n\r\nWhen this character is introduced, she wants to reunite with Ryner because he was her friend during her rough childhood. It makes sense. What doesn\u2019t make sense is how bubbly she is for most of the show, badly clashing with her background. What\u2019s worse is that this isn\u2019t the set-up to a gag character, because she\u2019s supposed to be taken seriously. But her serious moments don\u2019t work, because she lacks the roundedness needed to make her bubbly and serious side believable as the same character.\\n\\n\r\nThe only decent characters are more like two pairings that are unfortunately not around for long. One of the characters in the first pairing appears at the early and later parts of the show. She meets someone she doesn\u2019t like at first, but in their next scene they\u2019re enjoying a cup of tea, and in the scene following she\u2019s a blushing maiden. The other pairing is a classic warrior and princess story that believably flows from adoration to sweetness; in the first scene they\u2019re smitten at first rescue, in the next scene they\u2019re trying to hide their feelings from their friends to no effect, and then they\u2019re enjoying a moonlight walk.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring the small amount of screentime these four characters have, they\u2019re believable because there\u2019s real progress to their relationships. Sure, it\u2019s cheesy, but it\u2019s at least an attempt at a pairing compared to Ryner and Ferris\u2019 see-saw relationship. It\u2019s not as layered as the other parts of the story, but being more layered doesn\u2019t mean better, but a greater chance to be worse. When there\u2019s more plot to juggle, it only falls down much worse when the juggle isn\u2019t kept up, and the juggle falls the moment it starts.\\n\\n\r\nThis is part of why Legend of the Legendary Heroes\u2019 writing leaves a bad taste, and what I mean when I say the story adopts a taste for complexities. It tries to execute too many threads at the same time and doesn\u2019t give enough time for each thread to be properly weaved. At the same time, the three main characters take up most of the story\u2019s screentime but have almost nothing to show for it. It\u2019s this odd combination of incoherent density and weightless quantity that makes this show such a failure from a storytelling standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nThis leaves only the presentation to save the show, but the visual part of that falls short. Save for Sion, his assassin servant, and the four pairing characters\u2014the last four lack screentime\u2014most of the character designs are multi-colored to the point where it\u2019s hard to tell them apart. For a world with swords and magic, many of the fight scenes are underwhelming for being nothing but beam spam or poor choreography that makes one question if the combatants are only as strong as the plot demands.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the presentation is the music, but music isn\u2019t the aesthetic focus of an action fantasy show. Still, it\u2019s loud when it needs to be, and has a surprising amount of grace during quieter scenes when it uses the art of silence to put focus on the dialog. Unfortunately, the music is held back by its odd habit of using random rock music during some scenes. This modern flare clashes with the medieval, fantasy feel of the show. I suppose it\u2019s trying to be cool, and in a better show it\u2019d be shameless fun, but here it comes across as trying too hard.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is odd, because looking at how the show\u2019s main characters are handled, it\u2019s like they weren\u2019t trying at all. No respect is given to most of the characters and their stories, it tries to tell too many stories, the stories often lack chronological coherence, the social themes lack any depth with its stereotypical villains, and the presentation is best where it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. This show does a few things right and everything else very egregiously wrong.\\n\\n\r\nBut the best thing I can say about this show is what Ryner goes on about from episode 1; take a nap. Sage advice, because taking a tap is preferable to watching Legend of the Legendary Heroes. Sure, you won\u2019t be doing anything, but at least it\u2019s better than getting Alpha Stigma-level angry at the people who made this.",

            "content": "Titles are essential in most forms of entertainment in order to draw attention. Titles, however, can also be misleading. Such was the case for me and the anime series entitled The Legend of the Legendary Heroes. It may be have been just me, but for some reason I did not find the title to be particularly appealing and it certainly did not paint an image that seemed interesting to me\u2014it felt too simple, too exaggerated. Then again, titles can be misleading.\r\nThe Legend of the Legendary Heroes is a fantasy piece\u2014a tale of magic and war in land inspired by Europe during the Middle Ages. Itdeals with Feudal Warfare, more or less. Its focus lies in a number of characters, each taking up a particular role in shaping the world that they reside in. The Roland Empire is the country brought into our attention. At its throne lies the striving Sion Astal, a king of quite a young age, but one that has decided to do everything within his power to change his kingdom for the good. Things are looking better than they have been for a while in Roland, but the greatest battle has yet to take place, for behind the shadows lie assassination attempts to overthrow the king and various conflicts between the neighboring countries.\\n\\n\r\nSion Astal knows that in order to prevail and fulfill his dream of changing the world for good he must find alternative ways of going about the problem. Therefore, he sends his good friend Ryner Lute, whom he made a promise to make the world a better place, and Ferris Eris, a female swordsman stemming to a clan in charge of guarding the king, beyond the borders of Roland and upon a journey to search for ancient relics that are said to have once belonged to a great warrior. These relics may hold the power to single-handedly turn the tides of battle in the bearer\u2019s favour.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the three aforementioned characters, which could be called the most important ones in the series, there are still lots of other ones that receive a notable amount of screen time and are quite vital to the progress of the story, such as Sion Astal\u2019s right-hand man Miran Froaude (a highly interesting character that remains as puzzling in the end as he ever was) or Milk Callaud, the captain of Roland\u2019s taboo-breaker squad who has her own personal reverse harem.\\n\\n\r\nToo many anime series like to paint their characters in black or white, but The Legend of the Legendary Heroes always remains in the gray area with most of its characters. Sure, Ryner Lute is a typical protagonist, yet even he has some pretty dubious past experiences. What\u2019s fascinating is the way we gain a different perspective on certain characters, since some tend to change their alignment (or so it appears, at least) or something about them is revealed that puts them in a completely different light. Flashbacks are no stranger in this anime and they are often used in clever ways, usually giving us more insight about the characters and their principles (or their lack of them), but they also tend to become dull or overused at times (so everyone had a bad childhood\u2014how convenient).\\n\\n\r\nMagic plays an important part in The Legend of the Legendary Heroes. The person most in contact with it is Ryner Lute, who is actually one of Roland\u2019s greatest magicians (not many know this since he prefers afternoon naps over battles) and an Alpha Stigma bearer, meaning his eyes can detect forms of magic, but he is cursed as much as he is blessed, for those possessing the Alpha Stigma tend to go out of control and destroy everything in their path if things get too intense. There\u2019s certainly some sword fighting to be had throughout the series (especially from Ferris\u2019 part), but most battles are fought using magic. Thankfully, the fight scenes are very well-done and they\u2019re always highly entertaining and easy to decipher (no weird camera angles or hurried editing here, don\u2019t worry).\\n\\n\r\nOne of this anime\u2019s most impressive aspects is the story. It may not be innovative or original, but it\u2019s executed in a spectacular manner, often exploring different themes or following several plot paths all at once. The main storyline never feels neglected, but somehow the series always finds time to develop other things at the same time and offer each of its characters satisfactory screen time. The episodes work great because their filled with a lot of variety, often featuring fashbacks and focusing on several plot points. The Legend of the Legendary Heroes gets a lot done in twenty minutes\u2019 time, always remaining entertaining yet never feeling rushed or overloaded.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is truly excellent, often eye-popping, but it does exhibit some problems. For one, some of the characters\u2019 facial expressions could have been drawn better, especially when it came to scenes depicting comedy. My other gripe is with an episode about halfway through the series which uses a different art style from the rest of the episodes. The reason why the anime changed styles was because the episode was more action-packed than the usual ones, but that still doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that that certain episode felt too unfamiliar to work in balance with the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most important drawback of this anime is its conclusion, or rather the lack thereof. While the series does not end with a cliff-hanger, it does leave most things open for a supposed sequel. However, a sequel coming out or not completely depends on how well this anime does on a financial level (it hasn\u2019t been doing very well up to this point from what I\u2019ve heard). So before deciding whether to give The Legend of the Legendary Heroes a watch or not, you might want to take into consideration the fact that things may never be resolved if no sequel is produced (of course, we\u2019ll always have the light novels to ease that pain).\\n\\n\r\nDespite such flaws, The Legend of the Legendary Heroes remains an excellent fantasy anime series. The story is very well done, the characters are thoroughly interesting and adopt shades of gray instead of black and white and every episode is as enjoyable as the previous one. Don\u2019t let its corny title be the deciding factor when it comes to considering whether The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is worth your time.",

            "content": "The unique (and corny) name is what got my interest in this anime. I read the description looking forward to a great plot that contained fantasy and adventure, but it ended up with trite comedy, disappointment and magic tricks.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nGeneral Scenario:\r\nThe beginning (first two episodes) was dare I say, terrible? It's most likely to turn viewers off leaving them to think \"I'll pass\". It jumps around, confusing the viewer instead of being intriguing. The story contains Ryner Lute being a lazy student and Ryner as well as Ferris searching for relics. It's much more than that but unfortunately it doesn't evolve everything it introduces. Forexample: What happened to the people of the land that was conquered by Roland? There was not a significant follow up. How about God's Eye group (the group of kids who were outcast because of Alpha Stigma)? You would think Ryner would be concerned about them. They should have used less of their time on Ferris love for Dango and more on the plot. It was like they were trying to cram a whole plot into 24 episodes, when in order to develop the plot into a masterpiece for what they were trying to present, it needed more time than that. A concept does not guarantee an excellent finished product.\\n\\n\r\nForm of Development/Pace:\\n\r\nThe pace was moderate for each individual episode, but overall I would say it's fast even though it doesn't seem that way. Since it tries to cram a lot of information in 24 episodes, a lot of development is left out of the loop.\\n\\n\r\nSides stories/ Extra space:\\n\r\nThere are no fillers however there is one recap episode.\\n\\n\r\nBelievable?\\n\r\nIt's believable it's just poorly done to where people connect with the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe Conclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThe Legend of the Legendary Hereos' conclusion was a big disappointment, reminding me of the ending of the atrocity known as Pandora Hearts /\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30cf\u30fc\u30c4,/ Pandora H\u0101tsu (I haven't done a review on that but I should. I'm already expecting hate mail for that review). It ended with a test of friendship (23rd episode) and bringing back people that the anime left behind but not to contribute to the plot it was more like \"hey, these people you forgot about they are still alive\" kind of feel (24th episode). It also left the viewer to ask what in the hell was the story about? Was it about finding relics, a legend of legendary heroes or was it attempting to be about the struggle of existing as an outcast (Ryner) and the burden of wearing a mask (Sion and Ferris, when it came to her issues and how she acted them out on Ryner)? Conclusion are supposed to bring the plot together and make the viewer at peace because of everything made sense it's not supposed to leave you hanging with a lot of questions unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nWhat kept my interest:\\n\\n\r\nWhat kept my interest as the viewer is wondering how will the characters overcome their struggles. Sion with the pressure of trying to produce a \"perfect world\", a more harmonious world. Ryner finding true happiness leaving the mental despair of the Alpha Stigma behind and Ferris with her mental trauma, how will she overcome her fear of abandonment by those who loves her and her truly learning how to display love. (Instead of putting up walls and beating Ryner up and jokingly at his character for comic relief would she ever come to a place where she is truly vulnerable.)\\n\\n\r\nExplanation of rating:\\n\\n\r\nAt most I would rate this story 6 out of 10. 6, meaning fine. It had the potential to be great but failed but at the same time it'll keep your interest anyways. Critically I would rate it a 4 (4 meaning bad), instead of the comic relief it could have used that time for plot. Black Butler /\u9ed2\u57f7\u4e8b/ Kuroshitsuji is an example of funny moments but the plot is more essential and the comedy does not attempt to make up for lack of plot. However I did wonder how it would all pan out so at most I would give it a 6 for fine because some might love the hell out of it despite it's flaws while others looking at it critically would recognize what a big disappointment it is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is splendid. It would have been better if had a great plot to flow with. I love the color schemes and the details and colors of the character costumes. Ferris costume is a treat with her purple and pink costume. This anime contained nice reflections and magic effects esp. the glow of the Alpha Stigma eyes, beautiful sunsets and detailed and fitting backgrounds. There isn't much to complain about the artwork. I don't remember one episode where I felt that the art team was slacking off on their job so with that I would give the artwork 8 out of 10. 8 meaning very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning theme and (especially) end theme compliments the series. The end theme were the better out of the two but nothing outstanding that makes me wanna rate higher. I like themes that encourage me to learn the lyrics not fast forward or skip if I have a chance. The background music was good though, it complimented the artwork and theme of the story. There were no annoying voices so that was a plus. So I would give it an 7 out of 10, 7 meaning good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI would rate the character 6 out of 10, 6 meaning fine. The main characters Ryner, Ferris and Sion have issues that one can relate or sympathize with. That what makes them appealing to the story. Ryner have been rejected by society and still consider those who reject him well being. He often struggles with the will to go on in a world that hates him. Ferris has her trauma from her parents and she acts that out on Ryner with joking about his behavior being lewd and perverted while physically hitting him. Sion abandoned by one parent while the other one died, rose to power . He carries the burden of the world on his shoulders by trying to do the right thing. If the story was right it would have been beautiful to see how Sion finds balance in ruling a kingdom and being happy, Ryner would have overcome his struggle and Ferris would have faced her trauma and how it has affected her behavior towards a person she obviously cared about... Ryner. None of that happened instead the potential for great characters who could overcome were left how they were found in the ending. No significant progression at all.\\n\\n\r\nWith the side characters, they were introduced but some of them weren't effectively utilized to be a benefit to the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEpisode by episode I enjoyed the anime after the beginning the first two episodes in particular. However on an all overall scheme I'm disappointed esp. with the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt averages out to a 6.8, most of that would be due towards the non-plot reviews so that should be taken into consideration. I'm putting down to 6 so it wouldn't give any false hope. This might be an anime where the viewer has to watch again to catch little details to be satisfied with the plot but that shouldn't be necessary and wouldn't be necessary if it was written well.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend to someone else? I don't think I would. If you are fond of the animation for cosplay reasons and can handle the first two episodes then buy all means go for it but don't say I didn't warn you.\\n\\n\r\nFinal notes:\\n\r\nEven though I heavily criticized this anime I liked it and enjoyed it despite it's flaws. :-)",

            "content": "'Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (Legend of the Legendary Heroes)' is a medieval fantasy adventure about Ryner Lute, a social outcast born with powerful magic eyes, and his friend the new king Sion Astral's quest to end all wars.\r\nStory/Character:\r\nIt's impossible to watch this show without being reminded of similar themed series. For example, the magical medieval setting of 'Scrapped Princess', art style of 'Koukaku no Regios', magic eyes of 'Code Geass', and knighthood and characters of 'Fate/stay night\". However, this show had the mother of all premises by blending all the best qualities from such series with an interesting mission of collecting \"Hero's Relics\".\r\nWith sucha cool mix of setting, characters, and items, we could've expected a captivating epic adventure. What we actually got was a rather dull, huge mess of a story.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the show had an awful story flow. A classic case of poor anime adaptation of a novel where the story jumps from one place to another. One minute, you're watching Ryner and Ferris trying to find Hero's Relics. Next minute, you're back in kingdom where Sion is working. Then jump back 5 (?) years before returning to a new adversary we've never seen before. Unlike novels, this effect on anime makes it nearly impossible to empathize with characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe character motivation is always questionable. All the kings are fighting for the same dumb reason: \"Slaughter all my neighbors to stop war\". This is 2010... there are already so many anime and movies about such contradicting and clich\u00e9 themes. There were also a lot of scenes where characters are obviously capable of accomplishing a better result, yet simply give up or their spells are nerfed just to achieve the desired plot development. For example, the destruction of bridge by Kiefer in the final episode when she could've clearly crossed first before destroying it. Such inconsistencies are usually unnoticeable in novels, but with visual support in anime, it just doesn't make any sense.\\n\\n\r\nThere also was a deliberate power balancing and DBZ-like increment of average strengths. For example, Ryner and Ferris have not been able to obtain a single Hero's Relic, while far weaker antagonists manage to obtain and use them as their primary means of attack. In addition, somehow the victors don't seem to be interested in collecting the loser's Relic after defeating them. The story is very much driven by sudden appearance of new adversaries. One minute, a character seems to be invincibly strong, then a new foe appears, and previous antagonist doesn't even stand a chance. The prime examples are Sui Orla, Miran Frouade, and Tiia Rumiblue. On the other hand, our hero and heroine seem to be able to put up a decent fight no matter how strong or weak the opponent is (they even struggle against minions).\\n\\n\r\nThere were way too many characters for 24 episodes. Not only that, most of them had very limited role and weak presence. I just browsed through the character list, and didn't even remember half of them. That's how bad the side characters were. And then we have the hero and the heroine, who were just lazy Lelouch Lamperouge ('Code Geass') and outgoing Saber ('Fate/stay night). Despite Ryner having Alpha Stigma, he only casted about 4 different spells, 80% of which being \"Lightning\".\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was funny at first, but it got tedious through uncreative repetition of dango and sleep. A lot of action scenes, but not very exciting unless Alpha Stigma is fully activated. The story tries to be dark in the second half, but it just seemed out of place due to light first half, and didn't make sense. Overall, very boring, corny story and character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAmazing, considering a large portion of animation work was subcontracted to Korean studios.\\n\r\nCharacters are usually very detailed, and every character is easily distinguishable. While the background is not as detailed as it could be, the change in mood through lighting worked well.\\n\r\nSFX was wonderful in action scenes and with magic circle or spells.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the presentation (camera angles, cuts, art style, action choreography etc) were rather dull, and seemed lazy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLoads of established seiyuu even in minor roles. Some annoying, but on annoying characters to begin with, so it was somewhat tolerable. Everyone sound like they should, especially Ferris' voice was great.\\n\r\nWhile Ryner played by Fukuyama Jun was excellent, I can't help but notice how his voice was exactly same as Lelouch in 'Code Geass' series. The two characters are already similar as it is (both having magic eyes), having the same seiyuu completely cemented Ryner as a cheap copy. The evil/mad laugh really was godly though, the best I've ever heard.\\n\r\nBGM in battle and emotional scenes were well done and dramatic. The rest are rather ordinary and forgettable, but didn't sound out of place.\\n\r\nAll four OP/ED in the series were pretty catchy and suit the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis series was by far the most disappointing series of the season (ending Fall). By episode 3, this series had such a strong introduction that it could've easily been an fascinating fantasy series, but it seemed to deteriorate by the episode from there, eventually leading to an inconclusive ending where nothing is explained and half the deliberate plot devices unused.\\n\\n\r\nFrom boring story, character, to lazy animation and voice acting casting choice, what this series suffered through was a widespread absence of creativity. Zexcs once again proves their incompetence, and this show did not live up to its title as the 'Legend of the Legendary Heroes'. It was an epic failure.\\n",

Honestly, the relic searching did not really last all that long. One thing that stood out to me in this anime is it was actually very funny, there should have been a comedy genre added, however, comedy was not the only thing that caught my attention. \r\n The premise of the story could seem a bit cliche, there are quite a few other anime where the main has an incredible power and has to overcome the effects of a past that heldmany hardships due to this power, but nonetheless this anime was still pretty great. It was enjoyable to see the hardships that Ryner had endured throughout his life and how he was able to overcome them. Also, they put quite a bit of back story on the other characters, such as Sion and Ferris, which was nice to see. That backstory adds a better connection to the characters as they face the conflicts together. Now onto my specific review points.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nAs I stated above, it does seem at first glance to be a cliche of sorts, but the synopsis is quite under-developed. There is more than just them searching for relics, much of it is based on the power that Ryner has and the hardships that came and are to come from it. Also, the comical parts in this story were quite enjoyable as well, whether it be the constant whining or witty remarks of Ryner about his naps, or Ferris' constant belittling of Ryner with her large imagination of perversion.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was not anything spectacular, although it was well done and they did not use many shortcuts. They had a good amount of detail as well. The gore scenes usually had some sort of shade above them not making them easy to see, but it was still good drawn overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound was ok. Nothing really struck me as really bad, or really good, it matched fine, but it did lack in some respects. The English voice acting was pretty good, the main characters seemed to match well with the voice actors. I have no speculation on the Japanese voice actors, as I have not watched the subbed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nI liked the fact they gave lots of back-ground information on the other main characters and didn't just focus of Ryner. The flash backs and the information on Ryner was very tragic and gave a lot of meaning to the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nThe story was great. I loved the way the characters were portayed, being that Ryner is a lazy guy that has witty remarks, and Ferris having the very funny imagination. The comedy in this anime was very funny, even though there was not a comedy tag. Also, being that Ryner was so powerful, it was cool to see how he progressed with his power, and how he gave it meaning.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. There were many aspects I did not plan to see, such as the comedy, and the small amount of romance. Many people may see it as cliche and boring, but the synopsis really does it no justice. So give this anime a try, and maybe you too, will find it to be a great watch.",

            "content": "Densetsu no yuusha no Densetsu(The legend of the legendary heroes) seems to be very good at leaving bad first impressions. I mean, just by looking at the name, generic character designs, boring looking synopsis and a badly done first episode, it is very easy to dismiss the series as an uninteresting fantasy based around the same old beaten-to-the-death ideas. But here's the thing, although the name suggests otherwise, deep down Denyuden is a charming series which knows how to take itself seriously.\r\nBased on a novel series which was published in 2002, Denyuden is a story of Ryner Lute, a lazy guy who wants nothing morethan to sleep for ten thousand years, and his relationship with his best friend, Sion Astal, an idealist king who finds himself facing the harsh reality of the world. The story follows Ryner as he tries to deal with the world who sees him just as a monster, and Sion, who finds himself getting further and further away from the dream of creating an ideal country without any sadness. I have to say, Denyuden walks a very dangerous line as it tries to mix humor with themes like drama and betrayal, but it manages very well and I just loved the way the mood suddenly changes from silly comedy to deadly politics in this show. Not only that, there are many other elements like saving the world, sad childhood, betrayal, young leaders etc which can easily go wrong and destroy the show, but they are used well and only contribute in making the show more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe staff behind Denyuden is pretty unimpressive, but I have to admit, they did a very good job on this series. The series doesn\u2019t try to be too ambitious, and slowly builds up its characters and fleshes out its setting. The first half of the series, pretty much does nothing more than introducing characters and giving them a clear role. Many of the subplots are just there for the character introduction. The second half of the series uses all that building up efficiently and things suddenly pick up pace and that\u2019s where the show really starts shining. The characters starts developing in the way you want them to, the story starts becoming very interesting and series throws away most of its humor and finally gives you the awesomeness its first arc promised. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story of Denyuden is not the series\u2019 best part, it is still impressive. There are many interesting elements in the plot(Alpha stigma, Hero relics) and as the plot moves further, the questions just keep on increasing. The series also does a very good job on answering the questions yet not answering them. Many answers are followed by even more questions. Also there are many hidden answers in the series itself. The downside to this is that it may leave a few confusing parts but that can be solved by re-watching the series after you have finished it. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the series may not be too special itself, but the way it is used, getting fleshed out by its politics, makes it very interesting. I love the way the characters are influenced by the world they live in. There are many myths and legends in the world of Denyuden and the way they effect the main plot also proves very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the best part of the series, the characters. Yes, the characters of this series are just awesome. Whether it\u2019s the main characters or the side characters, all of them have distinct personalities and are really fun to watch. I just love the main characters. They are just fleshed out really well. I especially liked how Ferris, who at one time was really annoying, turns enjoyable in the end. Same goes for the side characters. Even the annoying ones like Milk. They all turn charming later in the series. I also like how there are many flashbacks in the story. Normally too many flashbacks are boring for me, but here they tell that the characters don\u2019t forget what happens and try to develop themselves. This is true for especially Ryner. He was good at the beginning of the series, but he really developed in the series and by the end, he turns into a really fantastic character.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes of this series are okay, but I really love the voice acting here. It really brings life to the characters. And the use of BGM is pretty good too. The art isn\u2019t too bad but nothing awesome either. I really liked the animation of the last arc, but apart from that it\u2019s nothing that stands out. \\n\\n\r\nWell, to sum up and add some stats to the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10): Impressive and keeps you interested till the end\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): Impressive voice acting and use of music\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8/10): Nothing special here although I liked the work they did on the last arc\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): Really awesome characters. Loved everyone of them\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10): I loved Denyuden and it\u2019s certainly one of my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nI would also like to add that if you are wondering whether to watch the show or not, just give the show a chance and watch the first arc(first 4 episodes) and then decide whether to continue or not.\\n",

Or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it might sound cliche but the fact that Ryner and Ferris were forced to work together and each have their personal quirks make all of their interactions so amusing to watch. \\n\\n\r\n(For example: Ryner -the real main character of the show- is the laziest guy ever and always prefers to take naps over doing anything. Ferris is a beautiful \"assassin\" who's quick to resorting to violence [[at least towards Ryner]] easily twists and misinterprets situations in weird ways and [arguably] is only devoted to dangos [A kind of dessert/snack made up of several sweet sticky mochi-like balls that are \"shish-kabobbed\" on long thin sticks]\\n\r\nThrow in a few more characters with equally weird quirks/moments and magic & mystery behind the Legendary relics and you've got potential for a amusing and fun series! \\n\\n\r\nHowever it's not all fun and games as something dark & mysterious is also hidden beneath the plot....\\n\\n\r\nI recommend checking out this anime to anyone who's interested at all in anime with this type of setting/backdrop and those who like a good mix of action and comedy but also don't mind dark twists/drama, etc.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\r\nMy personal ratings and few other random comments:\\n\r\n((This part down here has now been changed to reflect my impressions up to episode 18)) \\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\n** The political side (aka Sion's side) of the plot can be rather confusing & unclear sometimes if you're not paying attention especially towards the beginning but if you get the general gist it's enough to understand everything else.\\n\r\nThe other parts of the story are somewhat slow-paced and the episodes are constantly littered with cliffhanger endings but when it's all pieced together it's an epic story filled with a good balance of comedy and twists and those touching moments that make you feel sad for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\n**Colors are generally \"soft and smooth\" and not \"stressful\" to the eye. It also tends to use \"bright colors\" more than other color tones....though that's not to say the show doesn't know how to use dramatic lighting ---It's done well enough for those key dramatic moments, etc. A pretty standard yet fitting art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\n**It's never bothered me so it's not bad to say the least. I think it's more or less fit in nicely with the moods of various parts as well (otherwise It would have bothered me) By the way, OP and ED songs are pretty good/catchy unlike other series I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\n**Character backgrounds are only expanded on when the episode/plot pacing finds it necessary. This can lead to a good mix of well-timed character introductions vs the not so well-timed ones. At least the main 3 (Sion, Ryner, and Ferris) do not suffer from a lack of enough character development. Overall I'd say the major characters have been expanded well like they deserve while most minor characters (and sadly- a few major characters) have yet to have a purpose established\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\n**Outside of the Sion moments (Yes I'm sorry Sion...I find you mostly boring) The other parts are either action packed or full of amusing conversations/situations that even something as mundane as walking through a town or forest can turn into something amusing. I really enjoy watching every episode and always can't wait for the next to air. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nAs of what I've seen so far, I give an overall score of 8...but that may change later on...",

I'm sure no one would call out the translators if it was just shortened to Legendary Heroes. \r\nSo a couple years ago I got the entire series for FREE on itunes. Thats right folks it didn't even cost me a dime. Like any anime fan I downloaded it without a second thought, I didn't even look at the summary. But after 15 minutes of the first episode I turned off my computer and walked away, never turning back to see the rest ofthe series.  Lesson learned from this - there was a reason why this series was for free.\\n\r\nBut lo and behold! Years later I find it on Netflix. It's like this series haunts me!! This time I watched the whole thing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\n It's plain! it's like a cardboard cutout of the definition of anime. It didn't stand out to me at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nwhile the music wasn't bad it wasn't amazing either. It was just there.\\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nNow imagine Berserk and attack on titan had a child. That unholy offspring would be this. Now if done correctly itd be an amazing anime, but the writing had no structure.\\n\r\nThe begining was bad. Didn't hold my attention at all.\\n\r\nAlthough once the story started explaining itself and I became attatched to the characters and knew their background. Then that's when this anime truly got me interested. \\n\r\nBut the ending is where it all fell apart. That excitement it built shattered instantly. This anime expained nothing. When I thought it was going explain something it'd turn around and leave me with even more questions than before. How did Sion ever become king? What did Sion do the 2 or so years Ryner was in prison? What is going on the entire last episode?! Seriously someone explain that last episode to me!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nhonestly 75% of the characters were useless and could have been cut from the show entirely and it wouldn't have effected this anime one bit. \\n\\n\r\nI dont understand how some people are giving this 10/10 rating. Was it a masterpiece? Absolutely not. But it did have some redeming qualities. For a while there I would have given this anime an honest 8/10. But after the last 4 episodes that 8 dropped so far it became a 5. By the end of it all I felt like I wasted my time and unfortunately there is no way I'll ever get back the hours I wasted on this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a better  fantasy/action anime I point you to Berserk. (Or anything really. Just don't watch legend of the legendary heroes)\\n",

            "content": "This anime is a case study in how to spend 24 episodes telling a grand-scope story only to get nowhere in the end. Is it worth spending all that time only to have no finale? No. Absolutely not. There are some stories worth experiencing just for the ride itself, but there are others where every single passage builds to a grand showdown/big reveal/epic sacrifice/whatever only to completely abandon that idea in favor of sequel baiting; here, there is no sequel and won't ever be one, so the entire anime is a pointless endeavor from the outset.\r\nI'm entirely serious when I say that all 24 episodes(to the very last moment) work tirelessly to construct a foundation of mammoth proportions. There are so many side plots and interesting characters built up but 100% of them are unresolved in the end--and it also doesn't help that Densetsu's primary worldbuilding technique is an over-reliance on flashback sequences. In my estimation 15% of this show is flashbacks, and while I generally loathe that technique it wasn't so bad and I could have looked past it. Unfortunately none of it amounts to anything.\\n\\n\r\nThere are early hints of brilliance with Ryner's colossal power level, but besides a titillating peek it never shows itself again. The entire last half I was anticipating it being unleashed but it never came--just like everything else. It's like a neverending game of \"no honey, it's YOUR turn to enjoy yourself\" where no one gets off and everyone just goes to sleep out of frustration. \\n\\n\r\nI've come out of pointless series with good impressions before because, as I said earlier, some journeys are worth experiencing. What differs here is that absolutely everything contributes to setting the snowball rolling downhill. All the little plot developments, character quirks, funny asides, and long philosophical diatribes build and build and build only for the sun to come out and melt the snow before the bottom. So, what do you get for 24 episodes? A decent magic system, snappy animations with impressive backdrops, a large cast of likeable characters where everyone has good motives, a musical score that's largely serviceable with flashes of brilliance, and a surprising amount of lighthearted scenarios (episode 23 in particular was extremely good in this regard). What you don't get is even a hint of closure, every single narrative thread still open, and an overwhelming sense of \"what the fuck was the point?\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat an overwhelming disappointment. This should have been amazing.",

            "content": "The End\nIn this world there are many legends. The legend of Zelda, the legend of Excalibur, the legend of leisure suit Larry. Likewise it also isn\u2019t usual for many Legends to carry hero in their titles; Legend of Condor heroes and the legend of Galactic heroes are two good examples of this particular trend. However, this series I\u2019m about to review (in my now trademarked half-assed style) does what very few series before have dared to do. It gives itself a name so damn awesome you\u2019ll cream yourself every time you think about it. Welcome to Legend of the Legendary Heroes (DenYuDen!).\nCharacters\nWith a name asawesome as this, the story has to be good. I'm guessing probably full of action, epic battles, great characters and manri men. Well, if you (like me) thought that was the case you couldn't be anymore wrong. Try dumplings, tsundere, more dumplings and assassination attempts that clearly aren't Ezio based(ubisoft, western?... ok ok tenchu based then) . The plot is exactly as written in the title; the primary (and often randomly exploited) story is about a search for legendary hero artifacts from a past age, called legendary hero relics(very original). You might want to bring a map for this one as you'll have almost no clue where this story is headed. One episode they'll be searching for the hero relics(and failing) and the next episode Ryner and Ferris will be wasting minutes discussing dumplings in a very bakemonogatari like banter. There's literally little to no consistency in this shows tone. Which really wouldn't be so bad if that was what they were aiming for. However, that is definitely not the case as you'll see that shortly after these episodes about dumplings, going on a date and various other things(that belong on a slice of life show and not a show with the name legend) we are given massacres, wars and tales of hidden corruption. As a result this show has no flow, no sense of direction. Now I'm well aware that this was originally a light novel and perhaps this style of narration worked best for that format. But for an anime? Many times I found myself confused at to what was going on. This especially worsened towards the end. Where I assume the producers/studio found out that they had blown their budget and poorly managed the episodes and now suddenly had to fit 100 plot devices into the last 2-3 episodes. Seriously, I don't even know if what happened at the end could even be called a cliffhanger. It all just felt very anti-climatic and rushed. Cliffhangers are supposed to build the tension for a possible(or in this case improbable) continuation. All this ending did was build more confusion. There are so many questions left unanswered at the end. Who is Ferris' brother? Why is Gastark so desperately after the relics? What is the point to all this Lonesome Devil Dark Hero business ? I fear at the rate they're going even if they did continue this series it would take at least another 2 seasons before any of these questions get answered. And we'll all be left no doubt with a feeling that it was 2 seasons 2 many(ahahah...no?). Be that as it may the story does captivate it's audience and if you get past the slow beginning you'll definitely find something moderately interesting. For that reason alone it gets a 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\nStory\\n\\n\nThe characters. Ah what would a show be without its characters(what would a daimyo review be without random questions and comments)? First and foremost we have Grif...Sion Astal as this shows black knight.  He starts off with good intentions(conquering the world), a coup and later down the road begins to ask himself where all of this went wrong. It isn't Sion's fault though, Sion's mom was a commoner and his father was a noble so it completely makes sense to us the viewers when we see things like Sion being split into two personalities. His first personality and the personality that defines his character as whole (as it sets the tone for yaoi fanfiction writers across the globe) is the typical shojo male.  Flamboyant and visually effeminate it is the face he usually shows when talking to Ryner(suspicious). It is also the one usually displayed during this show's ending credits. His 2nd personality however is what I would describe as the serious fucking business look. Anything can happen when he displays this look ranging from: wars, noble executions and various attempts to kill his best friend. The reason for all these things? I suppose you could explain the first two kingly business and all that but the last one is up for grabs. Is Sion a crazy sadistic mofo(awesome)? Or is he just jealous that Ryner loves Ferris and not him? Who knows, who cares he's the villain and that's as much as the series wants us to believe. Who needs a motive? Evil is evil guys. Next up we have Ryner what I guess you could call this shows primary protagonist. What you need to know about Ryner is that in Japan people that don't work and want to sleep all day are cool dudes(shikimaru, etc). Where just about everywhere else they're jackasses (or daimyos). The main difference however, between a Ryner and a Daimyo is a Ryner has no reason to be lazying about all day. Ryner has atleast 3 women who would come(pun) to his every whim and call. The fact that he has what could potentially become a harem makes Ryner anime 2.0 approved. His first bi... love interest is this chick by the name of Kiefer (ran out of good names). Not much needs to be said about her and so I won't say anything else. But please do feel free to imagine and ad lib whatever this loquacious Daimyo might say.  His 2nd and by far more tsundere love interest is Ferris (Ferris? Ferris? Ferris Bueller?). Just as you might imagine she loves hitting our main character and subsequently wasting our time pretending not to like him. Many an episode died as these two tried to conceive what would only be described as a bastard plot. Don't get me wrong though I'd love to bone her, but would I marry her? No. My life is what could only be described as an action anime full of suspense, violence, explosions and tissues(don't ask). Having her involved would change my life into some sort of mediocre slice of life. And that is exactly what Ferris does to Legend of the Legendary heroes. Her interactions with Ryner while they may seem interesting to some just remove quality from the show. Finally for the last love interest, we must ask ourselves this question. What does a show need to be greenlight for production these days? Random dialogue check, tsundere check, moe check, bishounen males check. Seems like everything doesn't it. But in the words of the eternal captain Konata of the USS Fap-J \"Make it loli\". Now you'll have to excuse me for not knowing this last ones name off the top of my head so I will just call her Orange Juice. In fact it is my opinion she was just added to ensure that this show maintained anime 2.0 standards. Without Orange Juice, Ryner is just in a love triangle( easily solved when studying rumbling hearts). With her, Ryner has a certified harem. The fact that Orange Juice is also a loli guarantees sales. Now we have other characters and once again simply out of lazyness I won't comment on them. Don't worry you really aren't missing out on anything all we have left is shotas, hentai sized women(mmm), more bishounen and very poorly written blood knights. Once again proving that if you can't write a story with a few characters adding a bunch of them won't make it any better (though it does make my rants longer). 6/10\\n\\n\\n\nOverall\\n\\n\nGoing by the trend in my scores a 7 in the story and a 6 in characters can only be the sign of worse things to come. Normally you would be right but believe it or not I rather enjoyed this series. Now some of you may think I've gone AWOL but it really isn't that bad(it isn't that good either). The most entertaining stories I found usually had to with Sion's story of conquest. I found that the darker elements helped to combat the uneventful I love Lucy type plots. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\nEntertainment\\n\\n\nDespite all it's flaws though, unlike another show I rated and review similar to this, Legend of the Legendary Heroes almost never comes off as pretentious. It doesn't try to fool the viewers into believing its made a masterpiece of a show. Neither does liking this show require one to kiss the feet of Kagami Takaya, the shows creator. For those reasons alone I am truly grateful. At the end of the day it's up to you (or your favourite reviewer) to decide whether or not you will like this show more than let's a stardriver or an index. But with so many shows attempting to blend different genres into one mass produced food tablet you'll find that no matter what you decide to watch this or next season everything will seem oh so similar. DenyuDen just did it in a way that wasn't dreadfully painful to watch. 7/10",

            "content": "Also known as Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu, an anime with a silly name if ever there was one. Now where to begin with this one? Densetsu starts off pretty straightforward- a magical fantasy with sword fights, a quest for powerful items, blah dee blah blah, been there, done that. Nothing new. However, I have to admit that my expectations were soon blown out of the water when the show escalated into something much darker and much more ambitious than what it first seemed. To anybody who starts off the series all I can sayis watch until episode three before you decide whether to watch it or not.\\n\\n\r\n          There's quite a bit of mood-swinging involved where one moment you'll be laughing at the lighthearted talk and the next you'll be watching a bloodbath. The series has its high and low points in its 26 episodes and can be best described as erratic, but not necessarily in a bad way. There's quite a bit of world building (which never really came to fruition). but there's also a lot of character focus (which was way better).\\n\\n\r\n          The characters were one of the strong points and many of them are fleshed out very well, especially the three main characters who are all likable and have good chemistry. (Also I have to applaud Ryner Lute's English voice actor for an excellent performance- he really brought Ryner to life). However, there are three (or two, your mileage may vary) annoying female characters whose definition of comedy appears to be screaming nonsensical lines nonstop at maximum volume. Please do yourself a favor and cover your ears every time they're onscreen.\\n\\n\r\n          Other than the three idiots pretty much everyone was interesting- especially Miran, the ruthless guy with seemingly ulterior motives and a thirst for blood. He always managed to spice things up with his psychopathic behavior (and he usually just laughs off the mass murder).\\n\\n\r\n          So there you have it; watch the Legend of the Legendary Heroes with zero expectations, and you'll probably emerge happy the way I did. I should warn you that though the series did have a good conclusion it's a bit of a cliffhanger (and there probably won't be a second season). Still, I'd recommend Densetsu to anyone interested in a bit of lighthearted/bloody entertainment with nothing better to do.",

Even though the 1st ep starts in the middle of action and battle , the following episodes explain in quite well how did Ryner and Sion meet in a military school , how they become friends , it shows Sion's past too thus why he wanted to become king in the first place. Sion's process of becoming the king was a a surpriseto me , but anyway he's feet to be one. That explains why Ryner is not executed  instead his friend , the king sends him on a mission with Ferris, the sister of Eris who 'made Sion king'. The plot is quite original and that's why is enjoyable  to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters itself are unique in their way . The main char Ryner a good-for-nothing who sleeps all day long but he's feared as a monster for his powers . I especially love his eyes when he uses his magic >--< , a dango( don't know what kind of food it is)  lover girl who was trained by his brother to become a professional fighter , Sion the type who wants to become the ruler 'coz he wishes for peace but doesn't care what kind of methods does he use, though he has many faces , he's different in front of the nobles, and way different in front of Ryner , where he can be himself without putting on a mask. The comedy moments in the middle of a serous battle , Ferris beating up Ryner and so on make this show  worth watching ,because it gives everything . Action , fantasy,comedy. romance(  those Ferris Ryner moments are so cuteeeee!!).....\\n\\n\r\nSo I would say this is overall a 9.50( I'll give the rest when I finish the anime) .",

Perhaps I found it good because I came in with such low expectations after reading the name, but I can definitely say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Truly, one shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.\r\nI would say that as of the 18 episodes that I personally have watched, the story has been interesting and captivating.  Although some might argue that parts of it are similar to other shows, it seems pretty uniqueand original to me (although I certainly have not watched as much anime as many others).  The main character, Ryner, is fun to relate to, as his extreme laziness and lack of motivation make him somewhat of an antihero.  Other characters each have distinctly interesting personalities, and overall, the voice acting and audio is very good.  The animation quality has been fine throughout the show (in the most recent episode that I have watched, episode 18, the quality slightly decreases, but this is because more attention and detail is given to the action scenes, which, to me, is desirable).  Overall, I would say that this show is a very enjoyable one, and would recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested.",

            "content": "These days we often misuse words in ways that sometimes don't make sense. Take \"epic\" for example, and think about all of the occasions where the term has been applied as a colloquialism that simply means \"I enjoyed it\" , \"it was very good\", or some other sentiment along those lines. It's actually surprising how many people don't know the meaning or usage of the word, but rather than comment on the failure of education systems, let's have a look at how \"epic\" applies to an anime like Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (or The Legend of the Legendary Heroes, whatever floats your boat).\r\nThe originaleleven volume light novel series by Kagami Takaya was published in Dragon Magazine from February 2002 until October 2006 and has spawned a sequel (The Legend of the Great Heroes of Legend), and two spin offs (The Legend of the Legendary Heroes Anyway, and The Legend of the Black Fallen Hero), as well as being adapted as a drama CD, a PSP game, a manga, and the recent anime rendition.\\n\\n\r\nNow aside from mild curiosity at the obvious addiction to using the words \"legend\" and \"hero\" in some manner, one has to wonder if the anime adaptation can really live up to the popularity of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with an attack by the Nelphan army on the person of Ryner Lute, a layabout who is on a mission for his trusted friend, boss, and cause of all of his problems, King Sion Astal of Roland. Accompanying him on his journey is the warrior and perpetual dango addict Ferris Eris, a woman who may be a genius with a sword, but is pretty clueless with almost everything else (except dango). The pair have been tasked with finding and acquiring the legendary artifacts known as the Relics of Heroes, which lie hidden in various places across the continent of Menoris.\\n\\n\r\nAs with any fantasy tale there's an element of derivation inherent in the plot which results in several very familiar scenarios being played out over the course of the series. This in itself isn't a bad thing though, as these staples are often used to drive home a particular point, or as support for the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this anime really does need the support.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issues with Denstsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (DenYuuDen), are the lack of coherency with the story and the constantly changing pace of the plot. Viewers may often find themselves wondering how a particular situation came about, and while there are efforts to tie up certain loose ends, these are nothing more than papering over the cracks. The narrative suffers from a distinct lack of timely explanations, and events can lead the audience on a merry dance as they struggle to keep up with the storyline. This is exacerbated by the constant mood swings that occur from one episode to the next, and the addition of seemingly random comedy scenes give the viewer the sense that even the show itself has no idea what's going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nThe heart of the problem is simply that ZEXCS, like many other studios, have made a screenplay that is nothing more than a \"cut and paste\" rendition of the original source material. While there are some anime that get away with summarily stringing together disparate events, it would have been better for everyone if they at least made the effort to stick to the story. Better yet, ZEXCS could have followed the example set by Satelight when they made Guin Saga, and only adapted a portion of the story to ensure there would be a continuous flow to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOne has to wonder what moment of \"genius\" would persuade director Kawasaki Itsuro and series composer Yoshimura Kiyoko to make such a disjointed narrative.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side the lack of care with the storyline isn't really reflected in the look of the show, and DenYuuDen has some nice, imaginative scenes that really show what ZEXCS are capable of if they put their backs into it. The series features some decent animation, but the design principle impinges on this to a degree, partly because of the bishounen aspect of the show, but mainly because of the costumes. While the various outfits and garments are creative in their own way, there are several scenes where things like cloaks would clearly be a hindrance to any actual combat. In addition to this the characters tend to be on the impassive side when it comes to facial expressions, although this becomes less of an issue as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nDenYuuDen also features some very nice lighting and visual effects that add an extra layer of atmosphere to particular events, giving them an elegant, decadent, or dramatic feel that requires little in the way of added audio. Unfortunately this is offset by a lack of attention with small, specific details which seem like they were pencilled in as afterthoughts (Ryner's two year old beard is one example of this). While it's sometimes easy to overlook these relatively minor flaws, every now and then they become impossible to ignore, and viewers may be left wondering why the studio didn't notice these discrepancies before releasing certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe series features two opening themes, LAMENT Yagate Yorokobi Wo by Yuuki Aira (episodes 1 to 12), and Last Inferno by Ceui (episodes 13 to 24). The first OP is a rather bland affair that is generally well timed and edited, but ultimately fails to inspire. The second track is an altogether different beast that has far better choreography, and possesses a more serious and dramatic air than before. As for the ending themes, Truth Of My Destiny by Ceui and Hikari no Filament by Takagaki Ayahi, neither is anything other than a reasonable pop ballad coupled with pointless visuals that have no bearing on the story proper.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is interesting is the manner in which the background music is utilised. The tracks are often subtle additions that never really come to the fore unless the situation warrants more drama or tension, and because of this there are very few clashes with the dialogue. In addition to this the effects are given precedence over the music during a number of action sequences, and given that this series is a relatively disjointed affair, the quality of the audio choreography is more than a little surprising.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problem areas for DenYuuDen is the dialogue, in particular the tendency towards oratory and the sudden changes between banter and seriousness that are extensions of the inherent issues with the storyline, so it's to the credit of the actors and actresses that they deliver some decent performances. Fukuyama Jun (Ryner Lute), Ono Daisuke (Sion Astal), Takagaki Ayahi (Ferris Eris), and the rest of the cast are able to inject a degree of personality into their characters, but this is limited by some truly cumbersome scripting.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately this, together with the compression of the story, has a knock on effect where the characters are concerned.\\n\\n\r\nLike so many other fantasy anime out there, DenYuuDen follows the tried and tested method of event driven development, but like many other shows it also falls into the trap of poor characterisation. From the beginning of the first episode the viewer is expected to not only identify with Ryner, Ferris and Sion without knowing anything about them, they are also supposed to wait for any explanations because of the disjointed nature of the story. Add to that the fact that much of the growth is dependent on specific events that are scattered throughout the narrative, and the lack of personality comes to the fore.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, while there is little to maintain the viewer's interest in the characters at the start of the show, things do take a turn for the better at the midway stage so that by the end of the series they are no longer cardboard cutouts. The events that drive the development also become a little more complex as the story develops, which is nice to see as the tendency in fantasy anime is to add more detail to the story while keeping these \"signposts\" simple.\\n\\n\r\nNow it may seem like I'm being unfair to DenYuuDen by picking up on so many of its flaws, but there is a reason for this. While there is a lot that could have been done to improve the series as a whole, it's actually a rather enjoyable romp too. The byplay between Ryner, Eris and Sion can be odd because of the poor scripting, but there is humour in there, enough to make the viewer smile at least. In addition to that, there is a concerted effort to improve the story in the second half of the show, with darker themes emerging and more focus on consequences. The action sequences are decent enough, but every so often there is a flash of brilliance, and the characters can sometimes show a surprising depth that really should have been there for most of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the rub. It really, really could have been so much better than it is. There is so much that ZEXCS could have easily done to improve DenYuuDen, and even something as relatively simple as deciding to adapt only a portion of the light novel series would have made a profound difference.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that should be touched on is the mistaken assumption that Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu is somehow an homage to Legend Of The Galactic Heroes due to the similarity in the naming conventions. The problem is that far too many people who have heard of, or watched, the latter anime have automatically decided that DenYuuDen should be just as good when, aside from the name and the fact that heroes, politics and war are involved, the two bear very few similarities. It's a bit like saying apples and apricots should taste the same just because they're both fruits that grow on trees and their names start with \"ap\".\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, leaving that aside, the one thing that really stands out about this anime is that it's effectively an unfinished product, especially as the light novels are still publishing. The disjointed storyline and initially lacklustre characters make this a much more difficult show to invest in, and this is a shame as there are several key plot elements that are interesting enough to warrant much more attention.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, ZEXCS' attempt at adapting the novels has some good points, and while there is enjoyment to be had, it's a far cry from being an epic.",

            "content": "[Edit Part A: This original review was written on the basis of what I have seen up until episode 18 and around that episode the anime had two options 1. stick with the original novel, which has a sequel to it and continue with it or 2. going for an \"anime-only\" ending with 8 episodes to spare (26 episodes).  I would recommend not to read Edit Part B at the end of the original review, unless you want to.]\r\nOkay I admit, the title is a bit... I mean it's really something that can put you off. Add to that, a very very ordinary firstepisode definitely led many to have a thought such as \"Oh! Okay. Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (Legend of the Legendary Heroes). I will watch it later.\" or most likely, 'Meh, it's definitely not my type.\"  And yes, I can tell that with the number of people actually dropping it after first couple of episodes, let alone placed it in their 'on hold/plan to watch' list which is staggering.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, before you even read this review, I would suggest to watch the first three episodes (you can seriously do without the FUNistreams, since it is actually nicely animated) and drop the show if you like, well its more like I dare you would drop it once you've seen episode three. \\n\\n\r\nSo much for an introduction, here goes the real deal:\\n\\n\r\nLegend of the Legendary Heroes is based on a novel of the same title which goes back some 8 years from now (first published in 2002). The anime is almost an exact adaptation of the novel. The novel and its anime adaptation are based on a feudal European setting, just that, blended with Magic and Monsters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for a brief introduction to where the story picks up, Ryner Lute (Fukuyama Jun), a magician of the Empire of Roland goes on a journey to find what they call the 'Hero Relics' scattered all over the continent. He is partnered with Ferris Eris (Takagaki Ayahi), a beautiful, arrogant and insanely skilled swords-woman. Both of them have been dispatched by Sion Astal (Ono Daisuke), the young Hero-King of the Roland Empire. If it wasn't for Sion's slave-running, as what both Ryner and Ferris see him to be, Ryner would have been enjoying countless number of days taking his afternoon naps while Ferris enjoying her share of dango, and only dango in all of her meals. Everyday! \\n\\n\r\nTo give an insight, Hero Relics are assumed to be sources of immense power that can overthrow an entire empire, something Sion desires to have available at his disposal so that he can make his empire a force to be recognized. You can easily understand Ryner and Ferris wouldn't be the only ones on the hunt. As Ryner and Ferris keep searching for the relics, putting his absolute faith on both of them, Sion follows his dream to make an empire where everyone would have a wonderful life. Something that comes with a price indeed; Coup d'\u00e9tat followed by numerous assassination attempts from time to time from power hungry nobles and their followers. I won't say anymore than this. Rest are for you to find out, because it goes far beyond anything as simple as it might seem as you've just read.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is surprisingly good. I always tend to enjoy anime with lots of flashbacks, past happenings which often help a story to grow. Denyuuden, as what it is called in short, really is impressive on that regard. While the first episode is more like an introductory episode that goes to show the main characters involved in the anime, the following couple of episodes show flashbacks from where it all began, why Ryner set for the journey to find the relics, why Ferris has been appointed as his companion, and how, young Sion came to throne. These two episodes (2 and 3) are basically the foundation of the story that will take so many turns here and there as more characters are blended in while making the anime all too enjoyable, that when you will look back, you will be thrilled to realize how simply it all started. The story has unimaginable twists and when you think a character was included just for the sake of it, they will surprise you with the role they are going to play in the development of the whole story. Story wise, this couldn't be any better. And I dare say, I have seen lots of anime already to make such a rather bold statement. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime can be seen as from both the characters' point of views, as well as from the political aspects involved, which makes it a very intelligent anime. For example, the decisions Sion makes as a King often conflict with his philosophy, but he shoulders everything as a King should, refusing to give in to his ideals. At the same time, the conflicting nature of the characters within themselves makes it a very heartfelt anime. Like Ryner, who has been through enough, shows lack of emotion, although he cares for every living thing around him, ironically though, he puts threat on those around him just through his very existence. Ferris, who is always mocking Ryner doesn't falter to hold him dearly when he really needs it the most. And the anime translates a society that is ruled by the so called nobles and their hunger for power, and a society where everyone brands certain people as 'monsters' for the inhuman power they possess, ironically again, something they wish they never have possessed, something they were born with in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nicely depicted. From the absolute loyalty of the subordinates of Sion, for instance General Claugh Klom, to the emotional involvements of the members of the Roland Taboo Hunter team, (yeah, you have to know Milk Callaud (Fujita Saki) and her reverse-harem :P) everything makes sense. Characters making their entrance halfway through the series, for instance, the Hero-King of Gastark, Riphal Edea (Nakai Kazuya), or even the late, very late introduction of Tiia Rumiblue (Sakurai Takahiro) has been intensifying. And there are mysterious characters like Ferris' older brother Lucile (Sugita Tomokazu), Sion's right hand Miran Froaude (Suwabe Junichi) and Milk Callaud's second in command Luke Stokkart (Hino Satoshi) will make you ponder to understand their every move and their motives. You must have been really annoyed by now to see all those seiyuus in the bracket. But the reason behind putting them there is to show the number of popular voice-casts have been working on this anime, justifying the weight of the characters being portrayed overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is really of top notch. The backgrounds are nicely animated and gives you the feel of a feudal European setting coupled with magical terrains and mysterious plains. The actions are simply put, stunning. From the magical circles that Ryner draws before unleashing the commands, to Ferris' sword fights are animated smoothly without any glitch. Like I warned before, watching online streams, or stream-rips will kill half the real enjoyment. The fierce battles, magic circles, blood gores; you really cant enjoy them over low quality streams. This is not an anti-FUNi claim, just a fact which you can clearly confirm if you google the anime's screenshots/screencaptures. I would rather you buy the DVD/Blu-rays when they are out.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, particularly the BGM of the anime is really good. They change and merge so nicely with the mood that it makes the anime vibrant. One of the major contributions of BGMs is to propagate the emotional state of mind of the characters involved and Denyuuden scores a perfect 10/10 in that aspect. I would also like to say that the OP/EDs are really good, and grow into you as you continue the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside of the anime is probably every time it wants to pull a comedy. I would say it failed miserably to make me laugh even once. \\n\\n\r\n[Edit X: the following bits under [Ignore][/Ignore] was a conclusion I came up at episode 18. So they don't carry enough significance for my overall entertainment of the anime up till that point. Of course it changed after episode 24. Regardless, it was a nice watch and I found the anime quite good compared to many other shows that came out in Spring 2010 anime calender.]  \\n\\n\r\n[Ignore]I hope this review helps you to pick an anime that gives you a negative vibe when it actually is one of the real gems out there. I am enjoying this anime like nothing else from the Spring 2010 season and the reason behind writing this review is to make YOU find out what you've been missing out!\\n\\n\r\nAgain a reminder: Please do watch the first three episodes at least before coming to any conclusion. And if you still think its not your plate of dango, I would rather see you finding this review I took my time to write on 'Not Helpful'. [/Ignore]\\n\\n\r\n[Edit Part B: The anime decided to stick with the original novel and follow it until the final episode. Which left the Anime highly open ended and a lot of things to be answered. According to forum reads, twitter feeds and blogs, I have reached to a conclusion that unless there is a significant improvement of the market of DVD/Bluray Disc, which is really poor at the moment, a sequel is highly unlikely. So if you don't intend to read the sequel novel, which is still ongoing, this anime is definitely not for you. Other than that, I would just say that there were bits in the original anime trailer which were never shown in the 24 episodes run of the entire show, leaving a bigger question, why those bits were there in the trailer when they were never in the anime series at all. Of course, I am referring to the bits that directly showed parts that collaborates with where the anime ended and giving a glimmer of hope to a sequel of the anime. You just never know.]",

            "content": "I often think that as long as I know what to expect from a show, it couldn\u2019t disappoint me. First impressions from the title alone gave a sense it was trying too hard to be epic, but that didn\u2019t matter since I expected \u201cLegend of the Legendary Heroes\u201d to be a fun, clich\u00e9d romp. But instead of creating a brainless fantasy flick for dumb people like myself, the show adopts a taste for complexities with writing that leaves a bad taste.\r\nThe story opens with two of the three main characters, the wizard Ryner and the knight Ferris, as they journey across the continent of Menorisin search of powerful Hero Relics to aid our third main character, the High King of Roland, Sion. The lazy Ryner and steadfast Ferris aren\u2019t anything beyond that in the first episode, with the only noticeable interplay between them being a scene where Ferris calls Ryner a pervert. Unfortunately, this scene is a running gag throughout the show that turns the Ryner and Ferris duo from simple to cringeworthy.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the show follows Ryner and Ferris\u2019 adventures, meaning much of that time focuses on their relationship, which is Ferris calling Ryner a pervert for no reason; Ryner doesn\u2019t so much as see a pantyshot from Ferris, so it\u2019s not even clich\u00e9d in the way it should be, but outright unbelievable. Their relationship is 70% one running joke and 30% serious moments with no real progress between them, because they\u2019re only sentimental when the show calls for it. Their relationship goes in a circle, or maybe it\u2019s a see-saw; I don\u2019t care, but neither do the writers.\\n\\n\r\nIn one of the show\u2019s scenes, Ryner is going out of control for plot reasons while Ferris is trying to snap him out of it. After she manages to get through to him, Ryner breaks down and starts crying in her arms as the rain suddenly pours. This scene of clich\u00e9s doesn\u2019t work since there\u2019s a lack of tells on their progress. Ferris blushes maybe once before this while Ryner shows no interest in her at all. And even if this scene did work, they go back into being a weightless comedy duo until the story demands their sentiments again. And this happens more than once.\\n\\n\r\nBut Ryner and Ferris\u2019 relationship is harmless compared to the threads in the rest of the show. Ryner\u2019s lack of personality outside his laziness can be made up for with his background, but the show\u2019s storytelling often jumps back and forth from present day to flashback without any tell it\u2019s done so, making it hard to follow. Even then, most of what little backstory he has is in the later parts of the show. It\u2019s hard to take his tragic past seriously when the show often glosses over it for attempted comedy.\\n\\n\r\nFerris is an even bigger joke than Ryner. When she\u2019s not wrongly calling him a pervert for whatever reason, she\u2019s going on about dango flavors without much else to her character. Somehow, she has even less background than Ryner, and it doesn\u2019t help that this background is little more than skin service that isn\u2019t even charming, but a forced attempt at being dark and edgy. But, it wouldn\u2019t be a forced attempt at being dark and edgy if Ferris was a character worth caring for, if she had real progress and most of her time didn\u2019t focus on failed comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe final main character, Sion, is also a big joke. His character arc is about learning to make tough choices that come with being High King, but his personality doesn\u2019t show it at all. He\u2019s equally serious and easygoing until the end of the show, which makes it easy to wonder whether story events are affecting him at all. Most of his background involves characters that have one or two lines of dialog, which isn\u2019t enough for it to be taken seriously like it\u2019s supposed to. He\u2019s also incomprehensible, saying he doesn\u2019t want to rule like a tyrant one moment, then leaves his assassin servant to take extreme measures so he can reach his goals the next moment.\\n\\n\r\nSorry, I tried jumping over one clich\u00e9 and fell onto another. When the story isn\u2019t being lazy with its characters\u2019 progress or background, it tries TOO hard and ends up being a war and politics philosophy discussion without compelling characters to distract from the fact. These heavy themes require a delicate touch, but unfortunately most of the villains\u2014villains, not antagonists\u2014are wealthy, evil people that take away from any social depth the show tries to have.\\n\\n\r\nNot that what depth the show does have is worth much anyway. There\u2019s a lot more going on in the story, but most of it amounts to nothing or is rushed. One of the characters shows a thirst for vengeance without any build-up leading to that moment. The character he wants revenge on wants revenge on another character. And that final character is dealt with so quickly it disrespects the passion and empathy the first two characters (try to) invoke. If that sounds like a short plot description, then don\u2019t worry, because the show doesn\u2019t give these multiple story threads more than a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBut even with a lot of episodes, one of the characters still proves ineffectual.\\n\r\nWhen this character is introduced, she wants to reunite with Ryner because he was her friend during her rough childhood. It makes sense. What doesn\u2019t make sense is how bubbly she is for most of the show, badly clashing with her background. What\u2019s worse is that this isn\u2019t the set-up to a gag character, because she\u2019s supposed to be taken seriously. But her serious moments don\u2019t work, because she lacks the roundedness needed to make her bubbly and serious side believable as the same character.\\n\\n\r\nThe only decent characters are more like two pairings that are unfortunately not around for long. One of the characters in the first pairing appears at the early and later parts of the show. She meets someone she doesn\u2019t like at first, but in their next scene they\u2019re enjoying a cup of tea, and in the scene following she\u2019s a blushing maiden. The other pairing is a classic warrior and princess story that believably flows from adoration to sweetness; in the first scene they\u2019re smitten at first rescue, in the next scene they\u2019re trying to hide their feelings from their friends to no effect, and then they\u2019re enjoying a moonlight walk.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring the small amount of screentime these four characters have, they\u2019re believable because there\u2019s real progress to their relationships. Sure, it\u2019s cheesy, but it\u2019s at least an attempt at a pairing compared to Ryner and Ferris\u2019 see-saw relationship. It\u2019s not as layered as the other parts of the story, but being more layered doesn\u2019t mean better, but a greater chance to be worse. When there\u2019s more plot to juggle, it only falls down much worse when the juggle isn\u2019t kept up, and the juggle falls the moment it starts.\\n\\n\r\nThis is part of why Legend of the Legendary Heroes\u2019 writing leaves a bad taste, and what I mean when I say the story adopts a taste for complexities. It tries to execute too many threads at the same time and doesn\u2019t give enough time for each thread to be properly weaved. At the same time, the three main characters take up most of the story\u2019s screentime but have almost nothing to show for it. It\u2019s this odd combination of incoherent density and weightless quantity that makes this show such a failure from a storytelling standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nThis leaves only the presentation to save the show, but the visual part of that falls short. Save for Sion, his assassin servant, and the four pairing characters\u2014the last four lack screentime\u2014most of the character designs are multi-colored to the point where it\u2019s hard to tell them apart. For a world with swords and magic, many of the fight scenes are underwhelming for being nothing but beam spam or poor choreography that makes one question if the combatants are only as strong as the plot demands.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the presentation is the music, but music isn\u2019t the aesthetic focus of an action fantasy show. Still, it\u2019s loud when it needs to be, and has a surprising amount of grace during quieter scenes when it uses the art of silence to put focus on the dialog. Unfortunately, the music is held back by its odd habit of using random rock music during some scenes. This modern flare clashes with the medieval, fantasy feel of the show. I suppose it\u2019s trying to be cool, and in a better show it\u2019d be shameless fun, but here it comes across as trying too hard.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is odd, because looking at how the show\u2019s main characters are handled, it\u2019s like they weren\u2019t trying at all. No respect is given to most of the characters and their stories, it tries to tell too many stories, the stories often lack chronological coherence, the social themes lack any depth with its stereotypical villains, and the presentation is best where it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. This show does a few things right and everything else very egregiously wrong.\\n\\n\r\nBut the best thing I can say about this show is what Ryner goes on about from episode 1; take a nap. Sage advice, because taking a tap is preferable to watching Legend of the Legendary Heroes. Sure, you won\u2019t be doing anything, but at least it\u2019s better than getting Alpha Stigma-level angry at the people who made this.",

            "content": "Titles are essential in most forms of entertainment in order to draw attention. Titles, however, can also be misleading. Such was the case for me and the anime series entitled The Legend of the Legendary Heroes. It may be have been just me, but for some reason I did not find the title to be particularly appealing and it certainly did not paint an image that seemed interesting to me\u2014it felt too simple, too exaggerated. Then again, titles can be misleading.\r\nThe Legend of the Legendary Heroes is a fantasy piece\u2014a tale of magic and war in land inspired by Europe during the Middle Ages. Itdeals with Feudal Warfare, more or less. Its focus lies in a number of characters, each taking up a particular role in shaping the world that they reside in. The Roland Empire is the country brought into our attention. At its throne lies the striving Sion Astal, a king of quite a young age, but one that has decided to do everything within his power to change his kingdom for the good. Things are looking better than they have been for a while in Roland, but the greatest battle has yet to take place, for behind the shadows lie assassination attempts to overthrow the king and various conflicts between the neighboring countries.\\n\\n\r\nSion Astal knows that in order to prevail and fulfill his dream of changing the world for good he must find alternative ways of going about the problem. Therefore, he sends his good friend Ryner Lute, whom he made a promise to make the world a better place, and Ferris Eris, a female swordsman stemming to a clan in charge of guarding the king, beyond the borders of Roland and upon a journey to search for ancient relics that are said to have once belonged to a great warrior. These relics may hold the power to single-handedly turn the tides of battle in the bearer\u2019s favour.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the three aforementioned characters, which could be called the most important ones in the series, there are still lots of other ones that receive a notable amount of screen time and are quite vital to the progress of the story, such as Sion Astal\u2019s right-hand man Miran Froaude (a highly interesting character that remains as puzzling in the end as he ever was) or Milk Callaud, the captain of Roland\u2019s taboo-breaker squad who has her own personal reverse harem.\\n\\n\r\nToo many anime series like to paint their characters in black or white, but The Legend of the Legendary Heroes always remains in the gray area with most of its characters. Sure, Ryner Lute is a typical protagonist, yet even he has some pretty dubious past experiences. What\u2019s fascinating is the way we gain a different perspective on certain characters, since some tend to change their alignment (or so it appears, at least) or something about them is revealed that puts them in a completely different light. Flashbacks are no stranger in this anime and they are often used in clever ways, usually giving us more insight about the characters and their principles (or their lack of them), but they also tend to become dull or overused at times (so everyone had a bad childhood\u2014how convenient).\\n\\n\r\nMagic plays an important part in The Legend of the Legendary Heroes. The person most in contact with it is Ryner Lute, who is actually one of Roland\u2019s greatest magicians (not many know this since he prefers afternoon naps over battles) and an Alpha Stigma bearer, meaning his eyes can detect forms of magic, but he is cursed as much as he is blessed, for those possessing the Alpha Stigma tend to go out of control and destroy everything in their path if things get too intense. There\u2019s certainly some sword fighting to be had throughout the series (especially from Ferris\u2019 part), but most battles are fought using magic. Thankfully, the fight scenes are very well-done and they\u2019re always highly entertaining and easy to decipher (no weird camera angles or hurried editing here, don\u2019t worry).\\n\\n\r\nOne of this anime\u2019s most impressive aspects is the story. It may not be innovative or original, but it\u2019s executed in a spectacular manner, often exploring different themes or following several plot paths all at once. The main storyline never feels neglected, but somehow the series always finds time to develop other things at the same time and offer each of its characters satisfactory screen time. The episodes work great because their filled with a lot of variety, often featuring fashbacks and focusing on several plot points. The Legend of the Legendary Heroes gets a lot done in twenty minutes\u2019 time, always remaining entertaining yet never feeling rushed or overloaded.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is truly excellent, often eye-popping, but it does exhibit some problems. For one, some of the characters\u2019 facial expressions could have been drawn better, especially when it came to scenes depicting comedy. My other gripe is with an episode about halfway through the series which uses a different art style from the rest of the episodes. The reason why the anime changed styles was because the episode was more action-packed than the usual ones, but that still doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that that certain episode felt too unfamiliar to work in balance with the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most important drawback of this anime is its conclusion, or rather the lack thereof. While the series does not end with a cliff-hanger, it does leave most things open for a supposed sequel. However, a sequel coming out or not completely depends on how well this anime does on a financial level (it hasn\u2019t been doing very well up to this point from what I\u2019ve heard). So before deciding whether to give The Legend of the Legendary Heroes a watch or not, you might want to take into consideration the fact that things may never be resolved if no sequel is produced (of course, we\u2019ll always have the light novels to ease that pain).\\n\\n\r\nDespite such flaws, The Legend of the Legendary Heroes remains an excellent fantasy anime series. The story is very well done, the characters are thoroughly interesting and adopt shades of gray instead of black and white and every episode is as enjoyable as the previous one. Don\u2019t let its corny title be the deciding factor when it comes to considering whether The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is worth your time.",

            "content": "The unique (and corny) name is what got my interest in this anime. I read the description looking forward to a great plot that contained fantasy and adventure, but it ended up with trite comedy, disappointment and magic tricks.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nGeneral Scenario:\r\nThe beginning (first two episodes) was dare I say, terrible? It's most likely to turn viewers off leaving them to think \"I'll pass\". It jumps around, confusing the viewer instead of being intriguing. The story contains Ryner Lute being a lazy student and Ryner as well as Ferris searching for relics. It's much more than that but unfortunately it doesn't evolve everything it introduces. Forexample: What happened to the people of the land that was conquered by Roland? There was not a significant follow up. How about God's Eye group (the group of kids who were outcast because of Alpha Stigma)? You would think Ryner would be concerned about them. They should have used less of their time on Ferris love for Dango and more on the plot. It was like they were trying to cram a whole plot into 24 episodes, when in order to develop the plot into a masterpiece for what they were trying to present, it needed more time than that. A concept does not guarantee an excellent finished product.\\n\\n\r\nForm of Development/Pace:\\n\r\nThe pace was moderate for each individual episode, but overall I would say it's fast even though it doesn't seem that way. Since it tries to cram a lot of information in 24 episodes, a lot of development is left out of the loop.\\n\\n\r\nSides stories/ Extra space:\\n\r\nThere are no fillers however there is one recap episode.\\n\\n\r\nBelievable?\\n\r\nIt's believable it's just poorly done to where people connect with the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe Conclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThe Legend of the Legendary Hereos' conclusion was a big disappointment, reminding me of the ending of the atrocity known as Pandora Hearts /\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30cf\u30fc\u30c4,/ Pandora H\u0101tsu (I haven't done a review on that but I should. I'm already expecting hate mail for that review). It ended with a test of friendship (23rd episode) and bringing back people that the anime left behind but not to contribute to the plot it was more like \"hey, these people you forgot about they are still alive\" kind of feel (24th episode). It also left the viewer to ask what in the hell was the story about? Was it about finding relics, a legend of legendary heroes or was it attempting to be about the struggle of existing as an outcast (Ryner) and the burden of wearing a mask (Sion and Ferris, when it came to her issues and how she acted them out on Ryner)? Conclusion are supposed to bring the plot together and make the viewer at peace because of everything made sense it's not supposed to leave you hanging with a lot of questions unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nWhat kept my interest:\\n\\n\r\nWhat kept my interest as the viewer is wondering how will the characters overcome their struggles. Sion with the pressure of trying to produce a \"perfect world\", a more harmonious world. Ryner finding true happiness leaving the mental despair of the Alpha Stigma behind and Ferris with her mental trauma, how will she overcome her fear of abandonment by those who loves her and her truly learning how to display love. (Instead of putting up walls and beating Ryner up and jokingly at his character for comic relief would she ever come to a place where she is truly vulnerable.)\\n\\n\r\nExplanation of rating:\\n\\n\r\nAt most I would rate this story 6 out of 10. 6, meaning fine. It had the potential to be great but failed but at the same time it'll keep your interest anyways. Critically I would rate it a 4 (4 meaning bad), instead of the comic relief it could have used that time for plot. Black Butler /\u9ed2\u57f7\u4e8b/ Kuroshitsuji is an example of funny moments but the plot is more essential and the comedy does not attempt to make up for lack of plot. However I did wonder how it would all pan out so at most I would give it a 6 for fine because some might love the hell out of it despite it's flaws while others looking at it critically would recognize what a big disappointment it is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is splendid. It would have been better if had a great plot to flow with. I love the color schemes and the details and colors of the character costumes. Ferris costume is a treat with her purple and pink costume. This anime contained nice reflections and magic effects esp. the glow of the Alpha Stigma eyes, beautiful sunsets and detailed and fitting backgrounds. There isn't much to complain about the artwork. I don't remember one episode where I felt that the art team was slacking off on their job so with that I would give the artwork 8 out of 10. 8 meaning very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning theme and (especially) end theme compliments the series. The end theme were the better out of the two but nothing outstanding that makes me wanna rate higher. I like themes that encourage me to learn the lyrics not fast forward or skip if I have a chance. The background music was good though, it complimented the artwork and theme of the story. There were no annoying voices so that was a plus. So I would give it an 7 out of 10, 7 meaning good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI would rate the character 6 out of 10, 6 meaning fine. The main characters Ryner, Ferris and Sion have issues that one can relate or sympathize with. That what makes them appealing to the story. Ryner have been rejected by society and still consider those who reject him well being. He often struggles with the will to go on in a world that hates him. Ferris has her trauma from her parents and she acts that out on Ryner with joking about his behavior being lewd and perverted while physically hitting him. Sion abandoned by one parent while the other one died, rose to power . He carries the burden of the world on his shoulders by trying to do the right thing. If the story was right it would have been beautiful to see how Sion finds balance in ruling a kingdom and being happy, Ryner would have overcome his struggle and Ferris would have faced her trauma and how it has affected her behavior towards a person she obviously cared about... Ryner. None of that happened instead the potential for great characters who could overcome were left how they were found in the ending. No significant progression at all.\\n\\n\r\nWith the side characters, they were introduced but some of them weren't effectively utilized to be a benefit to the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEpisode by episode I enjoyed the anime after the beginning the first two episodes in particular. However on an all overall scheme I'm disappointed esp. with the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt averages out to a 6.8, most of that would be due towards the non-plot reviews so that should be taken into consideration. I'm putting down to 6 so it wouldn't give any false hope. This might be an anime where the viewer has to watch again to catch little details to be satisfied with the plot but that shouldn't be necessary and wouldn't be necessary if it was written well.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend to someone else? I don't think I would. If you are fond of the animation for cosplay reasons and can handle the first two episodes then buy all means go for it but don't say I didn't warn you.\\n\\n\r\nFinal notes:\\n\r\nEven though I heavily criticized this anime I liked it and enjoyed it despite it's flaws. :-)",

            "content": "'Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (Legend of the Legendary Heroes)' is a medieval fantasy adventure about Ryner Lute, a social outcast born with powerful magic eyes, and his friend the new king Sion Astral's quest to end all wars.\r\nStory/Character:\r\nIt's impossible to watch this show without being reminded of similar themed series. For example, the magical medieval setting of 'Scrapped Princess', art style of 'Koukaku no Regios', magic eyes of 'Code Geass', and knighthood and characters of 'Fate/stay night\". However, this show had the mother of all premises by blending all the best qualities from such series with an interesting mission of collecting \"Hero's Relics\".\r\nWith sucha cool mix of setting, characters, and items, we could've expected a captivating epic adventure. What we actually got was a rather dull, huge mess of a story.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the show had an awful story flow. A classic case of poor anime adaptation of a novel where the story jumps from one place to another. One minute, you're watching Ryner and Ferris trying to find Hero's Relics. Next minute, you're back in kingdom where Sion is working. Then jump back 5 (?) years before returning to a new adversary we've never seen before. Unlike novels, this effect on anime makes it nearly impossible to empathize with characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe character motivation is always questionable. All the kings are fighting for the same dumb reason: \"Slaughter all my neighbors to stop war\". This is 2010... there are already so many anime and movies about such contradicting and clich\u00e9 themes. There were also a lot of scenes where characters are obviously capable of accomplishing a better result, yet simply give up or their spells are nerfed just to achieve the desired plot development. For example, the destruction of bridge by Kiefer in the final episode when she could've clearly crossed first before destroying it. Such inconsistencies are usually unnoticeable in novels, but with visual support in anime, it just doesn't make any sense.\\n\\n\r\nThere also was a deliberate power balancing and DBZ-like increment of average strengths. For example, Ryner and Ferris have not been able to obtain a single Hero's Relic, while far weaker antagonists manage to obtain and use them as their primary means of attack. In addition, somehow the victors don't seem to be interested in collecting the loser's Relic after defeating them. The story is very much driven by sudden appearance of new adversaries. One minute, a character seems to be invincibly strong, then a new foe appears, and previous antagonist doesn't even stand a chance. The prime examples are Sui Orla, Miran Frouade, and Tiia Rumiblue. On the other hand, our hero and heroine seem to be able to put up a decent fight no matter how strong or weak the opponent is (they even struggle against minions).\\n\\n\r\nThere were way too many characters for 24 episodes. Not only that, most of them had very limited role and weak presence. I just browsed through the character list, and didn't even remember half of them. That's how bad the side characters were. And then we have the hero and the heroine, who were just lazy Lelouch Lamperouge ('Code Geass') and outgoing Saber ('Fate/stay night). Despite Ryner having Alpha Stigma, he only casted about 4 different spells, 80% of which being \"Lightning\".\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was funny at first, but it got tedious through uncreative repetition of dango and sleep. A lot of action scenes, but not very exciting unless Alpha Stigma is fully activated. The story tries to be dark in the second half, but it just seemed out of place due to light first half, and didn't make sense. Overall, very boring, corny story and character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAmazing, considering a large portion of animation work was subcontracted to Korean studios.\\n\r\nCharacters are usually very detailed, and every character is easily distinguishable. While the background is not as detailed as it could be, the change in mood through lighting worked well.\\n\r\nSFX was wonderful in action scenes and with magic circle or spells.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the presentation (camera angles, cuts, art style, action choreography etc) were rather dull, and seemed lazy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLoads of established seiyuu even in minor roles. Some annoying, but on annoying characters to begin with, so it was somewhat tolerable. Everyone sound like they should, especially Ferris' voice was great.\\n\r\nWhile Ryner played by Fukuyama Jun was excellent, I can't help but notice how his voice was exactly same as Lelouch in 'Code Geass' series. The two characters are already similar as it is (both having magic eyes), having the same seiyuu completely cemented Ryner as a cheap copy. The evil/mad laugh really was godly though, the best I've ever heard.\\n\r\nBGM in battle and emotional scenes were well done and dramatic. The rest are rather ordinary and forgettable, but didn't sound out of place.\\n\r\nAll four OP/ED in the series were pretty catchy and suit the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis series was by far the most disappointing series of the season (ending Fall). By episode 3, this series had such a strong introduction that it could've easily been an fascinating fantasy series, but it seemed to deteriorate by the episode from there, eventually leading to an inconclusive ending where nothing is explained and half the deliberate plot devices unused.\\n\\n\r\nFrom boring story, character, to lazy animation and voice acting casting choice, what this series suffered through was a widespread absence of creativity. Zexcs once again proves their incompetence, and this show did not live up to its title as the 'Legend of the Legendary Heroes'. It was an epic failure.\\n",

            "content": "The synopsis for this anime really does it no justice, there is much more going on then them just searching for relics. Honestly, the relic searching did not really last all that long. One thing that stood out to me in this anime is it was actually very funny, there should have been a comedy genre added, however, comedy was not the only thing that caught my attention. \r\n The premise of the story could seem a bit cliche, there are quite a few other anime where the main has an incredible power and has to overcome the effects of a past that heldmany hardships due to this power, but nonetheless this anime was still pretty great. It was enjoyable to see the hardships that Ryner had endured throughout his life and how he was able to overcome them. Also, they put quite a bit of back story on the other characters, such as Sion and Ferris, which was nice to see. That backstory adds a better connection to the characters as they face the conflicts together. Now onto my specific review points.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nAs I stated above, it does seem at first glance to be a cliche of sorts, but the synopsis is quite under-developed. There is more than just them searching for relics, much of it is based on the power that Ryner has and the hardships that came and are to come from it. Also, the comical parts in this story were quite enjoyable as well, whether it be the constant whining or witty remarks of Ryner about his naps, or Ferris' constant belittling of Ryner with her large imagination of perversion.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was not anything spectacular, although it was well done and they did not use many shortcuts. They had a good amount of detail as well. The gore scenes usually had some sort of shade above them not making them easy to see, but it was still good drawn overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound was ok. Nothing really struck me as really bad, or really good, it matched fine, but it did lack in some respects. The English voice acting was pretty good, the main characters seemed to match well with the voice actors. I have no speculation on the Japanese voice actors, as I have not watched the subbed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nI liked the fact they gave lots of back-ground information on the other main characters and didn't just focus of Ryner. The flash backs and the information on Ryner was very tragic and gave a lot of meaning to the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nThe story was great. I loved the way the characters were portayed, being that Ryner is a lazy guy that has witty remarks, and Ferris having the very funny imagination. The comedy in this anime was very funny, even though there was not a comedy tag. Also, being that Ryner was so powerful, it was cool to see how he progressed with his power, and how he gave it meaning.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. There were many aspects I did not plan to see, such as the comedy, and the small amount of romance. Many people may see it as cliche and boring, but the synopsis really does it no justice. So give this anime a try, and maybe you too, will find it to be a great watch.",

            "content": "Densetsu no yuusha no Densetsu(The legend of the legendary heroes) seems to be very good at leaving bad first impressions. I mean, just by looking at the name, generic character designs, boring looking synopsis and a badly done first episode, it is very easy to dismiss the series as an uninteresting fantasy based around the same old beaten-to-the-death ideas. But here's the thing, although the name suggests otherwise, deep down Denyuden is a charming series which knows how to take itself seriously.\r\nBased on a novel series which was published in 2002, Denyuden is a story of Ryner Lute, a lazy guy who wants nothing morethan to sleep for ten thousand years, and his relationship with his best friend, Sion Astal, an idealist king who finds himself facing the harsh reality of the world. The story follows Ryner as he tries to deal with the world who sees him just as a monster, and Sion, who finds himself getting further and further away from the dream of creating an ideal country without any sadness. I have to say, Denyuden walks a very dangerous line as it tries to mix humor with themes like drama and betrayal, but it manages very well and I just loved the way the mood suddenly changes from silly comedy to deadly politics in this show. Not only that, there are many other elements like saving the world, sad childhood, betrayal, young leaders etc which can easily go wrong and destroy the show, but they are used well and only contribute in making the show more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe staff behind Denyuden is pretty unimpressive, but I have to admit, they did a very good job on this series. The series doesn\u2019t try to be too ambitious, and slowly builds up its characters and fleshes out its setting. The first half of the series, pretty much does nothing more than introducing characters and giving them a clear role. Many of the subplots are just there for the character introduction. The second half of the series uses all that building up efficiently and things suddenly pick up pace and that\u2019s where the show really starts shining. The characters starts developing in the way you want them to, the story starts becoming very interesting and series throws away most of its humor and finally gives you the awesomeness its first arc promised. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story of Denyuden is not the series\u2019 best part, it is still impressive. There are many interesting elements in the plot(Alpha stigma, Hero relics) and as the plot moves further, the questions just keep on increasing. The series also does a very good job on answering the questions yet not answering them. Many answers are followed by even more questions. Also there are many hidden answers in the series itself. The downside to this is that it may leave a few confusing parts but that can be solved by re-watching the series after you have finished it. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the series may not be too special itself, but the way it is used, getting fleshed out by its politics, makes it very interesting. I love the way the characters are influenced by the world they live in. There are many myths and legends in the world of Denyuden and the way they effect the main plot also proves very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the best part of the series, the characters. Yes, the characters of this series are just awesome. Whether it\u2019s the main characters or the side characters, all of them have distinct personalities and are really fun to watch. I just love the main characters. They are just fleshed out really well. I especially liked how Ferris, who at one time was really annoying, turns enjoyable in the end. Same goes for the side characters. Even the annoying ones like Milk. They all turn charming later in the series. I also like how there are many flashbacks in the story. Normally too many flashbacks are boring for me, but here they tell that the characters don\u2019t forget what happens and try to develop themselves. This is true for especially Ryner. He was good at the beginning of the series, but he really developed in the series and by the end, he turns into a really fantastic character.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes of this series are okay, but I really love the voice acting here. It really brings life to the characters. And the use of BGM is pretty good too. The art isn\u2019t too bad but nothing awesome either. I really liked the animation of the last arc, but apart from that it\u2019s nothing that stands out. \\n\\n\r\nWell, to sum up and add some stats to the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10): Impressive and keeps you interested till the end\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): Impressive voice acting and use of music\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8/10): Nothing special here although I liked the work they did on the last arc\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): Really awesome characters. Loved everyone of them\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10): I loved Denyuden and it\u2019s certainly one of my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nI would also like to add that if you are wondering whether to watch the show or not, just give the show a chance and watch the first arc(first 4 episodes) and then decide whether to continue or not.\\n",

            "content": "Enter a world of magic & sword fights, corrupt nobles & warring kingdoms.\r\nMeet Sion Astal: his father was a noble and his mother a \"commoner.\" After a twist of fate he ends up taking over the throne and is determined to change the Kingdom of Roland for the better.\r\nIt sounds very cliche at this point and all (and there's no reason why one wouldn't think that) but don't let that turn you off.\r\nThe anime keeps it happy and fun be following the journey of Ryner Lute and Ferris Eris whom -under Sion's orders- are on a \"secret mission\" to seek out the Legendary Hero relicsin the name of \"world peace\"! Or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it might sound cliche but the fact that Ryner and Ferris were forced to work together and each have their personal quirks make all of their interactions so amusing to watch. \\n\\n\r\n(For example: Ryner -the real main character of the show- is the laziest guy ever and always prefers to take naps over doing anything. Ferris is a beautiful \"assassin\" who's quick to resorting to violence [[at least towards Ryner]] easily twists and misinterprets situations in weird ways and [arguably] is only devoted to dangos [A kind of dessert/snack made up of several sweet sticky mochi-like balls that are \"shish-kabobbed\" on long thin sticks]\\n\r\nThrow in a few more characters with equally weird quirks/moments and magic & mystery behind the Legendary relics and you've got potential for a amusing and fun series! \\n\\n\r\nHowever it's not all fun and games as something dark & mysterious is also hidden beneath the plot....\\n\\n\r\nI recommend checking out this anime to anyone who's interested at all in anime with this type of setting/backdrop and those who like a good mix of action and comedy but also don't mind dark twists/drama, etc.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\r\nMy personal ratings and few other random comments:\\n\r\n((This part down here has now been changed to reflect my impressions up to episode 18)) \\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\n** The political side (aka Sion's side) of the plot can be rather confusing & unclear sometimes if you're not paying attention especially towards the beginning but if you get the general gist it's enough to understand everything else.\\n\r\nThe other parts of the story are somewhat slow-paced and the episodes are constantly littered with cliffhanger endings but when it's all pieced together it's an epic story filled with a good balance of comedy and twists and those touching moments that make you feel sad for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\n**Colors are generally \"soft and smooth\" and not \"stressful\" to the eye. It also tends to use \"bright colors\" more than other color tones....though that's not to say the show doesn't know how to use dramatic lighting ---It's done well enough for those key dramatic moments, etc. A pretty standard yet fitting art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\n**It's never bothered me so it's not bad to say the least. I think it's more or less fit in nicely with the moods of various parts as well (otherwise It would have bothered me) By the way, OP and ED songs are pretty good/catchy unlike other series I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\n**Character backgrounds are only expanded on when the episode/plot pacing finds it necessary. This can lead to a good mix of well-timed character introductions vs the not so well-timed ones. At least the main 3 (Sion, Ryner, and Ferris) do not suffer from a lack of enough character development. Overall I'd say the major characters have been expanded well like they deserve while most minor characters (and sadly- a few major characters) have yet to have a purpose established\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\n**Outside of the Sion moments (Yes I'm sorry Sion...I find you mostly boring) The other parts are either action packed or full of amusing conversations/situations that even something as mundane as walking through a town or forest can turn into something amusing. I really enjoy watching every episode and always can't wait for the next to air. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nAs of what I've seen so far, I give an overall score of 8...but that may change later on...",

I'm sure no one would call out the translators if it was just shortened to Legendary Heroes. \r\nSo a couple years ago I got the entire series for FREE on itunes. Thats right folks it didn't even cost me a dime. Like any anime fan I downloaded it without a second thought, I didn't even look at the summary. But after 15 minutes of the first episode I turned off my computer and walked away, never turning back to see the rest ofthe series.  Lesson learned from this - there was a reason why this series was for free.\\n\r\nBut lo and behold! Years later I find it on Netflix. It's like this series haunts me!! This time I watched the whole thing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\n It's plain! it's like a cardboard cutout of the definition of anime. It didn't stand out to me at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nwhile the music wasn't bad it wasn't amazing either. It was just there.\\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nNow imagine Berserk and attack on titan had a child. That unholy offspring would be this. Now if done correctly itd be an amazing anime, but the writing had no structure.\\n\r\nThe begining was bad. Didn't hold my attention at all.\\n\r\nAlthough once the story started explaining itself and I became attatched to the characters and knew their background. Then that's when this anime truly got me interested. \\n\r\nBut the ending is where it all fell apart. That excitement it built shattered instantly. This anime expained nothing. When I thought it was going explain something it'd turn around and leave me with even more questions than before. How did Sion ever become king? What did Sion do the 2 or so years Ryner was in prison? What is going on the entire last episode?! Seriously someone explain that last episode to me!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nhonestly 75% of the characters were useless and could have been cut from the show entirely and it wouldn't have effected this anime one bit. \\n\\n\r\nI dont understand how some people are giving this 10/10 rating. Was it a masterpiece? Absolutely not. But it did have some redeming qualities. For a while there I would have given this anime an honest 8/10. But after the last 4 episodes that 8 dropped so far it became a 5. By the end of it all I felt like I wasted my time and unfortunately there is no way I'll ever get back the hours I wasted on this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a better  fantasy/action anime I point you to Berserk. (Or anything really. Just don't watch legend of the legendary heroes)\\n",

            "content": "This anime is a case study in how to spend 24 episodes telling a grand-scope story only to get nowhere in the end. Is it worth spending all that time only to have no finale? No. Absolutely not. There are some stories worth experiencing just for the ride itself, but there are others where every single passage builds to a grand showdown/big reveal/epic sacrifice/whatever only to completely abandon that idea in favor of sequel baiting; here, there is no sequel and won't ever be one, so the entire anime is a pointless endeavor from the outset.\r\nI'm entirely serious when I say that all 24 episodes(to the very last moment) work tirelessly to construct a foundation of mammoth proportions. There are so many side plots and interesting characters built up but 100% of them are unresolved in the end--and it also doesn't help that Densetsu's primary worldbuilding technique is an over-reliance on flashback sequences. In my estimation 15% of this show is flashbacks, and while I generally loathe that technique it wasn't so bad and I could have looked past it. Unfortunately none of it amounts to anything.\\n\\n\r\nThere are early hints of brilliance with Ryner's colossal power level, but besides a titillating peek it never shows itself again. The entire last half I was anticipating it being unleashed but it never came--just like everything else. It's like a neverending game of \"no honey, it's YOUR turn to enjoy yourself\" where no one gets off and everyone just goes to sleep out of frustration. \\n\\n\r\nI've come out of pointless series with good impressions before because, as I said earlier, some journeys are worth experiencing. What differs here is that absolutely everything contributes to setting the snowball rolling downhill. All the little plot developments, character quirks, funny asides, and long philosophical diatribes build and build and build only for the sun to come out and melt the snow before the bottom. So, what do you get for 24 episodes? A decent magic system, snappy animations with impressive backdrops, a large cast of likeable characters where everyone has good motives, a musical score that's largely serviceable with flashes of brilliance, and a surprising amount of lighthearted scenarios (episode 23 in particular was extremely good in this regard). What you don't get is even a hint of closure, every single narrative thread still open, and an overwhelming sense of \"what the fuck was the point?\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat an overwhelming disappointment. This should have been amazing.",

            "content": "The End\nIn this world there are many legends. The legend of Zelda, the legend of Excalibur, the legend of leisure suit Larry. Likewise it also isn\u2019t usual for many Legends to carry hero in their titles; Legend of Condor heroes and the legend of Galactic heroes are two good examples of this particular trend. However, this series I\u2019m about to review (in my now trademarked half-assed style) does what very few series before have dared to do. It gives itself a name so damn awesome you\u2019ll cream yourself every time you think about it. Welcome to Legend of the Legendary Heroes (DenYuDen!).\nCharacters\nWith a name asawesome as this, the story has to be good. I'm guessing probably full of action, epic battles, great characters and manri men. Well, if you (like me) thought that was the case you couldn't be anymore wrong. Try dumplings, tsundere, more dumplings and assassination attempts that clearly aren't Ezio based(ubisoft, western?... ok ok tenchu based then) . The plot is exactly as written in the title; the primary (and often randomly exploited) story is about a search for legendary hero artifacts from a past age, called legendary hero relics(very original). You might want to bring a map for this one as you'll have almost no clue where this story is headed. One episode they'll be searching for the hero relics(and failing) and the next episode Ryner and Ferris will be wasting minutes discussing dumplings in a very bakemonogatari like banter. There's literally little to no consistency in this shows tone. Which really wouldn't be so bad if that was what they were aiming for. However, that is definitely not the case as you'll see that shortly after these episodes about dumplings, going on a date and various other things(that belong on a slice of life show and not a show with the name legend) we are given massacres, wars and tales of hidden corruption. As a result this show has no flow, no sense of direction. Now I'm well aware that this was originally a light novel and perhaps this style of narration worked best for that format. But for an anime? Many times I found myself confused at to what was going on. This especially worsened towards the end. Where I assume the producers/studio found out that they had blown their budget and poorly managed the episodes and now suddenly had to fit 100 plot devices into the last 2-3 episodes. Seriously, I don't even know if what happened at the end could even be called a cliffhanger. It all just felt very anti-climatic and rushed. Cliffhangers are supposed to build the tension for a possible(or in this case improbable) continuation. All this ending did was build more confusion. There are so many questions left unanswered at the end. Who is Ferris' brother? Why is Gastark so desperately after the relics? What is the point to all this Lonesome Devil Dark Hero business ? I fear at the rate they're going even if they did continue this series it would take at least another 2 seasons before any of these questions get answered. And we'll all be left no doubt with a feeling that it was 2 seasons 2 many(ahahah...no?). Be that as it may the story does captivate it's audience and if you get past the slow beginning you'll definitely find something moderately interesting. For that reason alone it gets a 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\nStory\\n\\n\nThe characters. Ah what would a show be without its characters(what would a daimyo review be without random questions and comments)? First and foremost we have Grif...Sion Astal as this shows black knight.  He starts off with good intentions(conquering the world), a coup and later down the road begins to ask himself where all of this went wrong. It isn't Sion's fault though, Sion's mom was a commoner and his father was a noble so it completely makes sense to us the viewers when we see things like Sion being split into two personalities. His first personality and the personality that defines his character as whole (as it sets the tone for yaoi fanfiction writers across the globe) is the typical shojo male.  Flamboyant and visually effeminate it is the face he usually shows when talking to Ryner(suspicious). It is also the one usually displayed during this show's ending credits. His 2nd personality however is what I would describe as the serious fucking business look. Anything can happen when he displays this look ranging from: wars, noble executions and various attempts to kill his best friend. The reason for all these things? I suppose you could explain the first two kingly business and all that but the last one is up for grabs. Is Sion a crazy sadistic mofo(awesome)? Or is he just jealous that Ryner loves Ferris and not him? Who knows, who cares he's the villain and that's as much as the series wants us to believe. Who needs a motive? Evil is evil guys. Next up we have Ryner what I guess you could call this shows primary protagonist. What you need to know about Ryner is that in Japan people that don't work and want to sleep all day are cool dudes(shikimaru, etc). Where just about everywhere else they're jackasses (or daimyos). The main difference however, between a Ryner and a Daimyo is a Ryner has no reason to be lazying about all day. Ryner has atleast 3 women who would come(pun) to his every whim and call. The fact that he has what could potentially become a harem makes Ryner anime 2.0 approved. His first bi... love interest is this chick by the name of Kiefer (ran out of good names). Not much needs to be said about her and so I won't say anything else. But please do feel free to imagine and ad lib whatever this loquacious Daimyo might say.  His 2nd and by far more tsundere love interest is Ferris (Ferris? Ferris? Ferris Bueller?). Just as you might imagine she loves hitting our main character and subsequently wasting our time pretending not to like him. Many an episode died as these two tried to conceive what would only be described as a bastard plot. Don't get me wrong though I'd love to bone her, but would I marry her? No. My life is what could only be described as an action anime full of suspense, violence, explosions and tissues(don't ask). Having her involved would change my life into some sort of mediocre slice of life. And that is exactly what Ferris does to Legend of the Legendary heroes. Her interactions with Ryner while they may seem interesting to some just remove quality from the show. Finally for the last love interest, we must ask ourselves this question. What does a show need to be greenlight for production these days? Random dialogue check, tsundere check, moe check, bishounen males check. Seems like everything doesn't it. But in the words of the eternal captain Konata of the USS Fap-J \"Make it loli\". Now you'll have to excuse me for not knowing this last ones name off the top of my head so I will just call her Orange Juice. In fact it is my opinion she was just added to ensure that this show maintained anime 2.0 standards. Without Orange Juice, Ryner is just in a love triangle( easily solved when studying rumbling hearts). With her, Ryner has a certified harem. The fact that Orange Juice is also a loli guarantees sales. Now we have other characters and once again simply out of lazyness I won't comment on them. Don't worry you really aren't missing out on anything all we have left is shotas, hentai sized women(mmm), more bishounen and very poorly written blood knights. Once again proving that if you can't write a story with a few characters adding a bunch of them won't make it any better (though it does make my rants longer). 6/10\\n\\n\\n\nOverall\\n\\n\nGoing by the trend in my scores a 7 in the story and a 6 in characters can only be the sign of worse things to come. Normally you would be right but believe it or not I rather enjoyed this series. Now some of you may think I've gone AWOL but it really isn't that bad(it isn't that good either). The most entertaining stories I found usually had to with Sion's story of conquest. I found that the darker elements helped to combat the uneventful I love Lucy type plots. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\nEntertainment\\n\\n\nDespite all it's flaws though, unlike another show I rated and review similar to this, Legend of the Legendary Heroes almost never comes off as pretentious. It doesn't try to fool the viewers into believing its made a masterpiece of a show. Neither does liking this show require one to kiss the feet of Kagami Takaya, the shows creator. For those reasons alone I am truly grateful. At the end of the day it's up to you (or your favourite reviewer) to decide whether or not you will like this show more than let's a stardriver or an index. But with so many shows attempting to blend different genres into one mass produced food tablet you'll find that no matter what you decide to watch this or next season everything will seem oh so similar. DenyuDen just did it in a way that wasn't dreadfully painful to watch. 7/10",

            "content": "Also known as Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu, an anime with a silly name if ever there was one. Now where to begin with this one? Densetsu starts off pretty straightforward- a magical fantasy with sword fights, a quest for powerful items, blah dee blah blah, been there, done that. Nothing new. However, I have to admit that my expectations were soon blown out of the water when the show escalated into something much darker and much more ambitious than what it first seemed. To anybody who starts off the series all I can sayis watch until episode three before you decide whether to watch it or not.\\n\\n\r\n          There's quite a bit of mood-swinging involved where one moment you'll be laughing at the lighthearted talk and the next you'll be watching a bloodbath. The series has its high and low points in its 26 episodes and can be best described as erratic, but not necessarily in a bad way. There's quite a bit of world building (which never really came to fruition). but there's also a lot of character focus (which was way better).\\n\\n\r\n          The characters were one of the strong points and many of them are fleshed out very well, especially the three main characters who are all likable and have good chemistry. (Also I have to applaud Ryner Lute's English voice actor for an excellent performance- he really brought Ryner to life). However, there are three (or two, your mileage may vary) annoying female characters whose definition of comedy appears to be screaming nonsensical lines nonstop at maximum volume. Please do yourself a favor and cover your ears every time they're onscreen.\\n\\n\r\n          Other than the three idiots pretty much everyone was interesting- especially Miran, the ruthless guy with seemingly ulterior motives and a thirst for blood. He always managed to spice things up with his psychopathic behavior (and he usually just laughs off the mass murder).\\n\\n\r\n          So there you have it; watch the Legend of the Legendary Heroes with zero expectations, and you'll probably emerge happy the way I did. I should warn you that though the series did have a good conclusion it's a bit of a cliffhanger (and there probably won't be a second season). Still, I'd recommend Densetsu to anyone interested in a bit of lighthearted/bloody entertainment with nothing better to do.",

            "content": "Note: I'm reviewing this anime according to my liking and personal tastes , thus is subjective >-< Don't blame me for it.\r\nThe story is set in a world with kingdoms and kings , maybe this is why I started watching this . Even though the 1st ep starts in the middle of action and battle , the following episodes explain in quite well how did Ryner and Sion meet in a military school , how they become friends , it shows Sion's past too thus why he wanted to become king in the first place. Sion's process of becoming the king was a a surpriseto me , but anyway he's feet to be one. That explains why Ryner is not executed  instead his friend , the king sends him on a mission with Ferris, the sister of Eris who 'made Sion king'. The plot is quite original and that's why is enjoyable  to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters itself are unique in their way . The main char Ryner a good-for-nothing who sleeps all day long but he's feared as a monster for his powers . I especially love his eyes when he uses his magic >--< , a dango( don't know what kind of food it is)  lover girl who was trained by his brother to become a professional fighter , Sion the type who wants to become the ruler 'coz he wishes for peace but doesn't care what kind of methods does he use, though he has many faces , he's different in front of the nobles, and way different in front of Ryner , where he can be himself without putting on a mask. The comedy moments in the middle of a serous battle , Ferris beating up Ryner and so on make this show  worth watching ,because it gives everything . Action , fantasy,comedy. romance(  those Ferris Ryner moments are so cuteeeee!!).....\\n\\n\r\nSo I would say this is overall a 9.50( I'll give the rest when I finish the anime) .",

Perhaps I found it good because I came in with such low expectations after reading the name, but I can definitely say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Truly, one shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.\r\nI would say that as of the 18 episodes that I personally have watched, the story has been interesting and captivating.  Although some might argue that parts of it are similar to other shows, it seems pretty uniqueand original to me (although I certainly have not watched as much anime as many others).  The main character, Ryner, is fun to relate to, as his extreme laziness and lack of motivation make him somewhat of an antihero.  Other characters each have distinctly interesting personalities, and overall, the voice acting and audio is very good.  The animation quality has been fine throughout the show (in the most recent episode that I have watched, episode 18, the quality slightly decreases, but this is because more attention and detail is given to the action scenes, which, to me, is desirable).  Overall, I would say that this show is a very enjoyable one, and would recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested.",

            "content": "This is the very first anime that has inspired me to write a review, and I have watched MANY anime over the years. It isn't necessarily the best anime I have watched nor is it my favorite, but despite this fact it was one of the more compelling and intriguing series that I have watched. This is very surprising to me, because I found many flaws in the way it was executed. \r\nDensetsu's first flaw, and arguably its largest is the pacing of the story. For the first half of the anime not much happens. The anime comes off as cliche, repetitive. Ryner, the malelead of this anime is lazy, and whines about having to do work, Ferris is the emotionless female companion that is there to keep Ryner in line. Whenever Ryner is lazy she gives him a good hit over the head. Both characters seem bland, and uninspiring. This sums up most of the interactions between the two leads for one half of the show. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately you are not able to skip the first half of the show because there are a few very important events that take place. They often come in the form of flashbacks, and they happen at peculiar times. \\n\\n\r\nWhat the first half of this anime is trying to accomplish is fleshing out the characters, and setting up the story. This is the anime's biggest downfall, too much time is devoted to setting the story up. That being said the second half of this anime is very memorable, and is teetering right on the verge of greatness. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime shines, this is what makes the anime memorable. It asks the fundamental question: What shapes each person as a human being? What seemed like bland, cookie cutter character suddenly are given a lot of depth. Suddenly the menial day to day interactions that you see in the first half become clear. There is a reason behind the repetitiveness, Ryners laziness, Ferris's relatively emotionless, cold exterior. What seems like a cookie cutter fantasy turns into a multifaceted, deep story line. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is slow developing, but the slow development will be well worth your time. What looked to be a bland, cookie cutter anime turned out to be one of the most enjoyable anime that I have ever seen. There were a lot of themes tackled in this anime, and it was done well in my opinion. If not for a lackadaisical first half, and a open ended ending it would have been one of the most talked about anime's of 2010. \\n\\n\r\nIn reality the story is only just getting started when the anime ended. I think a second season was intended for this anime, but unfortunately it will never happen. You will just have to make due with the visual novels if you enjoyed this anime. All in all this was an anime that was greater than the sum of its parts.",

            "content": "Well, I'm making this review to give a couple of advices and say what I think of the show.\r\nFirst a warning, first episode it's not the actual first one and gives a bad first impresion. So you may want to start with the second one. This one would be 5.5 or 6.5, I don't remember exactly what episode it would be.\r\nSTORY:\r\nFirst, the story is good, nice pace and with some unique elements. First of all half of the show have like 2 stories at the same time. Ryner that has a more classic adventure type of plot and Sion that has something close to GoTtype, until both stories converge at one point. \\n\r\nThe plot is simple BUT a lot of things are said in an implicit way and not in a \"IN YOUR FACE\" kind of telling. You need to pay atention to it or you are going to end up complaining about \"how random the plot is\". THEY EXPLAIN MOST THINGS and the show has a pretty linear plot with a couple of plot twist but following the logic it had, nothing is out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe world is one of the things that I liked the most, there are a lot of countries and every each of them have their own kind of magic. There a lot of legends like the name of the show implies, about relics, special powers and heroes, lot of them are important in the plot. Ryner adventure collect a lot of lore about the world while Sion side give information about the factions in the world.\\n\\n\r\nThis has a lot of comedy, sometimes you have a fun moment and then a very serius moment. We have a couple of the changes from time to time. Also a lot of times something that seems very serius ends up being a joke. Some things that seem important and then left behind may apear again later. It has a bit of romance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART AND ANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good with really fluid movements and well used CGI. The art is kinda hit or miss I guess, I like it tho. \\n\\n\r\nNice amount of action involving swordplay, magic, the relics and special unique powers. Also we have various kinds of scales of battle, from duels, to tag team battle, a couple of massacres and army battles. So your are going to see action here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nI liked the characters a lot, most of them are developed, including secondary cast. We get to see their backstories, their goals, their problems and how some of them change(for good and for worse). \\n\\n\r\nRYNER, one of my favorite characters and I feel a bit related too it. This character is on the OP side but not the strongest one. Lot of people complain about him not going on a killing spree every time that he can because he is strong... HE DOESN'T LIKE TO KILL PEOPLE !! But don't be afraid, this show has plently of killing and it's on the gore side sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nFERRIS, the female MC, this characters has a lot of hate, a missunderstanding about her it's her behaviour. She \"abuse\" the MC... BUT a lot of times it means something, it isn't blind violence. Look the context of her actions, a lot of times she does it because the MC is doing something dumb or because she is worried about him. Also a lot of times they are just joking, playing or doing dumb stuff together. It's not that hard to see that they really get along and have a fun dinamic. She has DereDere moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is OK, nothing good nor bad to say.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nGOOD:\\n\r\n-Nice and violent action scenes. \\n\r\n-Well developed and interesting characters.\\n\r\n-Good plot.\\n\r\n-Rich lore and world.\\n\r\n-Great animation.\\n\r\n-Decent comedy.\\n\\n\r\nBAD:\\n\r\n-For some people the plot isn't explained enough and might get lost, so pay atention because they explain!!!\\n\r\n-Around the 2 last episodes the pace gets weird and some random interactions between some of the cast and the MC apear, nothing great tho. It has a cool fight near the end too.\\n\r\n-First episode.\\n\r\n-Incomplete story. The LN is still ongoing after 8 years since the show ended, sooo the ending is pretty open.\\n\r\n-The timing of some jokes might be annoying for some people.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Anger, sorrow, hatred, despair, happiness\u2026regardless if you are a human or a monster, these are emotions that everyone feels. What is a monster? The ones who are born unique to others and have no say, or the ones who hunt them down and kill them due to fear of being overpowered?\r\nThe title of this anime in English translates to \u201cThe Legend of the legendary heroes\u201d, which is a very relevant and fitting name for this anime. It is quite simple and at the same time quite complex. After watching just a few episodes you will understand the meaning, but what I do recommend is thatas you are watching try to figure out the multiple meanings of this anime title, and try not to just categorize this anime title as a \u201csimple one\u201d. Now to begin the adventure of the legendary heroes!\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off where you meet two out of the three most important characters. Ryner Lute is with his partner Eris Ferris on a mission to try and collect these \u201cLegendary Hero\u201d relics. At first while watching this anime, like most animes you tend to start off confused and wondering where this show is going to go. You have Ryner Lute who is a magician and holds a secret power within himself. His partner Ferris\u2026 man on man what an interesting character to put in an anime that could have been very serious. She practically uses her \u201ccharm\u201d as an excuse to bully Ryner. She also bullies Ryner by calling him a \u201cmonster\u201d (in a jokingly way) that abducts and does terrible stuff to kids and women. Aside from that she forces Ryner to agree with her, and EVERY mission she has to have her dango, and she uses the excuse to go on missions with Ryner to \u201cprotect the dango\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nLater on you will meet the last main character who is King Sion Astal. As you can probably tell he is a king, and throughout the anime you learn bits and pieces of why he became king, and what he wanted to achieve as king\u2026 the usual. What made this such an interesting story was how you would always learn about the pasts of different characters in like segments and at crucial times during the anime. You learn about why most of them are who they are as the story goes on. You realize though after a while, after learning about all the characters pasts, some main some supporting, that this show could be very powerful and you could learn important life changing lessons. The biggest problem I found with this anime, aside from all the unanswered questions was the character Ferris. I mean I felt like her character (being tsundere) just went overboard at some points. Like at one point it will be very serious and intense and the next she is making fun of Ryner and it completely killed the atmosphere that had been built up.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, the only minor thing that I was disappointed about was the lack of a presence of Kiefer Knolles. I felt as if she could be one of the most important characters but she kind of just disappeared and reappeared randomly and I personally think she is one of the most important characters, especially for the development of who Ryner Lute really is. Those were the two biggest issues (or really only the issues) that I had with this show. \\n\\n\r\nSome things that I really enjoyed about this show were the magic, the character development, the character interaction with each other, and also the character styles. I really liked the way they portrayed the characters. This also goes with the fighting scenes that happened. I really like the pace they went at and also enjoyed watching all the unique aspects that were brought to each fight, and at the same time some of the silliness that was added. This show did go into great detail during the fighting scenes, with lots of parts being cut in half and everything that you would expect for a show that is rated \u201cR\u201d. That was one thing I was not disappointed bout, the amount of blood that flew around and the inhumanity of how people were treated. \\n\\n\r\nThis show also managed to show another lifestyle that isn\u2019t as relevant in today\u2019s society, which is hierarchy. You have a king at the top and then the lords who follow him and the commoners. At first, this sounds like an ideal way of living for the people because they believe that what the king is doing was helping the commoners out a lot, but in reality you notice that people are still treated as outcasts and excommunicated from society (shunned). This show was also able to show you that people might act nice on the outside, but deep down they have this hatred towards certain types of people just because they are different. \\n\\n\r\nOn a different note though, the music in this anime was good, nothing outstanding but it went with the show nicely. Personally the part that I always look for is when they end a show what is the mood or atmosphere that they leave you in. For this anime I found this very fitting using a very mellow song that filled each episode almost with a suspense and sadness in our hearts. I did really enjoy them trying to bring emotion to this anime (which was quite successful), and to be able to in some cases feel the pain of some of the characters and what they had to go through. \\n\\n\r\nThis leads to \u2018did I actually enjoy this show\u2019? As I say in most of my reviews I do enjoy almost all animes, but there is always something that leaves almost this hesitant feeling in me, and in this case was all the unanswered questions that were left. Normally animes leave maybe 2-3 questions for the viewer to think about but this anime had an amount that made the series feel incomplete. With the incompleteness of the anime also comes the hope of expecting more to come, if you look at it in an optimistic way, otherwise\u2026. You know where I am going. At the end of the day though, once I completed this anime I was quite pleased with the outcome because at first glances I was not expecting that much from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments please just send me a pm or write on my wall, I will try my best to answer to the best of my power! I will accept any type of feedback on to how to better improve my reviews, but please be constructive as well! Please also check my other reviews.

            "content": "The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is a surprising show in that it has quite a bit to offer that one most likely wouldn't have expected on a quick glance. On the surface it is a typical shounen action anime involving magical attacks and a search for mystical objects, and to some extent that is true. However, once the story begins unraveling, and it happens pretty quickly, Legendary Heroes shows that it has much more to offer than fighting and quirky antics.\r\nThe show starts off in the middle of the protagonist's, Ryner Lute, journey for the \"Relics of Heroes,\" a mysterious collection of artifacts thathe and his reluctant partner Ferris Eris have been tasked to find and collect. While these artifacts are supposedly powerful and destructive, Ryner wants to use them to create a world full of \"afternoon naps,\" and to achieve this goal he is supporting his old friend and the current king of Roland Sion Astal. Sion, the \"Hero King of Roland,\" has a similarly lofty and idealistic, though simple, objective - peace.\\n\\n\r\nThese naive ambitions would probably go unhitched in most shows where they are present, but the Legend of the Legendary Heroes turns the reality of these dreams into the main theme of the whole story; the sacrifices that the characters have to make and the way those losses affect and eventually make impossible the causes they strive for is the driving force that keeps the plot interesting. Each faction has their own needs, and when these needs clash the plot thickens, keeping the anime interesting all throughout. These sort of moments allow for plenty of character and plot progression which always comes at just the right time.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are a mixed bag. The ones that aren't expanded upon much in the show's run come off as shameless archetypes which, though appropriate for their individual role in the story, weakens the believability a bit and makes character interaction much less provocative. The most unfortunate part of this negative aspect is that each episode seemed to have some focus on the side characters that never end up fully developing, leaving the viewer wanting more but knowing they won't get much. On the other hand, the characters that do have significant progression are endlessly interesting and show where the plot really shines. Luckily Legendary Heroes seems to know that is where most of its strengths lie and the first arc of sorts is a long flashback explaining Ryner and company's current situation, and it is definitely intriguing enough to catch the attention of anyone who might otherwise have been bored with the seemingly typical plotline that is laid out in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nOne would expect a good amount of action, and Legendary Heroes certainly delivers. There are plenty of fights to satisfy those looking for flashy magic moves and even some large-scale battles involving plenty of throwaway soldiers and explosions. Unfortunately there isn't much variation in the attacks themselves; for example, Ryner doesn't even use more than one kind of spell for the whole show despite being heralded as \"the Greatest Mage in Roland\" and being a wielder of the powerful Alpha Stigma. Most of the interesting action surprisingly comes from the otherwise mostly uninteresting side characters, who obviously don't have as many fights but when they are the center of attention they show off as much as possible, making their fights the most entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art are mot much to speak of, outside of one particularly stylistic episode. Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem but the grand feeling the show should have is brought down at times by the lackluster visuals when they should ideally be on an equally outstanding level. The music is on a similar level of alright but not noticeable or memorable, again unfortunate given the creative things they could have done with the medieval-inspired setting.\\n\\n\r\nLegendary Heroes is an interesting and engaging plot filled with a mixed bag of generic and genuinely entertaining characters, topped off with a fleshed out fantasy world of politics and bloodshed. The things it is brought down by are significant enough to warrant some hesitation, but its assets are truly strong and warrant a chance from anyone who enjoys a well thought out and engaging plot and are willing to look past some of its clear faults and enjoy the whole.",

            "content": "First and foremost, Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu is only a part of the story. It's based off a light novel. Because it tries to follow true to the novel, the anime series ends on a terrible cliffhanger where we've been fed many episodes of buildup but no conclusions. It'll leave a sour taste in your mouth if you try to watch this as a standalone.\r\nSecondly, Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu's title, poster image, and synopsis misrepresents the series. It makes you think that this series is going to be a happy, cheesy adventure with an OP MC and romcom shenanigans. That's completely off, andfor that reason, a LOT of people looking for the aforementioned are disappointed when they start watching. \\n\\n\r\nThis is actually a story centered mostly around war and morality packaged into a fantasy setting.  It's not a story about Ferris and Ryner travelling the world to collect relics. That's a very, very small portion of it. It's moreso about personal backstories of the three main characters and the ruling of the Roland Kingdom. There are many tragic backstories. Despite the fruity colors, there's a lot of gore and dismembered bodies. There are a lot of characters in a moral gray zone. There's a lot of pain. The best part of the anime is the emotional punch it packs.\\n\\n\r\nThe series consists of generic elements, and it's comparatively 'old' - meaning you should expect tropes from the early 2000s.  For example, Ferris is a slapstick tsundere. This show's comedy relief centers around her poking fun at Ryner. This won't resonate well with many of the audience. I personally didn't mind it. It also incorporates fantasy elements and plot devices that have been frequently used in a number of series. However, I think that the generic elements have been packaged well into a story, so it doesn't  feel bland or overdone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think it's a good watch, though it needs to be supplemented with background material. I would recommend it to people who are looking for something with tragedy and moral conflict, especially the latter. It's very rare to find something with so many gray characters. It also sports a solid fantasy world to enjoy. My verdict on this anime is that it is polarizing. People who can't get into the characters or who want action will hate it. People who tend to empathize with characters will like it.",

            "content": "With a combination of ridiculous titles and magical incantations, Denyuuden may look like a turn-off; nevertheless, the series does deserve more respect than its underrated status. Although the reception of this almost-clich\u00e9 fantasy story was rather poor, the show does give off its unique flare here and there.\r\nThe plot was not spectacular. For people familiar with Arthurian legends and LOTR, Denyuuden pales by comparison. It isn't the first time magic, warring states, corruption and the battle between GOOD & EVIL appeared in text, on stage, or on screen \u2013\u2013 RIGHT? But it was not completely unoriginal, for I liked how the forces of GOOD andEVIL were relativistic: not one character acted purely benevolent or malevolent; they had their individual reasons to be. I give the plot a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nHere, studio ZEXCS proved its ability to animate with stunning artwork. The most notable highlight would be its usage of optical effects in the depictions of landscape and objects, mostly shadow and reflection, which the studio used rather effectively to amplify situation and mood. Although the background details were not the most exceptional anime has to offer, I really enjoyed the character designs. The people were good to look at \u2013\u2013 sometimes too good to look at. I give artwork 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nBrilliant is the word to describe the music in Denyuuden. With its music score a plenty, the soundtrack composed for this show coupled well with the emotions and events that are either happening or going to happen. \u201cKetsui no Tatakai\u201d is a perfect culmination of flowering heroism. \u201cKakusei\u201d captures the imagery of chaos and darkness. And let us not forget the lull of \u201cTonari ni wa\u201d; probably the bliss from Ryner\u2019s afternoon naps. The composition ranges from Baroque counterpoint to more eclectic selections: it\u2019s good stuff. I give music 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were a highlight in this story with the exception of Iris Eris (watch the show and you\u2019ll know what I mean). One outstanding feature about this anime is how often the characters would change in the way they feel towards one another, which made it more relatable to the viewer. Sometimes light; other times dark, each person was part of a balance amidst the yearning for the restoration of peace. I will attempt to give each major character a three-word title.\\n\\n\r\nRyner Lute \u2013 Absurdist Minimalist Magister\\n\r\nFerris Eris \u2013 Haughty Condescending Bishoujo\\n\r\nSion Astal \u2013 Bipolar Workaholic Vigilante\\n\r\nMiran Froaude \u2013 Shrewd Rationalist Prodigy \\n\r\nTiir Rumibul \u2013 Caring Misunderstood \u201cMonster\u201d\\n\r\nLuke Stokkart \u2013 Inquisitive Perceptive Watcher\\n\r\nLucile Eris \u2013 Amoral All-seeing Arbiter\\n\r\nLir Orla \u2013 Lucky Pink-haired Bastard\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, I give it 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed \u201cDensetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu\u201d so I give it 9/10.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Everybody who reads this: PLEASE understand that this is my opinion, and even though you might not agree, I have an opinion too, and I would like it to be respected, just how you expect to have your opinion respected. Just because I thought that something was better than you thought or worse than you thought, doesn't mean that I did a \"Bad review\". If I did a \"Bad Review\" than I wouldn't have cared to make a review in the firstplace. Also, I can understand if I might have said something that offended you, upset you, or whatever, but I literally can't quite helpthat. I certainly can make a review that deserves \"Constructive Criticism\", but I certainly don't intend on EVER making a \"Bad Review\" of anything. Anyway, rant over. Onto another review.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, let me clarify the fact that this anime is one of my favorites of all time, and for good reason, and some people don't quite understand this.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the story is about a man named Ryner Lute, who is a man with a special set of eyes that can make him mimic the use of magic almost instantaneously. He is joined by a lady warrior named Ferris Eris, along his adventures, in order to find the ancient relics within the lands of the continent, so that Roland can become one of the greatest kingdoms on earth. Also, the King of Roland, Sion Astal, was the bastard son of a nobleman, who seeks to provide justice to his land and even to the world. Now, there are many mishaps along the way, and there are some decisions that I think shouldn't have been made, but overall, the story was one of the best parts about this anime, despite the use of the flashback.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nothing less than amazing. I loved how it was used to show the different contrasts between characters, and their demeanor. Also, it gave us something to look at when we want something to stick out in our minds, which lets us to believe that it even sets up the ambiance in he scene. It simply was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound is probably the best part of this anime. The music was nothing less than captivating almost every single moment of the anime, along with the great opening and closing music, but that was the weakest music in it, but it was still amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were probably the weakest part of the anime. Ryner Lute was the best character within the anime, and you see his struggles, his pain, his laughter, his development as a character. He is one of the best protagonists of all time, despite his obsession with naps. Ferris Erris is a somewhat strong female lead, but she sometimes is helpless with dealing with Ryner Lute's behavior, often calling him a Womanizer and a Pervert, when he is not. Also, she doesn't really have the most original of names, but she is definitely a badass, if one might say so. Sion is also a fairly strong character. He is constantly doing paperwork, visits, parties, etc. when he is king. You see his struggles as king, thinking about how to govern the kingdom, how to deal with Ryner and people like him, etc. There aren't very many other main characters, but there are a lot of major supporting characters, like Kiefer Knolls, but she only plays a major supporting role because she was part of the magic academy that Ryner and Sion were a part of. Other than the 3 major characters, you don't really see much development from them, but you do see enough for them to be entertaining to you, like the romantic relationship building between one of Sion's generals and a noble lady, which is very enjoyable to watch, trust me. Also, there is a group that watches out for Ryner and stuff, but they don't really play much into the anime, in terms of the plot, until the later half of the anime, and even then, they aren't really the greatest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is one to behold for me. I know many people seem to disagree, but that is fine. Everyone has their own opinion on things, and I can definitely respect that. I wish that we could agree, but we are human beings. This anime is definitely a recommendation. Still want to play the visual novel, because I heard its far better, but I still haven't found anything about it yet.",

            "content": "This was one of those animes you just get absorbed into, though that is only from my personal references. This might not be so interesting to a person who doesnt care for a dark anime.\r\nThe story is really interesting and something that is quite cliche' with the main protagonist 'Ryner Lute' who travels around with 'Ferris Eris' in search of the 'legendary hero artifacts' pretty basic, story line with an interesting twist.\r\nRyner Lute has eyes called 'Alpha Stigma' or 'Alpha Stigmata' which ever you would prefer, that have the ability to steal any magic he sees used. Which you will notice throughout the series. Thoughhis eyes are special ill get into that more later on. Ryner is seen as a very lazy person who doesnt want to do anything except have 'afternoon naps' and i personally agree with him there.\\n\\n\r\nHe travels with Ferris Eris who is the sister of the current head of the Eris household. She is incredibly powerful for a warrior with no magic. She easily deals with large numbers of people though she isn't invincible they make a good team as she is running up front with a powerful melee and he supports with magic, and been able to copy any magic he sees he can use it against them they normally stop using magic after they notice this though and just stick to weapons. (with exceptions)\\n\\n\r\nSion Astal who knows Ryner Lute from the Special Royal Academy *spoiler* and later becomes king *spoiler* is a bright and charismatic person who is considered a hero among the people of Roland. He is surrounded by loyal and powerful subordinates who support him in his ideal to have a peaceful nation. He is also very much so a work 'a' holic who does alot of work thats required of him without much common sense such as eating. And with his loyal subordinates aid they keep him in good health to help run the nation of Roland.\\n\\n\r\nThey are the three main characters with other important characters been Ferris Eris older brother who is also the head of the Eris household and her younger sister Lucile Eris and Iris Eris. \\n\\n\r\nIsnt much to say about Lucile other than that he is more or less the kingpin of the Roland Nation who is incredibly and insanely powerful who *spoiler* makes a persons head explode with no effort *spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nIris on the other hand dearly holds her sister in high regards and works to keep her happy (easily seen from the series) oh and cant forget this piece of info but Ferris is obsessed with Dango especially 'Wynot's Dango' and Iris will deliver the Dango to her on nearly all occassions i can remember off the top of my head but dont hold me to that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the art is pretty good though its not the best ive seen from my many animes ive watched over the years. Its never the less good but still sometimes i wish they worked on it a little more. Never the less its not the worst ive seen but it is one of those animes where you notice it on the odd occasion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter speech is pretty good, only one i have to complain about is Iris even now im still not a fan of little girls who suck up to people's voices its like nails and a blackboard x 1000. The sound effects are pretty good especially when *spoiler* Ryner lute goes out of control rapes absolutely everyone around him *spoiler*  (please dont take that literally) I never really noticed any environmental sounds though. That could really use some work, but that could just of been from my 'tunnel vision' and me getting absorbed into the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series very much and would definitively recommend this series to anyone. *Spoiler* My favourite scenes throughout the series are when Ryner Lute goes nuts and kills everyone in his 'berserk' status. And the laugh damn i cant get enough of it. Guess that just me and been dark and evil inside haha *spoiler* If they had more involved and more dangerous things occur during those kind of scenes I would have to say it would be top notch in terms of my gruesome bloody side of animes. but alas there isn't well not from Ryner anyways.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow to get back to the eyes i said i would talk about more, the alpha stigma that Ryner has is well ill say \"Special\" i wont say anymore than that otherwise it will ruin it for others. They allow him to do more than the average Alpha stigma user. Now his eyes are not the only ones that exist there are 3 in total. Since you'll find out roughly around episode 17 (dont hold me to that) i dont think anyone will mind me saying and describing them but anyways \\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER* The first eyes are his, which can copy any and all magic he sees and are the most common eyes (his are unique though watch series to find out why), Then there are eyes that allow one to see inside peoples dreams and only appear once in the series, And lastly eyes which can absorb all forms of power and people. Now you only see a person with that once in the series. I hope will we see more in a 2nd season if that will ever happen. *spoiler*\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall this series is great and full of a great mix of comedy from the traveling of Ferris and Ryner, as well as awesome scenes of Destruction from Ryner.\\n\r\nThe series can be quite dark especially when Ryner is going berserk (even the sky shows that clearly and dont ask why). \\n\\n\r\nOther than it been dark (which can be a bonus to some and a detriment to others) its a extremely good series, other than the art been a little disappointing and Iris annoying voice it certainly is a top notch anime. \\n\\n\r\nHope that reading this review didnt totally waste your time. Hope you watch the series if you haven't already.",

            "content": "It's hard to understand why DenYuuDen has lost its way when it was going so well. Some said it was because the low audience, some say it's just bad script writing, maybe a mix of both. The fact is, Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetu is a good and enjoyable show, which unexplainably went the wrong way on the last 4 or 5 episodes. The only way to redeem itself would be by having a second season, but this seems highly unlikely from what I read.\r\nI was really surprised by the story on this series. I was expecting just another action anime full of cliches, butI was proven wrong and in a very pleasant way. The constant dark tone this series presents allied with political conflicts and personal conflicts were what made this a very good series, despite the bad ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, characters design and the sceneries were well done. It wasn't anything original but they enhanced to the right amount the feeling that was supposed to be conveyed at a specific moment. The action scenes were very short but were good as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack ranged from very good to very bad sometimes. More than once the music felt completely out of place to a certain scene, which made me feel quite confused if that was actually the intention or just the sound director going nuts.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was another strong point in this series, they were convincing, deeply explored and had their reasons to act as they acted. The only bad point was the development in the end which was very confusing and this is specifically what made this series lose so many points with me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was still a very enjoyable series, despite the terrible ending. Even though I wouldn't say not to watch just because the last episodes. I say, watch it, and pray for a second season!XP",

            "content": "From the title itself, you must have figured out that the anime \"Legend of the Legendary Heroes\" tries too hard. \r\nI was sucked into watching this anime over a couple other I had on my mind because of its setting. I really like the kingdom setting where is conflict between the different nations as well as inside one empire. The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is just that. \r\nThe idea for the series, while nothing original, is really intriguing. But the execution was in one word - BAD.\r\nI will divide this review into two parts, the good and the bad of the anime.\r\nBAD :\r\nNothing isexplained : Most of the important details are never explained and some are at the end of the series which isn't of any use. This leads to confusion and plot holes which leads to a lot of people just dropping the anime, which is fair enough. Who would want to watch something which throws different things at you that you don't understand? We are never explained or even told how many hero relics exist and how they were actually formed. \\n\\n\r\nUnnecessary Comedy : The comedy is so out of place in this anime, its not even funny. Almost all the important scenes are destroyed by comedy.\\n\\n\r\nInconsistent Power levels : I'll give you an example.\\n\r\nA is as strong as B. C is almost as strong as B. But C is annihilated by D. Then, D is annihilated by B. No matter what, this shouldn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development : The characters don't develop, they take a jump from being one personality to another. The main character Reiner is a kind-hearted loving guy at one time while at the other, he is simply lazy and uncaring(I am not talking about his inner demon). His relationship with Ferris develops to one point at around the episode 10 mark and then suddenly, it reverts back to how they were. at the start.\\n\\n\r\nRomance : While there isn't a whole lot of romance, the amount there is, isn't done well at all.  Places where there should be romance doesnt have romance while there is romance between characters we dont know enough about or how they fell for each other.\\n\\n\r\nIrregular Pacing : You'll never get the feel of what's going on in the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGood :\\n\\n\r\nConcept : The idea was really interesting but it isn't executed well enough. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : Although the character development isn't good, the characters were really likeable. Well, most of them were. I didn't like Ferris constantly beating up Reiner. She is just a sadist and has nothing more to her personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound is good yet nothing to make a fuss about. They're satisfactory I would say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI am not sure how much I enjoyed the series. I liked the idea and this could have really turned into a great story had it not been for multiple stupid scenes and plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some concepts which were opened but never explored. For instance, Reiner should've spent much more time with the people of his kind. Also, this should have happened way earlier in the anime. That had so much potential but the idiotic mangaka couldn't see it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nI know I shouldn't be giving this anime a 7 after all the complaints I had about it but there were some really interesting scenes and episodes which had a ton of potential. They were good to watch briefly but the stupidity and some of the nonsensical things that happened brought this anime down. I didn't feel the anime had to be in lower than my \"7\" score category, which is the score I give to most of my anime.\\n\r\nAs for if I recommend the anime or not, I would say watch the first few episodes and decide for yourself. If you can stick with the anime and follow the story without getting bamboozled about what's happening after the first 5-6 episodes, then you might come to like it... somewhat.\\n",

            "content": "What if instead of fan service, harems, the meaning of friendship, and all those other anime tropes that we have all come to get used to; An anime dared to be different. Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu was this anime. If you have seen Steins;Gate, then you know what I'm talking about when i say even the vocabulary is different. In both Steins;Gate and Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu, a certain type of language is used to signify that these characters aren't just your run of mill brainless characters, but are well thought out and intelligent. At least, this is what I first thought wheni finished episode 1. \\n\\n\r\nThe intelligence the characters portrayed during this anime was amazing, but at the same time, they all had these weaknesses that were not realistic to people living in such a divided world. These quirks of their characters made for a more lighter tone to an anime that really needed to show more of its darker side. For lying underneath this anime's lighthearted banter was a plot that was filled with sinister origins and prophecies.  In one example, Ryner Lute, (the main character), expresses a character trait that just seems like a bad attempt to lighten the mood. I like to sleep just as much as the next person, (maybe too much), But it is the last thing on my mind during stressful situations, let alone a war torn world where everyone hates you and what you represent. Ryner Lute would have benefited from a much better weakness, or downside to flesh out his character a bit more. He comes from a background where even his own parents gave him up for dead, or at least, were to afraid of him to show him the affection a child needs.\\n\\n\r\nRyner isn't the only character who had issues, Ferris Eris herself had an issue that bothered me. In an anime with such potential to take those anime tropes i mentioned and throw them out the window, why make her obsessed with dongo? The humor here was cute, and i admit made me chuckle a bit sometimes, but then a dark tone comes back and it all feels out of place. In Steins;Gate this same type of humor is thrown in, but it is used at the correct times and is a part of the anime as a whole, whereas the humor in Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu seems rushed, and just \"thrown in\". \\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of this anime that should be addressed is the Romance. First, you think he is destined to be romanced by Kiefer Knolles, but then they throw Ferris in, and even Milk gets a shot, but unlike a harem anime where each girl has a point, (or is supposed to), for being there, Milk just seems thrown in, and Ferris sort of takes Kiefer's spot. Having Ryner and Ferris stay friends would make for a much better character development point. They humor between them would have a place if it wasn't sharing a space with a romance. Kiefer and Ryner reuniting would make for a much better love story. Ferris mistreats Ryner the entire time they are together, using the common \"You are such a pervert\" phrase that we have all come to know and love. And yet there isn't even an inkling that he might be that way at all. At least in most anime when this happens the guy has seen something he shouldn't have, but poor Ryner gets accused for existing.\\n\\n\r\nRyner Lute is hated for simply being alive, because of his rare power. So for a character that is abused all his life, Kiefer is a needed, and wanted, distraction. She treats him with respect and finds something in him that she is attracted to, and he sees a girl who can see past his hated power, and loves him regardless of what society thinks of it. So why is she disregarded and then replaced by a girl who constantly berates Ryner, just as society has done to him all his life. Though she was also able to see past this horrible power of his, she didn't respect what the constant abuse could have done to him, and abused him in her own way. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about the characters and what could have been changed, but I'll leave that for another day. For now, i want to discuss the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is all over the place. According to those who have read the manga, it was not like this at all. So for some reason this anime was changed a lot from it's source material. And the saddest part is that the confusing plot is probably the worst thing that could have happened to this anime. With the impressive writing, to the incredible music. And characters who could have been fleshed out and wonderful to try and relate to, this anime certainly had a lot of potential. So why was it all over the place?\\n\\n\r\nThis type of storytelling, where the story jumps back and forth through time and plot points, is something that is becoming more and more popular among writers who try to be different. And if done write, it can incredible to delve into. It is extremely difficult to pull off successfully, however, and unfortunately this anime messed up big time. For an anime whose literature and dialogue are already intellectually complex, to throw in a convoluted sense of time just seems pointless to me. Someone who wants to sit back and enjoy an anime, only to find this particular one, will end up being one of the numerous viewers who added this anime to their dropped list. And I'm not normally one who agrees with dropping an anime, (I see myself as sort of a completionist), but I see how dropping this anime might end up being the correct decision, and not just for casual viewers of anime. Finishing this anime only instills a feeling of incompleteness and emptiness, and doesn't leave you hungering for more at the same time. We go from happy moments, to sad moments, to funny moments, and then back to happy moments all within one part of and episode where Ryner started out with a monologue about his horrible life. But that's not all, add to that a bit of unneeded romance that doesn't fit at all, and you have Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu in a nut shell.\\n\\n\r\nNow i didn't hate this anime at all, nor did I dislike it. In fact, I enjoyed this anime quite well. The strong suits of this anime besides the impressive writing and music, are how amazing the world is, and how diverse the characters actually are. I want to know more about this land, and the different nations that make it up. I want to understand the motives behind some of the minor characters that are randomly thrown in here and there. And if there is one complaint that I would have to stress the most about this anime, It's that it doesn't even give an effort to try and give the viewer those things.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are wondering whether or not you should watch this anime, I would say give it a try at least, watch an episode or two. If you think you can handle the complexity of the story and randomness of the characters, then i assure you it will be a fantastic anime for you. But if you are like me and can't seem to get through an anime like this. Then you will struggle all the way through it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I wouldn't watch this anime again, But I don't completely feel like my time watching it was wasted either.",

            "content": "Potential, remember that word. It is a value that never has to be proven, it is what could be but in most cases never becomes. Potential, that is the best word to describe the anime Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu. Densetsu had the potential to be talked about in the same breath as legendary animes such as Berserk, Code Geass, Attack on Titan, so and so forth. Instead this anime has faded into obscurity, completely forgot by most anime fans. It could have been one of the most talked about anime of 2010 but instead it suffered a terrible, and unfortunate fate of awful directing.\r\nThisanime had a lot of brand equity. The series Densetsu was a well known, and very popular as a light novel in Japan. The light novel was an epic that took on some lofty themes that many anime try to pull off but few are able to. It had it's lighthearted moments, but slowly it descended into a very dark and foreboding story line. The anime failed to capture that descent into darkness that made the light novel so great.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this anime I get the distinct impression that the director did not know what direction he wanted to go with this anime. After reading the light novel some of the decisions the studio took perplexed me. \\n\\n\r\nThe first, and most fatal mistake the director made was trying to tackle two light novels in one season without any clear direction. In fact some stories were spliced into the first half of the season that were nothing more than side stories from different light novels in the series than the main two that were covered in the anime. These stories were more of your typical shounen/slice of life type of stories that did not do anything to enhance the main story. This is a very large problem when you're trying to cover as much material as they did in just one season. It throws this anime's pacing off, and leads to some schizophrenic pacing.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the director needed to do is trim some fat. A lot of that content was unnecessary to move the story forward. As a consequence the first half of the anime drug on for a long time without making any significant process. This in turn leads to the main plot lines being hurried at a blistering pace in the second half. This led to a bipolar, schizophrenic anime that didn't know what it wanted to be. Cool shounen? Na I want to be a slice of life anime. No wait! I want to be a cliche shounen anime again! Not so fast, we're going to be a brooding, dark fantasy anime. This schizophrenia makes this anime very hard to categorize, I seriously don't think you can fit it into any one category neatly. \\n\\n\r\nFor me it led to some intrigue. I have been watching anime since I was the tender age of 7 (now I'm in my mid 20s). I have seen thousands of shows, from almost every genre imaginable, and in the end this is the one anime that left me scratching my head. I didn't know WHAT to call it because this anime had no clear purpose. It was supposed to be a dark fantasy, but instead it the director and studio did not know what to do with this anime.\\n\\n\r\n If they had trimmed some fat, and paced the story correctly this anime would almost certainly have had a second season, and my guess is it would have been in the Pantheon of most recommended and popular anime. Instead the anime ended at an awkward place, nothing was really resolved, the story just introduced a plot-line from left field that only really gets explained after the events that happened in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow, you may be asking, WHY did you give this anime a 9 out of 10? Despite the anime being botched, it really was an enjoyable anime if you had the fortitude to stick through it. The anime did a great job on world building. You got a great feel for the happenings, lore, and character of the main country in the anime, Roland. The anime did a good job fleshing out it's history, and politics surrounding the country. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime also did a great job of fleshing out the main characters, Shion, Ryner, and Ferris. Another aspect that I liked about this anime is that it was hard to tell which characters had ulterior motives and which did not. It added intrigue and depth to this anime. This anime asked the fundamental question where did we come from, how did we get this way, and where are we going. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the anime being botched in many ways, it came through thematically. It had depth that most fantasy anime do not have, and despite the schizophrenic nature of this anime it executed many things well. This is definitely not an anime for the masses, but despite this somewhat negative review I would be willing to bet that more people like this anime than not. The few things that this anime did execute well made this anime worth the watch for me. It's just sad to think that most of this anime's potential was squandered. It could've been much more than it is, but instead the director of this anime pissed away this anime's brand equity, and story.",

            "content": "Bias & First impression:\r\n\tI was caution to expect too much, for I have not seen many kingdom based plots and the lead male seemed somewhat stereotypically shounen. The first episode did not represent this series at all, on the contrary it was the worst. However if you give up on the first episode you have misjudged the rest of the show.\r\n\tThe pace of the show is fast, and things quickly start to pick up, connections are made, and confusions cleared. The reason I continued through was the unexpectedly amazing episode a few in, to be un-numbered for sake of spoiling. There is a mix ofthe comical duo of Ryner and Ferris that offsets the heavy atmosphere of Sion\u2019s attempt at improving the kingdom of Roland.\\n\\n\r\nExpectation: 6-7 Fine to Good.\\n\\n\r\nActual: 7 Good\\n\r\nEpisode scores: -,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,9,9,9,10,6,7,7,7\\n\\n\r\nAnalysis:\\n\r\n\tStory\\n\r\nThe story is large, fast paced, intertwined with politics, magic, relationships, and wars. They waste no time getting to the core of an event, however at times you can feel like everything is happening a little too fast. Have a rebellion? Well we can discover, plot, and kill them all in 23 minutes if you would like. Important flashback that sets up the plot? Cover those few years in three. A lot of times things happen behind the scenes too.\\n\r\nThis is not exactly complaining however, since they have so much story to tell they picked the most interesting parts. I loved how I was able to immerse myself in the huge cast and plot, and how I could sympathize with every side. \\n\r\n\tThe action was great in terms of animation, however there was a lot of \u2018convenient\u2019 dark spots, or rather almost any fight that took place indoors was like trying to find your way in the pitch black. It was an important element, and you can expect at least one action scene an episode even though it might be short.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThere are too many to be able to count. Thankfully you should be able to keep them all straight if I could. The story is face paced so there is plenty of development in their disposition over the course of the show. The villains are loveable, and the heroes are despicable; there is no clear cut good and bad which gives the relationships between everyone more complex. Every character has motive, personality, and significance in a sense.\\n\r\n\tThe only possible annoyance in this was Sion\u2019s and Ryner\u2019s unjustifiable friendship. Their promise holds such significance to them that it doesn\u2019t seem to fit in the dark realistic plot in which they are set. I think they attempt to explain this, but I don\u2019t believe it revealed itself to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\n\tMy attention was on and off; there were a few episodes early on that caught me along for the rest of the season. I didn\u2019t really enjoy the first half as much as I would have liked, but with this type of story there is a lot of buildup needed in order for things to get heated. Yet the last half was awesome as many of those scenarios came to a climax (as you can see from my scores). From the stereotypical hero who only wants to take his afternoon naps, to the bloody carnage of the alpha stigmas, the overzealous Sion, and slim divide between what is good and evil. This show can deliver \u2018if\u2019 you let yourself get pulled in.\\n",

            "content": "Let me start off with sharp criticism because that is the first thing I want to do after watching the whole series. I must mention that it took me really long time to deal with this show therefore it can't be called captivating by any means.\r\nAnimation quality was flat and inconsistent throughout the episodes. Sound was average as well, we saw similar OP/ED many times before, nothing extra nor memorable happend in the audiovisual area. ZEXCS did very tacky job at this one. The dialogues are miserable and often empty or repetitive. Most of the characters lack charisma and needed depth. The way how theyare introduced and developed is not properly executed in the whole narrative of the story. Fights choreography could be more complex and dynamic even though i am not sure what the anime is supposed to be, but i will get to this point later. The atmosphere is systematically being compromised by cheesy jokes. Last but foremost King Astals motivation speeches were happening suspiciously often right during sunset. Wasting time on insignificant characters as Milk and Iris is another problem. The end was very disturbing to me even though there was some slight foreshadowing it seemed to me like something that might be called \"very bad deus ex machina.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe main fault in this show is over-combination of various elements, meaning : different plot collisions that are not working, wrong pacing of show, Is it serious show or not ? Is the show about intrigues on kings court or action packed adventure ? Are the motives of love, family, death, friendship etc. coherent in the whole package ? All of those things could work, yes i think they could, but in this show they did not. To sum it up : Show had great potential with what seemed to be promise of \"more and better\" at the start. Unfortunately as the show went on and slowly was coming to an end, left the consumer with just a sense of unfulfilled expectations.",

The way it can be describe is like a combination of Gangaro, Gothic with a modern twist added in to it that doesn't suit the setting.\\n\\n\r\n-However, I admire Ryner's new look, it brings out the bad boy in him.\\n\\n\r\n-Side comment: I hate the way the artist drew Sion, he looks more feminine. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Rating, a fair number 6.\\n\\n\r\n-My only comment pertains to the opening theme, which I hate it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Rating #8\\n\\n\r\n- I like the way to were the character's look matches their role, however as this anime goes on a lot of things started to shift, example, Sion is strting to look like that he is the villain, question is whether  he is the main or the secondary antagonist. Also, I kinda wonder as to what role does Keifer Knolles will play in the last few episodes and whether Ryner should side with Gastark  empire instead  or stay in Roland with the possibility of being killed by Sion.\\n\\n\r\n-There is a side mystery as to what Sion has entered into, which may indicate that he may have gotten what he had bargain for with Lucile Eris.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: #8\\n\\n\r\n- The conclusion is just a few more episode to watch out for.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: #8\\n\\n\r\n-If there will be a season 2 of this anime, it'll be sure be fun to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTrivia: The legend of King Arthur came way back before the middle ages, it is said that the legnd came around during the collapse of the Roman Empire.\\n\\n\r\nThe wizard Merlin, King Arther's friend was said to have really existed in real life, but not as a  person with magical powers, but as a Celtic druid who led numerous rebellion against the roman occupation of Britannia, now the UK.     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

And mostly it has turned into either ignores or disklikes.\r\nWhich is cool, that's to be expected when you're criticizing something that people like.\r\nI'll try to be very succinct here.\r\nStory:  Ultimately this show felt like a slice of bread hoisted from the middle of the loaf.  After watching, I asked myself \"was there a point to this?\"\r\nEnjoyment? Emotional reaction?  Attachment?  I'm not too sure, but what i do know was that it really filled me with dread.Some of the most unbelievably cruel and heinous things occur in this show all in the backdrop of comedic relief.  It was incredibly jarring.  One minute there is laughter, the next their is something super brutal, then immediately there is more laughter.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to some this show up it would be tragedy and meager, meager hope.  Which brings me to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI thought, clearly, it was the strongest aspect of the show.  Better character writing in an anime?  I'm not sure i could name something better.  There were cliches ofc, but so offset by the grim realities of the world that it automatically took on depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound and Art were all pretty good, sound was forgettable, but went well with what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, I'm not sure who to reccomend this to; it was charming and funny alot of the time, but also unforgiving.  The twists and turns are not gentle.  It really throws you around all over the place.  Let's say that if you really liked Elfen Lied, which i gave the same score to, then you'll probably find something interesting here.  If your looking to get your heart warmed or a touch of the feels, well then you should probably run away never to return.",

I saw this on Netflix and thought I'd give it a go after enjoying the first half of Sword Art Online. \r\nThe pacing on this show was very inconsistent and the animation was pretty lackluster. What really killed the show for me was the dialogue. I can't think of something I've watched with worse dialogue. It sounded like reading old X-Men comics out loud where characters would say what their powersdid each time they used them whenever characters used magic \"I offer this contract to the god of blah blah blah.\" I don't know why I watched 13 episodes but I couldn't force myself to go on.",

            "content": "Legends of Legendary Heroes might be a enjoyable show if you find it early in your anime life. After that, it goes downhill fast. There's nothing in this show I haven't seen before. The characters are very bad, the writing is equally as terrible, and the action is rather poor. \r\nThe story is centered around a protag who is having a tragic backstory competition with everyone he meets.  The story doesn't really go anywhere. In 24 episodes we discover the actual plot in the very last episode. Kinda late to do anything with right? This is a anime adaptation. It was not adapted tobe watchable. A mediocre story line, that barely finds its ass with both hands and a map, is only serviceable if the other elements make up for it. They did not.\\n\\n\r\nArt is art. \\n\\n\r\nIt had sound. I remember that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters? I don't really have anything that fits that description in the show. There were these talking things that reused the same dialogue and jokes about 1000 times, but those aren't characters. Characters are these magical things that have more than 3 responses. They also grow and learn as a result of experiences. It's a difficult concept to grasp. If done correctly characters would actually mimic humans and be relateable. \\n\\n\r\nThis is perhaps the worst 'copy character' I have ever seen. He can copy and use whatever magic he sees. That's why he uses the exact same lightning spell the entire show. Copying is suppose to be a unique ability that makes a character interesting and give them multiple ways to overcome challenges. No. Keep using the same thing. I pity the world he lives in. A world of magic, cursed by a cruel god to only have one lightning spell. The fighting is truly forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nHow am I suppose to enjoy this? Should I be laughing at the same reused jokes? I certainly didn't watch for the graphics or sounds. There's nothing here for me to like.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this is a terrible show. If you find it early in your anime life watch it so you can see all the mistakes it makes. It's possible to get some enjoyment if you haven't seen many fantasy shows.",

            "content": "For someone that didn\u00b4t really had high exponentiation for this one, boy was I in for a surprise. First of all I can say the I thought this series was great! I happen to love good action and fantasy delivered with a good soundtrack and animation. I think \"Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu\" (\"The legend of the legendary heroes\") lives up to all of that. I also think it has a lot of other qualities but I get in to them later. If you have a problem with jumpy stories this probably isn\u00b4t for you.  You should also know that this i build upfor a equally long sequel, so all the threads doesn\u00b4t connect in the end.  But let\u00b4s get to way I truly enjoyed the show. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the story. It\u00b4s not the most original story but it doesn\u00b4t have to be, it had the right components. It had many elements, it\u00b4s just one of those stories that have many aspects. Some lighter scenes with humor and some happiness but also many dark and deeper ones. As I mentioned before the stories jumps back and forth in the timeline, often to get to know the main and supporting characters and know why they are like they are. It also jumps between different characters and geographical locations to build a larger picture. The story brings up subjects like trust, friendship, betrayal, forgiveness, guilt and exclusion. And of course a little love, (i\u00b4m a sucker for that) but just to keep the story interesting, it\u00b4s not this anime base just a spice.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nOutstanding. Beautiful colors, well designed characters and class light setting. One of the better I ever seen and I seen a couple now.. Many scenes like a conversation, a sunrise or a battle really comes to life by the art work. I actually bought this one on blu ray just to see it again with great quality, the art work deserves that.   \\n\\n\r\n Sound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music and voice actors was great. I liked both openings and i think they reflect the mood change as the series progresses. I think they matched the scenes with fitting music which also supported the story. Overall i really liked the soundtrack a lot.  I watched the dubbed version (I prefer dubbed) and I think the voice actors enjoyed their work because I think they are great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThe only reason that it does not get a full 10 is that there were characters that I had wanted to see more of and more background stories on them. But overall a great character development, just what I would have expected from a show that is build on a light novel that was still ongoing at the time. I really liked the main characters Ryner Lute and Ferris Eris. The are forced to team up and work together. They don\u00b4t care much for each other in the beginning but to see the how dynamic between them change through out the series is really great. \\n\\n\r\nRyner appears to be a very lazy and clumsy mage who only cares about his next nap and Ferris appears to be an abnormally skilled sociopathic swords woman that only care about dongos (a kind of sweets), but there is a lot more about them then the first appearance. King Sion is a very complex character, which will be clear as the story progresses. It\u00b4s a lot of interesting supporting characters as well, like the kings closets associates and their enemies. Thought is also put into the \"villains\", whom all have there own reasons to do what they do. The clear line between good and evil that easily slip into this kind of anime is enjoyably absent. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoy the hell out of my self watching this one. I really liked that I didn\u00b4t now where the show was going, with twist and turns. The combination of great art work,  nice setting music, good plot and interesting characters really pulled me in. I should mention that \"Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu\" fits all my favorite genres, so if this is not your favorites it\u00b4s a chance that you will not agree with me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nOverall I loved it! If it was possible to give it 9,5 i would. The only reason that \"Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu\" not reaches a full 10 is  is that the second sequel hasn\u00b4t come out get as anime and may not never come. But anyway a great show. I will definitely watching this again. I think this show highly under rated.",

Sadly, it was the only anime that looked interesting on there, so I watched it. And I have to say, it was really amazing. \r\nStory (9): Just watching the first episode will get you interested in the anime, though the plot they give you is sort of misleading, but still good (watch and you'll understand what I mean). The way the story plays out is really gripping and by the end, it'll seriously have you griping for a season two.\r\nArt (9): Theart's great.

            "content": "Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu or Legend of the Legendary Heroes is overall mediocre at best. While the story and characters do make it seem like there should be much potential in series, there is very little resolution or even major conflict, for that matter. Most of the time is spent on introducing the characters and political motives of the kingdoms involved. Perhaps the production was planning on a 52 episode long series in which the plot would quickly build up to something more meaningful. After even 24 episodes, I feel that the pacing is much slower than expected. There is a mix between episodesthat are filled with action and adventure and others that are more slice of life. This being said. The main plot of the story only picks up in the last couple of episodes of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe technical aspects such as animation and sound are more than acceptable. The main draw for me, personally, would be the voice actor, Jun Fukuyama, who plays the main character Ryner Lute. He is well known for other such roles including Lelouche Lamperouge from Code Geass. Watching a series solely for a voice actor/actress might be foolish to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nI feel that Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu should be much better than it is. It is also rated much higher than it should be as well. The premise should much promise, though the pacing and direction of the series could have been done in a more effective way in the 24 episodes it was allotted. Sources such as ratings or sales might be the main cause for the production being cut short.",

            "content": "I. Stale Battle-System:\r\nIn the first episode, you'll be seeing some fancy moves done by Eris, the blonde girl, and some flashy magic done by Ryner, the main character who is a mage, but this isn't really where the show shines. The show sort of keeps on misleading you, and I'm not just talking about the title. In the beginning of the episode, your taken into a battle scene where Ryner shows of his calculating prowess. But really, He only showcased this ability on the first battle. Most of the following fight scenes is basically him activating the same old spells: \"speed\", \"lighting\" and some otherminor things. It's actually quite repetitive when you remove his final resort, the old \"destruction mode\", which your going to understand if you watch. But again, combat wise, it's not so good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nII. In-depth Characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are possibly one of the best things about this anime. It's what makes a seinen a seinen. Well, to me, anyways. \\n\\n\r\n-Ryner\\n\r\nWhat is so \"deep\" about Ryner? The guy basically doesn't know what to do(at first). It's not because he's incompetent, he's plenty smart. He experiences thought struggles about what to do with oh so destructive world around him. What he really wants is to take a nap. What should a guy who likes to takes nap do? He also dwells into some interesting philosophical thoughts such as when he divides people into two: the standby people(which he identifies with) and the people who want to do things. It's interesting because he'll eventually go along with a latter type of guy. Then, there's his \"destructive mode\" problem. By actually engaging in combat, he runs the risk of killing people. And then, there's this \"Naruto-hated by everyone problem\". This guy has so many things wrapped in his head and he'll continue to get wrapped as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\n-Eris\\n\r\nEris is what some people refer to as a \"Kuudere\", if you're familiar with the word. If not, it's basically an almost emotionless female. Clever, Self-Confident, Pompous, and self-declared \"Beauty\".(lol) Don't get her wrong. Eris is quite a deep character as well. After she teams up with Ryner, she begins to start to initiate these sort of \"clever pretend games\" with Ryner. Of course, Ryner just goes along. When you think about it, it's actually quite interesting that she's doing this. I mean, although cold and straightforward, she also displays herself as random and playful. Another facet of her is that she seems to bond with Ryner almost too well. Her peculiarities(dango) does not prevent her from doing work of course. She understands situations quickly and initiate swiftly with her sword.\\n\\n\r\n-Sion\\n\r\nPretty in-depth as well. By that, I'm mainly talking about his moral-ambiguity. He is ambitious, unlike Ryner, and being him is like standing on a pedestal. There are too many sides to fall on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIII. Boring Setting:\\n\\n\r\nOne can't really pay attention much to the setting as there's not much out of the ordinary. It's basically your old medieval-magical period. There are powerful artifacts, which can be used as deterrent against war or can also be used to promote war. There are many countries and the world is engulfed in suffering. Ryner and his friends are victims.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIV. Plain Story:\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of lacking originality. Individuals rising within an empire, and from an empire, save the world. \\n\\n\\n\r\nV. Thought-provoking General Themes:\\n\\n\r\n\"Saving The World\" is usually an interesting idea since it involves so much complexity in terms of morality and society. It's also a very big idea.\\n\\n\r\n\"A Benevolent War\". There are many sides in the conflict. Some are simply led by corrupt rulers while other rulers actually wants peace...but at what cost? through war?\\n\\n\r\n\"From Destruction comes Creation\". Sort of Like Ryner. ;)\\n\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say it's a pretty good anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I realize this is in contrast to many of the reviews of this series, but I really loved this anime. At first I thought it was something generic, filled with b-roll action scenes but something about it made me watch the next episode, and then there was a little something more that intrigued me, and so on and so on, until by the final episode I was fascinated. But let's rewind. \r\nThe relationship between the two main characters, Ryner and Ferris, I thought was perfect. One of the reasons this anime might not have universal appeal is because people have different psychology on relationships. Evenstill, Ryner and Ferris are like perfect forces of Yin and Yang, each has what the other is missing, each are equally important to one another, and each have quirky characteristics that make them so uniquely special. When you watch a show, and you fall in love with the main characters as they fall in love with each other, and you are happy to watch the show, just to watch them be together, plot or no plot, then that show is amazing. I thought this show did that for me, and I hope it does it for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe third main character, adds a dynamic and powerful force to this story. King Sion is how great kings should be portrayed. He is inspiring at every turn, with perfect mental undersight of every current affair, his courage and intellect make you feel protected, and his beautiful and loving nature make you feel proud to have him as a king. Yet he also has a genuine character that makes him, him! He's not emotionless, he has bold and heroic dreams, and stays true to heart. I really got a sense of these things as the story unfolded, which was achieved in no small part due to great writing, awesome character illustration, and excellent voice acting. Also, his actions were not for the sake of adding excitement to keep the viewer hooked. That's a path where most anime's falter. But not this one. His actions were highly logical and in sync with his character throughout. The same goes for each of the characters in this series. \\n\\n\r\nI already mentioned that the relationship between Ryner and Ferris was enough to make me watch this anime regardless of plot. But what makes this series so excellent, in my opinion, is that it actually has an incredible plot. Even transcending into the realm of the metaphysical with divine creatures and demons, then tying it back in perfect conjunction to the central plot. \\n\\n\r\nI heard this series was influenced by Berserk, and after watching it, yes, there are definitely many of the same elements. Both are awesome, but Legend of the Legendary Heroes has some important assets that Berserk does not. To name a few, the character development has more meaning, the love between the two main characters has better dynamics, and the ending is better handled in LLH. (I have to question the ending in Berserk, which took things to an incredible pitch, however it wasn't the way I would have liked things to end). Berserk does have MUCH better action scenes and stronger maturity level, which adds an important layer of meaning. If LLH had Berserk's maturity and gripping action scenes it would be the best anime I've ever scene, hands down. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, I would recommend Berserk for people who like the more serious, mature animes, and LLH for people who don't mind a few silly moments in exchange for so much greatness.",

            "content": "\"Huh? What? I don't get it\" was my reaction to the ending of this confusing, yet enjoyable series. After much speculation, I was able to vaguely understand the ending. What does this mean? It most likely means that I'm stupid, or The Legend of the Legendary Heroes made itself a lot more confusing than it needed to be. I'm leaning towards the latter. However, if you want to be a dick about it, then it'd be the first one.  Anyways, besides the uh... intriguing(?) story, I enjoyed this series quite a lot. It just goes to show that you don't really NEED to knowwhat's going on (although it would be helpful) in order to enjoy a series.      \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that caught my attention was the artwork. In almost every single episode, the visuals were like eye candy. In fact, this was a big reason why I decided to stick with it in the first place. No, there were no crazy 3D effects that popped out at the viewer and gave them a boner. However, the lighting, angles, and its ability to create its own tone and atmosphere were all aspects that are very hard to find in other anime you see today. Why is that? Well, unlike other studios, Zexcs decided that 3D effects were NOT the only way to make the visuals enjoyable. And boy, were they right. Overall, the art was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound? Hmm...I can't really remember. Oh, right! That's because I tried erasing it from my brain due to its repetitiveness. In some scenes, the music didn't even match the atmosphere. The visuals were on a completely different level while the sound was produced by an elementary school band (no offense to you young'uns). During certain scenes with Ryner and Ferris happily cracking jokes at each other, ominous music would begin playing. Now normally, you'd expect something BAD to happen sometime soon. But in The Legend of the Legendary Heroes, it happened about 50% of the time. This was extremely misleading to me and therefore it ruined the mood that it had so successfully established through its visuals. Boohoo.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I can't say that the characters looked ridiculous, because then I'd be lying to you (except for Sion, he just looked like a woman). But what is it with these people and their wide range of hair colors? Do they dye their hair at a young age or are they from different countries? I have no idea. Apparently, in Roland, you can have blonde, red, white, or brown hair. Now, I don't know about you, but that sounds awesome to me! I'll take the zebra stripes. Hair color aside, the characters were all developed quite well. Each one had a decent backstory, and it was quite a joy to watch. Although, they COULD have had childhoods in which their families WEREN'T completely murdered or in which they were orphans. But I guess I shouldn't complain...too much. One thing that was quite bothersome was the sudden transition to flashbacks. In the middle of a fight, Ryner would have flashbacks and at one point, took up an entire half of an episode. Now, really? In the middle of a fight? What was the opponent doing the ENTIRE time Ryner was spacing out? Drinking tea? Reading the paper? If I were going against a guy with an Alpha Stigma, which apparently allows him to BEAT the living shit out of you, I'd definitely go for any opening. I don't know, that's just me. Anyways, characters were decent and I appreciated the time spent animating these flashbacks. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this? Hell yeah I did. In fact, It was one of the best anime (in my opinion) in the season. The humor was consistent, and although I have not read the light novel, the story seemed to be faithful to its original. Although I was utterly confused by the story, and completely annoyed by the sound, the breathtaking artwork and the dynamic characters were pluses. Seeing Ferris be able to feel emotions and express deeper feelings for Ryner was a good sight, and seeing Ryner be less of an emo was relieving. If this series were to have a sequel, you bet your pennies (is that even a phrase?) that I'll be watching it.",

            "content": "Awww, my first review.... Please Bear With Me   \r\n Whenever someone ask me to recommend an anime that has the genre of magic + adventure. The first thing that comes across my mind is most definitely The Legend of the Legendary Heroes AKA (LOLH). \r\nStory: 9/10\r\n   Set in an alternate universe, the story of LOLH is about a young man named Ryner along with a hot girl names Ferris was sent to retrieve the \"ALMIGHTY HERO'S RELICS\" by the command of the King of Roland Astal Sino. As they were searching forthe relics, they need to venture out the country and as the story progresses, we get to see the darker side of the world, the cruelty of the society. Of course, the anime isn't all about the protagonist searching for some random relics. We get to see the backgrounds of the characters, especially Ryner; for his childhood was miserable and through series we get to see him overcome trauma.\\n\r\n   However, the story ain't perfect. There are a lot of plot holes and things left unexplained. Well, thats what Zexcs gets when they try to squeeze a 30vol+ light novel series into a 24 episode anime. Besides, they could have not follow everything in the original material and using only a proportion of the material and add something on it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\n   The art of this anime isn't awe striking or ultra realistic like Kotonoha no Niwa. But it'd done it's job probably, to get enough details in it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\n   Awww, I love the openings of LOLH. It is one of my favourite openings. Anyway, the soundtrack matched with the animation, pretty well. It is good enough to bring out the atmosphere of the scenes. It's done a pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\n   Background story of the characters were nicely written, with good amount of details in it. Ryner has the most complicated background of all. His mysterious background brought up the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n   It has a wonderful setting, great characters with enough comedy and little bit of romance in it. With some odd/funny side characters to bring up the atmosphere. This anime is very very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is an underrated anime. Very few really know this anime well. It has a wonderful yet, somewhat complicated story. It is one my favourite animes of all time. If you have never heard of this anime, you really should check this out. You won't regret it. Overall (9/10)\\n",

            "content": "This was one of the most disappointing anime i have ever watched. So if you have read the synopsis you already know what its about but trust me it is not worth the time. An anime that is under the fantasy or adventure genre should have a great plot with likeable characters; unfortunately this anime did not. The best thing about it was the art because there was a lot of colour and the art style was ok i guess. The next best was sound because i dont know how bad sound can be to be honest. And now i come to the bad bit.\r\nTheanime started off pretty good, i quite liked Ryner Lute even if he had a very common, predictable personality. The idea about Alpha Stigmas wasn't bad but for me the story didn't stick with the simple concept that alpha stigmas are feared and disliked by everyone. Instead it followed a very boring approach and focused on politics of the country and Sion. The story didn't improve at all throughout and then towards the end it didn't even make sense to me. And I know that i wasn't too stupid to understand but for the last 3/4 episodes I didn't even know what was going on.\\n\\n\r\n I thought Ryner Lute was ok but the other two pissed me off so much. Ferris had nothing likeable about her she was rude and grumpy and in my opinion was a waste of space. If Ryner Lute was more powerful she wouldn't be needed at all. She always called him a pervert and I think it was a sorry attempt of humour that had been done 10 times better in other anime. She just annoyed me a lot. Then there is Sion who's personality was like an old man for most of it. There were at least 15 other side characters who i either didn't know the name of or though were just average.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of all these faults that I have pointed out I hated this anime.",

            "content": "You've all probably heard the quote \"Monsters are not born, monsters are made\". Well, if I should describe this anime in only one sentence, then I'd definitely use this quote. It's an action, adventure, fantasy and magic anime produced by Lantis and  Media Factory. With a score of 7.85 it is ranked 745 on My Anime List. \r\n   Plot and Story Line  \r\nWhen you look at the title of this anime, you'd most probably think that it is all about some amazing legends of some strong heroes from the past and so did I, but it came different. It was allfantasy, action and adventure but it was not nearly as good as expected. Thing is, what I thought would be a story about legends and stuff, was more a story about \"monsters\" that were created by humans them selves. Those monsters posses the \"Alpha Stigma\"- eyes that can analyze any type of magic but to the world they are better known as cursed eyes that bring destruction and death. \\n\r\nOne of those Alpha Stigma bearers is our protagonist, Ryner Lute. In a corrupt world, controlled by the nobles in each kingdom, Ryner became a talented mage being once a student of the Roland Empires's Magician Academy. In time, his best friend Sion Astal becomes the king of the Roland Empire and together they decide to fight against the evil in the world. \\n\r\nThe part about the legends is set in Ryner's mission. He goes on a journey together with Ferris Eris, to collect relics of the legendary heroes. They do find a couple of relics, but you never hear the story or the legend behind it. That sure was a disappointment for me because I was really looking forward to all the legends. From the title you'd think that the legends make up the main story line, but they are more some plot-filling adds. Only in the end, one episode centers the Legend that reveals the truth behind Ryner's Alpa Stigma, but that one comes kinda out of nowhere and just ends in a huge plot hole. It just confused all the things I thought I understood before. \\n\r\nEven tough they kinda mixed up the title-story thing, The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is still a good anime. The main story line follows the Alpha Stigma users and their destiny as monsters. As said in the intro, it gives a clear message about how monsters are created and later feared and accused by humans.  It is really interesting how the anime portrayed  the real world in such a fantasy anime setting. Thumbs up for that one.\\n\r\nThe story also doesn't lack in intrigue, drama, romance and amazing action scenes. A lot of side and background stories are woven into the anime's story. You get to know  lot of characters and even tough they are just supporting characters, you learn about their past, their feelings, hopes etc. It really did a great thing when it comes to that. \\n\\n\r\nStill the major problem I had with this anime is the, let's call it, \"plot structure\". The anime has a lot of plot holes, forced happenings and some unexplained happenings that come out of nowhere. A possible solution for that would be a second season because the anime hasn't finished with the end of the first season. But there is no sign of a second one and considering the fact that the anime aired in 2010, I wouldn't say that there is a second season planed. I guess 6 years would be enough of they wanted to. \\n\\n\r\n   Characters   \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are amazing. So many different, and so many interesting personalities at one place. This is one of the rare anime whose characters deserve to be described in detail, but each and every. Moreover, there is not a single character that I didn't like. They were really amazing. Besides, all those personalities contributed to the anime's overall appearance. As I mentioned above, the story is formed in a way you get to know each character and I found that great. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character was definitely Ferris Eris. I've always liked strong and independent female characters. In addition to that she is so unique and funny, but also caring and nice. On the other hand, our protagonist Ryner Lute is a lazy, good-for-nothing, yet strong when needed. He is obsessed with afternoon naps and always tries to find a wayout of his obligations and problems.\\n\\n\r\n   Animation and Style   \\n\\n\r\nAs expected from a 2010 anime, it's animation is not a big deal. It is okay and watchable. Nice colors, smooth movements and the way they illustrated the spells was also good. The style has nothing special. In one word-average. \\n\\n\r\n   Conclusion    \\n\\n\r\nThe Legend of the Legendary Heroes is a good and watchable anime. It does have a couple of flaws firstly in the story and in the plot in general but amazing characters made it enjoyable to watch, especially when it comes to the all the drama around them. Bad thing is that the magic actually wasn't in the front of the story since I was really looking forward to it. In the end, I liked it enough to give it a score 8/10, meaning you should check it out.",

            "content": "Overall \r\nlegend of legendary heroes disappointed me right outside the gate, with its ill-timed humour, gratuitous violence and unoriginal character constructs. legend of legendary heroes may have taken place at a fictional country at a fictional time, but of course we all know it's based on some form of European culture...because that's what most of their animes are based on. this show disappointed me because it had the potential to be so much better given the fact that the source material is a freakin novel. but it relied on so many anime cliches that it did more harm than good. not to mention the storytellingand art were both lazy and predictable. \\n\r\nAudio\\n\r\nthe first season OP theme song was a very generic anime song, nothing to remember nothing to celebrate. same could be said for the first season ending theme song, but I have a feeling I may have liked it if it weren't for those corny images of the suffering children. that was just too much of an anime stereotype plus I don't like having my emotions toyed with. so its a no for the first season's open and closing theme songs....actually I couldn't give a shit about any of the songs. I watched the series in english dub, I would say they did a mediocre job. all of the lolitas voices were high pitched and annoying, so I guess that could either be a good thing or a bad thing. the best voice definitely belonged to, Miran Froaude. aristocratic with a hint of villainy. \\n\r\nVisuals \\n\r\nthe art is nice, it's what drew me to the title in the first place. but I wouldn't say it's the best art I've seen in anime. not by a long shot. plus the art doesn't quite do what it's supposed to do, which is to capture the scenes as they might have been depicted in the novels. example: the scenes that are supposed to suggest opulence such as the palace parties, look bland; the scenes that are supposed to suggest the gruesomeness of war also look equally as bland. I also think the series relied too heavily on dramatic lighting..excessive soft glows, special effects glows, glitters and streaky shadows abound. the animation was pitiful considering the day and age and all the technological resources we have at our fingertips now, so there's no reason for the animation to have been as jumpy or as jittery as it was in some scenes. gratuitous scenes of violence are also rife throughout this series and it's pretty obvious why: to serve more as a plot diversion, cuz the storytelling sucks, shock value and to boost ratings, because everyone respects bloody anime, but also it was used as an animation shortcut. one swipe with a blade and 5 people just a rip open like packets of ketchup, with blood splattering everywhere especially on the camera lens so you don't have to draw anything else...cheap trick. \\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nthe story and then the characters were the biggest let down. there was just something not very \"true\" about this story: not very genuine. I can appreciate it being an anime, I can appreciate it been a fantasy anime, but it just doesn't come off as a very genuine story. I can't help but wonder if the comedic elements in the light novel were just as disjointed....and tacky. in one scene we have people's heads being cut off with blood splattering everywhere, and then right next to that you have some b**** eating dango on a stick or some whiny high pitched Lolita (and there are several lolitas in this) in pigtails go on and on about why she loves her big sister. in what universe or reality does this seem possible, or even logical? I will say that it is the serious side of this anime that has kept me interested. I do like the general idea of a corrupted monarchy, greedy heirs at each others throats, kingdoms at war, political intrigue and all that other good stuff. but it's that f****** weird goofy comedy that absolutely doesn't fit! who finds repeatedly abusive behavior funny? \\n\r\nthe overall theme(s) of the story is annoying, it doesn't help that the perspective and the narration are constantly being switched around between 3 or 4 different people. is it a story about the survival of a nation or a story about self discovery? perhaps a story about the pursuit of dreams? is it a love story or is it just a simple story about a quest to collect ancient relics? the problem is, can't really use that \"all of the above\" option unless you also want to accept that it's an over-inflated, over-ambitious, piece of shit douchebag anime series. Plus we already have much better anime out there that's already doing the \"Multifaceted\" swiss army knife thing. And you can't just shrug your shoulders and say hey that's just anime. we have enough anime out there that's already doing the \"Senseless anime\" thing.  But it's pretty obvious that the first option is exactly what this anime is trying to achieve. however it fails at accomplishing this, mainly for two reasons that I can see: 1, the majority of characters are walking cliches, not enough back story is given to these 2d characters to bind them to these roles you actually need them to portray (how does the bastard son of a concubine become king? ) And then 2, the widely varying emotional tones swinging from deadly serious to goofy slapstick. just because it's in anime. there's a reason why anime has different genres; each genre has it's own type of humour style and message and what's being emotionally required of the audience cannot all come from one anime. just all lumped in together and have it make sense. that's like saying you're gonna eat: tuna salad, chocolate, tofu, mackerel and cheese with a red wine all because they are edible and therefore you can. but does it sound like a pleasurable experience? no. \\n\r\nand do not get me started on what ever the fuck those last few episodes were supposed to be about? some sort of wanna be shakespeare macbeth, king lear shit, with all these internal dialogues.....no, just no. \\n\r\ncharacters \\n\r\nthe characters annoy me. yes they're beautiful, yes they're bishounen but they're very two-dimensional. which is a surprise to me, given the very rich resource that these characters were drawn from, a fuckin novel! I'm not gonna go through all of the characters of the series but I am gonna talk about the main ones and why they annoy me. the boy or the main character, has an overwhelmingly strong power, but of course he has a personality that undermines that, because no one likes a cocky protagonist! so of course he's incredibly meek or incredibly shy, or very clumsy and in this case he's very lazy. needless to say when the appropriate time comes, he snaps out of it, he uses his incredible magic and he saves the day. \\n\r\nthe blonde woman instantly made me want to gag. she has blonde hair and blue eyes....so of course this means she's beautiful (insert gagging noise here... ) and of course she carries the sword, because she's the one with the penis envy and needs to carry some phallic weapon. the second part of her penis envy is evident by her unnecessarily abusive behaviour towards the males. is this supposed to be comedy? because I don't find it funny. is it supposed to hide the fact that he is infinitely stronger than she is? I hope not, since we already know from the first episode this isn't the case. and why isn't she fat? all she ever does is sit there chowing down on some dango which was funny maybe 3 out of the 5000 times they attempted the same lame dango joke.\\n\r\nthe gay king is also equally as annoying, once again another two dimensional character who's been given a flimsy background story: bastard child, some sort of abuse or neglect, magically becomes king of the country. I say he's gay because he doesn't seem to have any interest in any other person except the lead male character and some never ending piles of paperwork. and I'm sure he's written that way on purpose so that we can have all these innuendos throughout the series.... for the fangirls. yes I'd say that I am probably the most disappointed in this character. because the more serious and deeper elements of the story seems to come from his perspective. but for whatever reason the anime did not want to focus only on the serious side, they wanted shit to be light and goofy...and that's why the story sucked. did we even get to find out who killed the vassel? because I have a feeling the king did it himself. \\n\r\nverdict \\n\r\nI'd say 4 maybe a 5...because conceptually it was a good story, but then again would credit go to the anime or to the original novel? I guess the anime, because it did capture the original concept, it was just poorly executed. the comedy was repetitive and disastrous, the violence and gore were gimmicky. the serious elements were left unexplored and the pathos seemed both preachy and trite at the same time.",

And I know, because I have seen alot of anime.\r\nDensetsu_no_Yuusha_no_Densetsu A.K.A The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is a perfect exemple for telling people :\"Do not jigje a book by it's cover\". And for our case, it would be : \"Do not judge an anime by it's absolutly ridiculous name\".\r\nHonestly, when I came across this I was all like :\"W.T.F This name is pathetic, ridiculous, geeky, overly pretensious and frankly it really sounds like the people whi thought of the name had NO imagination.\r\nBuuuuuut, everybody has moments where the are so borred thateven an anime with a dumb name sounds watchable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd honestly after a few \u00e9pisodes I felt like I had found an anime gold mine.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why, first off, the characters, each and every character was gorgeous (I'm not kidding) EVERYBODY!!! (yep, even the old people, but I suppose to acctually find them hot, you need to be an old man or an old lady yourself, xD.). And for the most part ALL the main and supporting characters were just lovable, I seriously wanted to go Inside my laptop to join them and become there friends!\\n\\n\r\nthen, the art, of course it goes with a character design but also, the backgrounds, one second you would find yourself on a beutifull mountain, the next in a mysterious forest, it was very very very good.\\n\\n\r\nafterwords would come the music, lovely!\\n\r\nThe character voices, well at least in English dubbed were very good, full of emotions, TRUE TALENT (once more, I am not kidding).\\n\\n\r\nTrully I loved it, but it must be said, the story was very sad, it wasen't a feild of roses and butterflies, it was cruel, but however, they had times when it was so funny I bursted out laughing, and then when it became sad again, I wanted to cry.\\n\\n\r\nSo here's this, so like it's the story of this Young guy called Ryner Lute, he was treated like a demon ever since he was litle and he kept closing himself up and acting normal when he was clearly lonely. But ever since he met Ferris Eris and Sion Astal, he was able to know what friends feel like. Him and Ferris have adventures and Sion became King and gave them a mission to find heroe relics (or something like that), but shortly after ....... (HAHAHA! you thought I was gonna tell what happen?! Well NO, I'm not gonna spoil you guys, but still it is definitly Worth watching).\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I hate about THIS anime was the cliff hanger ending! Seriously, like W.T.F happened?! The show was godl perfect and then they forgot to add just 1 episode, I swear, all could have been done in 1 episode is they had just done it! I guess this leaves room for a thousand fanfics because it is now the only way for me to live in peace now, the show was to great for me to just give up on it just now.\\n\\n\r\nMy advice to you all is : \"WATCH THIS SHOW\"...You are going to love it.",

The story is about an Alpha stigma bearer, Rynner who partner up with Ferris- an incredibly sword-women to look for the Hero Relic  and go through a lot of hardship~....( if you wanna know what is it, watch it please), it had touched moment in the anime that make you wanted to cry (and so i did x.x) so the story is just fit to get a 10 from me~\\n\\n\r\n      Art, Sound : 9- 8\\n\r\n   The art in the anime is pretty, since i dont like the shota type of animation picture, and it's better than average, the background is also great so a good 9 will be receiving for art.And the sound for the anime is very good, although it seemed to be a little sad..... 8 would be enough.\\n\\n\r\n    Characters, Enjoyment: 10\\n\r\n  The characters in DnYnD is simply funny and nice, Rynner is a guy who like to sleep all day long and sometime is very sad because people calling him monster( he aware of it himself too), he surely developed feeling for Ferris, and yep~~ Ferris is the bullying, only for Rynner though, she love to eat dango all the time, she also like Rynner ( she didnt realize it herself >",

            "content": "This show's story is set in a quasi-medieval period that ties in kings and knights with magic and unknown mysteries. If that's the sort of thing you're into, this anime definitely gets interesting.\r\nStarting early on in the series, we come to understand that the protagonist is someone very special. While people in this world get trained in the use of various types of magic, a specially-born person with something called an alpha stigma can immediately copy any spell they see. But on top of that, when pushed too far, this person can go berserk and unleash utter havoc on both friend and foe. That's theburden Ryner Lute has to wrestle with throughout his soul-searching journey, and one that his friends struggle at times to contend with.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, the kingdom that Ryner lives in is one of typical social injustice as per the caste system. His friend, Sion Astal, seeks to change all that by becoming king from the ground up, a goal he accomplishes but then decidedly comes to odds with in his unending, escalating efforts to make the world a better place. The story unfolds between these two focal points, with superb dialogue fit for the age.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are both decently well done. There are a lot of action scenes with plenty of violence and bloodshed. But scenery can fall flat and be generally uninteresting, and I would have liked seeing more of a variety of outfits on characters, especially considering that most of the ones we focus on are higher-up sort of people. The sound isn't terrible, but it does lack in faculty during battles. It gets pretty bad during the largest action scenes, where it feels like none of the explosions pack any sort of punch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are all very well done though. Ryner comes with a lot of depth surrounding his monstrous circumstance that pits him in a precarious position. He wants to be with people, but at the same time fears that he may harm them or that they may consider him just a beast to be killed. His companion Ferris, however, seems mixed but really pulls through to help show him that she's a true friend. Most of the time, she just calls him a pervert, and dreams up wild imaginings of him impregnating anyone he touches or teaching any young kid he speaks to the wicked ways of perversion. She's also monstrously obsessed with dango. But she cares more for him than she cares to admit. Sion, the other main focus, goes through a lot on the throne, which gets him in the end. Many of the supporting cast get some back story interlaced through the story, but there are still characters left out which could've used more supporting history.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was pretty easy to watch! Everything was enjoyable till the end, which definitely felt rushed. It's also unfortunate that 4 years after this series aired, we still don't have a second season. Fair warning: a great story, with interesting characters and interesting building, but a bad cliffhanger ending that just begs for more. Things are just starting to really heat up by the time the end rolls around, and then it all stops.",

            "content": "Quick note before I begin: All parts will be graded and then added up to make up a final score out of ten. I will grade out of sound, animation, story, characters, and personal enjoyment. I'm sorry if all this seems vague, but I have not watched this anime for about two years. Also there is no selection to rate the story here, but I will add it in here anyway.\r\nBetter way to read the review: https://sloaneranime.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/review-the-legend-of-legendary-heroes\r\nSound\r\nI'll start with sound. I am a fan of both of the openings, although I think the second one is my favorite of the two. Both endings are alsovery elegant and calming, and the first is my favorite. The sound track is more or less typical of kingdom animes such as these, but at the same time that is not a bad thing. The various, sometimes very gory sound affects are just okay, not amazing. The voice acting is good. I think I watched the series in dub, and the voices fit well. I watched some clips of the sub and that also seems to be well done.\\n\r\nScore: 1.5\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nNext up is the animation. When considering how to grade this, you have to take into account both the art style and the age of the anime. Since TLLH is an older anime and was made in a era of transition (between digital background/effects and draw), the background is pretty bad most of the time. I\u2019m not going to say it is better than it is\u2026 The art style is pretty typical, but fits the content and style of the anime quite well. The effects for Ryner\u2019s special ability do not disappoint.\\n\r\nThe depiction of death is dealt will in a way that is pretty brutal, but certainly not as brutal as it could be. I find it to be somewhat artistic, although some may consider it a form of censorship. The normal fight scenes are decent. I like how a lot of it is drawn (including horses might I add!) The animation overall doesn\u2019t take away from the anime, but actually makes the anime better. Despite it\u2019s age, the animation is solid. \\n\r\nScore: 1.4\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe storyline of TLLH is not the most clear, but still magnates to keep it together. The premise itself is not very unique, but the progression throughout the series is what helps to differentiate the anime from others. Also the synopsis given on MAL gives the series absolutely no justice. Despite this, the story itself is well developed, especially by the characters. The paths that the main characters follow make sense, and the flashbacks flow smoothly with the main story line. On the other hand, some of the side characters seem to be poorly worked into the anime (they would seemingly appear out of no where).  Overall, the story is not very memorable (obviously), but the series makes up this in other areas. \\n\r\nScore: 1.2\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI think the characters are easily the strongest part of the anime. The main characters are incredibly well developed through a combination of flashbacks and influential events. First I will talk about Ryner, the holder of a legendary power called the Alpha Stigma. Ryner is a somewhat  atypical main protagonist. He is seemingly unmotivated, yet possesses a great deal of skill for the magical arts. Ryner is unique because he fears his power more than any other character in the series. I think Ryner is one of the stronger leads in anime, as he carries the series very nicely and maintains his unique character. Ryner's past with Sion and journey with Ferris are the main focus of the anime. Sion is a (more or less) childhood friend of Ryner's. The two of them make a pack, agreeing that Ryner would do all that he can to help Sion take the thrown and dominate the country. Sion is a very calm and collected character. He is also very loyal to Ryner's, and saves his life on a number of occasions. Sion also helps bring Ryner and Ferris together. Ferris is somewhat blunt, but also pretty sweet deep down. Ferris is a sword wielding badass with a passion for dango and a unique past. The low-key romance between Ryner and Ferris helps TLLH to have light and humorous moments amongst the action and death filled moments.The side characters are also pretty enjoyable, and don't steal the show by any means. I like the red haired right hand man to Sion, Claugh. I also like the pink haired guy with the big sword, Riphal. Raven (Miran) is also a very interesting character, as he is caught in between his loyalty to Sion and Ryner. The antagonists of the series are forgettable, but serve their role just fine overall. \\n\r\nScore: 1.7\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment of the series is one that is greatly influenced by nostalgia, as TLLH was one of the first anime I have ever watched. I really liked the contrast between the military, magic, and adventure sides of the anime. I only wished that the ending was finished off a bit better.\\n\r\nScore:   1.6\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 7.4\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend the series to fan of action, supernatural, fantasy, and military.\\n\r\nI would consider this a must-watch for fans of Kingdom animes. Another great Kingdom anime is Arslan Senki.",

            "content": "If I watch one more anime that spends a season building up tons of epic story arcs and gets discontinued one more time... I'm going to have a LEGENDARY breakdown. To quickly summarize, the anime does an excellent job of getting you excited and into the story. Tons of arcs are introduced and you can just tell the story is going to be great. Now the problems... I sure hope you're able to read Japanese because the light novel is the only way you're going to get any sort of conclusion.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThe story is complex, convoluted, confusing at times, but has all the markings tobe epic. They chose to introduce way too many story lines and leave a lot of them fairly undeveloped as of the end of the anime. I think they put all of their eggs into the season 2 basket, because there was so much left in the air or unexplained that you can't possibly be left with a good feeling as a viewer.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very good. I enjoyed the characters and fight sequences. There wer some funny gifable moments as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound was OK. Nothing too memorable but it does it's job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis one is tricky. Some characters are given quite a bit of development, while others have confusing back stories and you really have no idea what their deal is. I'd say each character varies... scores from 9/10 to 3/10 depending on which character. They could have done a much better job by including less characters and instead giving more time to the important ones.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really felt like this was building to something. I thoroughly enjoyed the ups and downs and couldn't wait for the story to unfold. The relationships between the characters were evolving and even though there was lighthearted comedy the series overall had a very real and serious tone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI think this anime had potential to be an 8/10 anime. Most of my issues were that the anime slow played a bunch of the story and had way too many characters for a deep development. It was obvious they were planning to stretch it over 2 seasons. I have seen anime which handled this FAR better... instead choosing to handle less of the plot and giving each piece a fair amount of attention. Instead, what we have here is WAY too much being introduced and left dangling at the end of the anime. Far too many questions left unanswered. This leaves the viewer engrossed in a world and wanting more but left in the dust. \\n\\n\r\nI guess the one interesting thing is that this is the first anime in a while which is making me want to test my Japanese against the light novel, so I guess it did have a fair impact on me.",

Yeah, that's how much sense it makes - none at all. \r\nHas anyone else gotten tired of the eye hax bullshit already? LOOK AT ME, I HAVE SPECIAL EYE POWERS! Fucking dumb.Did anyone else notice how the Alpha Stigma is basically the same thing as the Sharingan? The ability to \"comprehend\" everything? Inherent magical powers? Activated by the death of a close one? Trait only present in rare few humans? The Alpha Stigma is basically the Sharingan with a different name.\\n\\n\r\nDid anyone else notice how Ryner Lute is basically Naruto personality wise and Guts story wise? Naruto is a slacker, so is Ryner Lute. Ryner has no ordinary Alpha Stigma! No, his Alpha Stigma is SPECIAL! Just like Naruto's tailed beast is SPECIAL! Also when Ryner activates his Alpha Stigma he throws a hissy fit! Just like how Naruto throws a tantrum when he goes into tailed beast mode! So original! Is there more to Ryner Lute's personality other than \"Ah wunna protect mah friens!!\"? Same with Naruto! Wow, what a complex and multifaceted personality! Totally not a one-dimensional typical shonenshit protag like Bleach's Ichigo! Did I mention that HE MEETS HIS MOTHER WHO SACRIFICED HERSELF IN HIS INNER WORLD? Can you rip off Naruto any more? I don't think so! Oh, also at the end Ryner Lute swears he will bring Sasuke - woops, I meant Sion - out of \"the darkness\" (TM). Top kek. And Sion, oh my god, he is the exact replica of Griffith. How he invited Guts - sorry, Ryner - into his little group, how EVERYONE got killed except him, Ryner and the other main character who is a girl (*cough*Casca*cough*). How he sacrificed all his friends to gain power(ahem - become king). Then start wars. Dat inner dialogue resembling that of a megalomaniac. \\n\\n\r\nIt's like the author just read Berserk and Naruto and then decided to combine them into one clusterfuck of shit that had an edgier story than Berserk and a shittier cast than Naruto, if that was even possible. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the action. The action, to put it plainly, sucks. Half of the \"battles\" are not really battles, just people laughing like retards whilst *black screen* *blood splatter* x_x. \\n\\n\r\nThe Alpha Stigma happens to be a way shittier power than the Sharingan to watch in action because it's just a bunch of pentagrams rotating on the screen and occasionally laser beams turn people into dust (but the screen goes black so you don't actually see it). It's shit. At least with the Sharingan (in the Forest of Death episodes at least) you got to see actual hand-to-hand combat, people throwing shurikens etc. In LOTLH all you see is people's magical rotating pentagrams firing magic lightning bolts at others magical rotating pentagram. It's boring as fuck. Sorry, the animation is just so BADLY DIRECTED it hurts. Whenever something cool happens, everything turns black and red so you can't see it. Also, characters don't engage in any real melee combat, they just blink from one place to another. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone.",

Yet, despite the retro setting, the characters have depth of having a surface and a darker and more serious level beneath that. The whole eye thing is similar to Code Geass, yet it isnothing like that at the same time. Anyway, if you're looking for an epic anime, this is one though the story may be a little complicated it sorts itself out in the end. If you don't like the whole deep story there are some killer action scenes at least one per episode, I think, so something for everyone. Romance too, and plenty of comedy this anime has it all and in good balance too. I won't say why it isn't a ten cause that would be a spoiler. Enjoy this one.",

The art and sound were pretty good, nothing to really complain about, its an action anime after all. \r\nMy favorite aspect of this anime though was absolutely the characters. Even though at first some of them seem like your typical anime save-the-world kind of characters, each one hasa complex personality and the \"good guys and bad guys\" arent just a black and white concept. In this aspect, the anime is almost realistic, showing that each person has some core reason to think and act the way they do and even the best intentions can lead to the worst conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nI have to say that even though the characters were the best part of this anime, they were also the worst. In basically every episode there was a new character introduced, and toward the end of the episode you would like that person. Then the character that you thought you really wanted to see in future episodes, one that had the potential to be of serious importance and in the end, they disappear. If this happened once or twice then it would be fine, but it seemed that every character had some side story that the anime was leading up to and in the end it didnt tell you any of them. It makes no sense!\\n\\n\r\nI guess to sum it all up, the story and characters were great, but they threw in way too many twists that you thought \"Wow i wonder what happened\" or \"Oh I cant wait until this all comes together\" and then by the end they give you this messy wrapping paper and this shitty bow and call it the end. I say this anime was more aimed towards people who dont read too much into things, because if you ignore all the what ifs, this anime was pretty darn good!",

I thought \"With that name it probably isn't  a good anime\".Fortunately when i began watching the first few episodes i saw  the story develop. You have a main character who is really strong but acts lazy and doesn't use his powers much and you have a super strong female lead who acts cruel to him. As you know he was forced to search for the \"Hero relics\" the fact that he was forced too made the story sound more interesting to me.\r\nNow for the art.I don'twatch animes that have poor art or really old looking. When i look through list of animes i usually judge if i want to watch it based on how it looks (that might be a bad habit if the arts not good or \"crappy\" but everything else is good about it.) So when i saw this animes art it looks newer then most animes and looks decent to watch the art when fighting made the anime really nice to look at and watch . Even so the art could be better hence why i gave it a 9\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound i usually like to listen to music in animes  when something big is going to happen or at the beginning or end of the episode.When i listened to the music in this anime it was pretty good. The sound effects for fighting , using magic and everything was pretty good better then your average animes. That's why i gave it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's were just unique. Usually when the main character gets discriminated against they act dull and become dark characters.\\n\r\nIn this anime they could have did that but they chose a different \\n\r\npath. The main characters gets tormented as a child but chooses to\\n\r\nact calmly and just act normal. Usually in most animes the female lead is \"gaga\" over the main character, but in this anime the female lead acts strong and shows no affection , but really likes the main character. That's why i gave it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly anyone would enjoy this anime even if they aren't into the theme it's just fun to watch as things happen to the main character. Basically if your just looking for an anime to watch to pass time then you could watch this too. So i would say the enjoyment would get a 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i would give this anime a 9.",

What can go wrong?\r\nDensetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu speaks a story of magic and power, where there is inequality and injustice in the world. In any other context, this would have been a great masterpiece on par with many magic genres such as overlord and no game no life. However, it did itself in with the ending that is too open-ended. It may be the only ending considering that the creators spent a lot of the time on character development which was enjoyable. However, I believe that moreemphasis should have been placed on moving the story forward and allowing the viewers to see more of other kingdoms and epic wars. This is to ensure that they could achieve their ideal end goal. However, due to the creators emphasized on characters, there is the lack of an happy ending or a good cliffhanger. Many thing are left untouched such as what happen to Kiefer, what happen to the kingdoms of Roland and Gastark. It was a very good attempt with the development, however with slow pacing it ended uneventful. \\n\\n\r\n~ Story: 6/10 \\n\r\nDecent development but bad ending.\\n\\n\r\n~Good art:8/10\\n\\n\r\n~Sound: 7/10\\n\r\nGood opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\n~Character:8/10\\n\r\nGood character development and progress thorough their relationship.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nWould have been a lot of better considering the possibility of it being a big hit if it had done better in the ending or a second season.\\n\\n\r\n~Overall:6/10\\n\r\nIt would have deserved a better rating had it not have a triggering ending. \\n\\n\r\n~Thank you for your kind attention for reading my rambling!~\\n\\n",

The characters' struggles and backstories will be the only thing that will keep you going. It tries to focus on the current status of the world: the politics, the invasions - why these people do it. Why are some more fortunate than others? What makes a great ruler? It got to a point where the show tries to over-complicate situations just to prove a point, and the characters appear flatter than originally intended.\r\nThe interesting thing about this show, however, is it's inability to establish a proper antagonist. It'sboth a good and bad aspect: bad primarily because what's a good anime without an antagonist? There is(are) conflict(s), mind you, if you consider ten sideplots running at the same time conflicts. But the great thing about this is that it immerses the viewer into its weird modern-medieval universe and leaves you helpless. We are quick to points fingers like \"Ha! If the MC defeats this guy, then a good ending will come out!\" or \"It's his fault!\" but the show takes that ability away from them and will allow the viewer to see the whole picture and leave them to their own conclusions.",

            "content": "I have very mixed feelings about this one, it reminds me of ef: a tale of memories, I only enjoyed half/some parts of the anime. I feel like Densetsu had a lot of potential. \r\nProbably the biggest issue with this anime is it's way of story telling (and characters a little bit) some of the transitions between episodes leave you very confused,\r\n\"How did this event, suddenly turn to that one?\"\r\nand overall just the general plot sometimes can get confusing. (ESPECIALLY around the end)\r\nWith this flaw, I just think the anime wasted it's time and could've been a good anime, not to mention its huge cliff-hangerat the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe other issue is with its characters, I feel there a lot of unnecessary characters, and maybe some of them were necessary, but with the anime ending on a cliff-hanger, we don't get to see their \"necessary-ness\" again, it could've done better. A lot of times comedy is thrown in a little to much for the characters' situations, and it bugs me a little bit, although it isn't quite out of place as let's say Akame ga Kill!\\n\\n\r\nBut let's get to some of the good points.\\n\\n\r\nI like the Art/Animation, I really do, it is very pretty and the effects are nice, I really like how the guys and girls look, their faces are well, attractive to be blunt. But when one of the characters (Ferris) when her bangs \"flip\" it has this weird animation for them where it looks like her hair merges together in a weird way, I don't know you'd have to see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing, even if this was an anime that probably wouldn't get most people thinking, it did for me at some points, a little morale questioning here and there. There were parts of the anime I really enjoyed, and others, well,\\n\\n\r\nThis anime took me 3 months to complete, and not just because I was pressed for time because of school, it just wasn't interesting to me, at a lot of points it didn't have me coming back to it on my free time. Only by my sheer OCD completionist nature did it give me the power to binge-finish it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked the anime somewhat, I feel if it ever got a S2 (which will probably never happen) and if it was done better it would be a great anime. This however, I don't feel satisfied from watching it, some of the ups of it were nice, but it didn't captivate me. You can watch this if you want, just don't expect too much.\\n\\n\r\n(Also btw the music is good, but the second opening has WAY better cinematography)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Essentially the story plot seems mediocre at best, but let me tell you; this deserves a second season! I'm not going to give up spoilers or give scores because it wouldn't do it justice. Don't pass this anime up because it seems bland the best are always sleepers. It's a nice break from my harem anime choice lol",

            "content": "When I first saw the title of this anime, for some reason, I had this image of this anime being a classic from the 80s to 90s era. Of course, I was wrong, though I was right about this anime being related to something old.\r\nThe Legend of the Legendary Heroes has a medival setting, focusing mainly on magic; fantasy and a little bit of medival weapons like, swords, bows etc. . The anime starts off on a rather confusing note since we have no idea of the names of the characters that are getting most of the screentime in the first episode. Basically, viewers thathave not read the novel, will have no idea what is going on in the first episode, but that is quickly remedied by the following episodes. However, even that quickly falls apart in the middle of the season. \\n\\n\r\nTowards the later half of the season, events are rushed, plot holes are accumulating with no sign of getting filled anytime soon and what is supposedly the main antagonist, goes AWOL for majority of the later half of the season and then even more characters that are supposedly antagonists as well showed up, so now, we don't know who is the main antagonist here. The anime started off nicely, then everything became chaotic.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the negative tone of my words above, there are some things that I liked. One of them was how the directors used future episodes to fill in plot holes in past episodes by bringing them in as flashbacks, if you will, though not all of them were filled. \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the anime was very nicely done, sound bits for spells, clashing of blades, ambience etc. fitted the mood very well, bringing the anime to life, or so to speak. \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, the voice acting was also splendid, namely Fukuyama Jun and Ono Daisuke, nothing more needs to be said.\\n\\n\r\nThough with all that being said, I still enjoyed the anime thoroughly and this anime has enormous potential for a second season. If a second season is made, it will defintely be one of the best animes of all time, that is of course assuming that they don't screw up like they did with the first season.",

            "content": "I'm not going to discuss the show as much in my review, but things I noticed that other reviewers have not touched on (yes I did read them all). \r\nI agree with most of the other reviewers that the art is great, the sound is pretty good, the story is interesting (I watched this series more religiously than I think any other I've seen), the characters are very well developed (arguably one of the most attractive elements of the show), and the setting is ok. \r\nI also would like to say before anything else, that I really really really loved this anime. I lowered myscore to an 8 because of my frustration with the end... which if you read on will be explained. Up until the last episode the show had wavered between a 10 and a 9 for me.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the things I noticed in the series.\\n\\n\r\n First of all the story is really interesting not due to the actual plot of the series but because of the whole premise of the show/world. (Although, I will say that the plot is pretty interesting) Its not so much the plot line following Ryner and Sion that I found so interesting, but what was happening in their world during the course of the show. It was the social conflict between countries, between the people and the \"monsters\", etc and how people/characters changed or didn't change in reaction to them that I found really intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nI also hadn't thought about it much until I watched the last episode, but I realized that the first half of the series is really just an introduction to the world. The plot really doesn't pick up until the second half of the show. At the same time, I never found this frustrating and the show was never anything but enjoyable to me. Perhaps it is this careful development of the world that makes my first comment about the series true. I also think that this is part of the reason that the characters within the series have the depth that they have. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this leads into my last comment. When I watched the last episode I simply could not believe it was the last one, not because I didn't want the show to end, but because I felt like it wasn't the end. It felt like one of the all too familiar cliff hangers that the show uses unashamedly and continuously. Because the real story didn't begin to be developed until later on in the series, I feel the writers had to rush to \"get it all in.\"  Sadly, the show suffered for it. Character side stories were abandoned and unfinished. The last episode leaves the series completely wide open with no real ending to it at all. Watchers are left scratching their heads and wondering what in the world the point was beyond a simply exquisite peak into another world's history. \\n\\n\r\n*spoilers*\\n\\n\r\nI also felt some of the characters suffered from the rushed ending. I found myself wondering what happened to Kiefer after she was suspected of being a spy by Edea. She makes an extremely brief appearance in the last episode in an attempt (I assume) to show watchers that she somehow made it out of her sticky situation in one piece... yet, this answers no questions at all. Does that mean Edea let her go, or did she escape? Is she now acting on his orders in trade for her life? How did she know where Ryner was, and how did she get there that quickly, and why wasn't Edea or any of his people with her?  I also had to wonder about Tiir and Milk, these characters dropped off with no real explanation toward the last few episodes as well.  Lastly, one has to wonder... Who was the man who showed his face in only one episode, but seemed to be an important character (he kills Ryner and tests Ferris)? Who was the woman in the very last episode that stops Lucile and Sion.  How can Lucile be the \"Weaver\" if Sion is the Hero who consumed him? What will Lucile do when he realizes Ferris ran off with Ryner?\\n\\n\r\nI honestly feel as if the show has another season left in it (I wouldn't be opposed to that at all, in fact I would watch it gladly). So many unanswered questions and so many possibilities. What were the writers thinking finishing in such an open ended and rushed manner?\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all of this, I still really enjoyed the show and would def recommend it. Just... keep in mind what others have said, watch more than the 1st episode. You've got to make it through like the 3rd or 4th to really get drawn in.",
