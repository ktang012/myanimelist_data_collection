            "content": "\"Say, Nana... Do you remember the first time we met?\"\r\nThese words are the introduction of the beautiful world of \"Nana\". Ai Yazawa is probably the most convincing shoujo manga writer ever. With colourful, realistic characters, breathtaking events and just a pinch of music she creates a world in witch every girl can forget about reality and fall into the embrace of romantic fantasies. \r\nOne of the best things about \"Nana\" are the characters - we can actually see the reflection of ourselves in some of them and believe, that someone like that can really exist. This is proof that you can make a good animewithout the conventional tsundere, moe or annoying childhood friend.\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't like though is Hachi's personality. Her behaviour at times is despicable. Mainly because she has no ideals or dreams (except getting married witch is pretty boring compared to the rest of the characters). \\n\\n\r\nThe story is also one of Nana's strong points. Ai Yazawa worked really hard on it, and did her best to create a realistic world so that the reader can almost become part of it and experience it emotionaly. \\n\r\nEven though the plot is a typical shoujo tearjerker (with a bit of music) it has that magical something that makes you cheer unconsciously for some characters and experience emotionally some events almost as strongly as the characters themselves. Another good thing about the story is that it exposes the hard, cruel reality, which has no happy endings and pure loves. Yazawa-sensei gives her characters a big imagination (especially Hachi) But the world they live in is just like ours.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it wasn't that impressive. It annoys me how all the characters are so thin and tall. Other that that I think the art matched the story pretty well. There were lots of details regarding shadows and highlights. That's in order to underline the mood of certain moments, mainly in room 707.\\n\\n\r\nNana has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. The openings and endings were songs by the 2 fictional bands in the show, witch was a brilliant idea imo. Olivia Lufkin and Anna Tsuchiya fit the characters perfectly. Nothing much to add here: the music in Nana is brilliant. Period.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nana is a must-see position for shoujo-fans. It tells us a lot about life, it's hardships and also teaches us an important lesson about the mistakes, that we shouldn't make.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, so please don't be hard on me ;)",

            "content": "One of the things I like to see the most in anime is how they portray relationships. I&rsquo;m a sucker for romance, but I hate the cheesy stuff you usually see in typical shoujo anime. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll find an anime with realistic characters, with the typical flaws of human nature, and usually people love them. We can identify with them. Like in Evangelion many people who have dealt with depression could identify with Shinji (in some levels&hellip;). \r\nFor those of you who have watched your share of anime about love/relationships, I bet you could identify somehow with &ldquo;Bokura ga Ita&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&rdquo; or&ldquo;Kare Kano&rdquo;. Or at least you felt connected with its characters. I have watched them all and know what I&rsquo;m talking about.\\n\\n\r\nRecently, I finally sat down and watched &ldquo;Paradise Kiss&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a short (12 episodes) anime that, to make it short, is about relationships and growing up. I was impressed by its maturity. The art style took a while to get used to, but afterwards I loved it. After watching it, I decided to watch &ldquo;Nana&rdquo;, which is by the same author and deals with similar issues.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis:\\n\r\n&ldquo;On board the train to Tokyo to meet her boyfriend Shoji, Nana Komatsu (&quot;Hachi&quot;) happened to sit beside Nana Osaki who was traveling to Tokyo to fulfill her dreams of becoming a musician. The vocalist for her punk band &quot;Blast&quot;, Nana aims for a major debut for &quot;Blast&quot; in Tokyo where her boyfriend, Ren, is the guitarist for a popular band &quot;Trapnest&quot;. Sharing the same name &quot;Nana&quot;, both girls quickly form a bond of friendship. Their paths cross again when they encounter each other while searching for accommodation in Tokyo. Eventually they decide to live together in the same unit and this further strengthens their bond as the two &quot;Nana(s)&quot; go through their love lives and career.&rdquo; &ndash; AnimeNewsNetwork\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory  (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI almost have no words to express how it made me feel. It&rsquo;s amazing. Incredibly realistic and moving. I started watching it without knowing a thing about it (not even synopsis), though the title &ldquo;Nana&rdquo; sounded familiar as something popular among anime fans. The anime was broadcasted in 2006, lasting 47 episodes, but the manga first came out in Japan in 2000 and is still ongoing.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept itself isn&rsquo;t anything too extraordinary. People living together, people falling in and out of love, people trying to make it in showbiz and other stuff. You could say it blends many overused ideas, then twists them around and reinvents them, transforming itself into a completely original and brilliant idea. And it contains romance, drama and comedy, but the transition between them is really well done, so it doesn&rsquo;t feel weird.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes &ldquo;Nana&rdquo; shine is the incredible character development. The evolution of each character&rsquo;s personality and relationships with other characters. The things we watch them go through seem so real, like we&rsquo;d probably make the same mistakes and choices as they did. No one is perfect &ndash; that&rsquo;s a fact. We often think to ourselves &ldquo;If I was [him], I wouldn&rsquo;t have made that choice&rdquo;, but the truth is we are lying to ourselves. We are insecure, emotional beings, that often ignore rational thought and make reckless decisions. &ldquo;Nana&rdquo; is so realistic that it&rsquo;ll blow your mind away.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a long series, but it&rsquo;s not hard to watch. In the first episodes, the action often switches between the actual time and many flashbacks, but they really are important to understand a character&rsquo;s background. At some point you might get the feeling that they&rsquo;re repeating the flashbacks, but don&rsquo;t worry. This isn&rsquo;t a filler-filled series. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end I felt that the story was really well told. But they leave you in a sort of cliffhanger&hellip; because the manga isn&rsquo;t finished yet. But they made it more than obvious that at some point there&rsquo;ll be a second season of Nana, so don&rsquo;t worry. In fact, I loved watching this and the way it ended wasn&rsquo;t too frustrating because I&rsquo;d just experienced an awesome series.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe way the characters look might be a little hard to get used to (at least imo), but I really like the art style. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything too impressive or revolutionary about the visuals here&hellip; which is a good thing. I think the plot alone would be enough to hold the audience and maybe if they&rsquo;d done something too extravagant visually (*cough* Air *cough*) the viewer would get sidetracked from the story itself. I think the animation was very fitting for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation studio is Madhouse, which was also responsible for &ldquo;Beck&rdquo;, &ldquo;CardCaptor Sakura&rdquo;, &ldquo;Paradise Kiss&rdquo;, &ldquo;Death Note&rdquo; and a bunch of others.\\n\\n\r\nAudio (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI watched the episodes with the original Japanese voice actors and English subtitles. As for the actors, I think they were perfect for their roles. KAORI gave her voice to Nana &ldquo;Hachi&rdquo;, which suited the character perfectly with the childish and girlish tone (but thankfully not an annoying high-pitched voice). For the tough rock singer Nana Osaki we have Romi Paku, who also voiced Edward Elric in Full Metal Alchemist. They knew that &ldquo;Nana&rdquo; would be an instant success, so they gave it a cast of famous actors and spared no expense.\\n\\n\r\nAt first this seems like an anime about music, but it doesn&rsquo;t play that much of a part here. I mean, we hear lots of songs, but the story isn&rsquo;t focused on showing us the making of the songs in detail. Compared to &ldquo;Gravitation&rdquo; or &ldquo;Full Moon wo Sagashite&rdquo;, music wasn&rsquo;t as important here.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the songs. The fictional bands&rsquo; songs are used as openings and endings. OLIVIA is the singing voice of Reira, and we hear many songs from her. My favourite was &ldquo;A little pain&rdquo;. It was the first Ending, and since each episode ended on a relatively sad tone, the song fit perfectly. When I heard the first words of the lyrics (&ldquo;Travel to the moon&hellip;&rdquo;) it almost made me want to cry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs I&rsquo;ve mentioned, the characters are the best thing about the anime. We get the chance to know a bit about each character&rsquo;s history, motivations, thoughts and desires. They are so realistic that we just can&rsquo;t help but being sucked in by them. \\n\\n\r\nAs the anime progresses, the characters gradually grow. This is a very &ldquo;slice of life&rdquo; genre of anime, so we watch them growing up. I love how they all interact and deal with their decisions. I love how they aren&rsquo;t perfect&hellip; but as flawed as humans should be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime and it will definitely become one of my favorite series of all time. I feel like watching it again and again, but since it is 47 episodes long and makes me very emotional, maybe it&rsquo;ll have to wait until I have more time.\\n\\n\r\nI don&rsquo;t feel like reading the manga for the sole reason that it is too damn long. If it weren&rsquo;t for that, I would have already ordered all the volumes. But I gained new respect for the mangaka Ai Yazawa.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 live-action movies for &ldquo;Nana&rdquo;. I haven&rsquo;t watched them yet, but will soon. I&rsquo;m curious as to how they squeezed all that plot into 2 movies (I&rsquo;d say they have enough material to make a whole 11 episode drama or maybe something even longer). \\n\\n\r\nThe anime will have a second season&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure of that. But for that to happen, we&rsquo;ll have to wait until the manga is finished. Hurry up!\\n",

            "content": "The background of NANA feels like an endless white night. Things seem to be continuously in motion; beginnings and endings wrapped up in an infinite wave of falling snowflakes waiting to melt into each other. The forefront sits in perpetual twilight; characters seem to be eclipsed by their own shadows with barely enough to catch a glimpse of who they are. The entire landscape depicts the frigidity of life rising from frosty gales to a calmer ether, only to revert to stormier lands. Movement here isn\u2019t linear. Nothing is. NANA, as a whole, is pure kinetics; an explosion of emotional energy circling, clashing and alwaysin motion. This is all infused as a careful exploration of fate, transience, and relationships in a modernized setting. NANA as a work fully invokes the power of pathos while taking \u201cdrama\u201d to new heights.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the acclaimed manga by Ai Yazawa, Studio Madhouse adapted NANA into a 47-episode series. The story follows the pivotal journeys of two incredibly \u201cdifferent\u201d girls bound by the same name and circumstance. Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu are planets apart yet exist in the same sky; tethered by each other\u2019s gravitational force. Nana Osaki is externally a cool cat, adorned in Vivienne Westwood \u2013 the quintessential punk queen with a voracity for musical success. Whereas, Nana Komatsu, who garners the nickname \u201cHachi\u201d, is a dreamer who sees, breathes, and dreams in pink; her ambitions don\u2019t extend beyond finding her fairytale romance. Both are headed to Tokyo to pursue their various dreams (one to establish the perfect domestic life with her boyfriend, while the other wants to form her band and actualize her musical ambitions). Fate brings these two together as roommates and the narrative unfolds to reveal the tender anatomy of relationships and the power they have; to shape people and their respective worlds \u2013 for better or for worse.\\n\\n\r\nThen, what makes this work more than a seemingly run-of-the-mill drama about two girls discovering the pains and gains of life? What does it possess that other philosophized-by-life dramas don\u2019t? The answer is simple: understanding. Yazawa writes candidly about people and the world, not as a spectator, but as someone clearly living in it. Nana portrays an acute understanding of how people are and their complexities that are simply written off as natural proclivities. There is reason even if Fate seems to play some indiscernible part. There is meaning even if chaos seems to rule it out. However, what\u2019s impressive is not the mere incorporation of \u201cunderstanding\u201d, but \u201cHOW\u201d the work manages to create a stylized drama that is as visceral as the cold touch of the wintry night that it starts on.\\n\\n\r\nEven with its luridly icy sensation, NANA is never detached or impersonal. It may be highly temperamental, but it never indulges in its own despair. It\u2019s often cold but driven by the innate warmth of its living, breathing cast, who aren\u2019t just personifications of suffering or \u201cinsert-theme.\u201d This is partly what makes it sublime in its approach to drama. The drama isn\u2019t a descriptor or a simple add-on. An event doesn\u2019t happen so it can be \u201cdramatic.\u201d It doesn\u2019t happen only in effect. There is an ebb and flow; a serpentine path painted with emotional uncertainty. The characters drip with it, but the difference is that they own it. There is accountability here. Events happen for the characters as an extension of them. They don't occur only as a platform for causality (which makes all the difference).\\n\\n\r\nConsidering how easily emotional appeals can be manipulated to rehash emotional evocations, NANA remains earnest. There is a purpose in isolating feelings; to let the characters lather in them, not just merely show them; to explore them to such a degree that the feeling/the state itself becomes autonomous. Loneliness becomes its own character; as does love; as does happiness. It is as transient as it is eternal. The characters are so refined that it\u2019s hard to separate them from the elements that define them. Drama is all about nurturing these humanistic nuances and intricacies in its own habitat. Yazawa knows this all too well. Instead of showing these conditions as mere outputs of a decision or situation, they exist on an aqueous spectrum blurring the lines used to divide them AS a part of the being that gives them shape and substance. Then, causality only becomes a mean, just like Fate, just like chaos, not the end. Ultimately, that\u2019s what makes NANA idyllic as a drama, and even more so, as a story driven by life.\\n\\n\r\nHolistically, NANA showcases its prowess for drama through natural rawness, unflinching realism, and scope for understanding its subject matter(s) on a cellular level. The picture is impressive, but what makes it a pinnacle of its kind are the details \u2013 the pieces of storytelling that it utilizes to convey its narrative.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, there is perspective. Works revolving around the musings of \u201clife\u201d usually have a philosophy driving their vision of it; Nana has perspectives. What the series employs are contrasting, continual planes that converge with each other to give a wholesome view through Nana and Hachi. Their interconnectedness matters more than their seemingly opposing natures. The perspectives confess, observe, share, and exploit the hearts of the events and the characters. The episodes start with a stream of confessional thoughts spilling onto the screen and morphing into the events that transpired them.  Structurally, this does two things: One, it offers balance. Two, it contextualizes. This approach helps establish reliability because there are two narrators. This naturally aids in mitigating the problem of the unreliable narrator. The image becomes complete even if it is in broad, disconnected strokes. This show is unwavering in its personalization, and both perspectives will establish that with an uncanny persuasion.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, there is the context. The synergy between Nana and Hachi creates its own ecology. This isn\u2019t something that is easily fabricated by romanticizing the power of friendship. It is pure symbiosis, of two lives reflected through a continually cracking mirror. As the story progresses, the bifocal gaze of the two melds into one. Even the apparent contradictions between the two begin becoming whole. At first, Nana and Hachi seem to complement each other but gradually start inverting their traits. The evolution of each character is highly dependent on this progression which is why context is crucial. Hachi and Nana, along with the supplementary cast provide this even when the truth is far from being transparent. Although, getting to the truth feels trivial anyway. What the structural decisions do at their very core is reinforce the means (never the end). The importance of every word, emotion, and event that happens is preserved and with it, parts of the individual and their entire world for that moment in time.\\n\\n\r\nThat is what matters. These moments where time comes to a standstill and that instance singularly defines the world. Incepted through bursts of chemical reactions; frozen yet in flames, quietly burning everything around them. A tempest consumed by shadows of the past and uncertainties of the present. Where entropy orchestrates all and everything seems to fall into contradiction; where dreams are simply just dreams; where expectations are merely mesmerizing mirages in the distance; where love isn\u2019t a fairytale; where the importance of understanding each other becomes more important than anything else that could ever exist.  All of this is the essence of NANA\u2019s characters. Hachi, Nana, and the rest of the cast are crafters of their own moments. They coat the ashen night-sky with them. Constellations composed of moments; visual strings connected by the last and the next, in a cycle of change. It is through these anecdotal glimpses that these characters take form.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters embody this candid usage of memory, singularity, and understanding. There is much emphasis on individual events and actions. These subtleties develop to reveal how the characters are constantly at odds with themselves (even when the tone seems to be lighthearted, and all seems to be well). This is why the symbiosis between Nana and Hachi becomes so vital because their moments are not only reflected in each other but formed by each other. Additionally, it\u2019s their relationship that breaks the feigned insularity of the other characters. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have their own identities as does the rest of the cast. Everyone has a dynamism to them: their own palettes, shades, and gradients. Good. Bad. These words have no place here. Bound by insecurities, identity, and passion; constantly seeking themselves in a game of hide-and-seek, these characters are more than just adjectives and a system of traits. The show doesn\u2019t waste time in judging its characters because it has so much to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nEven then, the one that seems to be the most misunderstood and unfairly scrutinized is Hachi. She is by far the most superficially flawed character. That is never shied away from. That makes her easy to hate or dismiss as a standard shoujo lead. Hachi is perplexingly idiotic. She flings herself into the worst situations and finds herself in a never-ending state of ambivalence. Not only that, she creates disharmony between many other characters like Nana and her band members. Unlike, Nana who is easily likable due to her strong candor, intense personality, and devotion to her principals and goals, Hachi is unstable, unreliable, and utterly whimsical.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really substantiates her as a compelling character is how she is unapologetically grounded in her humanistic tendencies and flaws. This gives her a kind of awareness that the other characters, except for Yasu (Nana\u2019s longtime friend and drummer for her band), just don\u2019t have. Everyone acts like they are in control, regardless of how fragmented their reflection is.  Where everyone else is running from the phantoms they fear, Hachi absorbs them.  Nana is about as broken as they come but constantly hides her inner turmoil; stubbornly trudging through hardship and heartbreak. Pride means everything to her. Nana survives by hiding her true feelings, while Hachi lives by constantly embracing them. Hachi is fundamentally an honest character. She subconsciously recognizes her lack of control and her predispositions. Though, she often seems to be driven by her pseudo-idealization of romance which often recycles itself in ways worse than the last. She owns up to her wretchedness and attempts to reconcile; to change. Though, this doesn\u2019t make her immune. Her awareness is often drowned out by her naivete resulting in incrementally worse situations (almost to the point of becoming stuck in a self-prophetic rut).  Still, amidst it all, she remains transparent. There are no contrivances necessary with her. Transparency can be far more compelling than clarifying opaqueness, for what lies under the milky sheath is never truly clear.\\n\\n\r\nConclusively, the characters are superb because they are etched with all the shades of humanity. The physical and psychological are all accounted for. Character and emotion; feeling and action; change and stagnation; a sincere lust for meaning and acceptance are all encompassed by these characters. The best part is that there is no room to judge. The hearts of these characters beat in such sync with our own; that the only thing that\u2019s left is empathy and understanding even if it shrouded in frustration.\\n\\n\r\nAll this is packaged visually by Madhouse. They did an exceptional job adapting this series. There is a certain grittiness to the visuals and atmosphere that keeps the show from wandering too deep into the typical shoujo aesthetic. The series depends heavily on delivering rawness and realism. Otherwise, there is a nice balance of bubbly, bright scenes (in all their shoujo glory) contrasted with the necessary grunge required to keep the actual spirit of the story intact. The characters' idiosyncrasies are also poignantly preserved. The aesthetical and auditory direction kept the maturity of NANA blossoming throughout the show, despite its shoujo dispositions.\\n\\n\r\nOne further thing to note is that the manga is still publishing. The anime ends on a controversial note. For many, it leaves much to be desired. In the context of the story and especially how its told, the ending works. The story moves retrospectively. It doesn't bring the necessary closure needed to substantiate all the complexities it introduces, but it provides enough insight into what's important. It leaves room for more because there is more, but keeps the sanctity of the story still flourishing onwards. Another criticism it has received is its slow pacing. The pacing is slow as this isn\u2019t a show focusing on high-octane plots. It is about people. It seasons itself over time, maturing with its characters, and their lives. It never feels redundant nor inflated. There are silly subplots but they aren\u2019t superfluous; for they always work in tandem with a character. As aforesaid, the show never treats anything as an end. Sometimes things happen with no end and sometimes things spontaneously end. The point is that there is something concrete beneath it which ultimately sheds light on those involved.\\n\\n\r\nThat is what drama is. \\n\\n\r\nTime lost in an emotive frenzy. Moments molded from remnants of what passed. Transformed into what is to come. Even in the calm, something moves.  The scenery here is indeed a bit too chilly sometimes, laden with the melancholy of yesterday and the loneliness of tomorrow. Even so, the present waits in an ethereal stasis; attempting to understand itself. Remembering, being, and accepting; it\u2019s all here, often presented as unyielding blizzard internalized by those who live it. As the single snowflake finally dissolves upon touch into a pool of white, to become something more than just one, those walking in NANA also find themselves inseparable from those around them. Nothing is perfect here. Nothing needs to be.\\n\\n\r\nFor what happens here is relentlessly flawed yet at the same time, essential and real. What happens here is, life.\\n",

            "content": "Nana is one of those acclaimed anime that everyone seems to know the existence of, but very few people have ever actually watched. The fact that it\u2019s almost 50 episodes long is a bit of a turn-off in of itself, but even the people who have seen it barely discuss the thing anymore. Very few \u201cfavorite anime\u201d lists that I\u2019ve read actually include it. It\u2019s up there with Great Teacher Onizuka, Hajime no Ippo, and most of the Major anime in terms of high-ranking MAL darlings that the majority of MAL users will go \u201coh yeah, I\u2019ve heard how good this thing is.

But part of said reason was just that I wasn\u2019t interested. I never even cared enough to learn what happens in the show other than the fact that it was about two women named Nana who become friends and deal with relationship issues. And as much as I like the Paradise Kiss anime, part of its appeal was that it was really short. Eleven episodes, which admittedly made manga fans a bit grumpy considering an important male character and some story details got shortchanged as a result, but if it meant less boredom caused by dead space, than I was all for it.\\n\\n\r\nBut even with the huge amount of summer anime I keep up with riding my ass like a sexual metaphor that I\u2019m not going to elaborate on because it would be too nasty even for me, I had free time to surf Netflix for new shows to get into. And after my failure to get into the Netflix originals that I tried, along with browsing the anime selection and noticing Nana was on there, I decided it was as good a time as any to watch it and ended up finishing the show in less than two weeks. You have no idea how much free time I sacrificed regarding other activities I could have been doing - like finally playing Bioshock Infinite for one - to accomplish that, especially since I don\u2019t actually love Nana. Not that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good. It is. But if you were to ask me if I wanted to rewatch in the future, I\u2019d just shove my Paradise Kiss DVDs in your face, and not because I managed to get those really hard-to-find DVDs for a relatively cheap price and want to brag about it. Not just because of that, anyways.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, it is the pacing that\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m okay with taking a break in-between dramatic moments in order to set them up so that they\u2019d actually have some impact, but not breaks that go on this long. The very first episode of the anime introduces our two twenty-year old protagonists, a happy go-lucky idiot named Nana Komatsu and a rock punk chick named Nana Osaki, by having them meet on a train during their move to Tokyo and end up becoming roommates due to various circumstances. I was expecting the next episode to showcase the two getting to know each other whilst revealing their motivations for moving to Tokyo in the first place, until I read the Netflix summaries and discovered that the next five episodes would flashback to their pasts in a \u201chow we got here\u201d sort of way meaning we wouldn\u2019t get any meaningful interaction between them until half a one-cour series has passed. And to top it all off, they rehash the opening episode in Episode 6, which makes me wonder why you needed a prologue to begin with. I mean there\u2019s hooking the audience and then there\u2019s just baiting them with cookies for breakfast. It\u2019s an extreme, but by no means the only example of this sort of pacing dragging the show down. Certainly not the worst example from the show either.\\n\\n\r\nNot that the downtime is dull. It\u2019s just pretty average. If you\u2019ve seen one story about a quirky female trying to make friends and ends meet, then you\u2019ve seen Nana\u2019s light-hearted stretch of episodes. The only thing that makes it tolerable compared to most go-nowhere shoujo series is how despite Nana K trying her hardest to be independent, she\u2019s completely dependent on others, which becomes increasingly problematic on the people surrounding her as well as herself throughout the series. This leads to a decently engaging climax \u2153 of the way through the series when said hypocrisy pushes her boyfriend towards another woman, but I couldn\u2019t quite shake the feeling that I had just watched a romance movie that was the first part of a trilogy and stretched out to three times the length it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until Nana O\u2019s circle of friends, including the band of which her former boyfriend is a member of, shows up that the average-to-engaging ratio started to tip more towards the latter. But even then, it has its slow moments. Whilst I appreciate Nana for having buildup so that I could actually care for the \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they\u201d part of the story rather than act like a man in his forties who\u2019s desperate to lose his virginity, I could have completed an entire workout routine in the time it took for the buildup to go somewhere whilst still having enough time to cook some meat afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nThe absolute nadir of the experience was with the story\u2019s final arc, where after Nana K makes a mistake that causes her and everyone to face their own demons in a heart-wrenching string of episodes that rivals Kids on the Slope\u2019s final stretch in terms of emotional intensity, the show then spends the next ten episodes trying to have the characters go on with their lives with each episode having about 3-5 minutes of compelling drama and 17-20 minutes of \u201cwhilst I like these characters, this doesn\u2019t further the story in any real way\u201d I know a bunch of people were sour on Kids on the Slope for skipping an entire volume of the manga - amongst other things - but please explain to me what showcasing the actual process of Kaoru moving on from wrecking his entire life would actually add. Sometimes, some things are best left to the imagination and you just need to end the thing right then and there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just to make things worse, nothing even comes out of all that buildup other than a reaffirmation and closure of old plot threads that whilst engaging, don\u2019t really lend any sort finality to the show as a whole. Without giving too much away, there\u2019s this weird and unnecessary use of time skip before it cuts back to the present with the characters just acting like they usually do, even when major events occur. And whilst a hard decision is made in said finale, said decision is undercut by the timeskip showing that everything is going to be alright in the future, rendering it completely pointless. It feels like the anime ended right in the middle of the story, and whilst I understand that Nana\u2019s source material hasn\u2019t concluded even to this day - although the chances we\u2019ll ever get a conclusion from the author at this point are about as likely as Iggy Azalea ever being relevant again after her breakdown - you could have at least had made some sort of big deal out of things. At least achieve a small last-minute accomplishment? No? Alright then, but don\u2019t expect me to read your manga in order to find out what happens next. Especially since there\u2019s a certain car crash that happens later on that I think I\u2019m better off pretending doesn\u2019t exist.\\n\\n\r\nAm I banging too much on how unnecessarily long I found this series? Well it\u2019s the most unique thing I can say about it, because like me, even if you don\u2019t know what happens plot-wise, I\u2019d be very surprised if you didn\u2019t have any idea what Nana was actually about. The whole story is somewhere between Beck Mongolian Chop Squad and a Seo Kouji manga in that the majority of the characters are working towards making it as a punk band whilst dealing with all sorts of heartbreak and truths regarding how complicated relationships can get. All the characters are adults and even the more assholish members of the cast are likable, which automatically makes Nana better than those works. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that it focuses more on the latter than the former, which I prefer because my interest in the inner workings of how a band operates is virtually nil whilst my interest in the inner workings of how a relationship works is higher than the peak of Mount Olympus.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst there are some weird plot contrivances to further the story along, complaining about that in a drama is like complaining they\u2019re emotionally manipulative or comedies are funny. If you don\u2019t like the very idea of them, then you shouldn\u2019t be watching anything from the genre to begin with. You don\u2019t see me watching Bollywood movies for a reason you know. And whilst some of the plot points are eerily reminiscent of Suzuka, they work here because the drama fires in all cylinders rather than play favoritism towards one weak direction. Everything that happens is a result of the characters\u2019 personalities. Events that happen to one character also affects those around them, causing all involved parties to face themselves along with their circumstances. Nobody is a true bad guy, even when it\u2019s clear that one side is more wrong than the other. Even the high school kid who demands money from the girls he sleeps with is a lot nicer in practice than he sounds right no--get out of that chat room! I swear he\u2019s a decent guy...sort of.\\n\\n\r\nAnd most of all, the romance and relationship stuff is ultimately just a tool for larger issues. Sure we\u2019ve seen said issues addressed before: responsibility, personal luck, inner demons, etc. But those sorts of issues are never going to stop being relevant anytime soon, no matter what your age is. And as long as that remains true and they\u2019re explored in a way that reminds us of said truth, I\u2019m always going to find the stuff that Nana represents intriguing. That is why Nana continues to be remembered as one of the anime greats despite not being popular in this current generation of anime fans. Which makes it all the more frustrating that the show is to romance stories what Monster (sans conclusive ending despite the ambiguity of it all) is to crime stories.\\n\\n\r\nAs well-written, decent-looking (although Nana\u2019s actual animation is pretty terrible), nicely dubbed, and overall enjoyable both Madhouse productions are, my desire to ever revisit them is severely tempered by their long lengths and the inevitable dead space and repetition that comes from this sort of serialized storytelling \u201cshould have been a movie\u201d format. Maybe if the comedy during Nana\u2019s lower-quality stretches was funny, the pacing wouldn\u2019t have been so much of a problem. But all the jokes come from \u201cHow to write shoujo comedy 101\u201d, which is about as funny as a kid from a PBS show throwing a tantrum during the middle of a Lifetime drama. Sure it sounds like a good laugh on paper, but so does page 67 of the Kama Sutra. And don\u2019t blame me if your partner never wants to sleep with you again after that experience.",

            "content": "Ai Yazawa did it again.\r\nNANA is even better than Paradise Kiss for me. I love all the elements that make up the plot &ndash; Music, fashion, a little (a lot) of drama which goes hand in hand with some comedy and finally, Girl Power! It&rsquo;s almost as if Ai Yazawa knew what I like to see in an anime series.\r\nThe story revolves around Nana Komatsu (Hachi) and Nana Oosaki &ndash; how they live their lives and accomplish their goals, how they interact with the various men in their lives and the friendship between the both of them. They go through all of this with alot of tears and thankfully, a lot of laughs as well. The other characters are great too, especially the members of the Black Stones. Yasu is a bad-ass but altruistic lawyer/drummer, Shin is the adorable, childish bassist and Nobu, the all around boy next door guitarist. I like the members of Trapnest too, but my favorite has to be Naoki. He&rsquo;s really funny.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of times when I almost cried, especially when it comes to Ren and Nana O&rsquo;s relationship. It&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re a rock n&rsquo; roll Romeo and Juliet. There&rsquo;s also Hachi&rsquo;s MANY relationships, I don&rsquo;t want to give out spoilers but let me say Shoji sucks and Nobu rocks! ;)\\n\\n\r\nAi Yazawa and Madhouse is the perfect anime team I can think of. The animation was of course, very well done (although there were a lot of repeated scenes &ndash; laziness!). The character designs were sleek and modern. The color coordination is something to be lauded as well. The colors represent the clash of Hachi (bright and luminous) and Nana O&rsquo;s (Dark and Strong) personalities &ndash; Even though they differ they go well with each other.\\n\\n\r\nI really like the voice acting too. A lot of familiar names are found in NANA&rsquo;s cast list, such as Romi Paku as Nana Oosaki and Aya Hirano as Reira Serizawa. There&rsquo;s also one of my favorite male seiyus, Tomokazu Seki as Nobu Terashima, who happens to be one of my favorite characters from the anime. I also like KAORI, Hachi&rsquo;s seiyu. Her voice really matched Hachi&rsquo;s personality, in fact, every seiyu did a good job in portraying their respective characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe music rocked, of course. NANA&rsquo;s music made me a huge fan of Anna Tsuchiya. I like how varied the tracks are. &ldquo;Rose&rdquo; is a little bit dark and gloomy, while &ldquo;Kuroi Namida&rdquo; is sad and weepy, then there&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo;, my favorite because it&rsquo;s really upbeat and energetic. The insert song &ldquo;Zero&rdquo; is another favorite. OLIVIA&rsquo;s equally just as good. I still can&rsquo;t get over &ldquo;A Little Pain&rdquo;. The emotions embedded in the song really touch me. &ldquo;Wish&rdquo; and &ldquo;Starless Night&rdquo; were also nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint would be the abundance of recaps. I don&rsquo;t understand why there are so many recaps. Maybe they wanted more screen time for Junko and Kyosuke? This one isn&rsquo;t really a complaint, but I have to note the excessive amount of nudity (including frontal nudity) throughout the series. Since the anime depicts a more accurate account of mature relationships, I recommend NANA to mature audiences only.\\n\\n\r\nIt was almost painful for me that the show had to end and with such a sad conclusion too (at least for me). Thank goodness the manga is still ongoing and there are hints of a second season.",

            "content": "NANA is one of those shows that no matter how stupid it is at times, you still find yourself liking it. I would classify this show as a guilty pleasure because in all honesty, it can be compared to teen shows such as One Tree Hill or Dawson's Creek. That's how annoying it is. Despite all that, I still enjoyed NANA to a certain extent. I would recommend it, but not to everyone. Is it a decent show to watch? Yes. Is it as good as everyone says it is? No. \r\nStory (C) - First of all, let me just say that NANA can bepretty ridiculous. Everyone in the show throws around the word love like it means nothing, and everyone has sex with eachother without thinking twice about it. Like I said before, the content of the show is your typical teen drama. NANA is very stylistic though, and can cover up all of these flaws with the way everything is presented. So what I'm really trying to say is that Nana is all flash and no substance. It's a stylized, glossy, teen soap opera. It's a basic girly slice of life story, so I don't think too many guys will be interested in it. I liked the first half of the show a lot better than the second half. In the beginning we get introduced to Nana Komatsu and Nana Osaki. They're both 20 years old and coincidentally meet eachother on a train while moving to Tokyo. Their personalities are immensely different, which is something I liked. They end up renting an apartment together and become friends. The show starts out by explaining Nana Komatsu's (later nicknamed Hachiko, or Hachi for short) background and establishes that she's somewhat easy with guys and falls in love at first sight all the time. She moves to Tokyo to be with her boyfriend, Shouji. We also see Nana Osaki's past and we discover that she has never met her father before and that her mother abandoned her when she was four. She decides to move to Tokyo to achieve her dream of becoming a singer. She's much different with guys and has only had one love so far in her life. This is the basic story for the show. Simple, but interesting. The first few episodes present the story in a way that kept me engaged and anticipating the next episode. I liked how it seemed as if Hachiko's life and Nana's life were two completely different, parallel stories that just happened to collide. Hachiko has her friends and her boyfriend, while Nana has her band (called the Black Stones, or BLAST for short). Nana and Hachi's friendship is what ties these two world's together. Later in the show, their relationship isn't as strong. The story starts focusing on their love lives way more than their friendship. I mean I'm a girl, and I like romance like any other girl, but there's only so much I can take. It would be different if what was happening in their love lives was actually realisitc, but a lot of the situations they get in are really stupid and can be easily solved if they just talked it out. The story also starts focusing on the love lives of Nana's band members which I really didn't care about because they were just as annoying. The main flaw in the story is that there was too much romance and not enough friendship. I also don't understand why every summary of the show says that Hachi is looking for love and happiness while Nana is looking for fame and recognition. Nana's band doesn't even become famous until like 30 episodes into the show, and they don't even show her singing that much (which is supposed to be her \"passion\" in life). Most of the time she's just moping about her boyfriend who left her to join another band called Trapnest. When they do reconcile, their romance isn't very....romantic. All they do is have sex all the time. I realized that NANA started out with an interesting story that turned into nothing more than a bunch of people having sex  and \"falling in and out of love\" with eachother.\\n\\n\r\nArt (A-) - I liked the art in NANA because it went with the style of the story. The creators of the show really knew what they were doing when creating the atmosphere and tone of the show. Sometimes the facial expressions can look a little weird though, like when they're supposed to be angry it actually looks like they're smiling. I'm not sure if that was for comedic effect, but it just looked weird sometimes. Another thing I didn't like was how big everyone's foreheads were, but I guess that's just the style that the author of the manga wanted. The shading can also look a little bit awkward, but other than that I didn't have any problems with the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound (A-)  - Overall, the music in NANA went well with everything that was happening. The OPs and EDs were pretty catchy. A lot of the music used throughout the show is also featured as songs that BLAST or Trapnest sings during concerts. I thought that was pretty cool. The way the music was integrated into the show also helped create emotional moments and make moments that seemed pretty stupid and unbelievable work better. The music in the show was good, but ultimately another reason why the show is more style than substance. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (C+) - The characters in NANA are a problem. Hachi and Nana are both likeable characters, and I liked them a lot, but I just didn't understand why they were so stupid sometimes! In the beginning they kind of reminded me of how people would act in real life.Those were the times when the show succeeded. Later they did things that were so lame that I started not to like them anymore. \\n\r\nHachi - She's a very bubbly and friendly girl who's a little self absorbed and immature. She's always looking for someone she can fall in love with. I sympathized with her because I know how girls are, and I know that she really did just want to find someone who would love her and take care of her. I liked her in the beginning (even though her personality can be...irritating) because I know a lot of girls who act like her, and she seemed somewhat realistic. She sleeps with 3 guys during the course of the show, but at one point I realized something...why are so many guys even dating her? Before I watched the show I was expecting the characters to actually have lives, but I soon figured out that Hachi doesn't have a job, (besides temporary ones like working as a sales girl, and an assistant at an office) and she can barely take care of herself. She randomly went to art school even though she didn't have talent (is it possible to go to art school without talent?) and I'm guessing she dropped out? I don't really know, but all I know is that she isn't really good at anything except cooking.  Later in the show there's a situation where she has to choose between two guys and for some reason she loves both of them even though one of them treats her like trash. In my mind I was thinking \"this isn't really a tough decision here...\" but of course everything had to be overdramatic and unrealisitc. She \"loves\" so many people that I just stopped caring. \\n\r\nNana - At first I really liked Nana because she was independent, and a lot more mature than Hachi. She's cool and focused, and her style is kind of goth-punk. It seemed like Nana's goal in life was to become famous and she wasn't really focused on relationships that much. Then a few episodes later we find out that Nana was living with some guy that left her even though he still loves her and she still loves him. Whenever they're together they're either having sex or talking about how they love eachother and want to grow old together. She's always relying on her band members to be there for her, which I understood because of her situation with her mom. I liked her emotional depth, but it wasn't really explored that much. Instead there was too much time spent on the thing with her boyfriend. She would always talk about how singing was her life, but it didn't seem like it was her life to me. Nana also doesn't have a real job, and even though I liked her the best out of the two, I was really annoyed and tired of her by the end. She started losing that edge that made her cool in the beginning. She also didn't have any other hobbies besides playing with her band. \\n\r\nBLAST Members - All these characters started out as just supporting characters in Nana and Hachi's lives, but eventually they start taking over the show! There was lot of time spent on Shin's romantic life that I didn't care about. Nobu was ok I guess, but I didn't understand how he randomly started \"loving\" Hachi after a day. I liked Nana and Yasu's romantic tension, but that also didn't go anywhere. Everyone just started to get on my nerves. Trapnest Members - There's Ren, who's Nana's boyfriend, and is always whining about how he loves Nana but I never really got why they were sooo in love. He also didn't have a good childhood growing up so I guess that was something they bonded with, but his relationship with Nana just isn't developed enough. Reira's romance with Shin is tedious and exhausting when it doesn't have to be, and don't even get me started on Takumi and how annoying he was. The other guy in the band doesn't have too much screen time which is good because he wasn't that interesting.\\n\r\nThen there's Hachi's friends, Jun and Kyosuke, who aren't shown that much. At first I kinda liked them, but later on in the show they didn't really serve a purpose. Jun started out being the one with sense in the friendship between her and Hachi, but the things that she would say later in the show just didn't make any sense to me. If I knew someone was cheating on my friend I'm pretty sure I would tell them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (C-) - NANA starts out being very enjoyable despite the fact that most, if not all of the characters have no idea what love is, or what it means to be in love. NANA is enjoyable in the same way that every other sappy teen show is enjoyable. Not because it's realistic but because it's drama. Annoying, over the top, mushy drama. Everything that happens is blown out of proportion so much, and simple things that happen are transformed into emotional moments. I gotta say, I was sucked in. But after awhile it really does start to get old. Without any real content to fall back on, NANA turns into a typical show about relationships. It's even more dissapointing because there was a lot to work with. Maybe if the author didn't have so much of this beating around the bush stuff. A lot of things could have been resolved if the characters weren't so annoying. I guess in some ways it is realistic because people do act like that sometimes, but NANA was a little too over the top. There were some genuine emotional moments that hit home, but overall, the only reason why this show would be worth watching is for the presentation. All the flaws are covered so well with the stylized scenes and dramatic speeches and narrations from the characters that it kept me wanting more...for awhile...until it started to become so tedious that I couldn't wait for it to end. I can understand why girls like this anime a lot, but it's probably because they couldn't see past the appearance and production of the show, which definitely was impressive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (C+) - If you're a fan of any kind of teen drama/romance show out there then you'll LOVE this show. Trust me. It's not that I didn't like it. As I already said, I enjoyed a lot of it (mostly in the beginning) and there was a nice blend of comedy, drama, and romance, but there was definitely too much emphasis on the relationships...and sex. The good parts about the show, Nana and Hachi's contrasting personalities, their friendships, their backgrounds, were really good but there just wasn't enough of that. Even if we forget the fact that everyone in this show falls in love after a day, there still would be too many shortcomings in the story to give it a high recommendation. NANA is definitely rated too high on this site, and although I enjoyed this show I only enjoyed it for what it is - which is a superficial, relationship-heavy, melodramatic, teen soap opera.",

If you enjoy your shoujo or romance then NANA is a must see.\r\nThe story itself focuses on two young ladies named Nana and how they came to know each other and connected through the similar experiences they share in life. The first couple episodes introduces the main characters involved and spends an equal amount of time giving us some background on each Nana, then showing how they became acquainted. Then the main story kicks in, which actually feelsmore like 2 separate stories connected only through the strong bond of friendship between the both of them. Nana Komatsu&rsquo;s (Hachi) story is about her living her life to attain true love, whereas Nana Osaki&rsquo;s story is more about her dream to become a professional vocalist in a band. Even with all the heavy drama and real life dilemmas, there&rsquo;s still plenty of light humour to take your mind of things. Yet with this being a shoujo romance, it may be hard to determine whether this will have a happy ending or not.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is full of some very appealing characters that pretty much orbit around the two Nanas. Nana Komatsu (Hachiko) is an energetic, love struck young lady who&rsquo;s at the receiving end of many jokes and also many romantic hardships. Nana Osaki is more of a mysteriously dark and serious young lady who tries her best to support her friends through their hardships whilst dealing with her own. They each have their own circle of friends that do well as supporting characters, but still have some perplexing issues of their own and what makes it more interesting is seeing how these diverse people interact with each other, be it friends, lovers or rivals.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this series is near-perfect and that is thanks to the expertise of Madhouse, as the art style matches Ai Yazawa&rsquo;s vision perfectly. The character designs are elegant and very attractive (both guys &amp; girls), with stylish outfits to suit their varying personalities. Shame there was a fair bit of scene recycling going on.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to choose my least favourite aspect of this series then it would have to be the music but that may have been because I had high expectations of it. Personally I found the BGM to be pretty bland, which was compiled of a bunch of uninspiring melodies. The main redeeming factor came in the form of the invoking OP and ED themes, which were also used as insert songs throughout.\\n\\n\r\nOverall NANA is an incredible shoujo anime series that I will always remember for its realistic portrayal of different forms of romance and the emotional baggage that comes with it. The music subplot was incorporated well, as it gave me some insight into how things go on however it would have been better if it had more songs by Olivia. Surprisingly this series constantly gave the urge to see the next episode, due to all the major developments and cliff-hanger endings and it&rsquo;s a shame things had to come to an end, but at least I was left feeling satisfied.\\n\\n\r\n^_^\\n",

            "content": "Shoujo is probably the last word I would use to describe this anime.  \r\nNANA is possibly one of the most complicated romances I have ever come across; this complexity is what makes it so amazing, outstanding and fascinating. It is because NANA is not a typical shoujo which makes it suitable for a wider audience; it's far from your average school-life-love-triangle romance.  This anime will make anyone laugh, cry and feel a connection with the protagonists by the end of 47 episodes.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nCan anyone have any more drama in their life than the characters from NANA? In my opinion, the summary abovedoesn't really do the anime justice. What\u2019s so special about this anime is that it makes you think deeply. You come to realise how small the world really is, two girls roughly the same age, with the same name, heading towards the same place but both aiming for different goals. Initially, it may seem like the anime focuses on the two Nanas\u2019 lives running parallel with one another, day to day life just like that, but further into the anime, it makes people realise that even though the two Nanas have a lot in common and almost become as close as sisters, they are still extremely different to each other in person and opinions, thus creating conflicting situations. The anime revolves around how these situations are resolved for the better good of someone close to them, selflessness and selfishness. Drama is primarily dominant in this anime, as it continuously escalates, I can assure you that not one single episode is a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nThe art style in NANA is very unique; it differs from the conventional anime art style you may see in other anime. The characters are drawn very stylishly, each with their own unique appearance, the landscape is drawn almost as well as the characters and everything is very distinguishable and pleasant to look at. If you\u2019ve seen Ai Yazawa\u2019s previous work of Paradise Kiss, it is very similar to that. Only complaint I would have is that there is the occasional blurriness, but seeing as this is a 2006/2007 anime, it\u2019s forgivable. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nThe voice actors were perfect in their roles, I saw nothing weird or out of place with how the voice actors matched with the character\u2019s personality of which they were voicing. I really enjoyed the OST of NANA, the OPs and EDs were fitting in every way, I found myself looking forward to the next OP/ED each time. Anna Tsuchiya\u2019s vocals really brought out the punk-like character of Nana Osaki and Olivia Lufkin managed to convey the gentleness of Reira. An excellent OST as expected from a music based anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were very unique, whether it be a significant past story or an underlying secret, each character had a special trait that separated them from each other. The characters were generally very likable throughout, they were all characters that perhaps people may find them easy to relate to since NANA has quite a realistic element to it. As the story progressed there was noticeable change in the characters\u2019 attitudes and personalities, each one developing in their own way through influences of the people around them. In my opinion, Ai Yazawa\u2019s characters are always well thought out and interesting which makes them so hard to hate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall - 10/10\\n\r\nI gave this anime a 10 without hesitation. Overall, I really and thoroughly enjoyed this anime; each episode has something waiting for you and will never leave you disappointed. I watched this anime twice over and I ended up loving it even more by the second time. It is definitely the best romance anime I have seen by far and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a not-too-long but not-too-short romance that will leave you content and thinking about whether events in everyday life are merely a coincidence or down to fate itself.\\n",

            "content": "Gotta say, this is one of the most disappointing series to show up in the MAL top list. On the one hand, I found most of the characters really boring. Especially \"Hachiko\" who I couldn't sympathize with at all, and found I felt no pity for her at all in her fate. The other Nana was somewhat better, but overall, all of the female characters come across as being incredibly weak people who have nothing else in life to live for but to succumb to their men. Jun strikes me as the only one with any inner strength but alas she's a side character wenever really get to know well.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime, it's important to also consider the artwork, and in this area the series fails even harder. Obviously anime allows a great deal of freedom in styles, but in all cases it has to \"look right\". It's not successful art if I'm distracted from the story because the drawings look wrong. There are several angles where the artist clearly cannot draw heads and they look bloated and misshapen. The men are all strange giants with spidery appendages that look like they would break if they bumped into anything. In several scenes, I noted the ratios were ridiculously wrong and it appeared that arms came out of a person's mid-section rather than the shoulder. Again, if I'm noticing these things instead of the nuances of the story, there's a problem in the delivery here. Another point I'd like to mention is that characters that frequently are supposed to look angry appear to be smiling. It looks stupid and completely destroys any semblance of intended drama in the scene.\\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly not the worst show I've seen (I can think of plenty of harem series that are worse, for example), but I'd steer clear of this one.",

            "content": "While the anime adds a definite charm that you cannot get just from the manga, it also adds so many flaws that I had to stop watching it.\r\nThe most utterly incomprehensible flaw is that Blast turns out to be the least punk music possible. Nana's vocals sound like a Japanese, girlier version of that mid-90s Creed movement, and nothing in the instrumentals is slightly punky. This was a lot better when I could imagine them being something like a modern, trying too hard to be trendy, Japanese Sex Pistols in the manga.\r\nThe art is definitely another terrible translation. In the manga, nothing is especially fantastic,but nothing is ever glaringly wrong. The anime has one glaring anime that makes it impossible for me to actually attentively watch the series, which is that characters haphazardly gain a white, vertical stripe on their face. It is supposed to be a lazy attempt at depth/shadowing, but it just makes every character look like clowns for large durations of time. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth sometimes, and some of its quirks are nice, but it ends up usually being clumsy if anything. I understand it is probably a stylistic choice, but it is not a good one. It especially goes poorly with their attempts at gag art.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, for having a lot of big shot voice actors, they actually mesh really, really poorly. The voice acting really often sounds flat and tepid. I was surprised since I like so many of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe story loses little, and the translation from manga to anime does not especially hurt the characters, but with the other flaws screaming at me, it was just something I could not get through. Judging by the relentlessly breathless and positive reviews, no one else finds these flaws as noteworthy though.",

I read the synopsis, and it sounded okay, but it does not do justice to the show at all. \r\nI wouldn't say that Nana is shoujo. It has more sophistication and more intricate plot lines than the average shoujo. It treats the characters as people by acknowledging their feelings, their backgrounds, their motives, and that allowed for you to not only get attached to the characters, but to understand them. The characters developed a lot throughout the show, and your perception of them changed as information was revealed to you. \r\nI would definitelydescribe the show as beautiful, but it's also a little harrowing. It made me laugh, it made me choke up and almost cry (okay maybe just \"cry\"), it made me throw the phone that I was watching the show on across the room, but most importantly, it made me marathon all the episodes. \\n\r\nThe art style was kind of unique, but I grew to really like it. The animation was beautiful. The sound was great (with the exception of a song or two that didn't quite fit my tastes) and the sound played a huge part in the story. It added so much to my enjoyment to the point that I don't think you could enjoy the story as much in manga form because of it. \\n\r\nReally, I could go on talking about all of my favorite plot points, details, songs, characters, etc. But all you really need to know is that I have nothing but praise for this show. It's one of the best and most satisfying anime I have seen in a while, and I fully recommend it to anyone who wants to see a brilliant show about love and life.",

            "content": "Love triumphs the human soul in ways we can\u2019t fathom, and how we can contain it also remains unexplained. Whether it is love in a romantic or friendly fashion, it has always been one of the most sought out themes in stories in every medium imaginable. We are used to the idealistic form of love with many tropes and literary devices, but now we\u2019ve grown to appreciate the \u201crealistic\u201d types of romance. The type I  am refering to is a romance that tries to portray the reality we live in rather than what we hope it will be. Nana can speak for itself asone anime to be an achievement of perfecting that level of story.\\n\\n\r\nNana starts as your typical best friend story with opposite personalities; the bubbly, kind of dumb, girly girl and the no-nonsense rocker girl that meet each other by coincidence. What\u2019s oddly alluring about how these two play off their relationship is the fact that it doesn\u2019t seem forced at all. They don\u2019t just start as best friends. They\u2019re mere acquaintances that learn about how each other live out their lives through their work and family. It becomes a hilarious tirade between both characters in typical Josei fashion that we grow to enjoy. Not just between the two Nana\u2019s, but also with the other characters and their unique personalities. It\u2019s that break that makes you wish that the show was longer, so we could have more moments like them, even with its 50 episodes running time.\\n\\n\r\nBut with comedy comes heartbreak, and Nana comes into it with full throttle. There is the tragic relationship between Nana Osaki, the rocker, and Ren, that will admittedly cause some tears to form. The reason for this being how well it pulls in the romantic aura through narration and expository dialogue, which pulls you into how they were once a happy couple. Then there\u2019s Nana Komatsu, the childish one, and the problems of how she guides her life with being the girlfriend of Takumi and Nobu. While there are some aspects to the drama that was a bit rushed, it serves a definite purpose on how Nana matures from a ditzy woman into a responsible one to taking care of the people she loves, especially Nana Osaki. It develops Nana Komatsu quite nicely, and also Nana Osaki and how their relationship develops through whatever twist and turn it makes you go through.\\n\\n\r\nFor the supporting roles that pop up in Nana, it\u2019s a mixed bag. In that, there are great ones, but others are just not as strong. This all comes into perspective based on the fact that some are given more development than the ones that seem not to be bothered. Some are even given a more significant presence to previous episodes, but barely get any more screen-time for us to be fully invested in the entire cast. But what does make up for this is how every single one of the characters legitimately feels like real human beings. Not just from how relatable they are in terms of their problems and personalities, but also by the lack of cliches they could\u2019ve easily used to lessen the impact of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve watched, or read for that matter, any shoujo anime, Nana\u2019s art should be familiar territory for you. They do very well with the various comedic expressions on the characters\u2019 faces that are always charming to watch. It does seem jarring at first to see characters as really tall and skinny human beings, but that does give every character a lovely physical uniqueness to them. Even though there are instances of animation not being that fluid, especially with the dreadful concert scenes where it repeats animations over and over, the art style will still spark some charm to anyone with an open mind.\\n\\n\r\nWith a show centered around music, it\u2019s all about music, right? Oh yeah, there was. In all seriousness, the music aspect of the show narrative-wise is not too shabby, both in how it sounds and how it fits seamlessly with the romantic story. The songs are your typical post-punk rock music with some beautiful guitar chords, and drum fills that may sound more like your generic J-Rock song. Singing is where high praise is needed for the music and how Olivia Lufkin\u2019s voice resonates perfectly to the somber, heartbreaking tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic can levitate us into a better state of mind when we have been through a difficult life. That\u2019s the central theme that\u2019s the focal point to Nana. Nana and her band members reasoning for wanting to form a band in the first place was to express themselves in a way that was outside of the cultural norm. Ai Yazawa has a knack for showcasing the passion of the characters for what they do and trying to meet the end goal of being a successful band. But what makes it brilliant is how there is no bullshit to how she writes the outcome. There\u2019s no extreme end to it all; it\u2019s just a realistic scenario that we are most likely to meet when we try to reach our hopes and dreams. Not that there is some hopeless end to Nana, but it\u2019s an excellent middle ground between success and failure that feels hopeless, but hopeful at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nWhat manifests out of it all is a beautiful amalgamation of romantic comedy, music, and slice of life that sums up Nana in a great nutshell. Funny, sad, inspiring, and empathetic to its core, Nana has more going for it than your generic shoujo anime. It\u2019s one where there is so much to be had in it than just typical romance that you\u2019d find elsewhere. Even if you can\u2019t relate to people in love, being in a band, or experiencing breakups, Nana knows how people connect individually through friendships. And that is something we can all relate to.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

            "content": "Nana...\r\nSuch a beautiful and unique show among the Shoujo genre. We've all have fallen in love at some point in our lives, maybe it didn't turn out for the best or you couldn't stay in love for long because of other circumstances. Ai Yazawa makes a identifiable world that a lot of girls have been in, the feeling of, \"Does he love me?\" or \"Am I worthy enough for him?\" She makes it as realistic as possible and does this in a very subtle way not a lot of Shoujo anime pull off quit as well. It can also be watched by guys as well,it's not just limited to just girls. It's also not a cheesy romantic drama only girls can watch, there are plenty of male characters that men can relate to as well. They have personalities and desires just like the female characters do, so you won't be complaining that they have no personality. Another thing this anime does right is the drama. It hurts when you see the characters have to suffer. It doesn't just point to a character crying and saying, \"Feel something.\" It's like getting to be good friends with someone and watch them cry. It's more effective and less hair-pulling that way. Ai Yazawa shows you the character's personalities, then their back story in the first few episodes, and then shows their dreams and desires. That's how you actually feel something for the characters, you show them their inner and outer shell instead of an empty shell with nothing inside to show your emotions to. Now, shall we jump into the beautiful and tragic world of Nana?\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the romance in this show was handled in a way that you'll never expect. The main female, Hachi (Nana), is looking for love throughout the show. You'd think she'd end up with the first guy that pops up into the show, but that doesn't happen. It goes into a more original direction then most shows of its genre.  I won't spoil it for you, but you wouldn't expect it in the first half at all.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the story almost never got rushed at all. It was always well paced and put together. You might think they'll forget about a character or part of the story, but as soon as you think that, it comes back and shocks you of how much it remembers itself. It has a nice balance to it that not a lot of shows do a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAnother positive is the themes of heart break, loneliness, and fake love that are prominent throughout the show. It's something not a lot of Shoujo do and when they do, they don't really turn out to be the best written things out there, but it really makes a lot of sense here. Why? Because we get to learn these characters desires, personalities, and sometimes they don't even want to do it to certain characters. It does feel like they put effort into making these characters feel human and it really does show.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nThere's only one con that prevents it from getting a ten though, this mostly has to deal with what genre this show is in rather then the story itself, the comedy can really get on some people's nerves. There are some moments that'll have you rolling on the floor laughing, but for the most part, it uses those usual anime expressions for comedic effect. If you're not a fan of that style of comedy, this show isn't going to change your mind about that.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 10/10 (Fantastic!)\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nIt's nice to see that there's a Shoujo that doesn't use gigantic eyes on their female characters. Ai Yazawa has a unique way of drawing her characters. Instead of the ordinary big eyed characters, she has a nice balance of realism vs anime/manga. The facial features are exaggerated but not too exaggerated to the point where their hands are as big as their eyes and mouths too small and noses as well. All of the characters have their own design that stood out among the rest. Like Nana's black hair and purple mascara, Hachi's innocent face, etc. It fit every character's personality and attitude. Everything had a nice evenness to it and it all adds up to memorable character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe studio who animated this was Studio Madhouse back in 2006, they're responsible for such masterfully animated shows like Death Note and Black Lagoon. So you would expect some great animation from this studio, because Death Note came around the time that Nana was still airing. Let's talk about the openings, They were wonderful and awesome for 2006 and even almost 9 years later. What's fascinating is that they used CG for the parts where Nana was on stage singing. It was very effective and what's good about this is that they don't use CG for the whole openings. It's a nice balance of CG and the animated parts of them. Overall, Madhouse did a great job on the animation. Never any shortcuts and it looks like they spent a lot of time for this.\\n\\n\r\nMinor Con:\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs might not appeal to everyone. It'll be hard to get used to them in the first few episodes, but when the show starts going along, you won't be that distracted by them as much as you did in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 (Wonderful!)\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nThere hasn't been any soundtracks out there that were as impactful, catchy, and beautiful as Nana's was. To name some tracks, there was Winter Sleep, Shadow of Love, Stand by Me, and Zero. The soundtrack is either one of those things you could listen to after a stressful day or before a party with friends. It's not limited to tracks that are just depressing and that's it, just like many things about the show, it's equivalent. It all adds up to one of the best soundtracks that you'll ever hear.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings were constructive and enduring. Always catching your ears the first time you hear them. They're something you'll be humming all day long. The first one titled \"Rose\" was memorable, tear jerking, and of course, catchy. Something you'll listen to when you want to listen to something elegant. The second one, titled \"Wish\" Is beautiful, impactful, and fit the show so well. It shows the pain and struggles that were going on around that time of the show. Great to listen to if you want to listen to a calming song. Finally, the one titled \"Lucy\" Is the most catchy out of all the other openings. If you want an up-beat song, this is something you should listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 (Near perfect)\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nEvery single character has perfect development, interactions, and personalities. You can look at one character and can name at least three personality traits from them. When you watch these characters, you'll feel like you're watching somebody's life in an anime. I won't be able to cover every character, so let's talk about the main females.\\n\\n\r\nNana Osaki:\\n\\n\r\nNana is an idependant, strong willed, and a laid-back person. When she gets to be roommates with Hachi (Nana) she also turns to have a huge heart for the people she cares about and is devoted to them. When Hachi is in a pickle, she is always there to run to her side and help her. If you even try to hurt one of her friends, she'll beat you up. She knows what it's like to be alone with no one to run to. Her mother left her and her grandmother watched over her then died when she was sixteen.\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of weird how her and Hachi get along so well. It might be because she needs a friend that can spice up her world. It's one of the reasons why they get along so well. To her, Hachi is like a little sister to her and she's the older and more mature one. She gets Hachi out of crazy situations because it's really hard to go through them on her own.\\n\\n\r\nShe has the perfect personality and a very humane one at that. She just feels like a best friend to you as you watch it. Her number one priority in life is to find happiness and is something a lot of us can relate to. You get attached to her dilemmas and when she gets emotional about something, you can just feel it just by looking at her. This character is one of the strongest female characters through personality you'll ever see.\\n\\n\r\nHachi (Nana):\\n\\n\r\nHachi is a person who is naive, a peacemaker, and a person who cares about others more then herself. Love is a huge part of her life and tries to find her \"prince charming.\" So she tries to flirt with all these guys to find the one because without love, she wouldn't be able to live. Some people in real life call her a slut but the way the anime portrays it, she's a young girl looking for someone she can live with for the rest of her life. Loneliness is something she can't live with and that's why she's a social butterfly.\\n\\n\r\nWhen she becomes roommates with Nana, she instantly gets attached to her. She is almost always a fun, caring, and a devoted person towards Nana and to others. She has a hard time getting mad at others, it just takes a lot away from her soul. She hides her inner feelings in order to keep the peace between her friends. She's such a caring and beautiful character both inside and outside. Thanks to her caring nature, she gives Nana an extra push to reach her dreams. Hachi an example of a beautiful person both inside and outside, although, there's only one problem with her character.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nHachi's indecisiveness will most likely bug you, sometimes you'll be yelling at her like, \"Don't do that you idiot!\" She has a very hard time making decisions so she relies on other characters to help her make the right decision. It's what prevents the characters from getting a ten.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nUnexpected romance, Well paced story, Beautiful themes, Unique character designs, Fluid animation, Inpactful soundtrack, Catchy openings, and Well developed characters.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nSometimes irritating comedy, Kind of hard art to get used to, and Hachi's indecisiveness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 (Great Show!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nana is worth watching for Shoujo fans and for people who love romantic dramas. You'll get attached to the characters in a heartbeat and almost everything else. Get to it as soon as possible, Nana is 100% worth your time watching!\\n",

            "content": "Nana for me was never a recommendation nor was it and anime I saw discussed on every forum, it was litarilly an anime/manga I stumbled upon one night whilst looking for a cute romantic series. I think that was a really lucky night. \r\nNana is honestly and anime I love a lot. Its one of the most real series I've seen.  I had kinda had enough of the typical high school harems that were all the same. Whist watching Nana I found something completely new and different. It still had the romantic feel I was looking for, but portrayed in a more adult way.And how can I forget the music in the series. When I intitally saw that this was a music series, I was kinda put off, because I did not see my self becoming very into the music of the series, however my percption had completely been changed in the first 5 mins. The opening song of the series \"Rose\" Is the best opening I've seen ever heard, and there are several opening I like, but this was a completely different feel and gave a sneak peek into what I was in for, for the next 47 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe two main Nana's of the series are complete opposites, which is why the series works soo well. We have cute, girly Nana AKA Hachi and The tomboy, rock chick edgy, Nana Osaki. They come together to make a great balance to the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this series is one that is often overlooked and is really great if given the chance. I personally have now seen the series 3 times and have finsihed off the manga. which quite rare for me, but it's the type of series that deserves the effort. It takes you on a rollacosta of emotions, with its light hearted comedy and it's touching romance. This is definatly a more mature approche to an otherwise teenage catagory in anime and manga, and why I appreciate it soo much.",

            "content": "Yes, I was initially drawn to NANA by Paradise Kiss. After having watched all of ParaKiss in about a day, I was left craving more of that special flavor of drama and the striking art style. However, I was not prepared for the treat I was in for when watching NANA.\r\nStory-\r\nWhat really struck me about the story was how the two parts of the story are weaved together. The two main characters' lives and personalities are so strikingly different that when they meld, it is truly something beautiful. The span of the story really helps one feel like they go somewhere, accomplish something, while watchingthis show. Once they intertwine and effect each other, that's when the story becomes something special. The drama, at times, feels like it is just taking soap opera cliches from the book, but for a change, I don't mind. The way it is written gives the show a feeling of reality, and the trials they face are compelling and moving.\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\nI love this art style. It isn't anything you would see normally, and it never gives you the feeling that they had a low budget or were ever lazy. The detail and color is enough not to be too distracting, but enough eye candy to hold you to it. All of the characters are visually appealing, and even though some may say its hard to get used to, I love it, and had no problems at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nIts a show about music, right? So the audio must be pretty impressive, and it doesn't disappoint. Anna Tsuchiya and her gritty voice sang perfectly as NANA Osaki. I always enjoyed listening to the opening and ending themes. My personal favorite was &quot;Kuroi Namida,&quot; more of a melancholy song, but the gritty love song, &quot;Rose,&quot; was another one of my favorites. OLIVIA was a nice contrast to ANNA. Her voice was a bit more smooth and feminine, soft, but still strong. The first ending song, &quot;A Little Pain,&quot; was my personal favorite of hers, because of its beauty and the sadness it bares. I always looked forward to it at the end, hearing the opening riff within the last couple lines of dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nI also really enjoyed the voice acting. I never at one point thought that the voices were annoying or wrong for the characters. The darker characters, like Nana Osaki and Ren, had voices that could carry that impression, while the cuter sweeter characters, like Hachiko, also had appropriate voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines. Without so many understandable and meaningful characters, this show wouldn't be nearly as good. The story itself is meant to contrast the two women, and it does that amazingly. The growth of these individuals is clearly evident, and does the 47 episode length justice. At times, the choices they made made me angry, but it is then that you realize how nicely human flaws are present here. Everyone makes mistakes, and this slice of life should be no different.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a really enjoyable show. I tore right through it, and despite the length, was left wanting more. With rumors of a season two, I can't wait to see where this show may take us next. With such personable characters, emotional music, nontraditional and beautiful animation, and the evolving story, I could definitely watch this one a next time around, and am dying to know where these characters go.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThe story is about 2 Nanas who meet accidentally and they become really good friends.\r\nIts really good anime which depicts the life of celebrities the difficulties they face and the past which lingers.\r\nIts is also a story about how the small steps we take in life might change our whole life. Its also makes you think about future and the present situations and analyse properly so that our lives may turn out to be better without hurting our friends and families much.\r\nIts not a homosexual movie which i thought after reading other reviews and was not interested to watch but it is not that sort;)\\n\r\ncharacters:\\n\r\nyou would fall in love with both Nanas at first and rest it different for different people.one Nana is cheerful,funny and  fickle while the other is serious and ambitious, its really good combination to make the story cool.\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nSoundtrack, openings and endings are really awesome and the songs that come in between the story are also good. Even though it is a musical anime it is typically not much a musical you could never get bored listening to songs played in the anime as main focus is on story unlike the movies where you get bored as they play songs now and then often. \\n\r\nMy view:\\n\r\nAt first I thought does a slice of life need 47 episode?  but this one definitely doesn't make you regret watching them all..It doesn't bore you much, the part where you feel irritated is at episode 22 and early 30 th episodes where it seems as if you were given a tasty food when you are really hungry but it is snatch from you thats the feeling you get there but if you continue in next episodes, the feeling is compensated as it gets interesting.\\n\r\n Overall:  the ending was pretty cool, I didn't expect it I mean the last episode made me feel that way,  did it make me depressed? I don't know :P ,  the feeling is really different. But in the end it was worth a watch and its a slice of life, dont expect a ending in it...:)",

            "content": "\"I need your love, I'm a broken rose.\" - lyrics from the first opening.\r\nThe anime shows aired during 2007 - 2010 were usually the most phenomenal in my point of view. Shows today were lacking the deep sense of plot, enjoyment, drama and the whimsical world of comedy. These days it is hard to look for an anime that will make you re-watch when you have time and remember for a lifetime. Nana is one of those shows that is heart-wrenching, cheerful and life - changing. \r\nPlot: Nana's story would actually be like soap operas in TV but better. You can see how the storylinewas put in deep thought and everything was strategically planned. More drama and comedy also more romance.\\n\\n\r\nTo tell you the truth, I suspected that this is going to be a music themed anime wherein everything revolves around the world of music, soundtracks, bands and yeah. more music. I thought the two girls coincidentally met in a competition. They looked different so I thought the gothic Nana would sing some alternative rock and other punk style songs (I wasn't wrong about that) and the other who looks like a fragile and cheery girl would venture in pop, love songs, or maybe japanese cultured stuff. Soon, they end up being rivals. On the other hand, that isn't the case. Osaki Nana, one of the main characters explored in Tokyo and met this girl named Komatsu Nana. They both have dreams, Nana wanted to become a successful singer, the other would like to find a job and be independent at the same time, meet her boyfriend who has a long-distance relationship with her. They soon meet again and it led to a deep and happy friendship. Although, it was a bumpy road for the both of them, things did sort out in the end (or so I thought). Heavy and consecutive circumstances will arise like betrayal, abandonment and despicable fate. Moreover, there will also be happy events which you will never get enough. The drama behind the story can happen in reality. We can relate to some of the stories of the characters and we will dive in to their emotions like we feel them, or like we are actually in the story. Honestly, there will always be cliche acts in this show but the point is, they clearly caught my attention. Life will not always be a bed of roses so, there will be various tragic moments along the way. Above all, I give it 9 points.\\n\\n\r\nArt, 6.5: One of the weak points but, it is understandable. The characters, background and other effects really did belonged to Madhouse. The eyes, body structure and dark aura reminded me of Death Note. The color of the hair reminded me of Bokura ga Ita as well as the expression of the characters. Kudos to the background, they somehow paid attention to the detail considering how hard it is to make an anime. They have to make everything from scratch. Developing 47 episodes can be a handful plus it was flashed last 2007 so yeah, I can see why I couldn't appreciate the art that much. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Some where phenomenal, some where blowing my brains out, and some where just distracting. I really like songs by the fictional band, BLAST (bias aside) because they were more convincing and new to hear. I'm not a big fan of punk rock or punk bands but it's nice to give it a try. Sound effects were quite repetitive while it adds mood to the dramatic and joyous scenes. \\n\\n\r\nVA's\\n\r\nWe'll start with the people I know too well and my favorites:\\n\r\nOsaki Nana's seiyu (Romi Park): Suitable, cool and awesome. She has the whole package. From the lowness of the pitch to the (sometimes) out of pitch voice she makes when she is mad or complaining. She's definitely one great voice actress. As expected to the Best Voice Actress during the First Seiyu Awards. \\n\\n\r\nNobuo's Seiyuu (Seki Tomokazu): Also Kyo Sohma's voice. It's nice to hear a kinder version of him and also his subtleness and everything. For me, he has one of the distinguishable voice of all and he doesn't have a mediocre voice. On top of that, I really like his acting, he could be goofy and seemingly upset at some parts of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nKyosuke's VA (Suwabe Junichi): Great and very A-okay. The huskiness of his voice suited the character very well. He has the ideal old guy kind of gesture and voice. \\n\\n\r\nLayla's voice actress (Hirano Aya): Exceptional work as always. She can depict a dramatic and a cheerful voice for the character. She also won an award but I don't remember what it was. On the other hand, I hope she had more screen time because I have always adored her voice.\\n\\n\r\nPeople I don't really know that well.\\n\\n\r\nKomatsu Nana's, Ren's, Takumi's, and Shin's seiyus were diverse too. Although I'm not a big fan of them, I enjoyed hearing their voices. They were good in catching my attention when I get hooked up in every scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest, they did okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8:\\n\\n\r\nSplendid Characterization but I can only give a few words to some of the characters:\\n\\n\r\nHere goes:\\n\\n\r\nKomatsu Nana: The flirty, selfish but cute girl that always get admired by many people. She can be dependable but she can do things professionally if she gives her heart and soul to perfect it. She is a fan of BLAST and TRAPNEST. She receives too many heartaches in the story but she always get to switch to many guys. She is a bright version of foolish chicks around the world. Naive, a boy lover and can flirt with any guy they like. But I love this woman, seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOsaki Nana: The cool version of a naive chick. She is somewhat a gothic girl. An introvert, independent, and incredible woman. A beautiful singer who will always cherish her fans. She isn't a boy lover but ever since she got to be friends with Nobu, she never had a single female friend (setting Misato aside). She has some problems like promoting her pride and having separation anxiety (because of her terrible past). I love her so much and I like her calm and consistent attitude.  \\n\\n\r\nJunko: An awesome friend to Komatsu Nana. She is straightforward and most of the time she can say things that would literally wake a person up and decide in a mature manner. She's definitely not one of those whores who would give second-rate advices and comfort their friends like a whim. \\n\\n\r\nKyosuke: First Most loyal guy in the show.\\n\\n\r\nRen: A bassist/guitarist in the band. Almost the loyal guy in the show. He is in love with Nana. He has some issues like being guilty on fulfilling his dream. He will do everything for Nana in a heartbeat. \\n\\n\r\nNobuo: Short but the sweetest guy ever. He isn't reluctant to give help to troubled girls. He can be a natural when it comes to fascinating conversations with men and even with women.\\n\\n\r\nSachiko: WHORE.\\n\\n\r\nShouji: MAN WHORE.\\n\\n\r\nTakumi: THE REAL WHORE\\n\\n\r\nShinichi: cute and visibly insensitive. He is probably the most chilled-out person in the series. He doesn't react that much plus he's handsome.\\n\\n\r\nYasu: Caring, Loving, and Dependable. He is like the Batman of this series.\\n\\n\r\nReira/Layla: Adorable, sensitive and a good singer too.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, there were really hateable characters. I can never get enough of NANA unless they remove all these characters because they are the highlight and the powerhouse of this story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: It was one hell of a ride. I'm lost with words. I shed a tear in many parts of the anime. Everything was unbelievably what I've wanted. Sure, there are some unwanted sex scenes, ecchi, and a lot of matured content but I am no pretentious slut plus I'm already a young adult so yeah I can carry it. The tragedy could be somehow heartbreaking but I eventually got over it soon. It's fine for me since it is has a realistic synopsis. The thought that at some point, they are all \"I think I wanna die\" but the next thing you know, \"Let's be fucking happy you bitches!\" It wasn't a total waste of time. We can really see the saying \"Forgive and forget\" in this anime. I also noticed how knocked up the characters were, they were sacrificing everything for music. Example, leaving your only love to complete your goal, giving up your chance to have good money and taking over a family agenda to be a guitarist, prioritizing your band instead of just studying for your lawyer licenship, and etc.\\n\r\nGiving it an 8 would mean I'm satisfied. I can continue on living and get inspired by this masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: I think I said enough. Nana's story, music, and characters brighten up my days. Considering how I finished all episodes within 3 days (too long isn't it), I definitely didn't regret watching this show. I learned that life won't always be the way you plan it to be. I might as well just let things hit for me and accept them but I will definitely do better. \\n\\n\r\nTRAGEDY and HAPPINESS always go together in life. It is inevitable.\\n\\n\r\nNana isn't just another love story, but a moment of truth, friendship, hard work and so on.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love romance, drama and realistic characters and plot, check out NANA!",

            "content": "NANA is a regrettably incomplete work. It takes viewers on a journey with an intriguing destination, aggravates them with rocky bumps along the way, and then unceremoniously abandons them on the roadside in the middle of nowhere. The story unfolds in reasonably entertaining ways but is too frequently hamstrung by inadequate build and progression with regard to many core characters, and when combined with the abrupt conclusion to the series, bewildered viewers at the very end may be asking themselves, \"Huh? That's it?\", as they lament over NANA's wasted potential and wonder what could have been.\r\nFrom the opening narration, NANA teases a mysterious endgame thatimmediately hooks viewers. The titular characters, Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu, and their respective origins are then introduced with a delightful blend of comedy and drama in the handful of episodes that follow, and viewers become increasingly eager to see them begin their new lives together in Tokyo. As more people enter their lives throughout the course of the series, the two Nanas progressively encounter more problems, and incidentally, the show itself does, as well.\\n\\n\r\nNANA spreads itself too thin in juggling its multitude of characters. Consequently, many key players in the show are insufficiently characterized, and their relationships are woefully underdeveloped. This manifests in various problematic ways throughout the entire run of the series. For starters, certain characters seemingly change on a whim, ever malleable to the demands of the story. Romantic relationships between certain characters, too, blossom and wither at the drop of a hat. Similarly, the degree of closeness of certain friendships, particularly that of the titular characters, comes across as highly implausible.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that can be traced back to one fundamental issue: viewers are expected to take too much on faith alone. When new and important facets of certain characters are revealed with no natural progression or even minimal foreshadowing, viewers must instantly believe that the most recent iteration of a character is the truest one, despite the dearth of any supporting evidence up to that point. When certain characters effortlessly fall in and out of love with no meaningful build-up, viewers are often simply told but rarely actually shown of how that love came to be and why it crumbled. When the titular characters implicitly and explicitly swear their eternal friendship, viewers are encouraged not to question that friendship because when viewers take into consideration only what they have seen--the occasional meals together, the band practice hangouts, a live concert outing, and a pair of strawberry drinking glasses--they realize that there is hardly anything of substance that would suggest that the two Nanas are inseparable soulmates. Friendly roommates? Sure. Good friends? Believable. Life partners? Unlikely. Whatever intense bond that they purportedly forged over the course of a mere six months must have certainly occurred off-screen, and like with everything else, viewers must accept it on faith.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, NANA's failure to tell a self-contained story in 47 episodes is inexcusable. NANA effectively ends in the middle of a story arc, making the ending a quintessential \"go-read-the-manga\" ending at its absolute worst. Considering that the publication of the source material was still ongoing at the time of the show's airing, the absence of a decisive conclusion to the entire story is, of course, understandable. However, what is not understandable is the total omission of a finale that is at least narratively logical with respect to only the 47-episode run. Not all loose ends need to be tied up, but enough loose ends certainly do in order to ensure a rewarding viewing experience. As it is, unsatisfied viewers must consult the source material, at least to a limited degree (note: the manga is on hiatus at the time of writing and has been since 2009), to obtain some sense of closure and to validate their time and emotions invested in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMuch as the titular characters ponder where things went wrong for them throughout the series, viewers are ultimately left to mull over the same about the series itself. Perhaps a tighter focus placed on a smaller cast of characters could have saved it. Perhaps a greater importance placed on organic character development could have helped. Perhaps a note-perfect conclusion could have mitigated the impact of all other flaws. In any case, the show that started off with such a remarkable bang provides no worthwhile payoff and finishes with a disappointing whimper, leaving unfulfilled viewers with many of the same questions in the end as they had in the beginning.",

            "content": "\"Epic\" - a word used describe the grand and the majestic... not a word you generally associate with romance.\r\nBut if there ever was an anime in which the romantic element can be justifiably described as \"epic\", then \"Nana\" would be it. Achingly beautiful and searing in its emotional insights, \"Nana\" takes the romance genre to dizzying heights while still maintaining a strong sense of realism and empathy with the viewer in spite of all its glamour and polish.\r\n\"Nana\" is a tale of two Nanas, Komatsu Nana (aka Hachi) and Osaki Nana (aka, uh, Nana). (I can't be bothered with their full names, so I'll justrefer to them as Hachi and Nana, which is what most of the characters in the anime do anyway.) A chance meeting between Hachi and Nana on a train to Tokyo marks the beginning of a special friendship. Hachi is on her way to join up with her boyfriend who is studying in Tokyo, while Nana is heading for the big city in order to take her career as a musician to the next level. The lives of the two Nanas soon entwine, and the story gets complicated, juggling friendship, romance, career aspirations and many other things simultaneously. \\n\\n\r\nI had high expectations for \"Nana\" before I started it, but I have to admit that I didn't get into it straight off the bat. There is one big reason for this - Hachi. Hachi is a fickle, self centred airhead whose number of past boyfriends probably rivals other girls in terms of the number of pairs of shoes they own. While she's not annoying in an excessive and unrealistic way a la Asuka from \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" or Menma from AnoHana, I really didn't feel interested in a story centred on this kind of character. In fact I stalled for several months after watching episode 3, where the show laid bare the worst of her clinggy character.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the series' attention shifted away from Hachi onto Nana soon after that, and, with two stunning episodes 4 and 5, showed me just what it is capable of. Nana is an intruiging character: controversial, pretentious and fiercely proud, her compelling portrayal gave me the motivation I needed to continue with the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile \"Nana\" does eventually meet my lofty expectations, it doesn't truly take off till about a third of the way through. After those two terrific episodes early on, the show went back to focusing mostly on Hachi. In spite of this, I didn't find them as hard to get through as the first few episodes. This is partly because Nana is now also in the picture to provide some relief, and partly because Hachi isn't quite as annoying once you get to know her a bit more. Though the first third of the show is far from being the series' best, they do throw up some spine tinglingly great moments. It could have been a lot more, however, if it wasn't for the excessive use of comedy. I feel that some of material dealing with emotional turmoil should have been given a more serious treatment, especially seeing how well \"Nana\" does that kind of thing. Instead, the series' often opted for a more comic portrayal, which undermined the mood at times.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, that criticism is only valid for that first part of the series. Everything changes once the members of Trapnest comes into the story. This is when \"Nana\" started producing episode after episode of drama of the highest caliber. These episodes are not only remarkable in their quality, but also in their consistency to stay at that remarkable level. At the heart its whirlwind drama, the show exposes, dissects, and examines in minute detail the emotions of the characters. The sensation of being dazzled by someone shining more brightly than yourself, the tug of war between pride and love, the feeling of not only needing someone, but more paradoxically, of needing to BE needed by someone... virtually everything explored in \"Nana\" feels startlingly real and relevant.\\n\\n\r\nFor all its romantic elements, the centrepiece of \"Nana\" is the relationship between the two Nanas themselves. Despite the two of them being so different in personality, they share a bond that seems to transcend normal friendship, and yet at the same time is as fragile as a glass figurine, and just as beautiful. The mutual envy and emotional support, the honesty and the dishonesty, the similarity and contrast between the personalities all contribute towards a fascinating and contradicting relationship.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, the story is narrated from Hachi's point of view. You get to experience the full range of her whimsical nature and her helpless, almost piteous attraction towards the glamourous, bright star in her life that is Nana. Hachi was never gonna be my favourite character, but she did grow on me quite a bit. Nana is still the more intriguing character though, so when the narration, after an astonishingly long run of excellent episodes, switched to her point of view at around the 30 episode mark, I was hopeful that the show would get even better. \\n\\n\r\nThese expectation does get filled to a certain capacity. The change allowed a deeper insight into Nana's complex character, insight that threw up some quite shocking revelations and served to make some things a lot clearer. Even though the show had already strongly hinted at Nana's fragility and pretentiousness, the extent of these traits only starts to surface at this point. I still wasn't completely sold by her feelings with regards to Hachi though... perhaps an narrative that interlaced the two perspectives all the way through would have made it more convincing than being dumped into the revelation all at once.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, the switch in perspective unexpectedly marks the point where the series starts to go down hill. Not by much, mind you. The problem isn't to do with the actual switch itself; it's to do with the romantic plots and subplots. You can only juggle so many relationships for so long a time before things start to feel ridiculous. When the monstrous webs of love triangles ends up involving nearly all the significant members of the cast, the show starts to buckle under the weight of their sheer number and complexity. While this isn't quite a show stopper for \"Nana\", especially considering its great execution, it's the worst kind of problem for this kind of series to pick up - it makes it feel too much like a soap opera. This causes the drama aspect of \"Nana\" seem a little too sensationalist, a little less believable. I find the characterisation of Takumi from Trapnest to be particularly problematic - while I liked the professionalism in his character, his constant changes in attitude sometimes makes him feel more like a plot device than a believable rock star, and in fact the whole of Trapnest feels altogether too down to earth.\\n\\n\r\n\"Nana\" more than made up for this slight lapse in quality eventually though, finishing the series with another strong run of episodes that are at least as good as any of the ones previously. While it remained a little over-convoluted, it's hard to take too much notice when the blossoming romances and the intensifying drama is so sublimely good. \"Nana\" ends on a hanging, bittersweet note that just begs for a continuation. Continuation seems unlikely though. This first season ended as the makers wanted to avoid fillers, and the intention is that a second season will be made once the manga is finished. Though this decision to avoid fillers should be applauded, the manga has stalled and the anime can no longer be considered as a recent one. With interest in the show cooling, that second season seems increasingly unlikely.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be a crime to review \"Nana\" without mentioning the music in it. In addition to the romance and relationships, \"Nana\" is about two bands, BLAST (Nana's own band) and Trapnest (band of Nana's lover Ren). A couple of Japanese artists, Anna Tsuchiya and Olivia Lufkin, were drafted in to perform the songs by the fictional bands. The songs are used heavily throughout the series, and in fact all the opening and ending themes are made up of them. There are several noteworthy things about these songs. The first is how they're impressively written to suit the story and the characteristics of the bands that perform them. Trapnest, a band that's hit mainstream popularity in \"Nana\", has songs with quite mainstream melodies. In contrast, BLAST have an edgier, more punk influenced sound, but one that isn't completely devoid of mainstream appeal, as one of the characters once commented. Anna Tsuchiya, who provides the singing voice of Nana, has a rasping voice that's so similar in quality to the Nana's talking voice that for a while I wondered whether it was the same person. \\n\\n\r\nMost of all though, I *loved* Olivia as the singing voice of Reira, the lead singer of Trapnest. The pure, ethereal beauty of her soaring vocals is exactly how I would imagine Reira's vocals to be. No wonder Ai Yazawa (author of the \"Nana\" manga), upon coming across her songs while helping to select the right singer for Reira, apparently exclaimed \"It can only be her!\" (A bit of trivia: Olivia, like Reira, is also half American!)\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just about the songs though, it's about the atmosphere too. The scene where Hachi being overwhelmed by the experience of going to her first concert has such a dense, authentic atmosphere that it reminded me of my own first time at a concert. The background music is also very good for setting the mood, but I think it could have done with more variety. A lot of tracks are just variations on the same melodies and themes. I also thought some of the elegant, classical instrumental tracks doesn't quite fit in with the style of \"Nana\", especially considering the nature of the bands the show feature, with their often heavy instrumentals and rebellious punk influences.\\n\\n\r\nI don't normally mention the voice actors, but the ones in \"Nana\" deserves a special mention for having so many stars in their midst. Even ignoring Romi Park (Ed from \"Full Metal Alchemist; Teresa from \"Claymore\") as Nana, there's a host of heavyweights such as Aya Hirano (Misa from \"Death Note\"; Haruhi from \"The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi\") and Tomokazu Seki (Sousuke from \"Full Metal Panic!\"; Chiaki from \"Nodame Cantabile\") to be found in support... it's like the \"Ocean's Eleven\" of anime. The big surprise though, is that amongst this glittery line up, Hachi is voiced by a relative unknown KAORI (don't ask me why her name's all in capitals, I'm just writing it how I've seen it elsewhere). But what's perhaps more surprising is that, despite her lack of star credentials, her near flawless portrayal of the whimsical Hachi is one of, if not THE most ear catching performance of the series; even short phrases such as the often used \"hey, Nana\" line are injected full of nostalgic feelings. It's to her and the show's greatest credit that Hachi eventually went from a character I disliked to a character I could not only tolerate, but like and even respect to a degree.\\n\\n\r\nIt's interesting to compare this to \"Beck\", a show that overlaps on many of the same themes of music, romance and life, but is a far more humble take on them. The difference is like the bands they feature - \"Nana\" is like the chart topping band while \"Beck\" is the indie band that's looking to make it big. And while the production power and glitzy glamour of \"Nana\" does help make it the better show (in my opinion), the two are ultimately very different, each with its own unique charms. It's just a shame that while \"Nana\" often transcends the romance genre with its powerful introspective insights on love and life, it ultimately doesn't completely break free of its trappings.",

            "content": "\"Say, Nana... Do you remember the first time we met?\"\r\nThese words are the introduction of the beautiful world of \"Nana\". Ai Yazawa is probably the most convincing shoujo manga writer ever. With colourful, realistic characters, breathtaking events and just a pinch of music she creates a world in witch every girl can forget about reality and fall into the embrace of romantic fantasies. \r\nOne of the best things about \"Nana\" are the characters - we can actually see the reflection of ourselves in some of them and believe, that someone like that can really exist. This is proof that you can make a good animewithout the conventional tsundere, moe or annoying childhood friend.\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't like though is Hachi's personality. Her behaviour at times is despicable. Mainly because she has no ideals or dreams (except getting married witch is pretty boring compared to the rest of the characters). \\n\\n\r\nThe story is also one of Nana's strong points. Ai Yazawa worked really hard on it, and did her best to create a realistic world so that the reader can almost become part of it and experience it emotionaly. \\n\r\nEven though the plot is a typical shoujo tearjerker (with a bit of music) it has that magical something that makes you cheer unconsciously for some characters and experience emotionally some events almost as strongly as the characters themselves. Another good thing about the story is that it exposes the hard, cruel reality, which has no happy endings and pure loves. Yazawa-sensei gives her characters a big imagination (especially Hachi) But the world they live in is just like ours.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it wasn't that impressive. It annoys me how all the characters are so thin and tall. Other that that I think the art matched the story pretty well. There were lots of details regarding shadows and highlights. That's in order to underline the mood of certain moments, mainly in room 707.\\n\\n\r\nNana has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. The openings and endings were songs by the 2 fictional bands in the show, witch was a brilliant idea imo. Olivia Lufkin and Anna Tsuchiya fit the characters perfectly. Nothing much to add here: the music in Nana is brilliant. Period.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nana is a must-see position for shoujo-fans. It tells us a lot about life, it's hardships and also teaches us an important lesson about the mistakes, that we shouldn't make.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, so please don't be hard on me ;)",

            "content": "One of the things I like to see the most in anime is how they portray relationships. I&rsquo;m a sucker for romance, but I hate the cheesy stuff you usually see in typical shoujo anime. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll find an anime with realistic characters, with the typical flaws of human nature, and usually people love them. We can identify with them. Like in Evangelion many people who have dealt with depression could identify with Shinji (in some levels&hellip;). \r\nFor those of you who have watched your share of anime about love/relationships, I bet you could identify somehow with &ldquo;Bokura ga Ita&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&rdquo; or&ldquo;Kare Kano&rdquo;. Or at least you felt connected with its characters. I have watched them all and know what I&rsquo;m talking about.\\n\\n\r\nRecently, I finally sat down and watched &ldquo;Paradise Kiss&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a short (12 episodes) anime that, to make it short, is about relationships and growing up. I was impressed by its maturity. The art style took a while to get used to, but afterwards I loved it. After watching it, I decided to watch &ldquo;Nana&rdquo;, which is by the same author and deals with similar issues.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis:\\n\r\n&ldquo;On board the train to Tokyo to meet her boyfriend Shoji, Nana Komatsu (&quot;Hachi&quot;) happened to sit beside Nana Osaki who was traveling to Tokyo to fulfill her dreams of becoming a musician. The vocalist for her punk band &quot;Blast&quot;, Nana aims for a major debut for &quot;Blast&quot; in Tokyo where her boyfriend, Ren, is the guitarist for a popular band &quot;Trapnest&quot;. Sharing the same name &quot;Nana&quot;, both girls quickly form a bond of friendship. Their paths cross again when they encounter each other while searching for accommodation in Tokyo. Eventually they decide to live together in the same unit and this further strengthens their bond as the two &quot;Nana(s)&quot; go through their love lives and career.&rdquo; &ndash; AnimeNewsNetwork\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory  (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI almost have no words to express how it made me feel. It&rsquo;s amazing. Incredibly realistic and moving. I started watching it without knowing a thing about it (not even synopsis), though the title &ldquo;Nana&rdquo; sounded familiar as something popular among anime fans. The anime was broadcasted in 2006, lasting 47 episodes, but the manga first came out in Japan in 2000 and is still ongoing.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept itself isn&rsquo;t anything too extraordinary. People living together, people falling in and out of love, people trying to make it in showbiz and other stuff. You could say it blends many overused ideas, then twists them around and reinvents them, transforming itself into a completely original and brilliant idea. And it contains romance, drama and comedy, but the transition between them is really well done, so it doesn&rsquo;t feel weird.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes &ldquo;Nana&rdquo; shine is the incredible character development. The evolution of each character&rsquo;s personality and relationships with other characters. The things we watch them go through seem so real, like we&rsquo;d probably make the same mistakes and choices as they did. No one is perfect &ndash; that&rsquo;s a fact. We often think to ourselves &ldquo;If I was [him], I wouldn&rsquo;t have made that choice&rdquo;, but the truth is we are lying to ourselves. We are insecure, emotional beings, that often ignore rational thought and make reckless decisions. &ldquo;Nana&rdquo; is so realistic that it&rsquo;ll blow your mind away.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a long series, but it&rsquo;s not hard to watch. In the first episodes, the action often switches between the actual time and many flashbacks, but they really are important to understand a character&rsquo;s background. At some point you might get the feeling that they&rsquo;re repeating the flashbacks, but don&rsquo;t worry. This isn&rsquo;t a filler-filled series. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end I felt that the story was really well told. But they leave you in a sort of cliffhanger&hellip; because the manga isn&rsquo;t finished yet. But they made it more than obvious that at some point there&rsquo;ll be a second season of Nana, so don&rsquo;t worry. In fact, I loved watching this and the way it ended wasn&rsquo;t too frustrating because I&rsquo;d just experienced an awesome series.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe way the characters look might be a little hard to get used to (at least imo), but I really like the art style. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything too impressive or revolutionary about the visuals here&hellip; which is a good thing. I think the plot alone would be enough to hold the audience and maybe if they&rsquo;d done something too extravagant visually (*cough* Air *cough*) the viewer would get sidetracked from the story itself. I think the animation was very fitting for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation studio is Madhouse, which was also responsible for &ldquo;Beck&rdquo;, &ldquo;CardCaptor Sakura&rdquo;, &ldquo;Paradise Kiss&rdquo;, &ldquo;Death Note&rdquo; and a bunch of others.\\n\\n\r\nAudio (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI watched the episodes with the original Japanese voice actors and English subtitles. As for the actors, I think they were perfect for their roles. KAORI gave her voice to Nana &ldquo;Hachi&rdquo;, which suited the character perfectly with the childish and girlish tone (but thankfully not an annoying high-pitched voice). For the tough rock singer Nana Osaki we have Romi Paku, who also voiced Edward Elric in Full Metal Alchemist. They knew that &ldquo;Nana&rdquo; would be an instant success, so they gave it a cast of famous actors and spared no expense.\\n\\n\r\nAt first this seems like an anime about music, but it doesn&rsquo;t play that much of a part here. I mean, we hear lots of songs, but the story isn&rsquo;t focused on showing us the making of the songs in detail. Compared to &ldquo;Gravitation&rdquo; or &ldquo;Full Moon wo Sagashite&rdquo;, music wasn&rsquo;t as important here.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the songs. The fictional bands&rsquo; songs are used as openings and endings. OLIVIA is the singing voice of Reira, and we hear many songs from her. My favourite was &ldquo;A little pain&rdquo;. It was the first Ending, and since each episode ended on a relatively sad tone, the song fit perfectly. When I heard the first words of the lyrics (&ldquo;Travel to the moon&hellip;&rdquo;) it almost made me want to cry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs I&rsquo;ve mentioned, the characters are the best thing about the anime. We get the chance to know a bit about each character&rsquo;s history, motivations, thoughts and desires. They are so realistic that we just can&rsquo;t help but being sucked in by them. \\n\\n\r\nAs the anime progresses, the characters gradually grow. This is a very &ldquo;slice of life&rdquo; genre of anime, so we watch them growing up. I love how they all interact and deal with their decisions. I love how they aren&rsquo;t perfect&hellip; but as flawed as humans should be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime and it will definitely become one of my favorite series of all time. I feel like watching it again and again, but since it is 47 episodes long and makes me very emotional, maybe it&rsquo;ll have to wait until I have more time.\\n\\n\r\nI don&rsquo;t feel like reading the manga for the sole reason that it is too damn long. If it weren&rsquo;t for that, I would have already ordered all the volumes. But I gained new respect for the mangaka Ai Yazawa.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 live-action movies for &ldquo;Nana&rdquo;. I haven&rsquo;t watched them yet, but will soon. I&rsquo;m curious as to how they squeezed all that plot into 2 movies (I&rsquo;d say they have enough material to make a whole 11 episode drama or maybe something even longer). \\n\\n\r\nThe anime will have a second season&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure of that. But for that to happen, we&rsquo;ll have to wait until the manga is finished. Hurry up!\\n",

            "content": "The background of NANA feels like an endless white night. Things seem to be continuously in motion; beginnings and endings wrapped up in an infinite wave of falling snowflakes waiting to melt into each other. The forefront sits in perpetual twilight; characters seem to be eclipsed by their own shadows with barely enough to catch a glimpse of who they are. The entire landscape depicts the frigidity of life rising from frosty gales to a calmer ether, only to revert to stormier lands. Movement here isn\u2019t linear. Nothing is. NANA, as a whole, is pure kinetics; an explosion of emotional energy circling, clashing and alwaysin motion. This is all infused as a careful exploration of fate, transience, and relationships in a modernized setting. NANA as a work fully invokes the power of pathos while taking \u201cdrama\u201d to new heights.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the acclaimed manga by Ai Yazawa, Studio Madhouse adapted NANA into a 47-episode series. The story follows the pivotal journeys of two incredibly \u201cdifferent\u201d girls bound by the same name and circumstance. Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu are planets apart yet exist in the same sky; tethered by each other\u2019s gravitational force. Nana Osaki is externally a cool cat, adorned in Vivienne Westwood \u2013 the quintessential punk queen with a voracity for musical success. Whereas, Nana Komatsu, who garners the nickname \u201cHachi\u201d, is a dreamer who sees, breathes, and dreams in pink; her ambitions don\u2019t extend beyond finding her fairytale romance. Both are headed to Tokyo to pursue their various dreams (one to establish the perfect domestic life with her boyfriend, while the other wants to form her band and actualize her musical ambitions). Fate brings these two together as roommates and the narrative unfolds to reveal the tender anatomy of relationships and the power they have; to shape people and their respective worlds \u2013 for better or for worse.\\n\\n\r\nThen, what makes this work more than a seemingly run-of-the-mill drama about two girls discovering the pains and gains of life? What does it possess that other philosophized-by-life dramas don\u2019t? The answer is simple: understanding. Yazawa writes candidly about people and the world, not as a spectator, but as someone clearly living in it. Nana portrays an acute understanding of how people are and their complexities that are simply written off as natural proclivities. There is reason even if Fate seems to play some indiscernible part. There is meaning even if chaos seems to rule it out. However, what\u2019s impressive is not the mere incorporation of \u201cunderstanding\u201d, but \u201cHOW\u201d the work manages to create a stylized drama that is as visceral as the cold touch of the wintry night that it starts on.\\n\\n\r\nEven with its luridly icy sensation, NANA is never detached or impersonal. It may be highly temperamental, but it never indulges in its own despair. It\u2019s often cold but driven by the innate warmth of its living, breathing cast, who aren\u2019t just personifications of suffering or \u201cinsert-theme.\u201d This is partly what makes it sublime in its approach to drama. The drama isn\u2019t a descriptor or a simple add-on. An event doesn\u2019t happen so it can be \u201cdramatic.\u201d It doesn\u2019t happen only in effect. There is an ebb and flow; a serpentine path painted with emotional uncertainty. The characters drip with it, but the difference is that they own it. There is accountability here. Events happen for the characters as an extension of them. They don't occur only as a platform for causality (which makes all the difference).\\n\\n\r\nConsidering how easily emotional appeals can be manipulated to rehash emotional evocations, NANA remains earnest. There is a purpose in isolating feelings; to let the characters lather in them, not just merely show them; to explore them to such a degree that the feeling/the state itself becomes autonomous. Loneliness becomes its own character; as does love; as does happiness. It is as transient as it is eternal. The characters are so refined that it\u2019s hard to separate them from the elements that define them. Drama is all about nurturing these humanistic nuances and intricacies in its own habitat. Yazawa knows this all too well. Instead of showing these conditions as mere outputs of a decision or situation, they exist on an aqueous spectrum blurring the lines used to divide them AS a part of the being that gives them shape and substance. Then, causality only becomes a mean, just like Fate, just like chaos, not the end. Ultimately, that\u2019s what makes NANA idyllic as a drama, and even more so, as a story driven by life.\\n\\n\r\nHolistically, NANA showcases its prowess for drama through natural rawness, unflinching realism, and scope for understanding its subject matter(s) on a cellular level. The picture is impressive, but what makes it a pinnacle of its kind are the details \u2013 the pieces of storytelling that it utilizes to convey its narrative.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, there is perspective. Works revolving around the musings of \u201clife\u201d usually have a philosophy driving their vision of it; Nana has perspectives. What the series employs are contrasting, continual planes that converge with each other to give a wholesome view through Nana and Hachi. Their interconnectedness matters more than their seemingly opposing natures. The perspectives confess, observe, share, and exploit the hearts of the events and the characters. The episodes start with a stream of confessional thoughts spilling onto the screen and morphing into the events that transpired them.  Structurally, this does two things: One, it offers balance. Two, it contextualizes. This approach helps establish reliability because there are two narrators. This naturally aids in mitigating the problem of the unreliable narrator. The image becomes complete even if it is in broad, disconnected strokes. This show is unwavering in its personalization, and both perspectives will establish that with an uncanny persuasion.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, there is the context. The synergy between Nana and Hachi creates its own ecology. This isn\u2019t something that is easily fabricated by romanticizing the power of friendship. It is pure symbiosis, of two lives reflected through a continually cracking mirror. As the story progresses, the bifocal gaze of the two melds into one. Even the apparent contradictions between the two begin becoming whole. At first, Nana and Hachi seem to complement each other but gradually start inverting their traits. The evolution of each character is highly dependent on this progression which is why context is crucial. Hachi and Nana, along with the supplementary cast provide this even when the truth is far from being transparent. Although, getting to the truth feels trivial anyway. What the structural decisions do at their very core is reinforce the means (never the end). The importance of every word, emotion, and event that happens is preserved and with it, parts of the individual and their entire world for that moment in time.\\n\\n\r\nThat is what matters. These moments where time comes to a standstill and that instance singularly defines the world. Incepted through bursts of chemical reactions; frozen yet in flames, quietly burning everything around them. A tempest consumed by shadows of the past and uncertainties of the present. Where entropy orchestrates all and everything seems to fall into contradiction; where dreams are simply just dreams; where expectations are merely mesmerizing mirages in the distance; where love isn\u2019t a fairytale; where the importance of understanding each other becomes more important than anything else that could ever exist.  All of this is the essence of NANA\u2019s characters. Hachi, Nana, and the rest of the cast are crafters of their own moments. They coat the ashen night-sky with them. Constellations composed of moments; visual strings connected by the last and the next, in a cycle of change. It is through these anecdotal glimpses that these characters take form.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters embody this candid usage of memory, singularity, and understanding. There is much emphasis on individual events and actions. These subtleties develop to reveal how the characters are constantly at odds with themselves (even when the tone seems to be lighthearted, and all seems to be well). This is why the symbiosis between Nana and Hachi becomes so vital because their moments are not only reflected in each other but formed by each other. Additionally, it\u2019s their relationship that breaks the feigned insularity of the other characters. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have their own identities as does the rest of the cast. Everyone has a dynamism to them: their own palettes, shades, and gradients. Good. Bad. These words have no place here. Bound by insecurities, identity, and passion; constantly seeking themselves in a game of hide-and-seek, these characters are more than just adjectives and a system of traits. The show doesn\u2019t waste time in judging its characters because it has so much to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nEven then, the one that seems to be the most misunderstood and unfairly scrutinized is Hachi. She is by far the most superficially flawed character. That is never shied away from. That makes her easy to hate or dismiss as a standard shoujo lead. Hachi is perplexingly idiotic. She flings herself into the worst situations and finds herself in a never-ending state of ambivalence. Not only that, she creates disharmony between many other characters like Nana and her band members. Unlike, Nana who is easily likable due to her strong candor, intense personality, and devotion to her principals and goals, Hachi is unstable, unreliable, and utterly whimsical.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really substantiates her as a compelling character is how she is unapologetically grounded in her humanistic tendencies and flaws. This gives her a kind of awareness that the other characters, except for Yasu (Nana\u2019s longtime friend and drummer for her band), just don\u2019t have. Everyone acts like they are in control, regardless of how fragmented their reflection is.  Where everyone else is running from the phantoms they fear, Hachi absorbs them.  Nana is about as broken as they come but constantly hides her inner turmoil; stubbornly trudging through hardship and heartbreak. Pride means everything to her. Nana survives by hiding her true feelings, while Hachi lives by constantly embracing them. Hachi is fundamentally an honest character. She subconsciously recognizes her lack of control and her predispositions. Though, she often seems to be driven by her pseudo-idealization of romance which often recycles itself in ways worse than the last. She owns up to her wretchedness and attempts to reconcile; to change. Though, this doesn\u2019t make her immune. Her awareness is often drowned out by her naivete resulting in incrementally worse situations (almost to the point of becoming stuck in a self-prophetic rut).  Still, amidst it all, she remains transparent. There are no contrivances necessary with her. Transparency can be far more compelling than clarifying opaqueness, for what lies under the milky sheath is never truly clear.\\n\\n\r\nConclusively, the characters are superb because they are etched with all the shades of humanity. The physical and psychological are all accounted for. Character and emotion; feeling and action; change and stagnation; a sincere lust for meaning and acceptance are all encompassed by these characters. The best part is that there is no room to judge. The hearts of these characters beat in such sync with our own; that the only thing that\u2019s left is empathy and understanding even if it shrouded in frustration.\\n\\n\r\nAll this is packaged visually by Madhouse. They did an exceptional job adapting this series. There is a certain grittiness to the visuals and atmosphere that keeps the show from wandering too deep into the typical shoujo aesthetic. The series depends heavily on delivering rawness and realism. Otherwise, there is a nice balance of bubbly, bright scenes (in all their shoujo glory) contrasted with the necessary grunge required to keep the actual spirit of the story intact. The characters' idiosyncrasies are also poignantly preserved. The aesthetical and auditory direction kept the maturity of NANA blossoming throughout the show, despite its shoujo dispositions.\\n\\n\r\nOne further thing to note is that the manga is still publishing. The anime ends on a controversial note. For many, it leaves much to be desired. In the context of the story and especially how its told, the ending works. The story moves retrospectively. It doesn't bring the necessary closure needed to substantiate all the complexities it introduces, but it provides enough insight into what's important. It leaves room for more because there is more, but keeps the sanctity of the story still flourishing onwards. Another criticism it has received is its slow pacing. The pacing is slow as this isn\u2019t a show focusing on high-octane plots. It is about people. It seasons itself over time, maturing with its characters, and their lives. It never feels redundant nor inflated. There are silly subplots but they aren\u2019t superfluous; for they always work in tandem with a character. As aforesaid, the show never treats anything as an end. Sometimes things happen with no end and sometimes things spontaneously end. The point is that there is something concrete beneath it which ultimately sheds light on those involved.\\n\\n\r\nThat is what drama is. \\n\\n\r\nTime lost in an emotive frenzy. Moments molded from remnants of what passed. Transformed into what is to come. Even in the calm, something moves.  The scenery here is indeed a bit too chilly sometimes, laden with the melancholy of yesterday and the loneliness of tomorrow. Even so, the present waits in an ethereal stasis; attempting to understand itself. Remembering, being, and accepting; it\u2019s all here, often presented as unyielding blizzard internalized by those who live it. As the single snowflake finally dissolves upon touch into a pool of white, to become something more than just one, those walking in NANA also find themselves inseparable from those around them. Nothing is perfect here. Nothing needs to be.\\n\\n\r\nFor what happens here is relentlessly flawed yet at the same time, essential and real. What happens here is, life.\\n",

            "content": "Nana is one of those acclaimed anime that everyone seems to know the existence of, but very few people have ever actually watched. The fact that it\u2019s almost 50 episodes long is a bit of a turn-off in of itself, but even the people who have seen it barely discuss the thing anymore. Very few \u201cfavorite anime\u201d lists that I\u2019ve read actually include it. It\u2019s up there with Great Teacher Onizuka, Hajime no Ippo, and most of the Major anime in terms of high-ranking MAL darlings that the majority of MAL users will go \u201coh yeah, I\u2019ve heard how good this thing is. Better putit on my PTW list that I\u2019m never going to clear out\u201d or \u201cthat was a really good show. *Forgets about it after a few months*\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSaid lack of enthusiasm along with the fact that it\u2019s a relatively long show directed by Morio Asaka aka that flowery director who\u2019s so slow-paced in his storytelling that even the stuff of his I\u2019ve actually liked ended up feeling underwhelming in the end, is the main reason I never watched Nana. But part of said reason was just that I wasn\u2019t interested. I never even cared enough to learn what happens in the show other than the fact that it was about two women named Nana who become friends and deal with relationship issues. And as much as I like the Paradise Kiss anime, part of its appeal was that it was really short. Eleven episodes, which admittedly made manga fans a bit grumpy considering an important male character and some story details got shortchanged as a result, but if it meant less boredom caused by dead space, than I was all for it.\\n\\n\r\nBut even with the huge amount of summer anime I keep up with riding my ass like a sexual metaphor that I\u2019m not going to elaborate on because it would be too nasty even for me, I had free time to surf Netflix for new shows to get into. And after my failure to get into the Netflix originals that I tried, along with browsing the anime selection and noticing Nana was on there, I decided it was as good a time as any to watch it and ended up finishing the show in less than two weeks. You have no idea how much free time I sacrificed regarding other activities I could have been doing - like finally playing Bioshock Infinite for one - to accomplish that, especially since I don\u2019t actually love Nana. Not that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good. It is. But if you were to ask me if I wanted to rewatch in the future, I\u2019d just shove my Paradise Kiss DVDs in your face, and not because I managed to get those really hard-to-find DVDs for a relatively cheap price and want to brag about it. Not just because of that, anyways.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, it is the pacing that\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m okay with taking a break in-between dramatic moments in order to set them up so that they\u2019d actually have some impact, but not breaks that go on this long. The very first episode of the anime introduces our two twenty-year old protagonists, a happy go-lucky idiot named Nana Komatsu and a rock punk chick named Nana Osaki, by having them meet on a train during their move to Tokyo and end up becoming roommates due to various circumstances. I was expecting the next episode to showcase the two getting to know each other whilst revealing their motivations for moving to Tokyo in the first place, until I read the Netflix summaries and discovered that the next five episodes would flashback to their pasts in a \u201chow we got here\u201d sort of way meaning we wouldn\u2019t get any meaningful interaction between them until half a one-cour series has passed. And to top it all off, they rehash the opening episode in Episode 6, which makes me wonder why you needed a prologue to begin with. I mean there\u2019s hooking the audience and then there\u2019s just baiting them with cookies for breakfast. It\u2019s an extreme, but by no means the only example of this sort of pacing dragging the show down. Certainly not the worst example from the show either.\\n\\n\r\nNot that the downtime is dull. It\u2019s just pretty average. If you\u2019ve seen one story about a quirky female trying to make friends and ends meet, then you\u2019ve seen Nana\u2019s light-hearted stretch of episodes. The only thing that makes it tolerable compared to most go-nowhere shoujo series is how despite Nana K trying her hardest to be independent, she\u2019s completely dependent on others, which becomes increasingly problematic on the people surrounding her as well as herself throughout the series. This leads to a decently engaging climax \u2153 of the way through the series when said hypocrisy pushes her boyfriend towards another woman, but I couldn\u2019t quite shake the feeling that I had just watched a romance movie that was the first part of a trilogy and stretched out to three times the length it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until Nana O\u2019s circle of friends, including the band of which her former boyfriend is a member of, shows up that the average-to-engaging ratio started to tip more towards the latter. But even then, it has its slow moments. Whilst I appreciate Nana for having buildup so that I could actually care for the \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they\u201d part of the story rather than act like a man in his forties who\u2019s desperate to lose his virginity, I could have completed an entire workout routine in the time it took for the buildup to go somewhere whilst still having enough time to cook some meat afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nThe absolute nadir of the experience was with the story\u2019s final arc, where after Nana K makes a mistake that causes her and everyone to face their own demons in a heart-wrenching string of episodes that rivals Kids on the Slope\u2019s final stretch in terms of emotional intensity, the show then spends the next ten episodes trying to have the characters go on with their lives with each episode having about 3-5 minutes of compelling drama and 17-20 minutes of \u201cwhilst I like these characters, this doesn\u2019t further the story in any real way\u201d I know a bunch of people were sour on Kids on the Slope for skipping an entire volume of the manga - amongst other things - but please explain to me what showcasing the actual process of Kaoru moving on from wrecking his entire life would actually add. Sometimes, some things are best left to the imagination and you just need to end the thing right then and there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just to make things worse, nothing even comes out of all that buildup other than a reaffirmation and closure of old plot threads that whilst engaging, don\u2019t really lend any sort finality to the show as a whole. Without giving too much away, there\u2019s this weird and unnecessary use of time skip before it cuts back to the present with the characters just acting like they usually do, even when major events occur. And whilst a hard decision is made in said finale, said decision is undercut by the timeskip showing that everything is going to be alright in the future, rendering it completely pointless. It feels like the anime ended right in the middle of the story, and whilst I understand that Nana\u2019s source material hasn\u2019t concluded even to this day - although the chances we\u2019ll ever get a conclusion from the author at this point are about as likely as Iggy Azalea ever being relevant again after her breakdown - you could have at least had made some sort of big deal out of things. At least achieve a small last-minute accomplishment? No? Alright then, but don\u2019t expect me to read your manga in order to find out what happens next. Especially since there\u2019s a certain car crash that happens later on that I think I\u2019m better off pretending doesn\u2019t exist.\\n\\n\r\nAm I banging too much on how unnecessarily long I found this series? Well it\u2019s the most unique thing I can say about it, because like me, even if you don\u2019t know what happens plot-wise, I\u2019d be very surprised if you didn\u2019t have any idea what Nana was actually about. The whole story is somewhere between Beck Mongolian Chop Squad and a Seo Kouji manga in that the majority of the characters are working towards making it as a punk band whilst dealing with all sorts of heartbreak and truths regarding how complicated relationships can get. All the characters are adults and even the more assholish members of the cast are likable, which automatically makes Nana better than those works. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that it focuses more on the latter than the former, which I prefer because my interest in the inner workings of how a band operates is virtually nil whilst my interest in the inner workings of how a relationship works is higher than the peak of Mount Olympus.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst there are some weird plot contrivances to further the story along, complaining about that in a drama is like complaining they\u2019re emotionally manipulative or comedies are funny. If you don\u2019t like the very idea of them, then you shouldn\u2019t be watching anything from the genre to begin with. You don\u2019t see me watching Bollywood movies for a reason you know. And whilst some of the plot points are eerily reminiscent of Suzuka, they work here because the drama fires in all cylinders rather than play favoritism towards one weak direction. Everything that happens is a result of the characters\u2019 personalities. Events that happen to one character also affects those around them, causing all involved parties to face themselves along with their circumstances. Nobody is a true bad guy, even when it\u2019s clear that one side is more wrong than the other. Even the high school kid who demands money from the girls he sleeps with is a lot nicer in practice than he sounds right no--get out of that chat room! I swear he\u2019s a decent guy...sort of.\\n\\n\r\nAnd most of all, the romance and relationship stuff is ultimately just a tool for larger issues. Sure we\u2019ve seen said issues addressed before: responsibility, personal luck, inner demons, etc. But those sorts of issues are never going to stop being relevant anytime soon, no matter what your age is. And as long as that remains true and they\u2019re explored in a way that reminds us of said truth, I\u2019m always going to find the stuff that Nana represents intriguing. That is why Nana continues to be remembered as one of the anime greats despite not being popular in this current generation of anime fans. Which makes it all the more frustrating that the show is to romance stories what Monster (sans conclusive ending despite the ambiguity of it all) is to crime stories.\\n\\n\r\nAs well-written, decent-looking (although Nana\u2019s actual animation is pretty terrible), nicely dubbed, and overall enjoyable both Madhouse productions are, my desire to ever revisit them is severely tempered by their long lengths and the inevitable dead space and repetition that comes from this sort of serialized storytelling \u201cshould have been a movie\u201d format. Maybe if the comedy during Nana\u2019s lower-quality stretches was funny, the pacing wouldn\u2019t have been so much of a problem. But all the jokes come from \u201cHow to write shoujo comedy 101\u201d, which is about as funny as a kid from a PBS show throwing a tantrum during the middle of a Lifetime drama. Sure it sounds like a good laugh on paper, but so does page 67 of the Kama Sutra. And don\u2019t blame me if your partner never wants to sleep with you again after that experience.",

            "content": "Ai Yazawa did it again.\r\nNANA is even better than Paradise Kiss for me. I love all the elements that make up the plot &ndash; Music, fashion, a little (a lot) of drama which goes hand in hand with some comedy and finally, Girl Power! It&rsquo;s almost as if Ai Yazawa knew what I like to see in an anime series.\r\nThe story revolves around Nana Komatsu (Hachi) and Nana Oosaki &ndash; how they live their lives and accomplish their goals, how they interact with the various men in their lives and the friendship between the both of them. They go through all of this with alot of tears and thankfully, a lot of laughs as well. The other characters are great too, especially the members of the Black Stones. Yasu is a bad-ass but altruistic lawyer/drummer, Shin is the adorable, childish bassist and Nobu, the all around boy next door guitarist. I like the members of Trapnest too, but my favorite has to be Naoki. He&rsquo;s really funny.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of times when I almost cried, especially when it comes to Ren and Nana O&rsquo;s relationship. It&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re a rock n&rsquo; roll Romeo and Juliet. There&rsquo;s also Hachi&rsquo;s MANY relationships, I don&rsquo;t want to give out spoilers but let me say Shoji sucks and Nobu rocks! ;)\\n\\n\r\nAi Yazawa and Madhouse is the perfect anime team I can think of. The animation was of course, very well done (although there were a lot of repeated scenes &ndash; laziness!). The character designs were sleek and modern. The color coordination is something to be lauded as well. The colors represent the clash of Hachi (bright and luminous) and Nana O&rsquo;s (Dark and Strong) personalities &ndash; Even though they differ they go well with each other.\\n\\n\r\nI really like the voice acting too. A lot of familiar names are found in NANA&rsquo;s cast list, such as Romi Paku as Nana Oosaki and Aya Hirano as Reira Serizawa. There&rsquo;s also one of my favorite male seiyus, Tomokazu Seki as Nobu Terashima, who happens to be one of my favorite characters from the anime. I also like KAORI, Hachi&rsquo;s seiyu. Her voice really matched Hachi&rsquo;s personality, in fact, every seiyu did a good job in portraying their respective characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe music rocked, of course. NANA&rsquo;s music made me a huge fan of Anna Tsuchiya. I like how varied the tracks are. &ldquo;Rose&rdquo; is a little bit dark and gloomy, while &ldquo;Kuroi Namida&rdquo; is sad and weepy, then there&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo;, my favorite because it&rsquo;s really upbeat and energetic. The insert song &ldquo;Zero&rdquo; is another favorite. OLIVIA&rsquo;s equally just as good. I still can&rsquo;t get over &ldquo;A Little Pain&rdquo;. The emotions embedded in the song really touch me. &ldquo;Wish&rdquo; and &ldquo;Starless Night&rdquo; were also nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint would be the abundance of recaps. I don&rsquo;t understand why there are so many recaps. Maybe they wanted more screen time for Junko and Kyosuke? This one isn&rsquo;t really a complaint, but I have to note the excessive amount of nudity (including frontal nudity) throughout the series. Since the anime depicts a more accurate account of mature relationships, I recommend NANA to mature audiences only.\\n\\n\r\nIt was almost painful for me that the show had to end and with such a sad conclusion too (at least for me). Thank goodness the manga is still ongoing and there are hints of a second season.",

            "content": "NANA is one of those shows that no matter how stupid it is at times, you still find yourself liking it. I would classify this show as a guilty pleasure because in all honesty, it can be compared to teen shows such as One Tree Hill or Dawson's Creek. That's how annoying it is. Despite all that, I still enjoyed NANA to a certain extent. I would recommend it, but not to everyone. Is it a decent show to watch? Yes. Is it as good as everyone says it is? No. \r\nStory (C) - First of all, let me just say that NANA can bepretty ridiculous. Everyone in the show throws around the word love like it means nothing, and everyone has sex with eachother without thinking twice about it. Like I said before, the content of the show is your typical teen drama. NANA is very stylistic though, and can cover up all of these flaws with the way everything is presented. So what I'm really trying to say is that Nana is all flash and no substance. It's a stylized, glossy, teen soap opera. It's a basic girly slice of life story, so I don't think too many guys will be interested in it. I liked the first half of the show a lot better than the second half. In the beginning we get introduced to Nana Komatsu and Nana Osaki. They're both 20 years old and coincidentally meet eachother on a train while moving to Tokyo. Their personalities are immensely different, which is something I liked. They end up renting an apartment together and become friends. The show starts out by explaining Nana Komatsu's (later nicknamed Hachiko, or Hachi for short) background and establishes that she's somewhat easy with guys and falls in love at first sight all the time. She moves to Tokyo to be with her boyfriend, Shouji. We also see Nana Osaki's past and we discover that she has never met her father before and that her mother abandoned her when she was four. She decides to move to Tokyo to achieve her dream of becoming a singer. She's much different with guys and has only had one love so far in her life. This is the basic story for the show. Simple, but interesting. The first few episodes present the story in a way that kept me engaged and anticipating the next episode. I liked how it seemed as if Hachiko's life and Nana's life were two completely different, parallel stories that just happened to collide. Hachiko has her friends and her boyfriend, while Nana has her band (called the Black Stones, or BLAST for short). Nana and Hachi's friendship is what ties these two world's together. Later in the show, their relationship isn't as strong. The story starts focusing on their love lives way more than their friendship. I mean I'm a girl, and I like romance like any other girl, but there's only so much I can take. It would be different if what was happening in their love lives was actually realisitc, but a lot of the situations they get in are really stupid and can be easily solved if they just talked it out. The story also starts focusing on the love lives of Nana's band members which I really didn't care about because they were just as annoying. The main flaw in the story is that there was too much romance and not enough friendship. I also don't understand why every summary of the show says that Hachi is looking for love and happiness while Nana is looking for fame and recognition. Nana's band doesn't even become famous until like 30 episodes into the show, and they don't even show her singing that much (which is supposed to be her \"passion\" in life). Most of the time she's just moping about her boyfriend who left her to join another band called Trapnest. When they do reconcile, their romance isn't very....romantic. All they do is have sex all the time. I realized that NANA started out with an interesting story that turned into nothing more than a bunch of people having sex  and \"falling in and out of love\" with eachother.\\n\\n\r\nArt (A-) - I liked the art in NANA because it went with the style of the story. The creators of the show really knew what they were doing when creating the atmosphere and tone of the show. Sometimes the facial expressions can look a little weird though, like when they're supposed to be angry it actually looks like they're smiling. I'm not sure if that was for comedic effect, but it just looked weird sometimes. Another thing I didn't like was how big everyone's foreheads were, but I guess that's just the style that the author of the manga wanted. The shading can also look a little bit awkward, but other than that I didn't have any problems with the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound (A-)  - Overall, the music in NANA went well with everything that was happening. The OPs and EDs were pretty catchy. A lot of the music used throughout the show is also featured as songs that BLAST or Trapnest sings during concerts. I thought that was pretty cool. The way the music was integrated into the show also helped create emotional moments and make moments that seemed pretty stupid and unbelievable work better. The music in the show was good, but ultimately another reason why the show is more style than substance. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (C+) - The characters in NANA are a problem. Hachi and Nana are both likeable characters, and I liked them a lot, but I just didn't understand why they were so stupid sometimes! In the beginning they kind of reminded me of how people would act in real life.Those were the times when the show succeeded. Later they did things that were so lame that I started not to like them anymore. \\n\r\nHachi - She's a very bubbly and friendly girl who's a little self absorbed and immature. She's always looking for someone she can fall in love with. I sympathized with her because I know how girls are, and I know that she really did just want to find someone who would love her and take care of her. I liked her in the beginning (even though her personality can be...irritating) because I know a lot of girls who act like her, and she seemed somewhat realistic. She sleeps with 3 guys during the course of the show, but at one point I realized something...why are so many guys even dating her? Before I watched the show I was expecting the characters to actually have lives, but I soon figured out that Hachi doesn't have a job, (besides temporary ones like working as a sales girl, and an assistant at an office) and she can barely take care of herself. She randomly went to art school even though she didn't have talent (is it possible to go to art school without talent?) and I'm guessing she dropped out? I don't really know, but all I know is that she isn't really good at anything except cooking.  Later in the show there's a situation where she has to choose between two guys and for some reason she loves both of them even though one of them treats her like trash. In my mind I was thinking \"this isn't really a tough decision here...\" but of course everything had to be overdramatic and unrealisitc. She \"loves\" so many people that I just stopped caring. \\n\r\nNana - At first I really liked Nana because she was independent, and a lot more mature than Hachi. She's cool and focused, and her style is kind of goth-punk. It seemed like Nana's goal in life was to become famous and she wasn't really focused on relationships that much. Then a few episodes later we find out that Nana was living with some guy that left her even though he still loves her and she still loves him. Whenever they're together they're either having sex or talking about how they love eachother and want to grow old together. She's always relying on her band members to be there for her, which I understood because of her situation with her mom. I liked her emotional depth, but it wasn't really explored that much. Instead there was too much time spent on the thing with her boyfriend. She would always talk about how singing was her life, but it didn't seem like it was her life to me. Nana also doesn't have a real job, and even though I liked her the best out of the two, I was really annoyed and tired of her by the end. She started losing that edge that made her cool in the beginning. She also didn't have any other hobbies besides playing with her band. \\n\r\nBLAST Members - All these characters started out as just supporting characters in Nana and Hachi's lives, but eventually they start taking over the show! There was lot of time spent on Shin's romantic life that I didn't care about. Nobu was ok I guess, but I didn't understand how he randomly started \"loving\" Hachi after a day. I liked Nana and Yasu's romantic tension, but that also didn't go anywhere. Everyone just started to get on my nerves. Trapnest Members - There's Ren, who's Nana's boyfriend, and is always whining about how he loves Nana but I never really got why they were sooo in love. He also didn't have a good childhood growing up so I guess that was something they bonded with, but his relationship with Nana just isn't developed enough. Reira's romance with Shin is tedious and exhausting when it doesn't have to be, and don't even get me started on Takumi and how annoying he was. The other guy in the band doesn't have too much screen time which is good because he wasn't that interesting.\\n\r\nThen there's Hachi's friends, Jun and Kyosuke, who aren't shown that much. At first I kinda liked them, but later on in the show they didn't really serve a purpose. Jun started out being the one with sense in the friendship between her and Hachi, but the things that she would say later in the show just didn't make any sense to me. If I knew someone was cheating on my friend I'm pretty sure I would tell them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (C-) - NANA starts out being very enjoyable despite the fact that most, if not all of the characters have no idea what love is, or what it means to be in love. NANA is enjoyable in the same way that every other sappy teen show is enjoyable. Not because it's realistic but because it's drama. Annoying, over the top, mushy drama. Everything that happens is blown out of proportion so much, and simple things that happen are transformed into emotional moments. I gotta say, I was sucked in. But after awhile it really does start to get old. Without any real content to fall back on, NANA turns into a typical show about relationships. It's even more dissapointing because there was a lot to work with. Maybe if the author didn't have so much of this beating around the bush stuff. A lot of things could have been resolved if the characters weren't so annoying. I guess in some ways it is realistic because people do act like that sometimes, but NANA was a little too over the top. There were some genuine emotional moments that hit home, but overall, the only reason why this show would be worth watching is for the presentation. All the flaws are covered so well with the stylized scenes and dramatic speeches and narrations from the characters that it kept me wanting more...for awhile...until it started to become so tedious that I couldn't wait for it to end. I can understand why girls like this anime a lot, but it's probably because they couldn't see past the appearance and production of the show, which definitely was impressive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (C+) - If you're a fan of any kind of teen drama/romance show out there then you'll LOVE this show. Trust me. It's not that I didn't like it. As I already said, I enjoyed a lot of it (mostly in the beginning) and there was a nice blend of comedy, drama, and romance, but there was definitely too much emphasis on the relationships...and sex. The good parts about the show, Nana and Hachi's contrasting personalities, their friendships, their backgrounds, were really good but there just wasn't enough of that. Even if we forget the fact that everyone in this show falls in love after a day, there still would be too many shortcomings in the story to give it a high recommendation. NANA is definitely rated too high on this site, and although I enjoyed this show I only enjoyed it for what it is - which is a superficial, relationship-heavy, melodramatic, teen soap opera.",

            "content": "NANA is a Shoujo, Slice of Life, Romance, Drama about the joys, the pain and the struggles that come with the endeavour known as love and romance. If you enjoy your shoujo or romance then NANA is a must see.\r\nThe story itself focuses on two young ladies named Nana and how they came to know each other and connected through the similar experiences they share in life. The first couple episodes introduces the main characters involved and spends an equal amount of time giving us some background on each Nana, then showing how they became acquainted. Then the main story kicks in, which actually feelsmore like 2 separate stories connected only through the strong bond of friendship between the both of them. Nana Komatsu&rsquo;s (Hachi) story is about her living her life to attain true love, whereas Nana Osaki&rsquo;s story is more about her dream to become a professional vocalist in a band. Even with all the heavy drama and real life dilemmas, there&rsquo;s still plenty of light humour to take your mind of things. Yet with this being a shoujo romance, it may be hard to determine whether this will have a happy ending or not.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is full of some very appealing characters that pretty much orbit around the two Nanas. Nana Komatsu (Hachiko) is an energetic, love struck young lady who&rsquo;s at the receiving end of many jokes and also many romantic hardships. Nana Osaki is more of a mysteriously dark and serious young lady who tries her best to support her friends through their hardships whilst dealing with her own. They each have their own circle of friends that do well as supporting characters, but still have some perplexing issues of their own and what makes it more interesting is seeing how these diverse people interact with each other, be it friends, lovers or rivals.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this series is near-perfect and that is thanks to the expertise of Madhouse, as the art style matches Ai Yazawa&rsquo;s vision perfectly. The character designs are elegant and very attractive (both guys &amp; girls), with stylish outfits to suit their varying personalities. Shame there was a fair bit of scene recycling going on.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to choose my least favourite aspect of this series then it would have to be the music but that may have been because I had high expectations of it. Personally I found the BGM to be pretty bland, which was compiled of a bunch of uninspiring melodies. The main redeeming factor came in the form of the invoking OP and ED themes, which were also used as insert songs throughout.\\n\\n\r\nOverall NANA is an incredible shoujo anime series that I will always remember for its realistic portrayal of different forms of romance and the emotional baggage that comes with it. The music subplot was incorporated well, as it gave me some insight into how things go on however it would have been better if it had more songs by Olivia. Surprisingly this series constantly gave the urge to see the next episode, due to all the major developments and cliff-hanger endings and it&rsquo;s a shame things had to come to an end, but at least I was left feeling satisfied.\\n\\n\r\n^_^\\n",

            "content": "Shoujo is probably the last word I would use to describe this anime.  \r\nNANA is possibly one of the most complicated romances I have ever come across; this complexity is what makes it so amazing, outstanding and fascinating. It is because NANA is not a typical shoujo which makes it suitable for a wider audience; it's far from your average school-life-love-triangle romance.  This anime will make anyone laugh, cry and feel a connection with the protagonists by the end of 47 episodes.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nCan anyone have any more drama in their life than the characters from NANA? In my opinion, the summary abovedoesn't really do the anime justice. What\u2019s so special about this anime is that it makes you think deeply. You come to realise how small the world really is, two girls roughly the same age, with the same name, heading towards the same place but both aiming for different goals. Initially, it may seem like the anime focuses on the two Nanas\u2019 lives running parallel with one another, day to day life just like that, but further into the anime, it makes people realise that even though the two Nanas have a lot in common and almost become as close as sisters, they are still extremely different to each other in person and opinions, thus creating conflicting situations. The anime revolves around how these situations are resolved for the better good of someone close to them, selflessness and selfishness. Drama is primarily dominant in this anime, as it continuously escalates, I can assure you that not one single episode is a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nThe art style in NANA is very unique; it differs from the conventional anime art style you may see in other anime. The characters are drawn very stylishly, each with their own unique appearance, the landscape is drawn almost as well as the characters and everything is very distinguishable and pleasant to look at. If you\u2019ve seen Ai Yazawa\u2019s previous work of Paradise Kiss, it is very similar to that. Only complaint I would have is that there is the occasional blurriness, but seeing as this is a 2006/2007 anime, it\u2019s forgivable. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nThe voice actors were perfect in their roles, I saw nothing weird or out of place with how the voice actors matched with the character\u2019s personality of which they were voicing. I really enjoyed the OST of NANA, the OPs and EDs were fitting in every way, I found myself looking forward to the next OP/ED each time. Anna Tsuchiya\u2019s vocals really brought out the punk-like character of Nana Osaki and Olivia Lufkin managed to convey the gentleness of Reira. An excellent OST as expected from a music based anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were very unique, whether it be a significant past story or an underlying secret, each character had a special trait that separated them from each other. The characters were generally very likable throughout, they were all characters that perhaps people may find them easy to relate to since NANA has quite a realistic element to it. As the story progressed there was noticeable change in the characters\u2019 attitudes and personalities, each one developing in their own way through influences of the people around them. In my opinion, Ai Yazawa\u2019s characters are always well thought out and interesting which makes them so hard to hate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall - 10/10\\n\r\nI gave this anime a 10 without hesitation. Overall, I really and thoroughly enjoyed this anime; each episode has something waiting for you and will never leave you disappointed. I watched this anime twice over and I ended up loving it even more by the second time. It is definitely the best romance anime I have seen by far and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a not-too-long but not-too-short romance that will leave you content and thinking about whether events in everyday life are merely a coincidence or down to fate itself.\\n",

            "content": "Gotta say, this is one of the most disappointing series to show up in the MAL top list. On the one hand, I found most of the characters really boring. Especially \"Hachiko\" who I couldn't sympathize with at all, and found I felt no pity for her at all in her fate. The other Nana was somewhat better, but overall, all of the female characters come across as being incredibly weak people who have nothing else in life to live for but to succumb to their men. Jun strikes me as the only one with any inner strength but alas she's a side character wenever really get to know well.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime, it's important to also consider the artwork, and in this area the series fails even harder. Obviously anime allows a great deal of freedom in styles, but in all cases it has to \"look right\". It's not successful art if I'm distracted from the story because the drawings look wrong. There are several angles where the artist clearly cannot draw heads and they look bloated and misshapen. The men are all strange giants with spidery appendages that look like they would break if they bumped into anything. In several scenes, I noted the ratios were ridiculously wrong and it appeared that arms came out of a person's mid-section rather than the shoulder. Again, if I'm noticing these things instead of the nuances of the story, there's a problem in the delivery here. Another point I'd like to mention is that characters that frequently are supposed to look angry appear to be smiling. It looks stupid and completely destroys any semblance of intended drama in the scene.\\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly not the worst show I've seen (I can think of plenty of harem series that are worse, for example), but I'd steer clear of this one.",

            "content": "While the anime adds a definite charm that you cannot get just from the manga, it also adds so many flaws that I had to stop watching it.\r\nThe most utterly incomprehensible flaw is that Blast turns out to be the least punk music possible. Nana's vocals sound like a Japanese, girlier version of that mid-90s Creed movement, and nothing in the instrumentals is slightly punky. This was a lot better when I could imagine them being something like a modern, trying too hard to be trendy, Japanese Sex Pistols in the manga.\r\nThe art is definitely another terrible translation. In the manga, nothing is especially fantastic,but nothing is ever glaringly wrong. The anime has one glaring anime that makes it impossible for me to actually attentively watch the series, which is that characters haphazardly gain a white, vertical stripe on their face. It is supposed to be a lazy attempt at depth/shadowing, but it just makes every character look like clowns for large durations of time. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth sometimes, and some of its quirks are nice, but it ends up usually being clumsy if anything. I understand it is probably a stylistic choice, but it is not a good one. It especially goes poorly with their attempts at gag art.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, for having a lot of big shot voice actors, they actually mesh really, really poorly. The voice acting really often sounds flat and tepid. I was surprised since I like so many of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe story loses little, and the translation from manga to anime does not especially hurt the characters, but with the other flaws screaming at me, it was just something I could not get through. Judging by the relentlessly breathless and positive reviews, no one else finds these flaws as noteworthy though.",

            "content": "I went into this series with no idea of what to expect. I read the synopsis, and it sounded okay, but it does not do justice to the show at all. \r\nI wouldn't say that Nana is shoujo. It has more sophistication and more intricate plot lines than the average shoujo. It treats the characters as people by acknowledging their feelings, their backgrounds, their motives, and that allowed for you to not only get attached to the characters, but to understand them. The characters developed a lot throughout the show, and your perception of them changed as information was revealed to you. \r\nI would definitelydescribe the show as beautiful, but it's also a little harrowing. It made me laugh, it made me choke up and almost cry (okay maybe just \"cry\"), it made me throw the phone that I was watching the show on across the room, but most importantly, it made me marathon all the episodes. \\n\r\nThe art style was kind of unique, but I grew to really like it. The animation was beautiful. The sound was great (with the exception of a song or two that didn't quite fit my tastes) and the sound played a huge part in the story. It added so much to my enjoyment to the point that I don't think you could enjoy the story as much in manga form because of it. \\n\r\nReally, I could go on talking about all of my favorite plot points, details, songs, characters, etc. But all you really need to know is that I have nothing but praise for this show. It's one of the best and most satisfying anime I have seen in a while, and I fully recommend it to anyone who wants to see a brilliant show about love and life.",

            "content": "Love triumphs the human soul in ways we can\u2019t fathom, and how we can contain it also remains unexplained. Whether it is love in a romantic or friendly fashion, it has always been one of the most sought out themes in stories in every medium imaginable. We are used to the idealistic form of love with many tropes and literary devices, but now we\u2019ve grown to appreciate the \u201crealistic\u201d types of romance. The type I  am refering to is a romance that tries to portray the reality we live in rather than what we hope it will be. Nana can speak for itself asone anime to be an achievement of perfecting that level of story.\\n\\n\r\nNana starts as your typical best friend story with opposite personalities; the bubbly, kind of dumb, girly girl and the no-nonsense rocker girl that meet each other by coincidence. What\u2019s oddly alluring about how these two play off their relationship is the fact that it doesn\u2019t seem forced at all. They don\u2019t just start as best friends. They\u2019re mere acquaintances that learn about how each other live out their lives through their work and family. It becomes a hilarious tirade between both characters in typical Josei fashion that we grow to enjoy. Not just between the two Nana\u2019s, but also with the other characters and their unique personalities. It\u2019s that break that makes you wish that the show was longer, so we could have more moments like them, even with its 50 episodes running time.\\n\\n\r\nBut with comedy comes heartbreak, and Nana comes into it with full throttle. There is the tragic relationship between Nana Osaki, the rocker, and Ren, that will admittedly cause some tears to form. The reason for this being how well it pulls in the romantic aura through narration and expository dialogue, which pulls you into how they were once a happy couple. Then there\u2019s Nana Komatsu, the childish one, and the problems of how she guides her life with being the girlfriend of Takumi and Nobu. While there are some aspects to the drama that was a bit rushed, it serves a definite purpose on how Nana matures from a ditzy woman into a responsible one to taking care of the people she loves, especially Nana Osaki. It develops Nana Komatsu quite nicely, and also Nana Osaki and how their relationship develops through whatever twist and turn it makes you go through.\\n\\n\r\nFor the supporting roles that pop up in Nana, it\u2019s a mixed bag. In that, there are great ones, but others are just not as strong. This all comes into perspective based on the fact that some are given more development than the ones that seem not to be bothered. Some are even given a more significant presence to previous episodes, but barely get any more screen-time for us to be fully invested in the entire cast. But what does make up for this is how every single one of the characters legitimately feels like real human beings. Not just from how relatable they are in terms of their problems and personalities, but also by the lack of cliches they could\u2019ve easily used to lessen the impact of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve watched, or read for that matter, any shoujo anime, Nana\u2019s art should be familiar territory for you. They do very well with the various comedic expressions on the characters\u2019 faces that are always charming to watch. It does seem jarring at first to see characters as really tall and skinny human beings, but that does give every character a lovely physical uniqueness to them. Even though there are instances of animation not being that fluid, especially with the dreadful concert scenes where it repeats animations over and over, the art style will still spark some charm to anyone with an open mind.\\n\\n\r\nWith a show centered around music, it\u2019s all about music, right? Oh yeah, there was. In all seriousness, the music aspect of the show narrative-wise is not too shabby, both in how it sounds and how it fits seamlessly with the romantic story. The songs are your typical post-punk rock music with some beautiful guitar chords, and drum fills that may sound more like your generic J-Rock song. Singing is where high praise is needed for the music and how Olivia Lufkin\u2019s voice resonates perfectly to the somber, heartbreaking tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic can levitate us into a better state of mind when we have been through a difficult life. That\u2019s the central theme that\u2019s the focal point to Nana. Nana and her band members reasoning for wanting to form a band in the first place was to express themselves in a way that was outside of the cultural norm. Ai Yazawa has a knack for showcasing the passion of the characters for what they do and trying to meet the end goal of being a successful band. But what makes it brilliant is how there is no bullshit to how she writes the outcome. There\u2019s no extreme end to it all; it\u2019s just a realistic scenario that we are most likely to meet when we try to reach our hopes and dreams. Not that there is some hopeless end to Nana, but it\u2019s an excellent middle ground between success and failure that feels hopeless, but hopeful at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nWhat manifests out of it all is a beautiful amalgamation of romantic comedy, music, and slice of life that sums up Nana in a great nutshell. Funny, sad, inspiring, and empathetic to its core, Nana has more going for it than your generic shoujo anime. It\u2019s one where there is so much to be had in it than just typical romance that you\u2019d find elsewhere. Even if you can\u2019t relate to people in love, being in a band, or experiencing breakups, Nana knows how people connect individually through friendships. And that is something we can all relate to.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

            "content": "Nana...\r\nSuch a beautiful and unique show among the Shoujo genre. We've all have fallen in love at some point in our lives, maybe it didn't turn out for the best or you couldn't stay in love for long because of other circumstances. Ai Yazawa makes a identifiable world that a lot of girls have been in, the feeling of, \"Does he love me?\" or \"Am I worthy enough for him?\" She makes it as realistic as possible and does this in a very subtle way not a lot of Shoujo anime pull off quit as well. It can also be watched by guys as well,it's not just limited to just girls. It's also not a cheesy romantic drama only girls can watch, there are plenty of male characters that men can relate to as well. They have personalities and desires just like the female characters do, so you won't be complaining that they have no personality. Another thing this anime does right is the drama. It hurts when you see the characters have to suffer. It doesn't just point to a character crying and saying, \"Feel something.\" It's like getting to be good friends with someone and watch them cry. It's more effective and less hair-pulling that way. Ai Yazawa shows you the character's personalities, then their back story in the first few episodes, and then shows their dreams and desires. That's how you actually feel something for the characters, you show them their inner and outer shell instead of an empty shell with nothing inside to show your emotions to. Now, shall we jump into the beautiful and tragic world of Nana?\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the romance in this show was handled in a way that you'll never expect. The main female, Hachi (Nana), is looking for love throughout the show. You'd think she'd end up with the first guy that pops up into the show, but that doesn't happen. It goes into a more original direction then most shows of its genre.  I won't spoil it for you, but you wouldn't expect it in the first half at all.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the story almost never got rushed at all. It was always well paced and put together. You might think they'll forget about a character or part of the story, but as soon as you think that, it comes back and shocks you of how much it remembers itself. It has a nice balance to it that not a lot of shows do a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAnother positive is the themes of heart break, loneliness, and fake love that are prominent throughout the show. It's something not a lot of Shoujo do and when they do, they don't really turn out to be the best written things out there, but it really makes a lot of sense here. Why? Because we get to learn these characters desires, personalities, and sometimes they don't even want to do it to certain characters. It does feel like they put effort into making these characters feel human and it really does show.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nThere's only one con that prevents it from getting a ten though, this mostly has to deal with what genre this show is in rather then the story itself, the comedy can really get on some people's nerves. There are some moments that'll have you rolling on the floor laughing, but for the most part, it uses those usual anime expressions for comedic effect. If you're not a fan of that style of comedy, this show isn't going to change your mind about that.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 10/10 (Fantastic!)\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nIt's nice to see that there's a Shoujo that doesn't use gigantic eyes on their female characters. Ai Yazawa has a unique way of drawing her characters. Instead of the ordinary big eyed characters, she has a nice balance of realism vs anime/manga. The facial features are exaggerated but not too exaggerated to the point where their hands are as big as their eyes and mouths too small and noses as well. All of the characters have their own design that stood out among the rest. Like Nana's black hair and purple mascara, Hachi's innocent face, etc. It fit every character's personality and attitude. Everything had a nice evenness to it and it all adds up to memorable character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe studio who animated this was Studio Madhouse back in 2006, they're responsible for such masterfully animated shows like Death Note and Black Lagoon. So you would expect some great animation from this studio, because Death Note came around the time that Nana was still airing. Let's talk about the openings, They were wonderful and awesome for 2006 and even almost 9 years later. What's fascinating is that they used CG for the parts where Nana was on stage singing. It was very effective and what's good about this is that they don't use CG for the whole openings. It's a nice balance of CG and the animated parts of them. Overall, Madhouse did a great job on the animation. Never any shortcuts and it looks like they spent a lot of time for this.\\n\\n\r\nMinor Con:\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs might not appeal to everyone. It'll be hard to get used to them in the first few episodes, but when the show starts going along, you won't be that distracted by them as much as you did in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 (Wonderful!)\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nThere hasn't been any soundtracks out there that were as impactful, catchy, and beautiful as Nana's was. To name some tracks, there was Winter Sleep, Shadow of Love, Stand by Me, and Zero. The soundtrack is either one of those things you could listen to after a stressful day or before a party with friends. It's not limited to tracks that are just depressing and that's it, just like many things about the show, it's equivalent. It all adds up to one of the best soundtracks that you'll ever hear.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings were constructive and enduring. Always catching your ears the first time you hear them. They're something you'll be humming all day long. The first one titled \"Rose\" was memorable, tear jerking, and of course, catchy. Something you'll listen to when you want to listen to something elegant. The second one, titled \"Wish\" Is beautiful, impactful, and fit the show so well. It shows the pain and struggles that were going on around that time of the show. Great to listen to if you want to listen to a calming song. Finally, the one titled \"Lucy\" Is the most catchy out of all the other openings. If you want an up-beat song, this is something you should listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 (Near perfect)\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nEvery single character has perfect development, interactions, and personalities. You can look at one character and can name at least three personality traits from them. When you watch these characters, you'll feel like you're watching somebody's life in an anime. I won't be able to cover every character, so let's talk about the main females.\\n\\n\r\nNana Osaki:\\n\\n\r\nNana is an idependant, strong willed, and a laid-back person. When she gets to be roommates with Hachi (Nana) she also turns to have a huge heart for the people she cares about and is devoted to them. When Hachi is in a pickle, she is always there to run to her side and help her. If you even try to hurt one of her friends, she'll beat you up. She knows what it's like to be alone with no one to run to. Her mother left her and her grandmother watched over her then died when she was sixteen.\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of weird how her and Hachi get along so well. It might be because she needs a friend that can spice up her world. It's one of the reasons why they get along so well. To her, Hachi is like a little sister to her and she's the older and more mature one. She gets Hachi out of crazy situations because it's really hard to go through them on her own.\\n\\n\r\nShe has the perfect personality and a very humane one at that. She just feels like a best friend to you as you watch it. Her number one priority in life is to find happiness and is something a lot of us can relate to. You get attached to her dilemmas and when she gets emotional about something, you can just feel it just by looking at her. This character is one of the strongest female characters through personality you'll ever see.\\n\\n\r\nHachi (Nana):\\n\\n\r\nHachi is a person who is naive, a peacemaker, and a person who cares about others more then herself. Love is a huge part of her life and tries to find her \"prince charming.\" So she tries to flirt with all these guys to find the one because without love, she wouldn't be able to live. Some people in real life call her a slut but the way the anime portrays it, she's a young girl looking for someone she can live with for the rest of her life. Loneliness is something she can't live with and that's why she's a social butterfly.\\n\\n\r\nWhen she becomes roommates with Nana, she instantly gets attached to her. She is almost always a fun, caring, and a devoted person towards Nana and to others. She has a hard time getting mad at others, it just takes a lot away from her soul. She hides her inner feelings in order to keep the peace between her friends. She's such a caring and beautiful character both inside and outside. Thanks to her caring nature, she gives Nana an extra push to reach her dreams. Hachi an example of a beautiful person both inside and outside, although, there's only one problem with her character.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nHachi's indecisiveness will most likely bug you, sometimes you'll be yelling at her like, \"Don't do that you idiot!\" She has a very hard time making decisions so she relies on other characters to help her make the right decision. It's what prevents the characters from getting a ten.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nUnexpected romance, Well paced story, Beautiful themes, Unique character designs, Fluid animation, Inpactful soundtrack, Catchy openings, and Well developed characters.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nSometimes irritating comedy, Kind of hard art to get used to, and Hachi's indecisiveness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 (Great Show!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nana is worth watching for Shoujo fans and for people who love romantic dramas. You'll get attached to the characters in a heartbeat and almost everything else. Get to it as soon as possible, Nana is 100% worth your time watching!\\n",

            "content": "Nana for me was never a recommendation nor was it and anime I saw discussed on every forum, it was litarilly an anime/manga I stumbled upon one night whilst looking for a cute romantic series. I think that was a really lucky night. \r\nNana is honestly and anime I love a lot. Its one of the most real series I've seen.  I had kinda had enough of the typical high school harems that were all the same. Whist watching Nana I found something completely new and different. It still had the romantic feel I was looking for, but portrayed in a more adult way.And how can I forget the music in the series. When I intitally saw that this was a music series, I was kinda put off, because I did not see my self becoming very into the music of the series, however my percption had completely been changed in the first 5 mins. The opening song of the series \"Rose\" Is the best opening I've seen ever heard, and there are several opening I like, but this was a completely different feel and gave a sneak peek into what I was in for, for the next 47 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe two main Nana's of the series are complete opposites, which is why the series works soo well. We have cute, girly Nana AKA Hachi and The tomboy, rock chick edgy, Nana Osaki. They come together to make a great balance to the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this series is one that is often overlooked and is really great if given the chance. I personally have now seen the series 3 times and have finsihed off the manga. which quite rare for me, but it's the type of series that deserves the effort. It takes you on a rollacosta of emotions, with its light hearted comedy and it's touching romance. This is definatly a more mature approche to an otherwise teenage catagory in anime and manga, and why I appreciate it soo much.",

            "content": "Yes, I was initially drawn to NANA by Paradise Kiss. After having watched all of ParaKiss in about a day, I was left craving more of that special flavor of drama and the striking art style. However, I was not prepared for the treat I was in for when watching NANA.\r\nStory-\r\nWhat really struck me about the story was how the two parts of the story are weaved together. The two main characters' lives and personalities are so strikingly different that when they meld, it is truly something beautiful. The span of the story really helps one feel like they go somewhere, accomplish something, while watchingthis show. Once they intertwine and effect each other, that's when the story becomes something special. The drama, at times, feels like it is just taking soap opera cliches from the book, but for a change, I don't mind. The way it is written gives the show a feeling of reality, and the trials they face are compelling and moving.\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\nI love this art style. It isn't anything you would see normally, and it never gives you the feeling that they had a low budget or were ever lazy. The detail and color is enough not to be too distracting, but enough eye candy to hold you to it. All of the characters are visually appealing, and even though some may say its hard to get used to, I love it, and had no problems at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nIts a show about music, right? So the audio must be pretty impressive, and it doesn't disappoint. Anna Tsuchiya and her gritty voice sang perfectly as NANA Osaki. I always enjoyed listening to the opening and ending themes. My personal favorite was &quot;Kuroi Namida,&quot; more of a melancholy song, but the gritty love song, &quot;Rose,&quot; was another one of my favorites. OLIVIA was a nice contrast to ANNA. Her voice was a bit more smooth and feminine, soft, but still strong. The first ending song, &quot;A Little Pain,&quot; was my personal favorite of hers, because of its beauty and the sadness it bares. I always looked forward to it at the end, hearing the opening riff within the last couple lines of dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nI also really enjoyed the voice acting. I never at one point thought that the voices were annoying or wrong for the characters. The darker characters, like Nana Osaki and Ren, had voices that could carry that impression, while the cuter sweeter characters, like Hachiko, also had appropriate voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines. Without so many understandable and meaningful characters, this show wouldn't be nearly as good. The story itself is meant to contrast the two women, and it does that amazingly. The growth of these individuals is clearly evident, and does the 47 episode length justice. At times, the choices they made made me angry, but it is then that you realize how nicely human flaws are present here. Everyone makes mistakes, and this slice of life should be no different.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a really enjoyable show. I tore right through it, and despite the length, was left wanting more. With rumors of a season two, I can't wait to see where this show may take us next. With such personable characters, emotional music, nontraditional and beautiful animation, and the evolving story, I could definitely watch this one a next time around, and am dying to know where these characters go.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThe story is about 2 Nanas who meet accidentally and they become really good friends.\r\nIts really good anime which depicts the life of celebrities the difficulties they face and the past which lingers.\r\nIts is also a story about how the small steps we take in life might change our whole life. Its also makes you think about future and the present situations and analyse properly so that our lives may turn out to be better without hurting our friends and families much.\r\nIts not a homosexual movie which i thought after reading other reviews and was not interested to watch but it is not that sort;)\\n\r\ncharacters:\\n\r\nyou would fall in love with both Nanas at first and rest it different for different people.one Nana is cheerful,funny and  fickle while the other is serious and ambitious, its really good combination to make the story cool.\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nSoundtrack, openings and endings are really awesome and the songs that come in between the story are also good. Even though it is a musical anime it is typically not much a musical you could never get bored listening to songs played in the anime as main focus is on story unlike the movies where you get bored as they play songs now and then often. \\n\r\nMy view:\\n\r\nAt first I thought does a slice of life need 47 episode?  but this one definitely doesn't make you regret watching them all..It doesn't bore you much, the part where you feel irritated is at episode 22 and early 30 th episodes where it seems as if you were given a tasty food when you are really hungry but it is snatch from you thats the feeling you get there but if you continue in next episodes, the feeling is compensated as it gets interesting.\\n\r\n Overall:  the ending was pretty cool, I didn't expect it I mean the last episode made me feel that way,  did it make me depressed? I don't know :P ,  the feeling is really different. But in the end it was worth a watch and its a slice of life, dont expect a ending in it...:)",

            "content": "\"I need your love, I'm a broken rose.\" - lyrics from the first opening.\r\nThe anime shows aired during 2007 - 2010 were usually the most phenomenal in my point of view. Shows today were lacking the deep sense of plot, enjoyment, drama and the whimsical world of comedy. These days it is hard to look for an anime that will make you re-watch when you have time and remember for a lifetime. Nana is one of those shows that is heart-wrenching, cheerful and life - changing. \r\nPlot: Nana's story would actually be like soap operas in TV but better. You can see how the storylinewas put in deep thought and everything was strategically planned. More drama and comedy also more romance.\\n\\n\r\nTo tell you the truth, I suspected that this is going to be a music themed anime wherein everything revolves around the world of music, soundtracks, bands and yeah. more music. I thought the two girls coincidentally met in a competition. They looked different so I thought the gothic Nana would sing some alternative rock and other punk style songs (I wasn't wrong about that) and the other who looks like a fragile and cheery girl would venture in pop, love songs, or maybe japanese cultured stuff. Soon, they end up being rivals. On the other hand, that isn't the case. Osaki Nana, one of the main characters explored in Tokyo and met this girl named Komatsu Nana. They both have dreams, Nana wanted to become a successful singer, the other would like to find a job and be independent at the same time, meet her boyfriend who has a long-distance relationship with her. They soon meet again and it led to a deep and happy friendship. Although, it was a bumpy road for the both of them, things did sort out in the end (or so I thought). Heavy and consecutive circumstances will arise like betrayal, abandonment and despicable fate. Moreover, there will also be happy events which you will never get enough. The drama behind the story can happen in reality. We can relate to some of the stories of the characters and we will dive in to their emotions like we feel them, or like we are actually in the story. Honestly, there will always be cliche acts in this show but the point is, they clearly caught my attention. Life will not always be a bed of roses so, there will be various tragic moments along the way. Above all, I give it 9 points.\\n\\n\r\nArt, 6.5: One of the weak points but, it is understandable. The characters, background and other effects really did belonged to Madhouse. The eyes, body structure and dark aura reminded me of Death Note. The color of the hair reminded me of Bokura ga Ita as well as the expression of the characters. Kudos to the background, they somehow paid attention to the detail considering how hard it is to make an anime. They have to make everything from scratch. Developing 47 episodes can be a handful plus it was flashed last 2007 so yeah, I can see why I couldn't appreciate the art that much. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Some where phenomenal, some where blowing my brains out, and some where just distracting. I really like songs by the fictional band, BLAST (bias aside) because they were more convincing and new to hear. I'm not a big fan of punk rock or punk bands but it's nice to give it a try. Sound effects were quite repetitive while it adds mood to the dramatic and joyous scenes. \\n\\n\r\nVA's\\n\r\nWe'll start with the people I know too well and my favorites:\\n\r\nOsaki Nana's seiyu (Romi Park): Suitable, cool and awesome. She has the whole package. From the lowness of the pitch to the (sometimes) out of pitch voice she makes when she is mad or complaining. She's definitely one great voice actress. As expected to the Best Voice Actress during the First Seiyu Awards. \\n\\n\r\nNobuo's Seiyuu (Seki Tomokazu): Also Kyo Sohma's voice. It's nice to hear a kinder version of him and also his subtleness and everything. For me, he has one of the distinguishable voice of all and he doesn't have a mediocre voice. On top of that, I really like his acting, he could be goofy and seemingly upset at some parts of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nKyosuke's VA (Suwabe Junichi): Great and very A-okay. The huskiness of his voice suited the character very well. He has the ideal old guy kind of gesture and voice. \\n\\n\r\nLayla's voice actress (Hirano Aya): Exceptional work as always. She can depict a dramatic and a cheerful voice for the character. She also won an award but I don't remember what it was. On the other hand, I hope she had more screen time because I have always adored her voice.\\n\\n\r\nPeople I don't really know that well.\\n\\n\r\nKomatsu Nana's, Ren's, Takumi's, and Shin's seiyus were diverse too. Although I'm not a big fan of them, I enjoyed hearing their voices. They were good in catching my attention when I get hooked up in every scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest, they did okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8:\\n\\n\r\nSplendid Characterization but I can only give a few words to some of the characters:\\n\\n\r\nHere goes:\\n\\n\r\nKomatsu Nana: The flirty, selfish but cute girl that always get admired by many people. She can be dependable but she can do things professionally if she gives her heart and soul to perfect it. She is a fan of BLAST and TRAPNEST. She receives too many heartaches in the story but she always get to switch to many guys. She is a bright version of foolish chicks around the world. Naive, a boy lover and can flirt with any guy they like. But I love this woman, seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOsaki Nana: The cool version of a naive chick. She is somewhat a gothic girl. An introvert, independent, and incredible woman. A beautiful singer who will always cherish her fans. She isn't a boy lover but ever since she got to be friends with Nobu, she never had a single female friend (setting Misato aside). She has some problems like promoting her pride and having separation anxiety (because of her terrible past). I love her so much and I like her calm and consistent attitude.  \\n\\n\r\nJunko: An awesome friend to Komatsu Nana. She is straightforward and most of the time she can say things that would literally wake a person up and decide in a mature manner. She's definitely not one of those whores who would give second-rate advices and comfort their friends like a whim. \\n\\n\r\nKyosuke: First Most loyal guy in the show.\\n\\n\r\nRen: A bassist/guitarist in the band. Almost the loyal guy in the show. He is in love with Nana. He has some issues like being guilty on fulfilling his dream. He will do everything for Nana in a heartbeat. \\n\\n\r\nNobuo: Short but the sweetest guy ever. He isn't reluctant to give help to troubled girls. He can be a natural when it comes to fascinating conversations with men and even with women.\\n\\n\r\nSachiko: WHORE.\\n\\n\r\nShouji: MAN WHORE.\\n\\n\r\nTakumi: THE REAL WHORE\\n\\n\r\nShinichi: cute and visibly insensitive. He is probably the most chilled-out person in the series. He doesn't react that much plus he's handsome.\\n\\n\r\nYasu: Caring, Loving, and Dependable. He is like the Batman of this series.\\n\\n\r\nReira/Layla: Adorable, sensitive and a good singer too.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, there were really hateable characters. I can never get enough of NANA unless they remove all these characters because they are the highlight and the powerhouse of this story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: It was one hell of a ride. I'm lost with words. I shed a tear in many parts of the anime. Everything was unbelievably what I've wanted. Sure, there are some unwanted sex scenes, ecchi, and a lot of matured content but I am no pretentious slut plus I'm already a young adult so yeah I can carry it. The tragedy could be somehow heartbreaking but I eventually got over it soon. It's fine for me since it is has a realistic synopsis. The thought that at some point, they are all \"I think I wanna die\" but the next thing you know, \"Let's be fucking happy you bitches!\" It wasn't a total waste of time. We can really see the saying \"Forgive and forget\" in this anime. I also noticed how knocked up the characters were, they were sacrificing everything for music. Example, leaving your only love to complete your goal, giving up your chance to have good money and taking over a family agenda to be a guitarist, prioritizing your band instead of just studying for your lawyer licenship, and etc.\\n\r\nGiving it an 8 would mean I'm satisfied. I can continue on living and get inspired by this masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: I think I said enough. Nana's story, music, and characters brighten up my days. Considering how I finished all episodes within 3 days (too long isn't it), I definitely didn't regret watching this show. I learned that life won't always be the way you plan it to be. I might as well just let things hit for me and accept them but I will definitely do better. \\n\\n\r\nTRAGEDY and HAPPINESS always go together in life. It is inevitable.\\n\\n\r\nNana isn't just another love story, but a moment of truth, friendship, hard work and so on.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love romance, drama and realistic characters and plot, check out NANA!",

            "content": "NANA is a regrettably incomplete work. It takes viewers on a journey with an intriguing destination, aggravates them with rocky bumps along the way, and then unceremoniously abandons them on the roadside in the middle of nowhere. The story unfolds in reasonably entertaining ways but is too frequently hamstrung by inadequate build and progression with regard to many core characters, and when combined with the abrupt conclusion to the series, bewildered viewers at the very end may be asking themselves, \"Huh? That's it?\", as they lament over NANA's wasted potential and wonder what could have been.\r\nFrom the opening narration, NANA teases a mysterious endgame thatimmediately hooks viewers. The titular characters, Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu, and their respective origins are then introduced with a delightful blend of comedy and drama in the handful of episodes that follow, and viewers become increasingly eager to see them begin their new lives together in Tokyo. As more people enter their lives throughout the course of the series, the two Nanas progressively encounter more problems, and incidentally, the show itself does, as well.\\n\\n\r\nNANA spreads itself too thin in juggling its multitude of characters. Consequently, many key players in the show are insufficiently characterized, and their relationships are woefully underdeveloped. This manifests in various problematic ways throughout the entire run of the series. For starters, certain characters seemingly change on a whim, ever malleable to the demands of the story. Romantic relationships between certain characters, too, blossom and wither at the drop of a hat. Similarly, the degree of closeness of certain friendships, particularly that of the titular characters, comes across as highly implausible.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that can be traced back to one fundamental issue: viewers are expected to take too much on faith alone. When new and important facets of certain characters are revealed with no natural progression or even minimal foreshadowing, viewers must instantly believe that the most recent iteration of a character is the truest one, despite the dearth of any supporting evidence up to that point. When certain characters effortlessly fall in and out of love with no meaningful build-up, viewers are often simply told but rarely actually shown of how that love came to be and why it crumbled. When the titular characters implicitly and explicitly swear their eternal friendship, viewers are encouraged not to question that friendship because when viewers take into consideration only what they have seen--the occasional meals together, the band practice hangouts, a live concert outing, and a pair of strawberry drinking glasses--they realize that there is hardly anything of substance that would suggest that the two Nanas are inseparable soulmates. Friendly roommates? Sure. Good friends? Believable. Life partners? Unlikely. Whatever intense bond that they purportedly forged over the course of a mere six months must have certainly occurred off-screen, and like with everything else, viewers must accept it on faith.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, NANA's failure to tell a self-contained story in 47 episodes is inexcusable. NANA effectively ends in the middle of a story arc, making the ending a quintessential \"go-read-the-manga\" ending at its absolute worst. Considering that the publication of the source material was still ongoing at the time of the show's airing, the absence of a decisive conclusion to the entire story is, of course, understandable. However, what is not understandable is the total omission of a finale that is at least narratively logical with respect to only the 47-episode run. Not all loose ends need to be tied up, but enough loose ends certainly do in order to ensure a rewarding viewing experience. As it is, unsatisfied viewers must consult the source material, at least to a limited degree (note: the manga is on hiatus at the time of writing and has been since 2009), to obtain some sense of closure and to validate their time and emotions invested in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMuch as the titular characters ponder where things went wrong for them throughout the series, viewers are ultimately left to mull over the same about the series itself. Perhaps a tighter focus placed on a smaller cast of characters could have saved it. Perhaps a greater importance placed on organic character development could have helped. Perhaps a note-perfect conclusion could have mitigated the impact of all other flaws. In any case, the show that started off with such a remarkable bang provides no worthwhile payoff and finishes with a disappointing whimper, leaving unfulfilled viewers with many of the same questions in the end as they had in the beginning.",

            "content": "\"Epic\" - a word used describe the grand and the majestic... not a word you generally associate with romance.\r\nBut if there ever was an anime in which the romantic element can be justifiably described as \"epic\", then \"Nana\" would be it. Achingly beautiful and searing in its emotional insights, \"Nana\" takes the romance genre to dizzying heights while still maintaining a strong sense of realism and empathy with the viewer in spite of all its glamour and polish.\r\n\"Nana\" is a tale of two Nanas, Komatsu Nana (aka Hachi) and Osaki Nana (aka, uh, Nana). (I can't be bothered with their full names, so I'll justrefer to them as Hachi and Nana, which is what most of the characters in the anime do anyway.) A chance meeting between Hachi and Nana on a train to Tokyo marks the beginning of a special friendship. Hachi is on her way to join up with her boyfriend who is studying in Tokyo, while Nana is heading for the big city in order to take her career as a musician to the next level. The lives of the two Nanas soon entwine, and the story gets complicated, juggling friendship, romance, career aspirations and many other things simultaneously. \\n\\n\r\nI had high expectations for \"Nana\" before I started it, but I have to admit that I didn't get into it straight off the bat. There is one big reason for this - Hachi. Hachi is a fickle, self centred airhead whose number of past boyfriends probably rivals other girls in terms of the number of pairs of shoes they own. While she's not annoying in an excessive and unrealistic way a la Asuka from \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" or Menma from AnoHana, I really didn't feel interested in a story centred on this kind of character. In fact I stalled for several months after watching episode 3, where the show laid bare the worst of her clinggy character.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the series' attention shifted away from Hachi onto Nana soon after that, and, with two stunning episodes 4 and 5, showed me just what it is capable of. Nana is an intruiging character: controversial, pretentious and fiercely proud, her compelling portrayal gave me the motivation I needed to continue with the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile \"Nana\" does eventually meet my lofty expectations, it doesn't truly take off till about a third of the way through. After those two terrific episodes early on, the show went back to focusing mostly on Hachi. In spite of this, I didn't find them as hard to get through as the first few episodes. This is partly because Nana is now also in the picture to provide some relief, and partly because Hachi isn't quite as annoying once you get to know her a bit more. Though the first third of the show is far from being the series' best, they do throw up some spine tinglingly great moments. It could have been a lot more, however, if it wasn't for the excessive use of comedy. I feel that some of material dealing with emotional turmoil should have been given a more serious treatment, especially seeing how well \"Nana\" does that kind of thing. Instead, the series' often opted for a more comic portrayal, which undermined the mood at times.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, that criticism is only valid for that first part of the series. Everything changes once the members of Trapnest comes into the story. This is when \"Nana\" started producing episode after episode of drama of the highest caliber. These episodes are not only remarkable in their quality, but also in their consistency to stay at that remarkable level. At the heart its whirlwind drama, the show exposes, dissects, and examines in minute detail the emotions of the characters. The sensation of being dazzled by someone shining more brightly than yourself, the tug of war between pride and love, the feeling of not only needing someone, but more paradoxically, of needing to BE needed by someone... virtually everything explored in \"Nana\" feels startlingly real and relevant.\\n\\n\r\nFor all its romantic elements, the centrepiece of \"Nana\" is the relationship between the two Nanas themselves. Despite the two of them being so different in personality, they share a bond that seems to transcend normal friendship, and yet at the same time is as fragile as a glass figurine, and just as beautiful. The mutual envy and emotional support, the honesty and the dishonesty, the similarity and contrast between the personalities all contribute towards a fascinating and contradicting relationship.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, the story is narrated from Hachi's point of view. You get to experience the full range of her whimsical nature and her helpless, almost piteous attraction towards the glamourous, bright star in her life that is Nana. Hachi was never gonna be my favourite character, but she did grow on me quite a bit. Nana is still the more intriguing character though, so when the narration, after an astonishingly long run of excellent episodes, switched to her point of view at around the 30 episode mark, I was hopeful that the show would get even better. \\n\\n\r\nThese expectation does get filled to a certain capacity. The change allowed a deeper insight into Nana's complex character, insight that threw up some quite shocking revelations and served to make some things a lot clearer. Even though the show had already strongly hinted at Nana's fragility and pretentiousness, the extent of these traits only starts to surface at this point. I still wasn't completely sold by her feelings with regards to Hachi though... perhaps an narrative that interlaced the two perspectives all the way through would have made it more convincing than being dumped into the revelation all at once.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, the switch in perspective unexpectedly marks the point where the series starts to go down hill. Not by much, mind you. The problem isn't to do with the actual switch itself; it's to do with the romantic plots and subplots. You can only juggle so many relationships for so long a time before things start to feel ridiculous. When the monstrous webs of love triangles ends up involving nearly all the significant members of the cast, the show starts to buckle under the weight of their sheer number and complexity. While this isn't quite a show stopper for \"Nana\", especially considering its great execution, it's the worst kind of problem for this kind of series to pick up - it makes it feel too much like a soap opera. This causes the drama aspect of \"Nana\" seem a little too sensationalist, a little less believable. I find the characterisation of Takumi from Trapnest to be particularly problematic - while I liked the professionalism in his character, his constant changes in attitude sometimes makes him feel more like a plot device than a believable rock star, and in fact the whole of Trapnest feels altogether too down to earth.\\n\\n\r\n\"Nana\" more than made up for this slight lapse in quality eventually though, finishing the series with another strong run of episodes that are at least as good as any of the ones previously. While it remained a little over-convoluted, it's hard to take too much notice when the blossoming romances and the intensifying drama is so sublimely good. \"Nana\" ends on a hanging, bittersweet note that just begs for a continuation. Continuation seems unlikely though. This first season ended as the makers wanted to avoid fillers, and the intention is that a second season will be made once the manga is finished. Though this decision to avoid fillers should be applauded, the manga has stalled and the anime can no longer be considered as a recent one. With interest in the show cooling, that second season seems increasingly unlikely.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be a crime to review \"Nana\" without mentioning the music in it. In addition to the romance and relationships, \"Nana\" is about two bands, BLAST (Nana's own band) and Trapnest (band of Nana's lover Ren). A couple of Japanese artists, Anna Tsuchiya and Olivia Lufkin, were drafted in to perform the songs by the fictional bands. The songs are used heavily throughout the series, and in fact all the opening and ending themes are made up of them. There are several noteworthy things about these songs. The first is how they're impressively written to suit the story and the characteristics of the bands that perform them. Trapnest, a band that's hit mainstream popularity in \"Nana\", has songs with quite mainstream melodies. In contrast, BLAST have an edgier, more punk influenced sound, but one that isn't completely devoid of mainstream appeal, as one of the characters once commented. Anna Tsuchiya, who provides the singing voice of Nana, has a rasping voice that's so similar in quality to the Nana's talking voice that for a while I wondered whether it was the same person. \\n\\n\r\nMost of all though, I *loved* Olivia as the singing voice of Reira, the lead singer of Trapnest. The pure, ethereal beauty of her soaring vocals is exactly how I would imagine Reira's vocals to be. No wonder Ai Yazawa (author of the \"Nana\" manga), upon coming across her songs while helping to select the right singer for Reira, apparently exclaimed \"It can only be her!\" (A bit of trivia: Olivia, like Reira, is also half American!)\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just about the songs though, it's about the atmosphere too. The scene where Hachi being overwhelmed by the experience of going to her first concert has such a dense, authentic atmosphere that it reminded me of my own first time at a concert. The background music is also very good for setting the mood, but I think it could have done with more variety. A lot of tracks are just variations on the same melodies and themes. I also thought some of the elegant, classical instrumental tracks doesn't quite fit in with the style of \"Nana\", especially considering the nature of the bands the show feature, with their often heavy instrumentals and rebellious punk influences.\\n\\n\r\nI don't normally mention the voice actors, but the ones in \"Nana\" deserves a special mention for having so many stars in their midst. Even ignoring Romi Park (Ed from \"Full Metal Alchemist; Teresa from \"Claymore\") as Nana, there's a host of heavyweights such as Aya Hirano (Misa from \"Death Note\"; Haruhi from \"The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi\") and Tomokazu Seki (Sousuke from \"Full Metal Panic!\"; Chiaki from \"Nodame Cantabile\") to be found in support... it's like the \"Ocean's Eleven\" of anime. The big surprise though, is that amongst this glittery line up, Hachi is voiced by a relative unknown KAORI (don't ask me why her name's all in capitals, I'm just writing it how I've seen it elsewhere). But what's perhaps more surprising is that, despite her lack of star credentials, her near flawless portrayal of the whimsical Hachi is one of, if not THE most ear catching performance of the series; even short phrases such as the often used \"hey, Nana\" line are injected full of nostalgic feelings. It's to her and the show's greatest credit that Hachi eventually went from a character I disliked to a character I could not only tolerate, but like and even respect to a degree.\\n\\n\r\nIt's interesting to compare this to \"Beck\", a show that overlaps on many of the same themes of music, romance and life, but is a far more humble take on them. The difference is like the bands they feature - \"Nana\" is like the chart topping band while \"Beck\" is the indie band that's looking to make it big. And while the production power and glitzy glamour of \"Nana\" does help make it the better show (in my opinion), the two are ultimately very different, each with its own unique charms. It's just a shame that while \"Nana\" often transcends the romance genre with its powerful introspective insights on love and life, it ultimately doesn't completely break free of its trappings.",

            "content": "\"Say, Nana... Do you remember the first time we met?\"\r\nThese words are the introduction of the beautiful world of \"Nana\". Nana tells a story of two girls who are of the same age and shares the same name, but are completely different; One is a naive dater, who always hooks up with the worst kind of guys, while the other is a bitter musician with a violent temper and a lonely past.  Nana Osaki and  Nana Komatsu, (later nicknamed Hachi) meet on a train, after moving from their small-town homes, to Tokyo to chase their dreams of love, music, and self-discovery. Nana leavesher band 'BLAST, to become a professional musician, while Hachi moves to Tokyo to be with her boyfriend, Shouji. Once they reached Tokyo, they parted ways. But with in a couple of days, both Nana and Hachi encounter each other again while looking at the same apartment 707, and despite them being completely different, they agree to live together just so they can split the rent and have a cheap apartment.  But their fateful encounter changes their lives in ways they never imagined possible ... to the point where life becomes unlivable without the other.\\n\\n\r\nYou can say that this anime is under the category of 'slice of life', drama, and romance. Since both Nana and Hachi are completely different, and they are living together, you can expect there would be a lot of drama between the two. Well, to tell the truth, there's isn't a lot of drama  between them. Both Nana and Hachi connect so well, they become best of friends. But, the drama actually kicks in when it comes to  Hachi and her relationship problems, and Nana and her rivalry with the band Trapnest. NANA is a fairly realistic anime. We can relate to what the character goes through from our real life experiences. This is why the anime is under the genre 'Slice of life\" And if you can't relate to what the characters goes through, don't worry. The creator of NANA, Ai Yazawa, did an amazing job with the characters that you become so attach to them, that whatever may  happen to them, you can feel their pain, happiness, sorrows, and loneliness. \\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of characters, this leads me to my next topic. The Characters and their development.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines.  As I stated before, Ai Yazawa did an amazing job with the characters. The characters are very unique, whether it be a significant past story or an underlying secret, each character has a special trait that separated them from each other. The characters are generally very likable throughout, there were all kind of characters that perhaps people may find themselves easy to relate to, since NANA has that a realistic element to it.\\n\\n\r\n Another reason of how Ai Yazawa did an amazing job with the characters is that she gave each character a strong background history. The first 6 episodes of NANA is actually a flash back. The reason why the first 6 episodes is a flash back is so that you can get an idea of what the characters are like, which is helpful, because as the story progresses you can actually see the changes and growth of each character through their attitudes and personalities, each one developing in their own way through influences of the people around them. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC.\\n\\n\r\n For anime series revolving around music, I tend to judge the music a little harshly. But surprisingly, the music in NANA doesn't disappoint me. The songs that are presented in NANA gives it that magical feeling, and it matches with the dialog so well, that it might send chills down your back. Also, the songs that are presented from both Blast and Trapnest are incredible, I can see why Nana wants to compete with Trapnest, they're good.. I loved all the songs from both Blast and Trapnest, but to be honest, I love Trapnests music over Blast, Sorry Nana. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was alright. The Japanese audio, Hachi's voice was really annoying, but you eventually get use to it. The rest of the characters voice acting was fine. But compare to the Japanese audio, the English dub was spot on. It matches the characters personalities, and to even put a plus side for the English dub, Hachi's voice isn't as annoying.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nIf you're watching this anime for the first time, you might thing the art style of this anime is dull and boring, if you're use to watching anime that are bright and colorful. Or maybe that's just me. But, like I said before, you get use to it. Once you're use to the art style, you realize that the characters are drawn very stylishly, each with their own unique appearances. The landscape is drawn almost as well as the characters and everything is very distinguishable and pleasant to look at. If you\u2019ve seen Ai Yazawa\u2019s previous work, Paradise Kiss, it is very similar to that.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nThere isn't a lot of negatives to this anime. The only complaints that I have is that Hachi voice, in the Japanese version, is very annoying. And after getting use to the art style of NANA, and liking it, the only complaint that I have in that category is that the characters are drawn way to skinny. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you're not into slice of life, drama, or romantic anime, then I don't think NANA is right for you, but it still something to look into. But other than that, I think this anime is very worth checking. It has 47 episodes, So it's not too short, nor too long, I think it's the right amount. And once the anime ends, you can pick up NANA right where the anime left off with the manga after chapter 42. The story continues on in the Manga.Oh and a heed of warning, this anime is rated mature for mild nudity and drug use. and if that doesn't bother you, then go right a head and watch NANA\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to grade this anime, I would give this anime is a 96% A",

            "content": "Nana has tremendous characters, tremendous art, and a soundtrack that's top tier in every way. If only I'd known how this series ended before I sat through all 47 episodes I never would have bothered in the beginning.\r\nIt started as a dramatic comedy (different, in my eyes, from a comedy-dramas in that comedy is the primary genre and the drama evolves from there) with attention-catching art and super snazzy music. Nana and Nana were extremely dynamic women with bright futures and mysterious pasts; supporting characters introduced along the way added charm and allowed the Nanas to bounce their personalities around with fresh perspective.\r\nThen, before itreally took off, the series tanked hard into drama that no amount of funny expressions or good music could prop up. I realize now that this series is designed for young women and girls, and while I'm neither of those I'm still able to empathize and extrapolate. Some lessons conveyed in the show are actually very important for young people to be taught. But then, as I got into the 30-40 episode range I thought to myself \"wait, what IS the main thesis here?\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's that if you're a pretty young girl it's totally fine to sleep with an endless line of guys and things will just work out for you. Friends just happen by accident, good situations just take a number and pop up when it's their turn, and your fortune/fate will basically be determined by people who happily overlook your slutty personality by virtue of you being naive and pretty. Everyone enables the protagonist to such a degree it really started to make me angry for the last five or six episodes. Sure, there's a harsh angle of schadenfreude after all, but not only will it probably be missed by the target audience, it's not enough to make up for the morals passed through the previous episodes. Eventually everything just got depressing--and I mean SUPER depressing--and all elements of comedy were tossed aside in favor of tears. One or two attempts were made in the 40-45 range, but they were halfhearted at best and barely took attention away from the sad pit that the show had dug itself into.\\n\\n\r\nI've read a synopsis of the manga, and thankfully this series was put out before those things happened or I would have just tossed my computer out the nearest window. I absolutely do not understand why situations are made so depressing just for the sake of more drama. Who actually derives entertainment or enjoyment out of these scenarios? Is everyone that batshit insane in the world?\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I'm not the target audience. Obviously. But the potential for something really special was here, and I'll remember these characters for years. I'll also remember how thoroughly trashed they were through pointless melodrama.

There are tons of shoujo out there and I have watched a bunch of them, but, for me, Ai Yazawa has created  \"NANA\" in an unique and marvelous way.\\n\\n\r\n   The story is  simple to follow. It is about the lives of two 20-year-old girls, both named Nana, who came to know each other after a fateful meeting on a train heading to Tokyo. Simple as it starts, the story that unravels is beautifully plotted and it enraptures you. It is not an anime that will not appeal to your emotions. Sometimes you will laugh, others you will get angry, while the moments that you will find yourself in tears will not be a miss. The strongest feature of the story is Yazawa-san's realistic perspective. She keeps a fairly good distance from the typical, idealized shoujo love story and focuses on portraying emotions and situations that every girl may come across. My only disappointment was the \"ending\". It ended while there still are many things you wanted to see. Still, with the manga on a long term hiatus there would not be any choices but to end it.\\n\\n\r\n   As far as art is concerned most people would find the really thin and tall figures a bit bizarre, however they really are artistically made, inspiring the idea of beauty which keeps up with the elegance that the story is written. Each one character is carefully designed to fit his personality without whatsoever give everything away\\n\\n\r\n   The sound was also very good. Not only do the voices of the actors match with the character outlook but also with their personalities and emotions. Also, as a music genre, the singing was also pretty delightful as Tsuchiya Anna and Olivia Lufkin have beautiful voices. However, I expected due to its genre a bit more of singing. The OST's were fine, kept simple, without any exaggerations to give a boost to the emotions.\\n\\n\r\n   The characters, matching the realistic style of Yazawa-san, are not flawless or very bad. Their personalities are deep and you get to know and understand them better as the story goes on. The backgrounds of the two girls were told right form the beginning which made a solid base for someone to get their personalities outline. The supporting characters were also treated with care and had a depth in their personalities as they play an important role to the development of our heroines.\\n\\n\r\n   In a nutshell, \"NANA\" was definitely worth-seeing. It is an anime that i have watched over and over and still love it. The plot was amazing and I felt a part of the story. It is one of those kind of anime that you never forget. Even though the ending is unsatisfactory and anyone who has gone through it craves for more, it surely does not affect the pleasure that \"NANA\" has to offer!",

            "content": "Nana is about two girls who share a lot in common including the same apartment and name. While one aims to be a famous musician the other aims to have the perfect love life. However,things don't go their way and it is a story of the trials and tribulations they go through.\r\nThe story is amazing in that is is so realistic. The most realistic anime i have ever seen. It shows the harshness of reality and this allows people to empathize with the characters as well as keep you glued to the screen because you don't know what will happen next,(life is unpredictable). The romanceis also very realistic and not so much idealistic so i find it more worth while to watch, though it can be quite harsh to some who are used to the more &quot;easily&quot; acheived lovelife.This is also where a lot of drama is inculcated into the anime so if your a drama-romance fan you will defnitely like it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, not like your typical animes, it has a more unique style and is particularly good in the illustration of the characters.Nothing bad about it at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs are fantastic! I loved every single one of the songs sun g by both bands(the opening and closing songs are performed by the bands as well).The songs are punk-rock mostly but there is one or two more light-hearted songs, but i still like them all even though im not much of a punk rock fan.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the anime's winning factor. The characters are all so vivid, all the chraracters are expressed well being able to see all their pasts, it gives you a better understanding of the story and the reason for their dreams. The character development is also astounding, one of the best i've seen, they mature a lot from the beginning to the end. Back to my previous point that most of the characters have a significant role to play which makes it quite realistic in that you are not focusing on only the main characters but the supporting chracters have a big role to play and this makes the story complex and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime a lo, from the songs to the characters to the story, it was all very good. There is a fair bit of comic relief in the anime and you really get swept away with it, i was like shouting at the screen at point at the main characters decisions,it was very engaging. But i must warn people that the ending can be said to be quite open ended which bothers me a bit as well.But its the same for the manga as well, and it is quite a surprise too(go watch and youll see, the last episode is a big surprise) it leaves you with a ton of questioons if you only watch the anime. But i suspect there will be a second season because of the ending and it was quite clear that the company will show the rest after the manga finishes. So i really look foward to it. It is definitely worth watching though it is adviced for a slightly more mature audience because it is really about REAL LIFE, not your idealistic bullshit.",

            "content": "Script - Fucking around. This show is about a lot of people meeting each other and establishing a series of relationships that are both complex and touching. Relatability is an important factor as people who have never been involved with someone in a romantic level can miss the most impressive thing in Nana: its realism. In a show where everything is about who's dating who we gotta see things moving forward naturally and characters acting naturally and acquiring dimension as time passes. When both Nanas decide going to Tokyo for similar reasons but a completely different mindset and view of the world, the result isa tangle of ideas, fears, interests and conflicts taking shape in a way so dramatic though so subtle. There's a lot of tone shifts, but they never ruin the atmosphere. If a moment is going to be crucial, regardless of the comic relief, there's no way you'll lose the punchline. Also, each character is developed slowly and through several layers of exposition. They don't just sit and talk about what's happening. You see them coming together step-by-step and their interests are so human. I mean, you see that there's more to each character than you could ever expect at first. Characters who seemed to be only clowns at first actually changed a lot throughout the show and though they remained the same people. That's very, very hard to make. Change your characters but don't replace them by another one. Also, the characters are treated with respect. Women are not objectified and sex scenes do not please a certain audience of perverted otakus, but rather have a meaning that relates to the plot and advances it properly. It's not cheap bullshit, it's serious business. As I said before, to those who have been in a relationship this show can represent a lot of the struggles and confusion that naturally make part of one. No character is perfect, all of them fear for something and hope for something. The plot is simple, but the characters are the most important elements of a show in my opinion and the hardest to handle. The conclusion wasn't as powerful as I expected, but the entirety of the show is simply too harmonic, beautiful, realistic and pleasing for me not to forgive minor flaws.\\n\\n\r\nCinematography - The character design is a bit generic, but works just fine since I can identify every single character in the show. The animation is basic and doesn't distract. The color palette is not colorful and while it's not bad at all, can make some people think the show is dry. Too bad for them. About the camera angles, they work very well to build relationships from distance and also the back and forth is ingenious sometimes, play attention to bathtub scenes. There's a lot of visual gags, but when not actually funny they don't distract at all. As I said, punchlines will usually work regardless.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Okay, the characters don't talk normally. They force it to fit their characters. It's something appealing to most people, but I can't stand to it sometimes. In this show though, since the content and substance is solid enough, I didn't care too much about it. There are voice actors who seem to be dead while recording, so I thank this is not the case. The soundtrack is simple, but some tracks are just too remarkable. The main theme for sad moments strikes really hard and usually is so well-placed. The start of the ending whenever a moment gets emotional towards the finale of each episode is also magnificent. Some of them warmed my spirit enough and of course I got excited to see what was going to happen in the next episode. Also, no engrish, thanks god.\\n\\n\r\n1234 - First episodes are a bit rushed when establishing Hachi's relationship with Shouji. Basically, a problem that comes whenever you want to push too much time and events towards the audience in a short amount of time or even off-screen. Also, the credibility of the 'music channel' that covers the polemic of Black Stones and Trapnest is kind of dubious. I live in a country where gossip about celebrities and bullshit on television is a thing, but even though they were never like that before. Very weird. The ending is not conclusive because the manga is unfinished, too bad.\\n\\n\r\nNana is slow-burning though fast-paced development of relationships that are gonna get denser and denser until you have a complex orchestra of characters, each one with their struggles developed and working in harmony, going for some real romance that reminds every facet of a real-life courtship. I hope you enjoy it and relate to it as much as I did. The End.",

What happanend though was the writers we're trying to be clever in the build up & ended up tripping in the tangled web thatthey themselves had weaved, making any attempts of getting back on tracks to save the series pointless and unfortunately too late.\\n",

Plenty of time to go into the back stories of the characters which really helped draw me in. Getting to know the characters feels the same as getting to know someone in real life. You can't make judgments about a certain character as their complex personalities are revealed delicately. and one finds that the characters are far from stereotype.  Even the supporting characters will wake the empath in anyone. Theyare the type to move you. Make you fall in love with the characters as they make you laugh, cry, or feel annoyance, frustration, even hate.   Yazawa Ai is a genius.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is rich with heart wrenching and heart-tugging moments. Girls, get a box of tissues ready. This is not to say that NANA can only be appreciated by girls.  True, there is romance but it explores the psyche of two women in a way that men will still derive some value in watching it because if ever they do decide to sit down and watch this, it will give them a better insight on women. Oh and did I mention this is a mature anime? \\n\\n\r\n I am crossing my fingers for the continuation of the anime.  Although I read the manga, I don't want to miss the music. The songs and the seiyuu are excellent, especially coupled with the music...ahh the music.  These elements really brought the manga to life.",

Few years later, i feel like i'm missing out because everyone who are familiar with anime love Nana. So i watched it again. I guess its because i'm much older and mature, i actually understand and feel the emotions the characters were portraying. \r\nThe characters are realistic and the story seems as if it is actually happening somewhere in this world. I feel like i'm watching a real live actiondrama when i'm watching Nana. I love so many things about this series. The music. The plot. The feels especially. Whenever i see Nana related post or hear the songs, i feel nostalgic as if it used to be something that meant a lot to me when i was growing up, but it's been only a few months since i finished it. That's the kind of impact Nana gives to me. and i don't always feel that with a lot of other things. \\n\\n\r\ni really hope the manga will be finished soon and the anime will be continued from where it left off. \\n",

I've always had a soft spot for anime with character development. Nana is a perfect example for character development, and I enjoyed every minute of it. \r\nI did not know what to expect from this show, it has been on my \"Planning to watch\" list but I never got the chance to watch it. And I don't regret watching it. I just love how this show is like anopposite attracts kind of show. Nana Osaki being the punk rock girl while Nana Komatsu being the cheerful cute girl the band members call Hachi.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between the two girls is just amazing. The ending of the anime was just sad, honestly I wanted Hachi to be with Nobu. I never thought Hachi would pick Takumi over Nobu which upsets me. Towards the ending of the anime was kind of depressing. I wish the anime would have completed with the same ending of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime gives off that old school vibe, which I like. New anime these days only focus on boobs or panties for their artwork which is kind of annoying but fine for fan service. This show mostly consists of desires for each character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a 10. When I have the time I go on Netlfix to watch this show. There should be more anime that focuses on character development, because this one exceeded my expectations.",

            "content": "\u201cYou know Hachi, I've been alone for a long time and I've felt lonely practically for all my life, but back then when I turned around and found you intent on cheering up our devastated lives, for a few seconds, I felt as if I had finally found a real home\u2026 our home.\u201d\r\nWatching NANA takes me back to the first month that I moved out of home with a friend into the big wide world. Not knowing how to get electricity connected or how we were going to survive with $10 in our bank accounts. Literally going months without buying groceries or how tiresome itgot walking up and down the countless flights of stairs. To me, Nana is one of the most realistic anime shows to date. \\n\\n\r\nLove. Friendship. Family. Identity. Independence. Reality. Arguments. Memories. Dreams. Beliefs. Morals. Fate. NANA covers the contents of life. The good, the bad and the uncertainty this is life itself. Which is part of the reason why I feel as though it is completely relate-able to.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was strong from beginning to end. Every main character had the spotlight to share their past, and they all grew in front of us. They weren't portrayed at the ideal human beings, just every day people who have dreams and have to work hard to make a living. I believe it allowed viewers to quickly learn about each character, forming a bond between viewers and characters based on personality. \\n\\n\r\nThe music\u2026 Ah the music. Seeing as this anime is based around the theme of music, it\u2019s obvious that it was going to be good. But from the moment that I listened to the OP in episode 1, it had already surpassed my expectations and I was drawn in, needing to hear more. I\u2019m a fan!\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this series was better than I thought. Initially i wasn't too fond of the work but after time passed it really grew on me. It pushes the boundaries of society with the thin bodies, ripped clothing, and identity. Many people don\u2019t like this style because many of the characters look malnourished, however this is anime. It defies logic, and it shouldn't be thought of as a personal attack against humans who aren't stick thin. It is simply the style that is best suited towards the plot and image of characters personalities. My only negative is that some episodes were noticeably better than others.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I have basically just shared my embarrassing love for this anime, I suppose I had better discuss my one and only negative, rather than being biased. The ending... it really didn't sit well with me. I've got questions that I need answers to! It felt rushed in my opinion and I wish there was one last episode or ova so that my questions can be answered. But in saying that i still enjoyed the ending, it just had a lot to live up to.\\n\\n\r\nI've been procrastinating about watching NANA for a loooooooong time, as I didn't expect that I would like it as much as everyone else was claiming. I regret waiting so long. I\u2019m a sucker for a nice friendship/romance story, and that is exactly what NANA delivered, except with a more realistic twist on it. \\n\\n\r\n I loved every minute of it, and would recommend everyone who hasn\u2019t already seen this to watch it. This was truly special.\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nHey, Nana....When I think about the different experiences you've had, with your band, with Ren, and most importantly with Hachiko, I begin to realize something. That love is not always what it means. On the outside, love is this perfect sphere of happiness and joy that can never be tainted. But on the inside, it's a swirling mess of betrayal, sadness, and hardship that leaves scars that even time cannot heal. But despite all of this, the connections we establish with the people that we truly love are impossible to break. It's with this mentality in mind that\"Nana\" goes down as one to remember.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nNana, like the name implies, is a story about two young women, both conveniently named Nana. After moving in together, their relationship with each other and with those around them is tested on a multitude of levels.\\n\\n\r\n\"Nana\" the show is a trek. Resting at 47 episodes for its single season, it is a lot to get through (based off of conventional anime standards). But it's for this reason that the show is just so good. Having so much time to work with the characters and the story allows everything to be fleshed out, explored, and developed as much as possible. One might think the opposite, that most of the progression would begin to stagnate due to the sheer amount of episodes. But with \"Nana,\" this was not the case.\\n\\n\r\nAs described in my preview, \"Nana\" focuses heavily on love and all that it entails. This should be interpreted literally; all facets of love are explored and investigated over the course of the show. From betrayal to true passion, nothing is off limits. This is something that the show can do so well because of the setting itself. The cast involved are all (more or less) over 20 years old. Meaning, this isn't your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. It's a mature, adult look at the relationships and love between men and women. For this reason alone it is already unique in the anime world. Most shows do not look at relationships \"so far ahead\" because that isn't the demographic. But even disregarding the show's maturity, its ability to capture this essence of what it means to love and be loved makes it far superior compared to other romantic shows.\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching \"Nana,\" the story is told from an interesting perspective. It's done in such a way that you know something isn't quite right early on, and that the overall progression of the story is leading up to this reveal. The entire time, you are wondering how the characters are going to end up not only individually but with each other.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time the story concludes, despite everything that you've been through, it still leaves you wanting more. The show ends on a rather peculiar note that has many unanswered questions left, but it is succinct enough to let you know that, for better or for worse, love is and always will be this rather strange phenomenon.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\n\"Nana,\" like its subject material, takes on a rather mature look. The art style is rather realistic, both in terms of the environments and the locations depicted, as well as with the characters. Whether it is the buildings, decor, or its people, everything just feels \"older\" when compared to regular anime. The show does incorporate reaction and minimalist faces, but this is almost always used for comedic effect.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the actual animation in the show is different. When looking at it critically, it is rather average. The show is dialogue heavy, but even for the sections that involve character movement, there isn't much detail. This is especially true when it comes to the most important sections which are the band performances. Many of the shots are either cut in such a way as to not show the characters performing their instruments or the shots that are used are recycled throughout the show. This is unfortunate considering how well everything else is done, but the show's actual animation is just not on the same level.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nOne of \"Nana's\" strongest parts is in its characters and their characterization. There are way too many to go into great detail about, but I will talk about my favorite three. Suffice it to say that they are all very well done and any one of them can be talked about at great length.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Nana-one, or \"Hachiko\" as she becomes later on. Hachiko is caring, loud, dependent, and carefree. Her view on love begins rather one-sided. That is to say, she believes that love is something that should be cherished dearly and can only bring someone happiness. She realizes through the relationships that she has that love is not so simple. Love brings both pleasure and pain, for both the receiving and the giving parties. As Hachiko begins to experience these different sides to love, her character also begins to change. While she starts off rather immature in her view on the world, by the show's end it is clear that she understands that love is not as idealistic as she initially made it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite characters from the show is Shin. Shin, despite his appearance, is among the most mature and wise people within the group. While his past is mysterious and ominous, his troubles give his view on love the exact opposite take when compared to Hachiko. Where she views love as something to be obtained, Shin views love as something to be used. Shin starts off using love for his own personal benefit, but he learns that love's best rewards come from not hogging it all to oneself and instead sharing it with someone who you care for deeply.\\n\\n\r\nArguably one of the best, if not the best, character from the show is Nana-two, or simply Nana. Like the rest of the cast, her relationships with those around her are both strong and broken. While her demeanor gives off a cold, stoic vibe, she is actually quite soft and sensitive towards the people around her. While she never goes out of her way to make her feelings known, she is always in a constant struggle trying to balance the varying forms of love she has for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nMost notably, her and Hachiko's relationship is, understandably, the most interesting. They care deeply for one another, not as friends or as lovers, but as something in-between. It's almost as if they were sisters separated at birth. They could not be any more different personality-wise, but their connection to each other is something special to behold. It guides the shows narrative and more often than not it decides the characters actions. In this way, Nana and Hachiko understand that the love they have for one another isn't something that can just be explained. It's almost like this ethereal existence that, no matter what may occur between them, their invisible link will never be broken.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\n\"Nana,\" alongside being a romantic comedy, is also of the music genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP of the three is, to me, the best among everything that the show has to offer. It's punk-rock sound and lyrics fit so perfectly with the show it's almost scary. I still remember the lyrics and that sweet sounding guitar. The second OP is also very good. Coupled with the visuals, it gives you this feeling of drowning or being trapped that mirrors its section of the anime. The third OP goes back to the punk-rock roots to finish off the show on a high note. The beat and especially the lyrics just make you want to jump off your feet and to \"keep going on.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe EDs take on a different role by being generally more melancholy. The first ED seems rather boring relative to the other OPs and EDs, but its meaning actually serves a greater purpose once the entire story has actually been told. The second ED is my favorite of the three. Its beautiful singing always captivates me when I hear it and its inclusion in the show was a definite boon. The third ED is perhaps the weakest, but it is by no means bad. Its sound gives off a sense of hope and longing for things out of reach.\\n\\n\r\nI said this briefly, but what all three of the OPs and all three of the EDs do extremely well is be relevant. If you pay attention to their sound, tempo, and lyrics, they have a much greater meaning to them in relation to what is currently happening in the show than them just being a few different pieces of music.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is fine. Nothing amazing of note, but all of the pieces are used appropriately and sound fitting enough for the shows overall tone and atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, Midori Kiwana as Nana/Hachiko and Romi Park as Nana do a fantastic job in their respective roles.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nYou would be hard pressed to find another anime watcher who loves romance more than I do. If I can ship a couple in a show, I do it immediately. If there are any hints whatsoever as to two characters having feelings for one another, I'm already having a huge, beaming smile on my face. So, for many parts of Nana, I was in heaven. Not only because of the constant romantic developments but also because it was something that I could potentially relate to.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the romance, the show is surprisingly very funny. Again, due to its adult-like nature, many of the jokes are older, dealing with topics such as sex and work. But at the same time, the show can also be more playful, such as making Hachiko \"act\" like a little puppy or having a character's cigarette floating in the air due to shock. The vast majority of the laughing happens in the first half of the show because the vast majority of the drama occurs in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't anything that \"Nana\" does wrong. It has strong characterization, memorable music, mature themes, nice humor, and good story-telling. I can't remember where I read it before, but sometimes \"Nana\" is referred to as the \"Fullmetal Alchemist of romance.\" And after completing the entire season, I can safely say that it is absolutely worthy of this title.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, love is investigated inside and out\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, mature look with average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, their experiences define the show\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, every OP and ED has meaning, soundtrack is nice, VAs perform wonderfully\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, romantic, funny, and mature\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "What was so special about NANA for me was that it didn't feel as if I needed to personalize the story, as if I was approaching something foreign and making it familiar to me. Nana spoke to something that already existed in myself. NANA was a story about Nana(s), but it was also my story, not in any particular way... it just was.\r\nThere was something so honest about it--it wasn't about art, or fame, or sex, or money, it wasn't even about music itself. It was about people, and how we cannot go on without love. We need love almost more than we need tobreathe.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, it seems so hard to hold onto. We look for love where we won't find it. We walk away from love that we didn't believe was there. We make so many excuses for why we do the things we do because sometimes we're not even sure if love is real, maybe all you have in this world is yourself. As people go their seperate ways and life just happens to them, the struggle to hold onto love becomes that much harder to bear, we have no choice but to approach our lives one day at a time, searching for a balance between all the things we want, all the things we lost, and all the disappointments we live with. Nothing can change that for anyone, we all have to find our own peace. \\n\\n\r\nI saw that in every character, but I saw it most in Nana herself. On the outside, she's tough, and strong, and she stands her ground. But on the inside, she's more lost than anyone, she's a child that is desperately hanging onto love. She wants Hachi, she wants Yasu, she wants Ren, she's so afraid of losing what they mean to her but she can't force time to stop. She doesn't give a shit about where she's going in life because she knows and feels that it doesn't mean a thing if she gets there at the expense of her love. She'll do anything for love, she'll even die for it if she has to. It's kind of tragic, but what is she going to do? What choice are we given in life? A lot of people can point to times where they regret having given up on love, but even someone like Nana, who keeps trying so hard not to give up--what can she do? Even if we abandoned everything for love it wouldn't permit us a permanent connection to any one person or point in time.\\n\\n\r\nI guess this anime was so important to me because I felt connected to someone I didn't even know, I suppose to Yazawa Ai and her own portrayal of that experience, but in just a general sense, to *someone* who clearly had felt these emotions. Because I watched NANA around the time I was struggling to make peace with the same exact feelings in my own life. I mean, it's an ongoing struggle, for everyone, but it came at the perfect time for me. NANA didn't do anything special with those feelings, and it didn't want to, that wasn't the point. It just existed with them, and in doing so, it quietly reminded me that I am not alone, in a way that I could actually feel. Nobody is alone, and that's not only some trite fucking sentiment you write on a bathroom stall in a moment of self-intoxication or something. There's really something behind that, you just have to be in the right place to receive it. NANA could do that for me and for a lot of people. I think there's something so magical in that.",

            "content": "Nana brought back my joy of watching anime since I took a hiatus in watching animes from 2002 to 06. \r\nStory - Nana is a story between two girls who shares not only the same name and age but the struggles as well. Every band musician will appreciate its story for it decipts how an old-fashioned Punk-rock band made it to the mainstream, Yes it is somewhat simillar to Beck, but Nana is different. Along with the musical journey, there is also a strong romantic plot which is the essence of this anime. This anime is humane and it could almost happen to anyone.That is for you to find out XDD\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art is crisp, as expected from Madhouse. Even though there are sometimes that the drawing is somewhat off, I took a read of the manga and realized that the characters are really drawn that way, Madhouse did a good job for maintaining the original Art from Yazawa sensei's. The background is awesome most specially in the first episode, but just about in the middle of the series, it is noticable that the BG isn't that good but they did reclaim it's goodness in the later episodes of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Like I've said earlier, Nana is a good musical journey (on par with Nodame Cantabile, well that depends on the person if they like either classical or punk rock/rock.) Among the several OST's of this anime, it is noticable that Nana uses different musical crossovers from country to winter-like ballad and heart wrenching violin scores used in their BGM's. The OP/ED of this anime is a pure win Anna Tsuchiya for Blackstones and Olivia Lufkin for trapnest.. It is a huge break for Olivia and Anna for them to perform to Nana for Nana is reallly popular in Japan even though I'm not too sure if it is right now. Personally I liked Kuroi Namida and Wish the best. You know what, If you have seen Nana the movie, I would really suggest that the two (Anna and Olivia) must have taken the role of Nana and Reira, for it suits them very well (Yazawa said that they are perfect for the bands they portray in).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters are enjoyable, their antics are soo cool and simple. The characters tend to do something cool, one episode after another. One good thing about this animes characters is that they show the flaws and egoism of humanity when it comes to love or money etc. It is painful sometimes to watch the episodes but this is the truth. Not just your typical anime wherein everything seems so vivid and bright, Nana is a good meaning for &quot;Slice of Life&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - There are 47 episodes in all and I enjoyed every minute of it. I enjoyed it thoroughly since I do listen to Punk Rock.  Everyone could relate to everything in this anime, that being said, Everyone would enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - Nana is a decent anime to watch, even though it is intended for girls, I myself as a guy really enjoyed Nana for I can relate to all the characters and to the story as well. Now I'm longing for season 2 *protest* XDD I'd say that why don't you try something or anything which is a slice of life today? Nana is highly recommended by yours truly, Cafekko. :)",

            "content": "Nana was the 2006-2007 anime (long) of the Madhouse studio. It\u00b4s  one of the most popular animes Shoujo. The anime also has some josei to reveal more mature and profound passages in the plot.\r\nSTORY (8/10)\r\nNana tells the story of two different girls in search of dreams in Tokyo. Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu, the two have an interlaced fate, so that the two begin to live in the same apartment. The Osaki wants to be a singer of success and Hachi want a job and be with her boyfriend.\r\nRegarding the direction, Nana has ups and downs. There are moments of comedy and drama (dramahas more). I like drama, the problem is when it is poorly managed in some episodes mainly with Hachi. There is much drama and little developing  by the Hachi.I didn\u00b4t want  to change her personality, but i would  like that she was more mature. The script is well balanced and almost every episode you stay connected with everything that's going on with the band and with the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nART (6/10)\\n\r\nThe animation Nana is bad / average. There are few moments of fluidity. In one episode, Nana and Nobu were smaller than normal relative to the others.  The design is good, but nothing too much.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9/10)\\n\r\nThe strong point of Nana. The anime has great openings, endings and soundtracks in some striking scenes. The best opening for me is the last, \"Lucy\" by Tsuchiya. It\u00b4s  attractive and accurately portrays the feelings of Osaki.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (8/10)\\n\r\nOverall Nana has good characters: Nana Osaki, Yasu (Yasushi), Nobuo, Shin, Ren, Reira (Layla), Shouji, Sachiko, Junko, Kouchi,  Miu and Mai. These are all great characters and above all charismatic. Until some characters that appeared a few times as the Miu and Mai  knew deep pass and affection.\\n\r\nBut there are some characters that I didn\u00b4t like so much: Nana Komatsu and Takumi. In opposition to Osaki who prefer the independence and determination, Hachi is a spoiled girl and puts  men above all. Any handsome man appearing, she falls in love. Ok, she changes the course of history, but she is still very dependent financially and emotionally. Anyway, Hachi is needy and selfish. During the 47 episodes, she changed little and thought the forced drama.\\n\r\nTakumi is a selfish character who only thinks of himself. For me, was a waste to put him in the script.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT  (8.5/10)\\n\r\nAs entertainment, anime is very good. That's because romanticize and fantasy certain aspects of the relationship. But there is a certain reality when we hear the feelings of Nana Osaki, my favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nAs I said, the anime has ups and downs. It has an open ending and you can go to the manga. Nana could be a better anime to do a reboot. Even still I recommend this anime to have some values and reflections on life. The Life isn\u00b4t easy for anyone and the effort it takes to get what we want in this short passage in the world.",

I don't think it is the perfect anime, but I do think this is one of the best anime of this kind of genre.\r\n- Story 8.5/10\r\nLike I said, it's a slice of a life anime. You can expect it to go about normal life issues, ups and downs, about struggles, hopelessness, and happiness, like the realistic life. It's a pretty deep anime, and the story was bringed out very wellImo.\\n\\n\r\n- Where the story is about\\n\r\nIt goes about two young women who are both share the name ''Nana'' (Means 7 in japanese) and age (20 years old) who met each other in a train and began sharing their lives. One of them is a vocalist of a band(''Black Stones''). In the beginning it's more about the other Nana (''Hachi'') not part of the band, later in the anime it goes more about her roommate's life too. It goes about their work, friends, and relationships, which are connected to another band as well (''Trapnest''). Those members of the two bands are involved too, they play a big role in the story.\\n\\n\r\n- Art 9/10\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are awesome. I think it's a pretty unique artwork, since I haven't seen anything like this so far. It's very detailed, they did a great job.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound 10/10\\n\r\nThe voices and the background sounds ect. were very good. The voices didn't sound exaggerated at all, which I hear sometimes in anime.. and they fitted the characters perfectly Imo. I also like the music very much, but what else do you expect from an anime about music?\\n\\n\r\n- Characters 8.5/10\\n\r\nI like the characters from NANA, they all have their own, unique not completely perfect personality. It feels for me they introduced them also well, they show you history about almost all of them. You emperize in their live, thoughts, feelings and grow with them. You really can get attached to them.\\n\\n\r\n- ''Enjoyment'' 8/10\\n\r\nEveryone experiences it in a different way. Everyone has different tastes and preferences. There were parts for me I loved, but also parts I found a bit boring, but in overall I'd give it an 8. It was definitely worth spending my time on.\\n\\n\r\nI recommed you to watch it, at least try it. I didn't love it right away when I started watching it either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy! ^^",

            "content": "NANA is perhaps one of the better shoujo series out there, and I give full credit to Yazawa-sensei's beautiful characterization and plot developments. This series is very character-driven, and without its memorable characters, it wouldn't be half as good as it is. And when it comes to plot, yes, it's filled with your typical shoujo elements but they're all done well, which just goes to show that it is possible to breathe life into old cliches.\r\nStory -- As I said, the plot is very character-driven, focusing heavily on two girls who, by amazing coincidence, are so similar but also very different as they walk theirpaths of life. It really would be nowhere if it weren't for all the wonderful characters that Yazawa-sensei has created. Furthermore, the story in the anime is so heart-wrenchingly told at certain points. The narrations at the beginning and end of each episode are told as if the future Nana or Hachi are looking back on old memories, reminiscing and possibly regretting, questioning and hoping, leaving you to wonder if Nana and Hachi ever got their happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the pacing of the story was very well done. At times, especially near the beginning, I thought it lagged a bit much by going over the Nana and Hachi train meeting, but after that's over and done with, it goes at what I considered a perfect pace. I never felt once that the story was dragging and was always wanting to know what would happen in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt -- The art was done very nicely. The colours were vibrant but never too unrealistic, and the animation and CGI were smooth and never felt cheap. If I had any complaint, I'd say that the characters were often drawn too thin to the point where they looked anorexic or even completely unrealistic, even for anime characters. Otherwise, it was all very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound -- For anime series revolving around music, I tend to judge the music a little more harshly. Still, I loved all the songs from both Blast and Trapnest. Anna Tsuchiya provides a harsher, rougher tone, that nicely reflect Nana's character and style, while Olivia Lufkin's softer vocals provide a more romantic and feminine tone, which again shows the theme of contrasts. When the OPs or EDs were used as insert songs, they were done very appropriately and suited the situations well, so they didn't feel randomly thrown in for the sake of having music. The other background music tracks were less noteworthy and barely noticeable, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was done very well and I applaud all the voice actors here because they did a terrific job. They were very believable from when they were laughing and having fun to when they were crying, yelling, or frustrated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -- Like I said, this series is so character-driven it would be nowhere near this level if it weren't for them. The contrast between the two Nanas was done excellently - you really get the sense that they play off each other well and that their friendship is so deep that it's hard to describe in words and is something that can only be felt. Meanwhile, the relationships between all the other characters are complex and tangled, and the ways in which they deal with these complexities is incredibly realistic.\\n\\n\r\nJunko summarizes it nicely in the later episodes when she says, &quot;There really is no right answer to these questions&quot; because in real life, there really isn't. You have to do what you can do and make the best out of a bad situation, even if it means that someone is going to get hurt in the end, and it's these things that Yazawa's characters contemplate and face. They hurt others, get hurt themselves, make mistakes, and as a result, they learn and grow. Or in the end, they might realize it's an &quot;eat or be eaten&quot; kind of world and that &quot;justice doesn't always prevail&quot; (as Yasu puts it). And as they face these problems of life, you can really identify with them and cheer them on to simply do their best. After all, that's all anyone can ask, right?\\n\\n\r\nOverall -- NANA is truly a series to watch, especially if you like shoujo. But it's not your typical shoujo. It's something different and goes beyond your simple clich&eacute;s, but in order to truly understand it, this is something you have to watch.",

            "content": "Nana is a show where love is used in every way, shape, and form. Love is used in a manner of romantics, friendship, lust, security, and companionship. Of course with every love story their are breakups, betrayals, and distance between people. Nana does a great job of illustrating this as the story unfolds.\r\nNana Komatsu (who will be referred to as Hachi) and Nana Osaki are both aboard a train where their path cross and cross again later and they eventually decide to live with each other as fate seems to push them together.\r\nThe genre of this anime is slice of life so as the genreentails the story revolves around the everyday life of Hachi and Nana, as well as their lovers and friends that we meet along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a nice element to this show as their is great lighting then the bands perform and the characters look more realistic is terms of other anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nNot much needs to be said about the sound because the opening of the show does a great job to set the tone of the quality of sounds views were going to be hearing in the show which obviously was very well received by viewers. \\n\\n\r\nYou fall in love with the main characters, Hachi and Nana very easily due to their cat and dog relationship which is warm and friendly and makes the viewers feel good when they interact with each other. The supporting characters are also great as the band Blast, feel like a dysfunctional family that are meant for each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and the story of Nana was its strongest element of the series but at some point the story seems to go downhill as love is often repetitively misplaced and the distance of some characters becomes to far to be repaired.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i thoroughly enjoyed this series and if you're into slice of life, kick ass bands, and a lot of romance then this is the show for you. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This show might hurt a little or make you feel nostalgic for memories of your own. For an unlikely scenario, you feel as though it is very, very real. \r\nI expected Nana to be, the first 15 episodes in, a series where you live vicariously through the main character, Nana Komatsu, later known as Hachi. She meets a new cool and beautiful best friend, she's starting a new life in Tokyo in a cute apartment with a handsome boyfriend, friends all around, including getting to know some really attractive members of a famous band. Sounds great, right?\r\nIt's not all blown away by tragedy, it's shakenup by misunderstandings/lies, fear, love, career pursuits, and life in general, as the two girls are very different and live very separate lifestyles, and it becomes more apparent as the show goes on, causing some interesting rifts. Despite this, their friendship and caring for one another is one of the strongest aspects of the show, but it's not shoved down your throat in a 'FRIENDSHIP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING EVER!!!1' type way. Nana portrays realistic emotions that apply to any situation very straight and bittersweet, yet savory at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story: 10/10. There are no loopholes. Everything has a purpose, every action is made understandable, and everything is well done. There are no filler episodes, which is saying a lot for a series with 47 episode slots to fill. It's far from boring, especially during the second half, where things escalate quickly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 How I WISH I could give this a 10 out of 10, as the characters are arguably the best part of the show. Hachi is more than just your ditzy, friendly, feminine young adult, she is also very considerate, yet struggles with her own selfishness, a trait she acknowledges but dislikes. Nana Osaki is not just a cool, punk, lead singer, she is just as, if not more, selfish than Hachi, and worries about depending on other people to the point where it hinders her relationships or makes her seem distant. The other main characters: Reira, Shin, Yasu, Ren, Nobu, Takumi... are very, VERY fleshed out and interesting, the minor characters: Misato, Junko, Kyosuke being just as much. The reason this has a 9/10 is because Naoki, a drummer in the band Trapnest, who appears regularly in the show and openings, has little to no character development. I get that he's not that important in comparison, but I would have liked him to have had a bigger role. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 It's Ai Yazawa. All of her designs are very pretty, appealing, modern, and fashionable, with punk edges Vivienne Westwood herself would be proud of, and lace. This has a nine out of ten, as this is a slice of life series, and there is very little room to be super experimental with the art, but all the lighting, scenery, and little details such as the accessories, are very tastefully done, and all the characters are easy on the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 ANOTHER one of the best aspects of the show. Since Nana revolves not only around the two main girls, but two bands: Blast and Trapnest, the show has songs recorded by fictionalized versions of these two bands, and it is AWESOME. Blast's songs are punky and energetic, with a demure husky female voice. Trapnest's songs are pretty and poetic, with an angelic female lead voice with a slight rock edge. Personally, I prefer Trapnest's sound and voice to Blast's, BUT that's like saying you prefer cookies to cupcakes. Both are absolutely savory and you'll take them if available.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. I watched this show when I was going through relationship troubles on my own. It was simultaneously a big mistake and a much needed detox, as I cried a few times, and at one point got so emotional that I could not finish it until a year later. When I did, I took a while to take everything in, as that ending really got to me. It's not sad, per se, just very true. It's a 9/10 because parts of it made me sad, and while I personally enjoy shows that make me sad and think a lot, I realize some might not. I -did- very much enjoy it though, and it has a heavy rewatch value to relive some of those moments the show has to offer. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I cannot recommend Nana enough, even if you typically do not do slice of life/shoujo. You are not too manly for Nana, unless you eat feelings and rocks for breakfast. I feel as though not enough people have seen it, and it perplexes me as it is delicacy. Nana is an experience.",

Was spending nights without sleep just to watch this anime, couldn't stop with just watching 5 episodes, it had to be 15! \r\nI was really impressed how they have done this anime, it was a bit different than the usual anime I watch, it had some strange \"moves\" but it was perfectly fine. I totally loved it.\r\nThe story is about two girls: Nana - a girl that wants to be loved and find her perfect love butisn't really sure about herself what she REALLY want, and NANA - a girl that wants to become a rock/punk star and is ready to sacrifice everything for it (at least she was thinking like that). The two of them became friends at the start of the anime and everything else showed is how they managed to get along, how they reach their goal and and and much more i don't wanna tell.\\n\r\nThe only thing i was sad about is that the manga is further than the anime, and there are so many things i still want to see, i still don't understand, and i hope it will get a second season, i really wanna watch this. It was really enjoyable :D\\n\r\nOne more thing: I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone under 18 years, cause they wouldn't understand many things in the story (ofc there are exceptions).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMany different types of characters, really realistic (no one is made OP, coolness overflowing or anything like that) just like i love it.\\n\r\nSo many emotions you can see while getting along with all these characters and all these different stories about them. Beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning i didn't really like the animation because while they are playing on a stage there wasn't much moving. It was more like a moving picture and the music playing in the background. Later in the anime that changed drastically and became really great and watchable. But i have to say that i liked how the characters and the surroundings are looking from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I am a fan of hard rock, metal and punk music and i loved the opening themes of this anime, really powerful and catchy.\\n\r\nBut what i really loved was the first ending of the anime: pure emotions",

            "content": "NANA tells the story of two young women who meet on a train with a one way ticket to Tokyo. They are both 20 years old and by pure fate they are both named Nana. Though they are similar in these aspects, they are completely different personality wise. Osaki Nana is a punk singer who also plays a bit of guitar whose dream is to make it famous as a musician. Komatsu Nana is a cheery, immature woman whose greatest dream is to be a a bride and live in a villa. Yet, these two form a great bond and after more fateful events, endup living together. They help eachother with the problems each of them face through their lives, problems of love and about their future.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10 - I found this anime fantastic. NANA held such a strong story since it's beginning. I enjoyed it a lot but I feel that the story didn't flow as easily through the second half. The first arc was fantastic, I have never held such a mixed range of emotions over a few episodes. Though, I feel like a lot was rushed through the second half and it constantly left a feeling as if you were on edge. Yet, I greatly enjoyed it, the emotions which I believe Ai Yazawa was trying to convey were felt by me. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation & music 10/10 - The art was fantastic, though I found the malnutritioned bodies a bit eerie. The characters were all so unique and the details with the piercings were beautiful. The music was my style of music so I'm biased when I say it was the best I've heard. The guitar was beautiful to listen to and Layla's voice was glorious. Kudos to Aya Hirano for having one of the most soothing and talented voices I have heard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 - All the characters were so lovable. I loved both the Nanas, I found them unique. There has been plenty of character depth and growth which I found very interesting to see unravel. The characters were obviously well planned.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give NANA a 9/10. As much as I feel bad about giving this score, I cannot give it any higher because of my opinion of the second half of the anime. Otherwise, it was a very well done anime and I recommend it to everyone and am hopeful for another season.\\n\\n",

            "content": "What is Nana? \r\nWhat is the story about?\r\n(Warning: the following review contains some spoilers, because that&rsquo;s really the only way you can review something like this.)\r\nI had to ask myself what this anime was about several times per episode. I had to try to find some ultimate conclusion, because this was such a good anime, but it never seemed to want to give me an answer.\r\nAnd finally, on the last episode, when the final song played, I realized what this was all about: hopelessness. In every sense of the world, the story of Nana and Nana is a tragedy. There is no happy ending foranyone, not really. There&rsquo;s nothing to feel good about in the slightest. Every single character save for one (Yasu) ends up being a terrible person, full of personality flaws and the impressive ability to make only bad decisions. If you want the basic premise of the story, read the other reviews, because what I want to say is that these characters all end up basically unhappy or on the precipice of unhappiness, hanging by a thread and miring in a mud pit of depression and lost hope. The best example of this is Hachi (Valley girl Nana who was given that nickname for practicality) &ndash; her story is pretty much the most depressing story ever. She&rsquo;s a selfish, pathetic excuse for a woman who cares about nothing in the world except herself. I had to ask myself why the other characters even liked her. She was just annoying and by the end of the anime, you&rsquo;ll find yourself open-mouthed and completely aghast because you just can&rsquo;t believe her story actually ends the way it does. I won&rsquo;t say more, but it&rsquo;s completely pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nBut, you know what? That was the intention. That&rsquo;s who Hachi is and the anime doesn&rsquo;t try to make excuses for her. This wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be a happy story. Unfortunately, through the first 20 episodes, you find so much hope and great things, that it&rsquo;s kind of a let-down afterwards, because it sinks into the hole of depression that it never digs itself out from. But the original intention of this was to tell the shabby story of these two women and what happened to them. In a sense, it was supposed to display realism at its ugliest &ndash; a godless, soulless world and the creators of this anime accomplished what they set out to do. Friendships are chance, marriage is always a mistake and love is an illusion &ndash; people are only out to serve themselves, but every now and then, you need someone to support the burden you carry in life, and that is what people call relationships. They serve no other purpose.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I&rsquo;m not a believer in this ideology personally, but still, what they set out to do, they finished with style. Nana has a unique fashion and voice all its own and it leads to several powerful episodes that would have been hard to pull off otherwise. The voice acting and music is second to none, full of emotion and while the crying scenes aren&rsquo;t exactly few and far between, they&rsquo;re well done and you usually can connect with them on some level.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what did I get from Nana in the end? Well, I had to analyze my own interpretation of love and romance and test it to see if it&rsquo;s what I believed. When an anime can make you really think and care at the same time, it&rsquo;s truly something special. Nana is definitely special and I would recommend it to anyone. I didn&rsquo;t enjoy the ending and the first 23 episodes are better than the last 24 by far, but what can you do? Also, I have to warn anyone who watches this that the two main characters don&rsquo;t actually talk to each other for the last fourth of the series, which was a huge letdown. I mean, how can you do that? Plus Hachi&rsquo;s story completely loses steam while Punk Rock Nana&rsquo;s story takes center stage. For the first 3 fourths of the story, their stories intertwine, but it just falls flat in the end to where Hachi become completely irrelevant, which is too bad. The ending was a failure on most levels as a result, I&rsquo;m sorry to report. It left a seriously bad cliffhanger with obvious intentions of a second season that was hardly a representation of the whole of the series. It was like 46 plus 1. As close to epic fail as you can get.\\n\\n\r\nI still thoroughly enjoyed this anime though, if only to satisfy my dark side and need to plunge into darkness now and again. (On a personal note, I hate Takumi and I constantly hoped he would die. *Sigh* unfortunately, he does not.) But I will definitely need a fresh dose of something uplifting like Nodame Cantabile to bring me back from the depths. In the end, I just thought it was too bad that this anime just refused to allow for some hope. \\n\\n\r\nI prefer a world where hope exists.\\n",

            "content": "I had conflicting thoughts writing this review... \r\nThe biggest reason why was because I ironically had an ex called Nana-Chan (Natsumi was her long name) and lets just say that our relationship did not really end up on the right tones. \r\nI could sum up this anime by saying if you are a guy, and you are a duchebag, this lays it out to a tee.\r\nThis is like a crash course in duchebag101.\r\n I cannot explain how much I have seen guys and girls do what they do in this anime. But I will admit between NANA and White Album (my previous review) White Albumwas more realistic to me in that reguards to real life situations.\\n\\n\r\nI do not know if they was what they were going for in this anime, but I think I got more pissed off at situations than actually enjoying them. Towards the middle/end of this anime, I had to watch it in a very short duration, because it reminded me of past relationships so hard that I had to take a day away from watching this anime and reflect on my past actions and pull myself back together again to try to finish it to do the review. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the anime I just wanted it to be over like a bad dream. \\n\\n\r\nEmotionally, it was a tough anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe story started out quite laggy in the beginning and I must say, it can be incredibly predictable because I would simply put myself in the shoes of the person and figure out what they would do, and then I would ask myself \"Would I do that?\" So to that end, I found it quite... again, predictable but still emotional. \\n\\n\r\nThe art reminded me of XXXHolic so damn hard that I thought I was watching a spinoff. The sound was \"alright\" but it was not top notch as I was expecting either. (I liked how they plugged Jackson Hole in many...many..episodes, makes me want to go there next time I am in Tokyo.)\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters (going to keep it short). It was REALLY REALLY hard to imagine Osaki, Nana played by Paku, Romi to play the part because I remember her playing Edward, Elric in Full Metal Alchemist. It was DAMN hard. But after about 20 episodes I finally got used to it and she did this role incredible. The other Nana; Komatsu, Nana was well done as well and thankfully I had not much problem adapting her to this role. The supporting characters in this anime literally CARRIED this anime all the way though. \\n\\n\r\nIn Enjoyment, I will say it was enjoyable, but incredibly depressing at times not to mention you would have \"WTF\" moments accompanied by a good ol' *facepalm*.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say it was good, it definitely was emotional as I said, because many of the personal situations in MY life were reflected in this anime. The feelings of loneliness, pain, anger, betrayal, lust, and sadness were rampant in NANA and I felt it along with them every step of the way.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Behold, the king (or queen?) of all shoujo anime, Nana.\r\nThe shoujo genre is one that can evoke a certain degree of condescension for some people. The sudden sparkly backgrounds, contrived romantic situations, bishies on top of bishies, and unnecessary melodrama. In short, it can showcase a somewhat \"idealized\" version of youthful romance. \r\nBut even if you're guilty of having these thoughts, I implore you not to ignore this specific show because of the \"shoujo\" tag. Because unlike other shows in the genre, Nana takes on a more grounded, realistic approach. Things are not perfect. The characters have flaws. They makes mistakes and poor decisions, theirrelationships are neither simple nor ideal, and things don't always work out how you think they should.\\n\\n\r\nThe setup is simple. Two strangers, both named Nana, end up as roommates in Tokyo. They're almost complete opposites and make their trip to the big city for different reasons as well. \"Rocker Nana\" as I call her, to make it big in the music industry, and the other Nana, \"Hachi\", to reunite with her boyfriend. Needless to say, and without spoiling anything, it's a bumpy road on both fronts, as both Nana's lives slowly become intertwined.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, the relationship between the Nana is something I found particularly interesting. It's not the usual \"two opposites butt heads until enough bonding moments occur to bring them together and form a strong friendship\" trope. It's a bit more complicated than that. Their relationship is far from perfect. There's jealousy, possessiveness, and unspoken feelings. In ways, it almost feels like a romantic relationship without the actual romance. It was a dynamic that surprised me.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the other relationships go, as expected there is a fair amount of drama and romance. Sure, at times it can get just a little \"soap opera-y\", but never to the point past suspension of disbelief. And that's the one thing that strikes me about Nana. Even with all the drama, the characters and story are presented in a real, sometimes raw, manner that is so difficult to accomplish in anime and deserves its due praise.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from an anime with a such a focus on music, the soundtrack is exceptional. Every once in awhile the first opening \"Rose\" pops into my head.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is above average, but also relatively standard shoujo fare. Most people are pretty tall, really skinny, and the male love interests are often as pretty as some of the female characters.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the biggest gripe would be the fact we still haven't gotten an ending, as the original manga is on indefinite hiatus as the author's health took a decline. Let's hope for healthy days ahead for Ai Yazawa, regardless of whether Nana is continued. She gave us a really compelling story and set of characters and I hope she's doing ok.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Whether you enjoy shoujo or not, watch this anime. Whether you're a part of the genre's \"target audience\" or not, watch this anime. It's a master-class of unflinchingly realistic character drama. It's a solid 9, very nearly 10, for me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nana is the best anime for anyone who wants realism when it comes to romance.\r\nNana is definitely one of my favorite Anime's, it would even be in my top ten. Ill now give three reasons as to why I love this anime.\r\nFirstly, The romance is real its something that anyone who has been through so many ups and downs in different relationships could relate to. And this is coming from my own personal experience, i could really understand what Nana was going through in the anime and this made me feel so much emotion. If you're a crybaby please expect some fireworks.\r\nSecondly, It doesn't onlyfocus on romance but also friendship. Friendship plays such a big part in Nana. Arguments, Jealousy, and love is something we get to see throughout and as i said before its a killer for the amount of emotions it will make you feel and i felt so many\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, The music is amazing. They use the voices of Olivia Lufkin and Anna Tsuchiya who are definitely two of my favorite Japanese singers. The song writing and the use of instruments is phenomenal. Even if i didn't like the anime i would listen to music forever, even till this day i listen to OST's.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime, Its funny, cute, dramatic, and romantic.",

            "content": "This is my first attempt to write a serious review. I try to apply some criticism to the animes I watch but I also highly value what I felt while watching a certain anime. That being said, I apologize in advance if my criticism isn\u2019t sharp enough throughout this review. Also, be aware English isn\u2019t my native language.\r\nStory \u2013 10/10\r\nNana\u2019s story is born through the random encounter of two completely different characters, both of them named Nana. Even though they differ in so many aspects and have such opposite visions, they manage to get to know each other and their stories become intertwined. That encounterleads to the reunion of people with different lifestyles and to an amazing drama.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 8/10\\n\r\nSo, I know some people who just won\u2019t watch Nana because of its art style. And I have to be honest here: it was one aspect that put me a bit off when I was looking for some new anime to watch. The characters do seem a bit too skinny and tall sometimes but it doesn\u2019t really matter because once you start watching the anime, you\u2019ll realize that there is really no better art style to portray the characters of this anime. There are actually several parts where if you just take some time, pause the anime and observe the characters in front of you, they look beautiful and, in a certain way, realistic. Also, in my opinion, the art style gives them a certain depth and it also really fits the tone and story of this anime. Summing it all up; I came to love the art style and I believe most of the people who watched this anime, did too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 10/10\\n\r\nIn my honest opinion, this is where Nana truly shines. The characters are just so well developed that even if you don\u2019t like their attitudes, you\u2019ll end up having no choice other than to just empathize with them or at least relate to them at a certain level. There are so many animes that only focus on the main characters and basically ignore the other characters, but Nana certainly isn\u2019t one of them. This is one of those animes where all characters have their importance and are given time to shine and make you care about them. They are well portrayed and realistic: your favorite character won\u2019t be perfect. They will have flaws. Flaws that only make them look more human and emotionally relatable. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack \u2013 10/10\\n\r\nWell, what can I say other than it is amazing? I\u2019m not trying to sell anything here; it just truly is amazing. All the chosen voice actors do their job right and both singers chosen for Nana Osaki and Reira are amazing, making every performance in the anime truly enjoyable. Comparing to other music animes I\u2019ve seen, such as Beck or Nodame Cantabile, I don\u2019t think there is such a big of a focus on the music-making part. The music is obviously there, but not as much as it is in the animes I\u2019ve just mentioned. The right tune just plays at the right moment and it just hits you. It hits you and you realize you\u2019ve stumbled upon a masterpiece. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 10/10\\n\r\nI\u2019ve watched Nana two times so far and I can say that both times I felt the exact same way: fascinated. The characters and music just pull you in. The drama is somewhat intense but not in a way that will bother you; on the contrary. I recommend this to all those interested in going on a so-called \u201cfeels trip\u201d and who are fans of the drama genre and want a story where characters actually matter. Whether you\u2019re a huge music fan or not, won\u2019t really affect your enjoyment of this anime; as I said, the OST is amazing and it will just do its job at the right moment. Enjoy the journey.\\n",

            "content": "Every time I went to a manga store the shelves were full of Nana and I wondered...hmm I should really watch this. \r\nBefore I started watching it, I already knew it was going to be good - MAL review score above 8, Madhouse, etc. I just didn't imagine it to be this good.\r\nI was first a bit afraid that it will be a fully music-centred anime but it is not. There is a little bit of music in it but don't worry, it's completely fine. \r\nStory 10/10\r\nNana is a story about friendship. Friendship between girls, mostly, so it might not be the best thing towatch for guys. If you think Frozen is a great story about friendship between girls, you will be surprised when you watch Nana. I swear Frozen is like a pile of dogsh*t compared to Nana. (sorry)\\n\r\nI like that the story shows quite a long period of time, so there's space for character development and the events don't seem repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing which I loved: It's not set in a highschool. I think I'm too old to enjoy those animes or I've just got an overdose of them. No ecchi elements either - YESS!\\n\r\nThe story has a proper ending, more or less but they could have made 1 more episode between 46 and 47. Maybe I'm just thinking this because I didn't want it to end...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I loved Nana so much is because of the characters. They seem very realistic to me and the actions they take are also very real.\\n\r\nK. Nana is not the typical shoujo \"kawaii desune\" girl and O. Nana is not the typical tsundere. The guys in the story also seem very real to me. I will not spoil it for anyone but I'm sure everyone can relate to at least 2-3 of them. There are no big scenes or overly dramatic moments in it. It just looks real.\\n\\n\r\nDesign: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot sure if I can judge this really, it's a 10-year-old Madhouse anime...of course the animation is good. Even though it's 10 years old, it's still fully enjoyable. Well done!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA classic anime from the pre-ecchi times by Madhouse is like a breath of fresh air nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, the characters and their actions are painfully realistic. I absolutely loved that! You will see all the typical mistakes people make in relationships and it will make you feel even closer to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending felt a tiny bit rushed but on the other hand it was time to finish it already. \\n\\n\r\nI've literally just completed the series and I must say,  I'm clueless about my life and my whole existence...but I like that feeling. Nana has really given me a lot. \\n\\n\r\n- Ne, Nana?",

The story was beautiful and the turmoil and joy the characters experienced honestly had me in tears at times. \r\nI loves the music in every aspect, both bands featured in the show had unique and interesting sounds. The art for Nana blew me away. The detail in every work is incredible and is a testament to the skill of the artist.\r\nThe characters where so dynamic, developed and well introduced it made me feel like they really could be actual people just fashioned into a anime.\r\nOverall i have to give Nanaa 10 because it blew me away on so many levels.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anybody over the age of 13, only because the story is very realistic in a sense that nothing seems to be watered down from they way it would actually play out in real life (example: People dating DO sleep together)\\n\\n\r\nPure enjoyment :)",

            "content": "\"Nana\" will seem unusual to many anime viewers. It's a shoujo and although it may have been written with women viewers in mind, I'm a guy and found it enjoyable enough as a drama. Not many anime tropes are present here, and that's a great thing, it's almost like a western-style drama trying to realistically depict the dramatic lives of a cast of cool characters. \r\nThe characters are also not your typical anime fare, especially punk Nana and her boyfriend Ren. I've never seen characters like that in an anime, they might not be edgy by western standards but it's cool to see characters ina realistic drama who are way out of the norm for Japanese people. The other Nana might initially seem to be a shoujo cliche - a straight-laced average girl who the female viewer can identify with - but she is quirky and imperfect, and goes through some real drama that doesn't pay lip service to the way that the unrealistic standards for how a woman is \"supposed\" to be (but few actually are).\\n\\n\r\nThere is a pretty expansive cast of characters including two full bands - one established, one looking for their big break. All of the characters have personalities and are multi-dimensional, which definitely adds to the story as you actually care about these crazy kids.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was a mixed bag for me, some of the background music was excellent and the band's songs were decent, but they were so repetitive. I guess that's just to be expected though, it's hard to have that much great original music.\\n\\n\r\nI found the ending to be unsatisfying. It wasn't awful, but I didn't really feel like it was a fulfilling finish to all of that buildup. This was probably due to the manga author having had to stop putting out new content due to an unfortunate illness.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone who likes anime dramas but is tired of the whole harem/high school drama thing. Even though some of them are quite good, they are doing the same basic thing. Don't let the shoujo label scare you off, this is really just a good drama.",

Although I did find one of the protagonists unbelievably annoying, the story made up for it. All of the other characters were great, and there was a decent element of character development. Especially in the beginning, there were a lot of sex scenes (not graphic), it annoyed me a little, but that is my personal preference, I am not into that kind of thing. Just don't say I didn't warn you. It is always slightly unsatisfying, and in most times intense to keep you going.As much as some characters or events annoyed me, I couldn't put it down. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I would have to complain about is probably the worst ending in the history of anime. Everything is left unresolved, and it left me feeling confused, like I had no idea how things were left. It did not end on a concluding note, and it seemed random and rushed. I think will the symbolism of the number 7 throughout the series had something to do with it. Since they ended on 47, they needed to rush the ending, so none of it made any sense at all. (Although if they went til 49, 7 is th sq root). It is a great series, so watch it if you are ok with a HUGE let down at the end.",

Which makes me find it Brilliant.\r\nThe story its about 2 grown-ass woman that the meet in a train, that goes to Tokyo to make they believe  a good life. They a-part and then they HAPPENED to meet in the same mansion which thy looking to\\n\r\nThey are the opposite of of the other yet so similar.They share the same name \"Nana\", they're both are 20 years old. The antithesis between the 2 main-characters is one of the bases of the story, quite rare in anime yet it can have good results \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode starts and ends with a monolog towards \"Nana\" \\n\\n\r\n-Yeah but which one of them mr ZpowderQ7?? \\n\\n\r\nExactly !! This is the brilliants of this anime. They have the same name. . . THEY HAVE THE FUKING SAME NAME!!!! HOW MANY TIME YOU SEE THAT IN A F*king anime that ?? Huh????!!!!\\n\\n\r\nLook, talking towards \"Nana\" could mean: talking to her selfs or her Friend \"Nana\". Also the monolog gives you the feel that you listening to the persons story  and with few words give the feel ''Holly Sh*t!! I wonder what happened\". \\n\r\nThat monolog builds expectation, builds the character builds everything towards the story and the viewer.  Thats good STRUCTURE \\n\\n\r\nYou don't need to be a fan of Shojo to enjoy this anime, the presentation of the story make everything invalid. \\n\\n\r\nThere is clich\u00e9 on the proses of the story but its invalid cause it lets you know that \"its gonna happened. . . Its gonna happened. . . OH f*k it happened \" .  \\n\r\nA clich\u00e9 can be easily spot on a story but if you have a F*KING GENUIS WRITHER like Nana's wright you can use it on your favour  to draw the viewer/reader  attention and not say \"I don't know whats gonna happen\" but say \"How its gonna happen\". \\n\r\nNow thats brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nDon't take my word for it, go check by your self.         \\n\\n",

            "content": "I am a 17 year old, metal-loving, video-game-nerd dude. I am seemingly way off to the wrong side of 'Nana''s demographic spectrum. It seemed necessary to state all of this before throwing my opinion at you all as your mileage may vary drastically depending on your age, gender, and so forth. While I do aim to be as objective as possible, take what I say with a pinch of salt and follow my recommendation in the final paragraph if you are curious about this anime. \r\nSo why on Earth did I pick up 'Nana'? The idea of a almost-50 episode romance did seem rather intriguing,and intriguing it was. However, what some may perceptive to be it's greatest strength, seems to be it's greatest weakness.\\n\\n\r\nStory~\\n\r\n'Nana' follows two young women in their pursuits of laughter, fun, love, and rock 'n' roll. The story is nothing particularly special, but it is enjoyable nonetheless. There are plenty of twists and turns, and the majority of the story arcs link together well and provide plenty of meat to the over-arching plot. One thing that bogs this down slightly is re-caps. 'Nana' will take no prisoners and can and will repeat segments from previous episodes almost in their entirety, but will throw something important in the mix that leaves you with no choice but to trek through previously discovered waters. It is frustrating at times and flashbacks are generally frame-by-frame pastes so you won't be discovering anything new. But on the whole, the story is enjoyable, filled to the brim with heart-warming (and potentially heart-wrenching) scenarios that should please most anime fans.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters~\\n\r\nIf there was a more divisive aspect to this show than the characters, i'd ask the court say 'I'. The characters themselves are interesting enough as individuals, even if a little unoriginal. You have your leading-role klutz, Nana. You have your lead-role unimpressed hero, Nana (yes, they share the same name. See what they did with the title? Ayyyyy). Secondary characters are fairly straightforward and don't have much going for them in terms of differentiating. Most are fairly jaded, with a couple showing a more idiotic side at times. The problem with the characters is character relationships. The relationships in 'Nana' are a level of realism that doesn't suit the medium of anime as well as one might hope. When you strip it down, 'Nana' is a B-grade romance movie presented in episodic anime format. While some may cry that the relationships are deep and allow for strong character building (which they most definitely do), the contrast with anime tropes and dramatic elongations of simple or even trivial scenarios causes an awkward fatigue. The series seems to drag on more than it should when you realise just how little has happened over the course of the first 20 episodes. The pacing of the show is brought down significantly by character relationships as the anime forces you to watch every reaction, every individual flashback. There is no room for intrigue. You know what is going to happen from a mile away, even if it isn't always the best (or most efficient) way to progress the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound~\\n\r\nThe art deserves some praise as the character animations are brilliant. They took some getting used to (different facial proportions to typical anime, extremely skinny and tall characters), but watching individuals during conversations is one of the highlights of the show. Whenever two or more people are on the screen, you are in for a treat as conversations are as energetic in a visual sense as they are in audio. Characters are detailed and environments look good when they need to. Some backgrounds are a little too simple when compared to scenes involving concerts or restaurants, but you will likely be too glued on the wonderful voice acting and facial animations to notice. Speaking of which (segway pun intended), the voice acting is a marvel for the most part. Nana and Nana are brilliantly portrayed, and the majority of secondary characters are fun to behold; even if the general attitude of the secondary characters 70% of the time is some form of diluted cynicism. The music is enjoyable, and some of the punk tracks are quite a fun time if you don't mind the absurd lyrics Japan love to spew out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall~\\n\r\nThis show is not and never was intended for a person such as myself, yet I still found plenty to enjoy about it. Constant backtracking, realistic relationship approaches, and borderline-monotonous cynicism did bring down the overall 'enjoyment' of the show, but the emotional forces and main leading ladies did provide a fun time. The story is a tad too predictable for the most part and could easily be ripped off of a multitude of live-action films. But that doesn't stop this anime from being worth a look. The first 3 episodes should be more than enough for you to make your own judgement as to whether or not it is your cup of tea, but I would recommend you watch at least that much (do it!). This show aims for the feels, but leaves enough breathing space for enticing dialogue and some good laughs.\\n\\n\r\n6.8/10",

You can look at the animated characters and realize that they could very well be someone in real in life, someone you have met, or even you. \r\nWe like to dream and imagine how our ideal life would be only to realize that things change,we make mistakes, and life doesn't always take us to where we initially wanted.

If only I had known, the power of NANA.\r\nNANA is a wonderful story; it's so realistic you can easily imagine yourself in the characters' shoes, you can identify with one or several of the characters, because the things happening in this anime, are realistic - these things happen to everyone during their lifetime.\r\n  Sometimes you'll find yourselfso frustrated you literally want to throw your TV/computer out the window. Sometimes you're so happy for the characters that you laugh to yourself. Sometimes, you feel their sadness, and you feel your own heart aching. Such is the power of NANA.\\n\\n\r\nI can't complain about the animation; it sure was good. It wasn't perfect, nor is it the best I've seen, but it was very fitting for the plot and the characters. The soundtrack was amazing with such catchy songs, well-thought out plotline that never got boring. They have such amazing talent, being able to create such a magical masterpiece as NANA. This is an anime I will be sure never to forget.\\n\\n\r\nI think I'll try reading the manga now. It's not even finished, but I still want to read it, and experience it all again. Like previously mentioned - such is the power of NANA.",

            "content": "I went into Nana expecting a typical shoujo and was instead blown away by the mature and realistic portrayal of adult life, most of all love and relationships.  It is a heart-wrenching and emotional show. It left a permanent mark on my heart and I believe it\u2019s in a league of its own in terms of shoujo. \r\nThe show depicts what people will do out of loneliness and an attempt to feel less empty. The characters are complex and flawed. They act painfully human- they say the wrong thing or act the wrong way, and they have to manage the consequences of their choices.They have self-destructive and unhealthy tendencies, which makes it difficult for them to be happy. \\n\\n\r\nThe nature of desire is unfulfilling. Achieving your dreams won\u2019t necessarily make you happy. Relationships and feelings are tenuous and easily crumble. Loving someone so much that you\u2019d die with them isn\u2019t incredibly romantic, rather it\u2019s scary and unhealthy. \\n\\n\r\nThey live in a harsh reality, not a sparkly fairy tale. Nana Komatsu is your standard shoujo protagonist. She\u2019s bubbly, optimistic, kind-hearted, cries easily, and na\u00efve. This show depicts how a character like this would fare in the real world, where she would be easily taken advantage of and tricked by men. The other protagonist, Nana Osaki, starts out as a tough and confident heroine but her unstable and fragile nature is gradually revealed. \\n",

I'm not a fan of the body shapes as this is the reason I stopped watching Speical A. But the story and characters made up for it. I'm not going to explain what the anime is about, it's in the summary.\r\nBut I will say this anime will take you through some emotions. There are characters you will like, love and hate. Nana O, the punk rock singer has this tough girl act vibe but is the typical softie when itcomes to her friends. She is kind of like Junko with the blunt talk that Nana K sometimes needs, but she also sometimes sugars coats or doesn't say certain things to Nana K in fear of hurting her feelings.\\n\\n\r\nNana K is a hopeless romantic who wants to find love and pretty much just be taken care of. She does come off as being spoiled or selfish and a bit klutzy but it is part of her cute charm. She is also always there for her friends and strangers.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do sometimes stop watching after episode twenty-nine, the episodes after that are still god but by then you don't get group scenes anymore or as much as the Blast members and Nana K since she has then moved on due to a situation she got herself in.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is great with the character development and the character background stories. Almost everyone besides Nana K comes from a broken home which I think is a bit unoriginal and kind of depressing, but it adds to the character and explains why how it made them what they are today.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah I enjoy it. The ending will make you mad though when you think about it. I won't post for the sake of spoilers, though.",

            "content": "\u201cThe dreams we are chasing and the reality that is chasing us are always parallel.  They never meet.\u201d\r\nI still remember clearly the first time my perception of anime crossed over from childish, adrenaline-driven fascination to a full-blown obsession that even then I knew already would form an integral part of my life for a long time to come.  It was when I first watched Elfen Lied: more specifically, seeing alternating episodes of dumbfounded boob groping, incestual and sadomasochistic innuendo, and mass slaughter juxtaposed over an overall atmosphere of emotional fragility that, despite its often downright kitsch clumsiness in retrospect, truly made an impactupon my often turbulent emotional state at the time.  It was the first time that I truly realized that anime could be used as a medium for more than just the adrenaline-driven beatdown fests or fantastical escapes into dreamland that appealed to me so much as a child.  Especially given its idealistic, symbolic molds of humanity that seemed to dramatically bring out the emotional core of one\u2019s being to the artistic surface, I suddenly realized that anime could be a highly compelling, and for me at the time perhaps the only compelling, form with which to portray the powerful sentiments that touched and connected different individuals.  \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, this triggered a long period of exploration, and I combed through countless slice-of-life, romantic drama, and tongue-in-cheek harem shows looking to capture that same powerful essence that had initially left me in wonder, discovering many classic series that I still treasure dearly to this day.  However, as the backlog of completed shows piled behind me and the same predictable character archetypes and \u2013dere derivations appeared time and time again as lethargic substitutes for true character depth, I naturally grew more jaded.  It\u2019s not to say that a series suddenly had to be completely original to evoke enjoyability, or that I couldn\u2019t from a subcultural perspective appreciate the \u201clanguage\u201d that anime used to call to its more hardened devotees, yet that obsessive, soul-consuming sense of awe that in the past had gripped me when encountering a truly mind-blowing tale only grew scarcer and scarcer in frequency. Going through a new show had simply become far too routine and workmanlike of an affair when I felt that everything I could have seen in it I had already seen in the past, and better. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t just give up. Life is about getting knocked down over and over, but still getting up each time. If you keep getting up, you win.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nHow was it then that Nana conflagrated my blood as easily as a river after an oil spill, causing me to blow through 47 episodes at speeds exceeding that of some of the most hook-laden Shonen series?  For starters, Nana pulls no punches when it comes to fleshing out a cast of believable, imperfect, and painfully human characters that stumble over the mess of their own weaknesses time and time again, and every time they fell, you were there bleeding alongside with them.  Indeed, the mistakes that each of the characters make, many of them blindingly obvious yet all too human, serve to endear the viewer to the characters\u2019 stories.  For me at least, the ability to attach the viewer to the characters to the extent where the lines between perceptions of fiction and reality became blurred saturated every second of the show with raw emotion.  This was only able to be accomplished because, regardless of the hyperbolized drama, the characters in Nana and their lives were all too real and all too relatable to the mundane.  I could see more than one starry-eyed, na\u00efve, and painfully clueless girl I had known in my life in the character of Nana K, and have seen my fair share of fragile, dependent souls hiding behind their cold walls of emotional stoicism (Nana O), pure-hearted nice guys lacking the maturity and perceptiveness to carry out their ideals (Nobu), and self-proclaimed assholes that avoided genuine, heartfelt emotional attachment as a way of coping with their sad, insecure life experiences (Takumi and Shin).  Watching Nana thus felt akin to gaining a near-omniscient insight into the lives of real, multifaceted individuals unbound by literary clich\u00e9s, especially the parts of themselves most people prefer not to reveal to any but those closest to them. The show in essence achieved a level of insight into human nature that caused the everyday to subsume itself into the transcendental through an excess of detail, much like in classic Russian literature.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, perhaps partly by virtue of its Josei subgenre (a subcategory of anime I admit I have little experience with), Nana subverted and undermined many of the troupes I was so used to seeing in romance anime, feeling like a breath of fresh air in a dusty, stale room.  For example, the seemingly strong, independent, career-driven rocker that was Nana O, who would in a different context act as a liberated foil to a weak, maudlin female character, was gradually revealed to be, as far as I could see, the most emotionally delicate, dependent figure in the entire show.  What was so beautiful about the manner in which this was executed was how from episode to episode, the masks that Nana put around herself, many of which she herself only later realized she had, were gradually peeled away from her like the layers of an onion.  Nana O\u2019s own growing self-awareness of her true nature is paralleled by the viewer\u2019s changing perception of Nana O, with every human interaction casting a clearer definition upon her multidimensional character away from the initially formed \u201cindependent, rebellious female\u201d archetype that one probably lumped her into at the beginning of the show.  This \u201cmovement\u201d from character stereotype to someone more resembling a real-life individual given greater dramatic license occurred with almost every major character within the show.  In that sense, character development within Nana not only occurred through standard plot driven changes to the characters\u2019 knowledge and base nature, but also a more meta- self-realizing unraveling of the characters\u2019 base substance, something that was always there but not always apparent to see, for either the characters themselves or the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nThe striking level of realistic detail given to every major character also made it hard to unequivocally love or hate any one of them, as all their actions had associated with them reasoning that one would be hard-pressed not to emphasize with to some degree.  The hackneyed adage of \u201cwalking in another\u2019s shoes\u201d is taken to a new level within Nana, with acts of sexual manipulation, infidelity, and hollow affection contextualized within the plot to almost, just almost, seem rational and perhaps even inevitable.  Of course, this hardly served to undermine the inherently heinous nature of such actions, but rather emphasized the ubiquity of the sentiments undergirding them within the depths of human nature, for both the seemingly well-adjusted and blatantly malformed alike.  Regardless of how one chose to judge a said character in the end, one at least saw clearly the difficult, winding road they took to reach the point in life they did.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHey, Nana...people's feelings change easily...what you see is a house of cards...nothing's sure, and nothing lasts forever.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI could go on dwelling upon the characterization for novels on end, but equal emphasis has to be put upon the message their stories serve to convey.  From one perspective, Nana can be viewed as two parallel journeys undertaken by two incredibly different girls to outrun their pasts and achieve their dreams.  All in the meanwhile, they yell across at each other from their parallel roads, eventually becoming the best of friends and both deep down seeking to jump onto the other\u2019s path instead of simply moving in tandem.  However, they continue to dream of what lies at the end of the roads they are currently on, and thus ignore the forks on the road they can branch off into, continuing to stare only ahead into the darkness and never truly coming into contact with one another.  If this reeks of subtle hints of yuri to you, I\u2019m not going to deny that Nana is not totally devoid of such innuendo, at the very least one-sidedly.  However, the subtle \u201clonging\u201d that always hangs uncomfortably in the atmosphere over interactions between the two Nanas acts more as a reflection of the girls\u2019 perpetual dissatisfaction, a result of chasing often reactive, nebulous dreams that cause both to ignore, neglect, and indeed shatter (literally and metaphorically in the story) the relationships that they use to maintain their fragile worlds, relationships that are taken for granted up until the moments of their imperilment. Thus despite having seemingly different motivational drivers (Nana K. chases true love, while Nana O. chases something that would provide a perpetual bulwark against her fears of abandonment), the two girls only seem to find true peace and acceptance as they actually are within each other, a relationship ironically forged by an accidental encounter on a train.  The gradual development of these feelings that the two Nanas create as a haven for one another is beautiful to watch, though tragic that conscious acceptance of these sentiments comes only after their relationship almost gets destroyed. \\n\\n\r\nThe conflict between idealized conceptions of love and the reality that love must come to bear with is perhaps the major plot driver in Nana.  Nana K. struggles through failed relationship after failed relationship with a menagerie of men from ranging from adulterating husbands to overly well-intentioned idiots, all while under the impression that she will find a one true love that could break all of the doubts and insecurities she has built around her.  Yet with time, she begins to come to the horrifying revelation that she had simply \u201cfallen in love\u201d with whatever guy happened to be around her in need at multiple respective time periods, and realizes just how replaceable men were in her fickle heart.  The reduction of the most seemingly sublime romantic emotions down to base needs for dependence begged the question of the foundation behind attachment, something that in the story was only grimly realized within Nana K.\u2019s growing life wisdom coinciding with the desanctification of her heart.  This would ultimately result in her surrender to a (on the surface) bona-fide villain of a man that ironically proved to the man she needed to provide a shoulder she could safely prop her delicate ego upon.  \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the dark realism of Nana is nowhere more evident than in the failure of dedicated effort, genuine kindness, and pure love time and time again to reach positive conclusions, a striking contrast to standard consoling romantic narratives in anime where, in their own way, the nicest, most genuine man (usually manifested in the form of a bumbling, usually unpopular male MC that one could vicariously live through in their plot armor-clad march to victory) always won out in their own way.  The men in the series that displayed such characteristics all ended up inevitably lacking in other areas that unfortunately their love and devotion could not compensate for, whether it be decisiveness, maturity, or resilience in the face of adversity.  This resulted in unconsummated relationships that could not hold up against the constraints of circumstance, belying that the arena love had to contend in was a cold reality where it took far more than simply the authenticity of one\u2019s feelings to achieve a happy ending.  On all ends, the characters of Nana were exposes of the often base, self-serving drivers behind relationships and the tenuous ground on which they rested.  Even the apparently \u201cdestined\u201d relationship between Nana O. and Ren is left cold, abandoned and unfulfilled, much like Nana O. herself in her childhood, in the face of career ambitions and personal insecurities, insecurities that would eventually lead to the raw love between the two transforming into a complete liability.  The cynicism of the series serves not as a final indictment of the institution of love itself as a failed ideal, however, as much as a recognition that it is an emotion as complex, varied, and imperfect as the imperfect mortals that will forever continue to suffer for it by their very nature as solitary, sentient beings seeking wholeness in that which lies outside of the constraints of the isolated self. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that life was about standing your ground, no matter how strong the current was. But going with the flow isn\u2019t so bad after all, as long as it takes you forward.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps for me, Nana was the right show at the right place at the right time in my life, a show that broke through the layers of jaded apathy I had built up over the years with its absolute refusal to compromise the integrity of its interactions to what for me had become hackneyed convention.  The role of music within the plot itself, in the form of the professional rivalry and personal attachments between the bands Blast! and Trapnest, only serves to aesthetically enhance the impact of the music itself (not too shabby I must say) on the viewer.  The artwork, embodied by long, glittering eyelashes, lanky, almost emaciated frames, and vibrant yet chillingly faded coloration, would certainly be an acquired taste for many, but serves perfectly through its attention to detail in visually representing every single emotion that passes through the hearts of the characters. The beauty of the execution brings the nuanced realism that underpins Nana\u2019s appeal into a realm of hyperbolized exaggeration, where the repeated destruction of the clich\u00e9 itself at the hands of the characters turns them into a new pantheon of ideological representation. I suppose the supreme irony is that the full essence of reality, in its all of its uncomfortable glory, could be so appropriately represented by fictionally, drawn characters in such a visually appealing waltz.  Not a single second did pass however, that I was not fully ensorcelled. Now if only they would adapt the rest of the manga, if it ever finishes.\\n",

            "content": "Nana... It was a long journey. \r\nFirst, I'd like to say that I'm a fan of stories with drama in relationships and drama in common. Also, I like stories with plot, so why did I only now start it...? \r\nNana is the story about life and the main idea of this story is love. Love between people. How they meet each other, how they love each other and how they break up with each other. Some do it because they find a better person, some \u2013 because feelings have already not the same as it was in the beginning, and some people have to doit because they love.\\n\\n\r\nBut, in the first place, this story about love between girls, between girl friends. How they meet each other one snowy day, by chance. \\n\\n\r\nThey had never met before, they have different appearance and character \u2013 one of them is intrusive girl just like puppy that always ready to chat with her the whole life long, and the other one is like alone quite rose in garden, listening to everything puppy said. Different at all, and having nothing common, but name, they fall in love at first sight.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why I like \u2018Nana\u2019? Well, like I said before, I like drama and plot stories. For me, this story also was full of emotions and experience.  In first time when I only started Nana, I didn\u2019t believe in it, because I didn\u2019t fancy how everything will be like people were saying about it, but, with time, tension gets higher, and I didn't care about anything, I just cried over Nana\u2019s story, and then over the further plot actions. Then, I\u2019m imbued of both Nanas\u2019 stories and grieve over them. I wanted a happy end for both of girls.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also worth mentioning a touching openings and endings. They started with aggressive, but romantic \u2018rose\u2019 and stopped with expressive \u2018a little pain\u2019; they continued with great \u2018Wish\u2019, and ended with painful and very beautiful \u2018Kuroi Namida\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I don't like about 'Nana' is how characters easy lost control of their emotions in the begining. It was just stupid and... unreal, huh. \\n\\n\r\nAnd art. I don't care about graphics, but it's quiet unwonted when you just started watch it.",

            "content": "This is not your typical shoujo/slice of life. This is actually a realistic representation of people and their flaws. I find it to be deep and it really makes you examine the way life is and the way people are. \r\nStory: 9/10 \r\nI looooove this anime. A lot. The reason it's not a 10, is because it's very drama based, and moves forward in a slow, emotional way, with no obvious end in sight. But in that same way, I find it very realistic, because it's not chasing a happy ending like most shoujo do. The same thing that makes it great, is also it'sdownfall. I also love the narrations in the beginning before the theme song- they often offered great insight to Hachiko's thinking. The story here really revolves around her mostly, even though Nana is a huge part of it, I always felt as though Hachiko was the main focus, probably because she has the more relatable and realistic problems out of the two. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\r\nI like the art on this one, although the characters definitely can be hard to get used to. But, they have quite a diverse cast, which I love. You can tell now that the art is a little dated, but it's far better than many it's age. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nYes this does revolve around music quite a bit. The background music was good, nothing that I took particular notice of. The music they played was good, but it wasn't what they were focusing on here. It was more of the concept of it, and their careers. What they did play was good,  but it wasn't really the main focus. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 \\n\r\nAt 47 episodes, it can almost seem a little repetitive- I can see many recurring themes like Hachiko's unrequited love causing her pain, her realizing and hating herself/other person for it and Nana's unwavering commitment to being herself and not letting anything stand in the way of her success with the band and being independent- of course they evolve beyond those simple principles, which is what makes this great to watch. The characters, while evolving in some aspects, do not evolve in others and that can be interesting and aggravating to watch, much like real life. The character development is amazing though, they give great insights to the way the characters think, the way they handle their emotions, and it's really compelling to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 \\n\r\nI really do love this anime. I think it has great themes throughout, and it is pretty fascinating to watch. Everything about it is good, but there is just something that keeps it from being great, and I think that's mainly that it has too many recurring themes for an anime this long. They struggle with the same problems on different scales throughout the whole thing. But, I also feel that's what makes this incredible realistic. \\n\\n",

            "content": "While I've only watched up to episode 23 I've read up to chapter 36 in the manga and from there I gave up. I don't think I can properly review this anime as I haven't finished it but I feel that I need to say a little something.\r\nNana was really addicting at first, it seemed interesting and it was a mature story. I've also seen the anime and read the manga Paradise Kiss by the same author and it had a similar vibe. I thought I'd like it. I did like it at first, but then it started going down the wrong path. I don'thave much to complain about with the art and sound, but as for the story and characters I have a lot I don't like about them. \\n\\n\r\nI really hate the main character Nana Komatsu. At first I thought I'd be able to deal with her, as she had her nice moments, but I couldn't bring myself to watch an anime when I hated the main character so much. I am willing to accept a few slip ups, but her actions in the anime are just ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked the other characters too at first, but none of them were doing what I wanted them to do, none of them. Basically nothing was going good. Some people may enjoy drama but when it goes this far it is just boring and unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nI finally couldn't take it anymore. Everything was going bad and I needed to know if something would eventually go right, and so I skipped ahead and spoiled myself. And what did I discover? That nothing got better and that it only got even more terrible and convoluted. How are any of the things that happen in this anime supposed to make the viewers happy? I at least expect some positive things to happen after all of the crap that goes down, but what do I get? More crap.\\n\\n\r\nI am tired of watching entire romance anime filled with drama only to give the viewers a little bit of happiness at the last episode. (I don't even know if they give us at least that, from what I could tell from the spoilers I don't have much faith in any sort of happiness appearing.) Nana is full of drama and even if you tell me \"it gets better\" there is no way I am going to wade through all of this crap to get to the better parts. I'm just not that patient, I have better things to do with my time.\\n\\n\r\nRemember, this review is from someone who did not finish the anime or the manga. I am just telling you what I can see from where I'm standing. Just know that this anime isn't going to be a fun ride if you don't like dealing with so much drama.",

            "content": "Imagine if one day, you meet someone with your name and even though you two are polar opposites, you two couldn\u2019t be any similar. That is basically one of the major plot points of this anime that I am going to review- and I must admit that\u2019s really interesting.\r\nSo, our story is about two girls with the same name as I mentioned earlier and they both are blessed with the name \u2018Nana\u2019. First, you have got Nana Komatsu- a ditzy, hopeless romantic who wants to head out to Tokyo so that she could be with her boyfriend Shoji and her other best friends. This Nanasearches for happiness and love, but at the same time doesn\u2019t have any particular goals and basically spends her time day dreaming like a little girl.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have got Nana Osaki- my favourite Nana in case you don\u2019t know- a badass, Goth chick who loves singing for her band Blast and someday hopes to be a professional singer. So, she too heads out to achieve her dream and get over her ex-boyfriend Ren Honjo- and I don\u2019t blame her for that because getting over a guy that good looking ain\u2019t easy! Nana Osaki searches for fame and success, but at the same time despite her attitude and pride- she is often portrayed as a sweet and caring individual, who is like the mother bear of the band Blast.\\n\\n\r\nThe two Nanas meet on a train ride and one thing leads to another and the two end up sharing an apartment with one another. After which, our real journey into their lives really begins!\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters from Nana Komatsu\u2019s side include her boyfriend Shouji, her friends Junko and Kyoskei. And from Nana Osaki\u2019s side we have got her band Blast which has Nobu, Yasu, Shinichi and of course Ren, who later leaves to join the band Trapnest which causes their break up.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the show starts off rather slow and I dropped it after one episode. Not because it was bad per se, but Josei anime is not really my type- even though it is targeted towards the demographic I am part off. I mean, this type of anime was new for me- mainly because despite being a girl I am not a girlish person or not even  mature enough to be interest in a show like this. So, I wasn\u2019t sure it will be suited to my taste. However, I decided to you know step outside my comfort zone and watch it- and I\u2019m glad I did.\\n\\n\r\nNana\u2019s pacing at the beginning can be either seen as something bad or good. That being said, the show starts off in the present- but the next seven or eight episodes takes place in both of the Nanas\u2019 past.  And that kind of made me hesitant to watch the show again-as it slowly progressed because I just eagerly wanted to know what happens after they move in together.\\n\r\nI, however did enjoy the back story at the beginning.  But, the show really did delay in starting off the actual story of the two Nanas.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, the pacing was flawless and just nothing to really complain about- but that\u2019s only after they were done introducing the characters after giving their lengthy back story. One thing that kept me interested in the show was its narration. It sort of had this nostalgic feeling attached to it- making it sound and also seem as if the two Nanas share a very intense and beautiful relationship. Nana Komatsu keeps reminiscing about her past when she first met Nana Osaki and she paints a beautiful picture with words by describing the events and also about her interactions and first impressions of Nana Osaki. That is something I truly admired, and narration in general can often suck but in Nana\u2019s case it was one of its strongest points. Towards the last twenty or so episodes, Nana Osaki takes the wheel from Komatsu and instead she starts narrating which was also executed equally well.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I hate to say this and I know many of you don\u2019t want to hear this, but I had some major issues with Nana Komatsu\u2019s character- I mean I am not saying she is a bad character but as a main lead she doesn\u2019t necessarily live up to expectations unlike her polar opposite Nana Osaki, who is just blowing off stereotypes!\\n\\n\r\nNana Komatsu, started off as this sweet, na\u00efve girl who is dependent on others and can\u2019t help but fall in love with the first cute boy she meets. Now, this is a very annoying trait- but I looked past it because I am not the type to be quick to judge. However, even by the end of the series she is more or less the same person- she is still dependent on others, she is very indecisive, and just unbelievably childish at times. It\u2019s like she hardly got any character development despite all the shit that happened to her. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, there are times you feel bad for her because since this is a drama- everything isn\u2019t sunshine and lollipops for her- but I feel like she never learns from her past experiences and keeps on making the same stupid mistakes over and over again. Her character is a good comic relief character, but as a main female protagonist she is just a failure at being that. I mean, if you can learn anything from her character, is that you shouldn\u2019t be an idiot and keep going back instead of moving forward. Nana keeps talking about how she is aware of the fact, that she is stupid, but she never seems to do anything about it. And I think that\u2019s worse than being a na\u00efve, dependent and hopeless romantic girl. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing about her character is her indecisiveness. She doesn\u2019t know who she is in love with or what she wants and just jumps from guy to other just to make things easier for her, especially towards the end which just brought her character down by several notches, which is sad because after fifteen or so episodes I thought she had the potential of being as great as Osaki.Nana Komatsu is a terrible role model for young girls, but yet for some reason I did enjoy her character because she did have some funny moments, none the less. I\u2019ll give her props for that at least!\\n\\n\r\nNow, Nana Osaki is one character I truly felt so sorry for. Her life was worse than Komatsu\u2019s but yet she manages to be strong, independent and cool. You want to root for her type of character and see her succeed every step of the way. Now given the type of environment she was raised in and the way people generally perceive her, Nana Osaki could have come out as a bitch! \\n\r\nNo, like seriously think about it, it\u2019s usually people with such difficult lives who always end up being bitter. However, even though Nana Osaki seems that way, she doesn\u2019t give off that vibe. From the moment, I first saw Nana Osaki and the way she acted, despite her sarcastic and couldn\u2019t care less attitude- she was still a kind hearted and sweet person with a heart made out of gold. She might be punk, but at the end of the day she doesn\u2019t let that label define her. And the development she also got throughout the series was amazing. I wish that the show gave her just as much importance and screen time they gave the other Nana.\\n\\n\r\nWow, I am losing my bananas saying Nana all the time. Wait, what? Moving on\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting cast, some are fleshed out properly and contribute to Nana\u2019s story just as our two titular characters do. However, some of them are still shrouded in mystery even towards the end of the show and you want to know more about them. The supporting characters in my opinion are given decent amounts of screen time and most of them seem to have made some sort of impact on the two Nanas.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Nana features very tall, skeleton like characters that is reminds me of Clamp\u2019s designs for Code Geass. The characters are very well designed, making them look very detailed and not to mention very fashionable. The artstyle of Nana already gives us the feeling that this is going to be a Josei anime before the story can get the chance to unfold to the audience. It despite being about seven to eight years old still looks top notch and has this sort of elegance and chic vibe to it that I can\u2019t really explain that well. In case you don\u2019t understand what I mean by all of this, I am simply trying to say that this show\u2019s animation is awesome!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening songs there are three but it\u2019s only the first one that really stands out the most and is also one of my favourite anime openings of all time. It suits the show so perfectly, and not mention it manages to narrate both the Nana\u2019s struggles in lives.\\n\\n\r\n Now, for Nana, when watching the show I think the dub is better, mainly because the two actresses voicing the two Nanas do a great job of bringing their characters to life. I especially enjoy the performance of Rebecca Shoichet who voices Nana Osaki making her sound badass and sincere which is an amazing accomplishment on her part.\\n\\n\r\nThis show had the potential of being a shoujo ai, heck it was very close to becoming one. Not that I would have minded if this went that direction, but I am glad at the end of the day these two just remained friends. Also, the show does a good job of establishing a bond between these two which makes the show all the more great. The banter between the two is hilarious and the moments the two share can range from being heartbreaking to being downright hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes of Nana felt rushed in my opinion as they tried to wrap everything up very messily. It just didn\u2019t work in my opinion and still by the end, a plethora of questions were left unanswered about certain characters. Many consider it a disappointment, and I can\u2019t help but agree with them.  \\n\r\nThe plot of this show might not be anything as exciting as something filled with aliens, time travelers and espers, hence this anime is not necessarily for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn\u2019t your average high school lovey dovey melodramatic romance anime, but is actually very realistic in the sense that it actually tells the story of two young women and their personal struggles in the world which many women can relate and or identify themselves with. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you\u2019re a teenage boy that enjoys explosions, guns and fight scenes, or a girl who loves sparkly backgrounds, teenage romance and bishounen catboys then you are not going to like this show. However, if you are willing to step outside your comfort zone and give this show a chance then maybe you\u2019ll like it. I am not saying you will, but you might!\\n\\n\r\nI am going to award Nana with an 8 and say that is definitely WORTH THE WATCH. I would give it a higher score if it wasn't for it's anti-climactic ending.\\n\\n\r\n If you want to get into Josei anime I suggest you start with Nana, it\u2019s the perfect gateway into this particular genre. It\u2019s a mature show with great characters, a decent plot and amazing music. I surprisingly enjoyed this show a lot, and it is also a harsh reminder that life is unfair and hard, so yeah basically a bitch!\\n",

            "content": "Nana is an anime about two girls called Nana. Nana Osaki is a musician from the countryside that went to Tokyo with her band to try live from music and be a star on the city, while Nana Komatsu was an \"artist\" from the countryside that went to Tokyo to live with her boyfriend. Some things happen and end up like two living in the same house, the anime walks around their romantic lives, their past, the difficulties of life, among other subjects.\r\nWhat i like about the anime is that they show to girls with the same name, almost the same age, the same dreamof leaving in the big city, how they deal with the pass and the present, their romance problems. They show how to girl can be so alike but so different from each other.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say much more about it with given spoilers, so if you like romance and drama, give a try to Nana.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be wary of my numerical evaluation because it is one of my favorite animes, however the evaluation was made based on my tastes and not the criteria of each of the readers.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nNana's story is very well written and quite complete. The story is made from one of the main characters reminiscent of how they met, how their two worlds came together, their problems, how they supported each other. All the events of the story are well connected, there are no characters that disappear or reappear miraculously, all of which have some relevance at a certain point in the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those points where there may be discord, personally I like the art type and I think it fits the story very well. I know there are other animes of the genre with better appearance but we have to take into account that this anime came out in 2006 and that each frame is a different drawing, and that it was all designed by hand.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nAnother point of discord, this was one of the few animes where I have always seen the opening and ending, but what leads me to give 8 of these 10 points is Nana music. Despite that hardcore metal aspect, Nana has an excellent voice, the speed of the song fits very well with the speed of the story and the lyrics of the song end up emphasizing the character's feelings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most important aspects, all the characters are developed in a way that concerns the story,there are no developments that lead to the abandonment of the main story and there are no characters that are not developed, all the characters are exploited but only in the aspects that have revelation to the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the story, the music, the art, everything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nRemember the evaluation was made based on my tastes and not the criteria of each of the readers.",

The relationship between characters is worked on and thought of very deeply by the author and takes one to the depth of their world , The feelings characters get is felt greatly by the watchers hence the utmost sadness and happiness fills their heart . It is pretty rare to see this kind of story nowadays . Although I must say some scenes and decisions were sometimes a bit too harsh esp. later in the show but never hurt the awesome experience of watching this masterpiece .\\n\r\nI must say that the weakest part of NANA is it's art . Extremely blurry scenes and weak lighting make up a somewhat average art but the character's art and almost everything else other than those two are almost flawless and somewhat compensate the shortcomings esp. some chibi forms and singing scenes .\\n\r\nThe OST and sounding of NANA is one of the best I've seen so far , it matches the mood swings of the episodes and by far surpasses the standards of a normal anime not to mention the variety of the songs used in the openings and endings .\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are well developed and it doesn't have any shallow and useless characters . They feel real and are easy to feel empathized toward which is admiring .\\n\r\nThe feeling of enjoyment is a bit controversial in NANA as it isn't defined by a happy ending or any specific scene but by the overall show . I think it is one of the most enjoyable anime out there but don't get me wrong that doesn't necessarily mean you will feel anything specific after completing it or that you'll drown in feelings of enjoyment and satisfaction but quite the opposite ( at least in my case ) It makes you question very basic human nature and feeling which is again praiseworthy imo .\\n\r\nIf you are tired of all the superficial anime and want something deep and even depressing to some extent and have a thing for shoujo material then this is for you . \\n\r\nI'll be decreasing my overall scoring system so that NANA's 10 score would stand out a bit .",

            "content": "I don't easily look down on people based on what they are, or what they do. It's the attitude and the way of thinking that I rather look up to. Whether they do good things or bad things, I think it's only a matter of context (the percieved \"good/bad things\" itself may differ each person, depending on their principal values). Maybe we end up choosing the same path if we were in his/her condition. Maybe we fall into a much darker pit. No one knows. But the two things I mentioned, it's what differentiate the true, \"good\" person from the other.\r\nIn my life of watchinganime, I've never seen anything as comforting as it is depressing and as real as watching NANA. The feeling of love, anger, betrayal, pride, fear, sympathy and regret I received from learning both the lead characters, living the \"determining stage of life\" that is the transition into adulthood, gave me chills and warmth throughout the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNANA is a 2006 anime adapted from a manga written and illustrated by Ai Yazawa. It tells about the chance encounter of Nana Komatsu and Nana Osaki, later about their friendship and each of their own lives. The two met on a fateful night in a bullet train to Tokyo, and sat next to each other. Hachi (lets just call the first girl this) came to Tokyo to finally meet her boyfriend, Shoji, though honestly it seems like she came just to find \"love\" in general. Nana on the other hand came to Tokyo to become a rock star. Both have same name, same age, same destination, and same motive: to start a new life.\\n\\n\r\nNana Komatsu, an air-headed girl from a small town up in northern Japan (I guess Tohoku region? It's never explicitly stated) who finds \"love\" as much as people do their laundry. I hate this girl. Ya, she's got the appeal, but blatantly speaking she really gave me frustration almost every 2-3 episodes, if not every episode, for all her \"wishy washy\" attitude when deciding about anything and still regret it after. I honestly couldn't care less about her desire for love, \"doing it\" every time she thinks she's found \"the guy\"; but the repetitive mistakes she made after finding out \"it wasn't really what she wanted\" really ticks me off.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Nana Osaki, also from a small town in northern Japan, who wanted to become a rock star. Back home she already made a name for herself together with her band called the Black Stones, until one of the members decided to leave and join a soon-to-be popular band in Tokyo. This caused conflict and later hiatus, and was devastating for the band at first. But Nana quickly stood up and continued to chase her dream.\\n\\n\r\nHachi and Nana coincidentally met again when they were looking for a place to live in Tokyo, and, as fate would have it, decided to live together (Yes, Hachi ultimately didn't live with Shoji. Say this was the first drama of many). The two bear different personalities, yet it's what made them so close. I like how their apartment became the \"connecting hub\" of different people and friends, and how they became a host of many moments and stories, past and present (and future), all mashed in one room. Outside, they have their own different lives, doing different things, interacting with different people. But when they get home, it's their world together. It's fate--one of the things that made me like this series.\\n\\n\r\nEvery season never cease to astound me, like riding a never-ending roller coaster. One time it made me so frantic I felt like flipping a table. And the fact that it was left hanging upset me even more. But if it were to resemble life, it would never have a \"true ending\", it'd keep moving and changing every time as long as you live. It's 47 episodes long, but I highly recommend people watching \ud83d\ude0a",

            "content": "The name of the Demon King recurs often in Nana, and it is often used as comedic relief when something unfortunate or inconvenient happens to one of the characters. However, the reference to the demon king may hold a more dramatic metaphor for the initiated, as Ai Yazawa weaves a story of loss, pain, music, and, most importantly, love.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nUnlike other stories, Nana's plotline is distinct from the development of its characters. While the two are affecting each other in substantial ways, the story seemingly moves forward with its own volition, not getting dragged down by the personal burdens of the characters within its weftand weave. This is sometimes a good thing, as the story moves, the past gets buried and festers into emotionless apathy or a deep scar, which further develops the character later on. However, the bad side is that the story manages to feel out-of-pace at times, and even glossing over details that were such an important and dramatic section of the previous episodes. In the later half of the show, Hachi's problems are paddled into the background as Nana takes center stage as narrator, and character conflicts begin to both drive the story and fragment the story. Various conflicts taking place at the exact same time sometimes made the later episodes feel jumbled and splintered, leaving a jarring sense of disconnect that takes one out of the story and go, \"that didn't make much sense.\" Of course, with a story so heavily based on emotion, logic doesn't work its way into the plotline very often, but that leads to clashing between subplotlines that feel poorly designed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nAlthough calling the characters in Nana stick figures isn't exactly accurate, it does say a great deal about the design of the characters relative to other series produced in the same season. The other shoujo drama that aired the same season, Ouran High School Host Club, also suffered from this slightly, but managed to keep the characters well-proportioned underneath their school uniforms and casual wear. Nana, on the other hand, stylized everyone as these skin-over-bones humans who can't seem to put on weight. Only when winter clothes are introduced that the characters get a little more substance to their figure. Overall, however, animation quality was still good, free from any notable error occurring within the scenes. Madhouse did well in its editing for this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nFor a show that focuses so much on the music industry as a whole, the sound is much more important here, relatively speaking. Both Anna Tsuchiya and OLIVIA did wonderful jobs as Nana Osaki and Reira Serizawa in the opening and closing songs. Beautiful piano melodies evoked sadness at dramatic scenes, while the punkish theme of the show came through when either BLAST or Trapnest was put in center stage. The singular gripe that can be said about the sound is that the natural singing voices of Romi Park and Aya Hirano drew a considerable difference in sound for both of the singers, leading to a certain degree of disconnect for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAs with all stories, character development is a huge part of a show, and Nana is absolutely no exception. Hell, most of the show is ABOUT character development, and it is absolutely wonderful to see that directors and producers left most of Ai Yazawa's story intact and preferred a narrative style to portray Nana instead of pure acting. To see both Nanas struggle through the memories of their past and either leave behind old ghosts or be continuously haunted by them throughout the show makes the story almost haunting, and definitely capable of drawing a viewer to stay connected to the story, even when other elements fall short. The other members of BLAST also got fully fleshed out backstories, with motivations that are clear to opaque, since the story is told through the eyes of either Nana K. or Nana O. Nobu, for example, is very much like Hachi in terms of easygoing love, but is passionate and pure to the point of being very simple to figure out motivations, though his actions aren't exactly as predictable. Meanwhile, Yasu stands as a piece of slate in comparison, as not even Nana O., his own bandmate, manages to figure out what exactly drives his actions at times, and the viewer is given few glimpses into his mind during his private conversations with other characters. Trapnest also has terrifically designed characters, with Naoki being a comedic relief when the story emerges from a heavy arc. Delving into any of the characters in a spoiler, however, but that should give an indication that the story is thoroughly developed and intricately weaved with the backstories and, sometimes conflicting, motivation of each character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nNana is not a perfect show by any means. Sometimes, its errors and faults glare through in pretty substantial ways, and takes a viewer out of the carefully crafted world of Tokyo back into real life. And yet, Nana seeks to mirror real life, in the way that not everything ends up happy, and sacrifices isn't just something meant for the underprivileged and poor. Romance isn't the happy-go-lucky emotional rollercoaster that other shows may portray it as, and Nana does a wonderful relating romance, whether it be love, friendship, or a passion for music, to how not everyone gets what they want in the end, and how not everyone can be merely read like the words they are born from.",

            "content": "\"Nee Nana..\" \r\nOnly two words but it brings so much emotions.. I still feel uncomfortable after hearing it and I have that bittersweet feeling running down the spine.\r\nI actually was reluctant to watch this anime.\r\nI tried reading the manga once before and I had a hard time dealing with the art (and I know it's dumb because art shouldn't matter if there's a good story behind it..). So I just stopped reading it. I might be weird or something but I'm the kind of person who loves crying in front of a sad anime. So... Four years after that I was talking with a goodfriend of mine asking her if she had any good recommendation for heart-breaking animes, and she told me \"Watch Nana\". I decided to give it a try...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nSo what struck me the most was of course the art. Since it was one of the reason I stopped reading the manga it was kinda hard to go back at it. I wasn't a fan of these long legs, tall and thin characters. It was way too different from what I was used to watch.\\n\r\nIn the meantime I grew up and decided to just ignore these few things I didn't like and focus on the other aspects of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nI guess you can read the synopsis by yourself, the story itself was good. I don't know what to say about it. It was a \"slice of life\" type where you follow the life of two girls. Don't kill me for what I'm going to say but there's nothing that exciting except the fact that one of them is a singer for a punk band. There's the usual friendship and love drama. Saying it this way might be a little bit depreciating but the way it is written and depicted through the entire anime is so damn good. I've never watched a series that had such a serious tone/mood and that was being so poetic (Yes I'm talking here about the parts at the beginning or ending of each episode with the famous \"Nee.. Nana...\" and yes this were my favorite moments)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are perfect, every single one of them has a background story, no one was left behind. The two main characters are sooo different and yet they suit each other so much. I sincerely could say that even though both Nana are the main characters, the other characters are as much important as them. They aren't here just to \"fill\" episodes with side stories and then disappear, they are intertwined with each other in specific relationships and that shows how much effort has been put in each character to make it unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI mean c'mon, I have no idea what people think about the soundtrack but can you really not enjoy it? I was more a fan of Trapnest songs (which are pretty calm compared to Black Stones). \\n\r\nBut there's definitely one song that surpassed all of them and it's \"Kuroi Namida\" . I still remember the last word of the last episode with this song in the background and... dem feels... ;___;\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI literally watched this anime in one week, every evening I watched a much as I could before sleeping and I did not regret. I cried way too much (so if you feel a bit depressed, please wait a little before watching this haha, might not be good for your poor little heart).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 \\n\r\nI don't really know how to convince you it's really hard to express my feelings towards Nana but it's definitely one of this anime that you'll remember. \\n\r\nIf you have some time to spare.. 47 episodes isn't that long and I promise you'll really enjoy it.",

            "content": "Where would anime be without Studio Madhouse? At least during this era of anime this particular studio was seemingly all over the place in genres, but also quality. Luckily, this incredibly popular manga, Nana, had an amazing source material to go straight off of along with director Morio Asaka. He has a history of more \u201cchildish\u201d romance anime like Chobits and Cardcaptor Sakura, but also had experience in storyboard with more mature shows like Monster and Black Lagoon. Some questions that would arise during development were could the studio create a quality show, stay true to the mature source material, and an accurate portrayal ofcharacter relationships?\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDo you remember the first time we met?\u201d Really, this opening statement sets the tone and introduces the mood going forward. These two aspects are done extremely well in Nana. Word choices in dialogue between characters is done in a way where even the minutest details has impact in the present and future for the show. Emotion then, of course, plays an even greater role for character development from episode to episode just like a real person would. This world in Nana creates something that fans and the like can then relate to these characters on a personal level.\\n\\n\r\nNana is about two women with the same name but are two different people with different directions in life. Unlike the usual romance anime about love, lost, and ultimately tropes, Nana is more like an afternoon Soap Opera. The show follows the two Nana girls and the group that is around them. It starts off a bit melancholy and even comedic at times, but then develops as would someone\u2019s real life where the characters experience difficult relationship turns, break ups, and creating personal bonds. It is within these moments that a slow build is done ultimately resulting in a climatic \u201cpersonal\u201d moment. Therefore, the first half of the 47 episodes focus on these developments to create some of the most heart wrenching moments to experience in anime. This might be some of the most divers, relatable, and believable cast since previous shows such as the romance of Honey and Clover and the music anime of Beck.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the animation is a consistent high quality such as everything being animated and smooth during live band performances. The music being fantastic then goes without saying. However, emotional moments are hurt by trivial and bland voice acting throughout the show. Other aspects that lowers Nana is the consistent censorship the show went through cutting out drug use making character developments not understandable during the anime and the worst is the original ending due to the manga being unfinished. Not saying the ending is bad, but so many questions and what happened to the characters are unknown unless the manga is read. \\n\\n\r\nLife does go on and Nana portrays this in a believable way. This is an emotional roller coaster that is near perfection. A high recommend.",

This world she created is truly inspiring, you really feel like you are one of the characters and those were your group of friends. Honestly, the realistic stories were captivating. What i love most is that the anime does not shy away from the adult themes found in the manga, it dives right in! Some of the lines and phrases are truly unforgettable. \r\n\"Say NANA, do you remember the first time we met?\"\\n\\n\r\nThinking back on this line now, it just gives me such a good feeling because I had no idea how great these stories would be. \\n\\n\r\nI was also impressed by the balance it had. There was love of course, but it explored all aspects of love. It wasn't your typical find a guy fall in love and live happily ever after. Nope, the complexity in which she delicately developed these characters is IMPRESSIVE.  There was also music, fashion, loss, sadness, joy, i mean i can go on and on and on. \\n\\n\r\nThere is truly nothing negative I can say about it, I hope it comes back because I am hooked. \\n\\n\r\nLol the only thing I would say is, these fools need to lay off the nicotine! I mean seriously, smoking is like oxygen to them. I was so lost in this anime, i swear the stressful moments were stressing me out along with them! haha made me want to grab a cigarette right along with them haha jkjk folks. I think the creator just thought it looked cool or something but that was redic 0_0 \\n\\n\r\nBottom line: WATCH IT! :-)\\n",

This anime has an amazing story, crazy good character establishment, and the art and sound are of course up to par. WHY then did i give this such a poor score? because according to reviews, synopses, and even by genre this was supposed to be a perfect story. every perfectstory has their tragedies, their tear-jerkers, and their heart wrenching scenes. but in the end, a perfect story leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling. haha ok so i dont need it to be some shallow \"the prince and princess live happily ever after\" shit. but i expected to feel satisfied after heartbreak occurred over and over again. i wont ruin this review by adding a serious spoiler here but i want you to know that after several depressing episodes leading up to the finale, the \"happy ending\" was nowhere to be seen. for me, this was an anime that was the work of a genus. the one obstacle that killed this story for me was the one name i needed to see on the happy ending list; NOBUO.",

            "content": "I didn't know what to expect when I watched the first episode of NANA. I've never watched any romantic anime so this was a whole new area for me.\r\nThe atmosphere and the artwork hit me instantly. The anime is very beautiful and Tokyo, the trains and the streets full of snow feel real and magical at the same time. The story is told in layers slowly revealing the backgrounds of both main characters, Hachi and Nana, and then getting in to their current lives in their common apartmet. Personally I find he storyline quite good, although at some points the relationships are getting very complicated.Especially the manga after the animated part is getting some times overly complicated, but then again, throughout the series I had a feeling that it was still quite real. When young adults spend time together as closely as these bandmates do, it's very likely that the relationships between people get complicated. People don't always get what they want - not in real life and not in NANA. \\n\\n\r\nThe series has some very strong points: \\n\\n\r\n1) MUSIC. Music is very dear to me and that probably that is the reason why this series affected me so strongly. It wasn't until the end of episode 9 when the the way music is potrayed in this series really got me. Some of the music scenes are so beautifully executed and the emotion is so strong that get chills every time I think about them. Because this is a story that takes place in the punk world of Tokyo and tells the tale of two bands, it is only normal that music plays a big part. That why I was very glad to notice that the music in this series is really good - good enough to listen afterwords. \\n\\n\r\n2) CHARACTERS. Besides the two main characters, the series features several other important characters as well. The band members are given a big role and the characters with their very unique personalities are wonderful. Sometimes the other characters become more important than the two main characters and their lives are momentarily in the middle of the story. The characters flow in and out in the series very much like they flow in real life - it was good to notice that the series did not tell a love story but rather a life story in which love, life and friendship all were included. \\n\\n\r\n3) MATURE/DARK THEMES. The themes portrayed in this series are far more mature than in any other anime I've seen. This series goes through such difficult themes as drug use and cheating as well as prostitution / child abuse, and this anime has a very good touch to those themes. A lot of the material is far from anything one would expect from a romantic shoujo anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series was an amazing experience for me. I was sucked into the story like crazy and I fell in love with some of the characters, hated others. Even though a large part of the manga hasn't been animated, the anime has a certain roundness in it and can be accepted as a season with reasonable ending. However, the manga is on extended hiatus and most likely it will never be finished. The manga leaves the reader in the middle of events with no sign of conclusion. It is an unfortunate weakness for this series that the manga and thus also the anime are unfinished. So in the end this is one of the best anime series I've seen but it left me angry and sad because it didn't really give a conclusion.",

            "content": "This review only attempts to cover what I found the numerous other reviews seemed to lack. So it is not a full blown critique, heck it's not even a proper review, only the essence of what I feel I had to convey, which is the one major point below. For the rest, I believe the other reviewers have done a good enough job to get you going. \r\nRomance and shoujo anime that I've seen so far have always shown blossoming love. Two people, usually a boy and a girl, realise they have feelings for each other and they're swept by emotions till they find variousmeans of getting together. The push and pull is fun, but once they get together, OH! HAPPY HAPPY END! \\n\\n\r\n-NOT!-\\n\\n\r\nThat's what I love about NANA. It doesn't show the push and pull of \"Love in the Air\", it shows relationships, as they are, when they're made and how to handle them. The characters bring up their past from episode 2, and when we start identifying with them, their world becomes our world. You get so involved in them that their happiness is yours and their sadness clings at your heart. I found myself being helped out in my own relationship due to this, helped out in making decisions, helped out in handling certain situations. The characters are deep, they grow and the decisions they make are true to them, even raw. They act their age. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a mature anime, with so much thought given to have a realistic approach. I love it. It was the first time I'd been dragged into an anime so bad. :)\\n\r\nIt's been two years since I completed this, and I realised I had put up a point here as a review. Two years down, the songs are still in my playlist, and they still move me. Olivia Lufkin's voice really brings out a reminiscent ring. I still remember Hachi and her killing decisions, I still remember Nana's possessiveness. And whenever possible, I've been trying to read the manga, few pages at a time.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note...\\n\r\nI just wish that the art and animation would have been slightly better. It's good, but the change from realistic to funny feels awkward, forced. For the concert parts, they have still scenes as well as animated ones for the bands, I'm not complaining much there, though obviously it was preferable to see their performance animated. (Nodame Cantabile is a +++ in that! UtaPri had some good investment for animation despite its hideous plot). But the lighting, the colours, the dresses and the day-to-day change in appearances of the characters are well done. We see fresh styles. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this show has a bloody huge number of reviews. I'm just here to add my point to them, not create another whole book worth the same stuff. \\n\\n\r\nSlice of Life, Romance, Relationships, Reality and Trying to make it on your own. An amazing watch! :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Where to begin with the complexity of NANA? I never thought I would ever write a review for this anime, but probably the cliche of anything good, but this was the best anime ever. Seems very stupid and retarded that I have posted everything a ten (surprised myself there) but NANA fills in the bill for the freshest anime with such unique counterparts to any other I have ever watched. \r\nStory: It really reflects nicely on struggles of real life and the cruelty of fame versus all the fake happiness and careless feeling USUALLY portrayed in animes. This wasn't a slap-happy, comical show but moreof a slice of life anime with much emotion and feelings that made me truly connect with the characters who don't stray from people in the real world. Nana and Nana's (will refer as Hachi) slim connection showed such intensity and how Ai Yazawa (author) fit every little piece together really made a nice puzzle of art, design and a story plot of innovation. Honestly, I have never watched Beck (another music anime) but to me, this story plot really made the mark and will probably leave an imprint on my mind for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The characters were drawn in a sort of common way with the slight difference in facial features and height. But the way Yazawa dressed their apparel was so far out amazing. I myself, when watching, had the temptation to run to the nearest clothing store and pile on t-shirts to rip and style with that gothic/punk appearance. The designs seemed to fit each character perfectly and match with no obvious flaws. It was also nice to see very different hairstyles of the characters from spiked, bob, all the way to bald. That just of course added to the personalities of the characters making them more appealing\\n\\n\r\nSound: Olivia Lufkin and Anna Tsuchiya compounded on the anime by adding their new (back then unknown) voices as Nana (Black Stones) and Reira (Trapnest). I had actually heard Olivia before watching Nana and when I saw her artist posted as Olivia inspi'Reira (trapnest) I was going...why would she bother having such a long name? Little did I realize her voice was over in this anime which led to her fame as a new artist waiting to shine. Their voices were different from one another yet complimenting each other since in the anime Reira and Nana have very different song styles. When they sang for opening and ending themes it didn't feel the episodes never officially ended after the ~20 minute mark but continued till the end of the video completed. I usually after hearing the ending themes of animes quickly load to the next video, but for NANA I kept on listening placidly till the end of the song was over. Took more time but made me feel more at peace about this certain anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It was refreshing to view the characters not a perfect people but with problems, addictions, smoking, lust, cleverness which added more to their attitudes and uniqueness as individual characters. I would say Hachi was the most corrupted one of them in the beginning for being indecisive and untrustworthy on love; but Nana soon sailed in as more of the girl in need since she was such an imperfect girl striding and persisting to just be loved. Each character is memorable and brings a part of the story to the table equaling each other. Though Nana and Hachi were the main characters it seemed that every character in the anime was equal in spotlight sharing and no one was overpowering any other character. All of them were in there for a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's obvious I had an amazing time with this anime saying that I officially finished at 2 am in the morning. For some insane reason I could not stop myself from ending the show. Every episode had a cliffhanger and the unconcluding thought seemed to drawl at my head. I loved every part. I would not say each episode was a filler they were all there for purpose. And now I am continuing the anime by manga (Starts on Vol. 12 Ch. 33).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: An excellent drama like anime revealing the real world and that fame is not always how it appears. Does have its comical sides with a more worldly feeling. An A+++++++++ to anyone who has ever felt unhappy of themselves and cannot understand the pain they go through (Sounds really cliche but works).",

            "content": "This was one of my favorite series. I guess I felt a connection to all the characters. In the past I've spent a lot of time in the music business. I've know the groupies. I've heard awful stories from bands about groupies. I know what its like to have a dream of being on stage... to surpass your role models. The characters are pretty true to the reality of the music world. On the flip side I do relate to Hachi (Nana). I was always easy to fall in love and have done many things in an attempt to influence someone to show me love.It really never had a very good outcome, but I know where she's coming from. She's a REALLY exaggerated version of me, and of many other girls I'm sure.  \\n\\n\r\nThe drama, the storyline, the romance, the hot guys... all aspects of this show I found amazing. The drawing is more detailed than generic anime, which I like. As silly as it sounds I won't watch an anime without at least one hot guy. I have to have some form of romance in my anime. Of course I think twisted relationships are even more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nYou find yourself loving characters, just to hate them later... and visa versa. The biggest thing though for me is the ending. It actually has a good ending which almost never happens, even though it falls under the 3 possible endings of a anime. I won't list them here cause you'll be able to guess the exact ending this one is, but feel free to read it in my profile.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone.",

Of course, seeing that NANA was one of the top 100 anime of all time according to MyAnimeList, I just had to give the show a try.\r\nThe beginning had me immediately drawn in! The diversity and the chemistry between the two Nana's and their developing character/relationships were really great! \r\nBut as the series continued, it just got worse and worse...\r\nThe main characters became less and less likeable, especially Nana O., character developmentwas rather forced or unexplained, and the motives of the character's actions were never reasonable or explained unlike in the beginning of the series. And to top it all off, the writing got more sloppy and unfocused as the series continued; sometimes even getting the chronology of the story wrong!\\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga, yet I'm very certain that it is better than this anime. So in case you haven't seen the anime yet, I HIGHLY recommend that you read the manga instead!",

They all have issues in their lives that hold them down, and really shows how issues you have affects everyone around you and those who care for you. The only reason I gave enjoyment an 8 instead of 10 like the rest is because it was so stressful to watch as I watched helpless hoping that I could have done something to stop the mistakesthe characters made, however I was hooked nonetheless.

            "content": "When i started watching first episode of this anime i heard these words \"Say Nana.... do you remember when we first met?\" and with those words i was captivated by this anime.\r\nAnime NANA tells us a story about two girls who are soo different but also very similar and about their painful life experiences alongside all happy moments they encountered. At first when we see the main characters (Two Girls) we think that they are soo nothing a like but after that we hear that they have the same names , same age and both going to Tokyo but On other hand they aren't verysimilar because of their characters one is clumsy , irresponsible and kind of stupid the other is very responsible , smart and knows what she wants. Whole story seems painful from the beginning because of such aspects as separation with the ones they love and being cheated on in front of your very own eyes.\\n\\n\r\nNana is more dramatic , painful anime then joyful or comedian ... because u see main characters mostly suffering then enjoying them selves even at the end there are more suffering then joyfulness ... \\n\\n\r\nWhat else i could say about Nana that its really how should i put this powerful anime which can really bring you to tears at some points but it also shows the development of two people feelings and how they gradually becomes almost inseparable ... even at some point there are jealousy which seems surpasses friendship but this isn't shoujo-ai so there are no such things ...\\n\\n\r\nNana also is a beautiful music anime with interesting music implanted in it ... which makes anime even more interesting to watch also without this music element it wouldn't be so interesting to watch because it holds most of the story in it.\\n\\n\r\nWell for me who loves drama and romance i loved this anime along side every other but for me it just had too much drama i would loved to see more romantic moments then pain all around the place ...",

            "content": "This is my very first review so I thought I'd start with an easy series. Nana is an anime that I think everyone will have mixed emotions about. \r\nNon spoiler review:\r\nIf you haven't seen this series yet and just want to know if its worth the watch\r\nNana doesn't have the feel of your stereotypical anime. Rather it feels like you are watching a late night tv soap opera. Almost all the main characters are adults for a start. It doesn't have one main character, rather it has two. The characters all complement each other nicely and they have a realistic feel to them. This seriestruly deserves to be under the genre 'drama'. It seriously never stops. Drama. Drama. Drama. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion this series has some great writing and character development which is always a plus in my book. However the anime was never finished which kinda leaves you feeling incomplete. Some of you may think \"Oh but I can just continue with the manga\" which is what I did BUT GUESS WHAT? The manga isn't completed either.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good anime to watch if you like drama. If you prefer 'quieter' series that actually have an ending than maybe give it a miss.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler review\\n\r\nOnly read this if you have already seen the series and are looking for someone else's opinion\\n\\n\r\nFirst impression: I almost dropped the series straight off the bat. It had what I felt was a boring start to it. However it being 40+ episodes I thought to myself \"well it must have had some popularity or it wouldn't have lasted that long\". I was soon glad that I had toughed it out as it did get better. I didn't like the relationship between shoji and nana though. I kept thinking \"I hope they break up\". \\n\\n\r\nOverall Impression: They did break up :O but in a way that I found truly disgusting. He cheated. I really hate cheating and almost dropped the series again when this happened. I didn't but I wish I did. This series has more cheating than....I don't know but there is too much cheating!! That isn't what I hate most about this series though. When watching this series you find yourself rooting for certain relationships \\n\r\nI want nana and yasushi to get together\\n\r\nI want nana and nobuo to get together\\n\r\nI want hachi and nobuo to get together\\n\r\netc.\\n\r\nThan on the off chance your favourite couple gets together :D it is soon ended though cheating death cheating etc. This is so frustrating because the series doesn't just do this once. It does it again and again and again to the point were your just like \"IM FREAKING DONE!! SCREW YOU!! QUIT F**KING WITH MY FEELING\"",

I have seen more than 500 titles already, but only \"Nana\" made me feel this way -losing control while pressing the \"next episode\" button. If it is a turn-off the amount of almost 50 episodes, let me laugh a little about it. It is 100 years too early to say something like this for a daimond like \"Nana\", which is not even supernatural themed, but it is turning ordinary lives into gold. 24 hoursper day is not enough to devote to this anime. Drop everything you do, everything you are watching and give it a try. At first, I was just curious and 100% sure that I don't like anything that don't include \"fantasy\" , but let's be honest here: it was 100 years early for me, too, to judge something that I had never seen. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 characters development, perfect pace, perfect surprises, perfectly balanced sadness and happiness, balanced romance, drama, mystery, maddness, perfect... ohh, I'll start fangirling here. It is in a way fuck-up and depressing at some point, but let's stay at the 10/10 story: this is all you need to know. I suggest to not acctually listen to any review -including mine- and just see for yourselves this piece of pure art.",

            "content": "To be honest I thought this anime was a musical lesbian love story and I already  wasn't expected to be blown away. Then after finishing all 47 episodes and still craving for more that I realized this is probably the best drama and slice of life anime I have watched so far.\r\nI am not very creative at words so I will keep my review short but clear as I can.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story is about 2 girls both named Nana, namely Nana Komatsu(Bimbo Nana) and Nana Osaki(Punk rockstar Nana) who met 1 fateful day on train heading to Tokyo and that's where their wonderful and painfulstory unfolds throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole story is long so I won't cover everything that happens in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation of the story is very good for me as it gives a nostalgic vibe because the whole story is presented as a reminscing of both Nanas' story together through letters written to each other and you will realize that sometime in their time together their friendship was shattered and had never seen each other for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does this anime have a good presentation of its story, it also deals with realistic problems that people will encounter in college to adulthood like choosing your major, unemployment, cheating your partner, love problems and etc. which is why I can connect to the people in the story and can understand what that they are going through which is rare to find in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn short the story is all about having dreams of being successful,love life, loneliness, true friendship, big decisions in life and responsibility.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nNothing special and I'm not pleased that everyone drawn thin and tall resulting in everyone having the same body type.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC:\\n\r\nThe anime has a subplot of music after all so of course its very good and  I never skipped the opening and ending songs and I can say it is definitely better than most anime songs.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe series has also well developed and believable characters but I'm just gonna focus on the 2 Nanas of the series as it would take too long if I include the others.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with Bimbo Nana.Throughout the series Nana has made so many stupid decisions that she has hurt herself and people who care about her, it made me cringe everytime she does this but I couldn't hate her in the end as she is really a good a person at heart annd it's just that she made some bad choices in life which I can understand at some degree.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Rockstar Nana. Throughout the series it is shown that she feels betrayed after her boyfriend who is also a fellow band member decides to leave the band for a better band in Tokyo. With this experience she decides to be a strong independent woman but the anime shows that despite that it is a facade she is still hurting inside and still can't let go of her boyfriend. Rockstar Nana may appear cold but as shown in the series she is also a good person like Bimbo Nana who always wish for the best for their friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe meeting of this two characters is the best part in the series as it shows them having a deep friendship which experiences both the good and the bad.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I can say that every character in the series is believable and there is no moment that I felt like I'm watching anything superficial and boring.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThis genre isn't even what love and yet this is one of the best anime series I have ever watched and recommend this to anyone who likes drama and slice of life without the too much melodrama or forced melodrama that makes most of that genre unrealistic/superficial.",

I usually watch action or slice of life animes but this is the first time a drama really brought me in. \r\nOkay- everyone has to give this anime a chance (I know- I know the art is total s---).  \r\nThe characters are so realistic. They feel greedy, jealous, desperate and make some of the most awful decisions but that is what being young is. The characters are on there own for the first time in a big city and they haveto learn to make the best choices.\\n\\n\r\nI also have a really big soft spot for friendship between girls. It just makes me all soft and warm. I'm sick of shows (animes or not) showing girls will kill each other for a man (Ano hana). \\n\\n\r\nThough one of the major flaws of this show, isn't technically the story's fault. More so of writer being ill or something has really messed up the story. It just ends where we see one of the nanas finally seeing the detriments of fame while the other nana is facing the crisis of raising a child. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is good- fits the story- only problem is that even tho the title song is really good (makes lyrically no sense tho), they keep making Nana sing it again and again. They should have made like three-four songs that could have been signatures song for Black Stones and Rin's bands \\n\\n\\n\r\nI really wish they finished this story! I need to know what happens. I also wished they changed the art- its so bad on the eyes.",

It's a production that portraits the realities of life through two 20 year-old girls. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story was fascinating, the string of events were possible. It had everything passion, love, lust, heart breaks, friendships, unbreakable bonds... I loved how everything would was like different pieces of puzzles but when you put them together, they fit and the picture was beautiful. The relationships between the characters were somewhat predictable, enough for you to make a guess based on fact but still have some major doubts. \r\nArt:\r\nThe backgrounds were alwaysamazing, as for the characters; Yasu's (Baldie) glasses were always kinda weird looking - all the girls had huge foreheads and really small bangs and the shins were always so pointy. But the shading and the expressions were always amazingly demonstrated. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNana's character is one that is very very strong and self-confident. I love the fact that during the anime, they would tell us what she was thinking because that proved that no one can always be 100% about everything. \\n\r\nHachiko was a girl who, let's face it, is a portrait of the girls these days; fall in love with all good looking people until someone shatters the illusion that because you're handsome, doesn't mean you're a good guy. Throughout the anime, she grows more and more mature but not in a hasty way. All her actions were always justified. \\n\r\nYasu was a bald man who was very responsible, a little too responsible. He always carried everyone's burdens while trying to fix his own problems. Without him, there's no way that this anime would've been a success. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nA TOTAL MUST SEE FOR ANY GIRL. [Boys, be warned you may like it if you have a thing for love stories which i think is wayy awesome]",

Basically gives us what we want; a few charismatic characters and endearing, where the highlight of the whole show will be its relations and development that they lead, doing that in addition you encarines with the characters, become real, with situations drawn from real life although brought a little more to the end of a Soap Opera as if it were.\r\nstory:\r\nBasically the story begins with KotmasuNana who wants to go to Tokyo to be with her boyfriend and become self-supporting, and Osaki Nana where you want to go to Tokyo to become a professional music. For reasons of the destination are in the same station where you know and gives rise to the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf we look at it this way, it will look like a show already seen several times and in different ways, in addition, as if it were a soap opera, many romantic relationships with enough load melodramatic and humor.\\n\\n\r\nSo the question is not so much the originality, is how the story and more importantly their characters, you feel the happiness and sadness ,moves off the screen and you get straight to the heart,but making it so real that even though are up to deceived (Spoiler) to NANA (Spoiler) don't think about hate him, even, you come to understand because of the deception, not returning this issue of good (actors) and bad (those who go against this) but what it is; human differences and different views.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe main dish of Nana and especially the best anime I do not want to say how much i like Ren or Yasu, or as I would like to be there to teach something to shin for that will not be by bad roads.\\n\\n\r\nOnly I will tell you that you will see a continuous progression of the characters, their interaction between them, how they are going to win affection, how they spend the most great lovers to people who they are is spectacular and realistic, you reflejaras in a few of them. And more importantly, in addition to its virtues, you will see that the human; its defects.\\n\\n\r\nAudio:\\n\\n\r\nThe Audio is very good, the themes of Opening i loved above all the 1 , but they all have their touch, and of the ending i don't know what to say all are spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe design of art is a little difficult, though unlike her cousin (Paradise Kiss), where it takes to get used, here in the early episodes you get used to the designs of the character. Of the animation, I do not know what to say, were not bad but it was best, but in a series like this that is in fact the least important\\n\\n\r\nConclusi\u00f3n:\\n\\n\r\nI already said it the best Josei Toda that exists and one of my favorite animes of all life. Do you have errors? Yes, sometimes the humor gets where they don't call, even with the realistic of the characters I'm surprised the promiscuous that are (Spoiler) as well who is not pregnant (Spoiler) , a little the contradiction of the characters wanting to be independent with others but in the end they end up being more dependent with the person or group among several others.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, nana is not a perfect anime or much less, but it is a very well written where it shows all the characters that appear a more than decent, and when you see this series you will notice that you will come, though some more than others, to the heart, sincerely the best anime and I'm looking forward to its second season.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------Espa\u00f1ol ------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u201cNana , siempre estar\u00e1s en mi coraz\u00f3n\u201d\\n\\n\r\nEstamos ante uno de los mejores (sino el mejor) Josei de la historia del anime y uno de los mas aclamados animes de la historia, \u00bfPor qu\u00e9?  B\u00e1sicamente nos da lo que mas queremos; unos personajes carism\u00e1ticos y entra\u00f1ables, donde el plato fuerte de todo el Show ser\u00e1n sus relaciones y el desarrollo que estos llevan, haciendo que adem\u00e1s que te encari\u00f1es con los personajes, se vuelvan reales, con situaciones sacadas de la vida real aunque llevados un poco m\u00e1s al extremo como si de una Telenovela se tratase.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria:\\n\\n\r\nB\u00e1sicamente la historia comienza con Kotmasu Nana que quiere ir a Tokio para poder con su novio e independizarse y Osaki Nana donde quiere ir a Tokio a volverse una m\u00fasica Profesional. Por razones del destino ellas se encuentran en el mismo Tren donde se conocen y da a pie a la historia.\\n\\n\r\nSi lo vemos de esta manera, parecer\u00e1 un espect\u00e1culo ya visto varias veces y de diferentes maneras, adem\u00e1s, como si de una Telenovela se tratase, muchas relaciones rom\u00e1nticas con bastante carga melodram\u00e1tica y humor.\\n\\n\r\nAs\u00ed que la cuesti\u00f3n no es tanto la originalidad, es como cuenta la historia y m\u00e1s importante a\u00fan sus personajes, lo sientes de verdad la felicidad y la tristeza ,traspasa fuera de la pantalla y te llega directo al coraz\u00f3n, pero haci\u00e9ndolo tan real que aunque hallan hasta enga\u00f1ado (Spoiler) a NANA (Spoiler) no piensas en  odiarlo, incluso, llegas a entender el Porqu\u00e9 del enga\u00f1o, no volviendo esta cuesti\u00f3n de buenos (protagonistas) y malos (los que van en contra de esta) sino lo que es; humanos con diferencias y opiniones distintas.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes:\\n\\n\r\nEl plato fuerte de Nana y especialmente lo mejor que tiene el Anime no quiero alargarme diciendo lo mucho que me gusta Ren o Yasu, o como quisiera estar hay para ense\u00f1arle algo a Shin para que no se vaya por malos caminos.\\n\\n\r\nSolo te dir\u00e9 que veras una progresi\u00f3n continua de los personajes, su interacci\u00f3n entre ellos, como van ganando afecto, como pasan ser de los mas grandes amantes a personas que ni se ven es espectacular y realista, te reflejaras en unos de ellos. Y lo m\u00e1s importante a\u00fan, adem\u00e1s de sus virtudes, veras los que los hace humanos; sus defectos.\\n\\n\r\nAudio:\\n\\n\r\n El Audio es muy bueno, los temas de Opening me encantaron sobre todo el 1 , pero todos tienen su toque, y de los Ending no se que decir todos son espectaculares.\\n\r\nArte:\\n\\n\r\nEl dise\u00f1o de arte es un poco dif\u00edcil, aunque a diferencia de su prima (Paradise Kiss), donde tardas en acostumbrarte, aqu\u00ed en los primeros episodios te acostumbraras a los dise\u00f1os del personaje. De la animaci\u00f3n, no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 decir, no estuvieron mal pero tampoco fue lo mejor, pero en una serie como esta eso es en verdad lo menos importante\\n\\n\r\nConclusi\u00f3n:\\n\\n\r\nYa lo dije el mejor Josei que existe y uno de mis animes favoritos de toda la vida. \u00bfTiene errores? Si, a veces el humor se mete donde no lo llaman, aun con los realistas de los personajes me sorprende los promiscuos que son (Spoiler) as\u00ed quien no sale embaraza (Spoiler) , se nota  un poco la contradicci\u00f3n de los personajes queriendo ser independientes  con los dem\u00e1s pero al final terminan siendo mas dependientes con la persona o el grupo entre varias otras.\\n\\n\r\nEn fin, nana no es un Anime perfecto ni mucho menos, pero es uno muy bien escrito donde muestra a todos los personajes que aparecen un desarrollo m\u00e1s que decente y, cuando veas esta serie notaras que te llegara, aunque alguno mas que otros, al coraz\u00f3n, sinceramente lo mejor que tiene el anime y espero con Ansias su segunda temporada.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Most series fail to build realistic flaws in characters outside of quirky personality traits or the general bully or evil type. Nana instead made the characters feel like real beings.\r\nWhile the actually romance stories, drama, and all the other aspects of the plot and production were fairly well done, it was the exploring these dysfunctions and the social dynamics they spurred that let Nana shine. I have never seen another show do it better. \r\nNana is weird in that I've seenmost of all of the high to decently rated romance anime (and some not so highy rated ones) and it was completely different than all of them. It really has it's own pace, so it's a great pickup if you want something original",

No matter how much i like anything else, i always compare it to this\r\n freaking show. WHY? The most basic answer i can give you is the characters are \r\nrelatable even the ones you hate. (yes even Takumi) They don't leave anyone's \r\ndirty laundry untouched, and everyone's a bit vulnerable which i enjoyed more then\r\n I'd like to admit. It shows the hardships in life, in a way thatwasn't\\n\\n\r\n cruel but was sort of uplifting, again i know it's odd. My favorite part about \\n\\n\r\nthe show is definitely going to have to be how the character development \\n\\n\r\nwas done it felt like they \"developed\" even when they didn't because \\n\\n\r\nwhenever you thought you knew a character you would always get psyched\\n\\n\r\n out and find out some-more bullshit. Finally I'd like to say after watching\\n\\n\r\n countless other anime, that they do adult topics like sex better then any \\n\\n\r\nother anime I've ever seen, it was basically not concerned with fan-service at \\n\\n\r\nall. However most of the main characters are rock stars, do you think there \\n\\n\r\nwas no sex.",

            "content": "\"Friendship is the most necessary thing for life, since no one wants to live without friends even if he had all other goods.\" -Aristotle\r\nIn my opinion, Nana is not about romance. It's about friendship. However, it paints a darker and more realistic picture of friendship, and how things like perceptions of success and heroism infiltrate the fortress of friendship and tear it down. \r\nAs I go through life, I find it more and more dull, and I can't help but think this is due to a lack of close friends. Sure, I got peers in college I can talk to, but I wouldn't consider themclose. I can't help but feel over-zealous parents with overly high expectations of seeing their son become the next nobel prize winner or becoming a rich doctor has ruined any success of true friendship budding. Thanks to these high expectations, most of my peers from high school are now scattered in different colleges, and most were not that close to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nThis is why I find Nana so fascinating, in that it shows how human relationships in modern day times are so fragile and filled with pretense. It is overwhelmingly difficult for two humans to accept each other for their most basic flaws. \\n\\n\r\nI will mainly talk about the two Nana's in this review, and how their relationship was flawed from the start. In this sense, this review is more analytical, but I would not really say there are spoilers since the show is mainly theme driven and not plot driven.\\n\\n\r\nRight at the get-go Nana Osaki is a hero in Nana Komatsu's eyes. Nana Komatsu, on the other hand, is just a naive, love-struck dependent country girl to Nana Osaki's eyes. Osaki even names the other Nana Hachi with the dual purpose of easily distinguishing between the two in conversation, and deeper meaning of having a hidden possessive personality, because Hachi references a popular dog, and dogs symbolize ownership over a living creature.\\n\\n\r\nNana Osaki is one of the most fascinating characters I've seen in an anime. She has hints of BPD, as referenced in being possessive of Hachi, as well as antisocial tendencies, as shown with her withdrawn social life in highschool. Mental disorders aside, there is much more to a character, and this involves relationships with other people. \\n\\n\r\nNana and Hachi can hold a conversation with ease, and hardly get on each other's nerves. There were plenty of times in the show I thought Nana would be mad at Hachi, but never did this happen. When it is just Nana and Hachi in the picture, the two are inseparable. Obligations to jobs and other people are where disagreements begin to arise. The two friends have to choose between their boyfriends and each other in both sharing living space and spending free time, and it's fascinating to see how a friend can become almost like a lover, even stronger in some sense, as to pull apart a romantic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I do not think Nana Osaki is being completely genuine about her true self. She does not talk much to Hachi about her life, and seems to carry an aura of independence and self-reassurance. Deep down, however, she is conflicted and insecure, which I believe is true for almost everyone. Because of her band, Nana Osaki acts like she does not need Hachi, and this is the fundamental flaw in their friendship. Im sure Hachi would be fully accepting of any flaws Nana reveals about herself, but she is just too proud and determined to find success for her band to commit to a friendship that deep.\\n\\n\r\nNana's relationship with her boyfriend Ren, is also interesting. Ren wears a persona of Sid from \"Sid and Nancy\", and seems to treat Nana with the same kind of possessiveness as Nana treats Hachi. The punk rock motif they flaunt about is also in reference to political-reactionary sub culture of youth groups who are fed up with economic stagnation. There is an article titled \"Friendship and Postmodern Utopianism\", and although I am not well-versed in the philosophical terminology and do not completely understand the article, I can't help but feel political unrest arises out of a culture that de-values friendship. It seems to suggest that friendship and utopianism values have an inverse relationship, as one goes up, the other goes down. I believe politics is the intermediate that people turn to in order to satiate friendship values while keeping utopian life-style, but this seems to be a very thin line that is unstable. \\n\\n\r\nThere are flaws to the show, the major being that it is incomplete. There are scenes in the manga that did not make it in the show, and even the manga is not fully finished. I still believe it to be worth watching though. Hachi's character can also feel very annoying, and she can be pretty whiny sometimes. But I believe her crying is genuine in that she truly feels sorry for Nana Osaki, and is crying out of shame for the feeling of betraying her friendship. Otherwise, her whining is just played for comedic effect, and most of the comedy is hit-or-miss. I would have removed some of the comedy, but it's not a deal breaker. \\n\\n\r\nI have to lastly mention the retrospective approach to storytelling the anime employs at the end of each episode, as if the events in the anime are just memories they are both reminiscing over. I'm not sure if this is used in the manga, so if someone could tell me that would be cool. In any case, what the anime does at the end of each episode is highly cathartic and melancholic, and gives off a feeling of nostalgia. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Nana, and hope for it to be complete one day. If it was complete, there would be no doubts that I would give it a 10, and may be my favorite anime of all time. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A real drama story told how its supposed to showing that these days anime has alot to work on would be my first thought when thinkning on this anime after watching it. \r\nThe story is great in many regards beginning with the meeting between the Nanas as being both interesting and having its own comedy if you want around it which is good for a too serious anime tends to get tiring. As you go through the anime alot of it feel real although sometimes the plot might annoy you or the melodrama goes 2 notches too high. I would say to give the storysome time to grow on you when it comes to this anime and you will have to watch more than one to get the bigger picture i feel but still its well made up. It shows that they dont rush things in it that they shouldnt rush and it feels as if the story flows in a natural pace. \\n\\n\r\nIm a general fan of classical rock music and although this is punk its also close to what some might call real music. I dont think any of the music or songs played in this anime are good since they feel natural as you watch the anime in itself. \\n\\n\r\nIf i had to go through every character that made an impression i would bore people reading this so i will give you the 2 mains and let the rest just come as one watches this. \\n\r\nNana Osaki is what one might call a typical punk girl / tomboy with a funny and interesting personality. She is the type you feel with and laugh at when she is herself and she feels very natural. She is nice when her friends needs it but she is harsh when they need to get it through their thick heads.\\n\r\nNana Komatsu is a promescius happy go lucky woman with a naive yet kind personality although she is also self centered so when something happens to her it goes down the path of melodrama and despair which tends to get annoying as it isnt an unusual thing. \\n\\n\r\nIts one of the few anime recently there i have thought this is a really good anime although there are things that can get one tired from seeing on repeat. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i was unsure wether to put this on 8-9 or even 10 but i felt it didnt give the feeling of being a 10 and it had too many good points to be 8 so 9 it was. I liked the realness of the story and the characters in it since they combined the seriousness with some comedy at great places. What i would say that i disliked was the lack of progresson i felt sometimes and also the mega melodrama that i felt this anime reeked of at times.",

            "content": "I know I'm coming to this anime quite late (given that it's 2017), but I'm glad that I finally took the time to watch it. Nana is a wonderful story about life, love, and regret. It's one of those stories where the characters just grab you and won't let go. It was an emotional roller coaster and as bittersweet as it might be to feel sad when the final episode winds down, I just love finding stories that can hit me that hard.\r\nSTORY - 10/10\r\nNana has a rather simple premise. Two girls named Nana meet each other, move in as roommates, and go about theirnew lives in Tokyo. One Nana is a little boy crazy and is trying to find love and acceptance. The other Nana is an aspiring rock star and is pursuing her dream with her band. \\n\\n\r\nBut there's nothing simple about the intricate weave of relationships and troubles that find the two girls and the supporting characters in their orbit. Watching all of the interactions play out is a wonderful journey. I can see how some people might find it a bit slow-paced. It's definitely something of a slow boil at times, but the payoffs are always worth it. The growing relationship between the two Nanas, in particular, is sweet and genuine and extremely realistic. The characters in this show feel like real people making real decisions in the face of real problems. There's not always a happy ending. And there's not always a bad ending. Sometimes people just endure and survive and make the best choices they can in the moment and have to live with those choices.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a pretty significant event that occurs about two-thirds of the way through the plot and pretty dramatically shifts the tone of the story and those relationships. Again, I can see how this might turn some viewers off, but it's incredibly intense to watch the momentum build towards the end of the story. And it's an absolute shame that the author took ill and was never able to create a proper conclusion. Here's hoping we might get some more of this wonderful story someday.\\n\\n\r\nART - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing particularly special about the art. I'm not always up on all the different studios in the animation business, but I found the character models to be very reminiscent of Code Geass - really, really skinny people, with kind of long faces. But I tend to get used to different art styles within a few episodes. The art here is solid, and it plays well with the emotional tones of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the two bands play such a significant role in the story, there are some pretty good original songs in the soundtrack. I just wished there were maybe a few more. Blast really only had two songs in their repertoire. I watched the dub, and thought the voice acting was strong. The two main leads, in particular, were both very well cast.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character work is the true strength of this show. Nothing about the many characters feels forced. They seem like real people - young twenty-somethings trying to figure out life. Sometimes they make good decisions, sometimes they make bad decisions. Sometimes they're happy, sometimes they're sad, and sometimes they just do what they need to do to get by.\\n\\n\r\nA major theme seems to be a recognition of their mistakes, and a longing regret, yet an inability to actually figure out what to do about it. Each episode opens and closes with one of the two Nanas narrating, looking back from an undisclosed point in the future, and you can really feel the regret in their voices when they talk about their memories. Both Nanas are incredibly nuanced and deep characters. There are times when I felt exasperated with both, wishing they would make the right choice, feeling pain as they make a mistake, or feeling pure joy as something good happens. That whirlwind of emotions really shows just how deep the characters are.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every one of the significant supporting characters feels just as real and fleshed out, from Nobu to Shin to Yasu to Ren. Even Shoji and Jun and Kyosuke have great appeal. And even an asshole like Takumi has his place and works perfectly within the context of the story. There's really almost nothing bad I can say about the writing of the characters in this show, it's as close to flawless as I've seen in an anime yet. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI can honestly say that I enjoyed nearly every second of this anime. Even in the moments where I was disappointed in a character's choice, or worried that something was about to go wrong, the sheer power of the emotions I felt while watching was a bit of a surprise. There are only a handful of shows (anime or otherwise) that have spurred such a response in me. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI think my average rating on this site is in the high 7s. Some people might find that a bit high, but I don't like to score below a 5. If I watch a show through to completion, then there had to have been enough in there to sustain my attention, and that's worth at least a 5 to me. And if I drop a show, I don't rate it - I don't consider it to be fair to rate something that I wasn't willing to watch all of. So that tends to drive my average up a bit. All of that to say that while my average is high, I still tend to be fairly judicious about giving something a 10. I'll give 8s and 9s pretty regularly, but a 10 is still a special rating reserved for shows that had a powerful impact on me. It has to be more than something I just enjoyed, it has to really move me.\\n\\n\r\nNana has everything that I could ask for in a story. A solid plot that forms the foundation for exceptional character work. An emotional punch that escalates as the show progresses. I felt genuine happiness and sadness as I watched. My only disappointment (as is pretty common with many anime) is the lack of a conclusive ending, and I'm willing to look past that with the hope that someday the author will finally be able to return to finish the story (as a side note, they did a pretty clever job with the final episode of the anime as a way to provide some open-ended semi-closure to the story).\\n\\n",

            "content": "I stumbled across this anime as I was browsing the top anime list on this site.  Having not seen this anime before, I checked out the the brief description and decided to pass it up.\r\nI put this anime off for quite awhile, as I wasn't terribly excited about the story.  I assumed this would be a rather typical contrived romance about a \"rock star\".  I decided that I'd watch it one day, when I had little to do. \r\nWell, that day came.  It has been pouring rain here in Ohio for the past month.  Bored, and out of good booksto read, I clicked on Netflix and decided to give NANA a shot. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I was blown away. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, before I begin, let me give you my demographic.  I am a woman in my late twenties.  I studied liberal arts in school, and therefore fond of most art mediums (including anime obviously).  I am open to every genre and approach each work with an open mind. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I am sure you can understand why I was a bit hesitant to watch this anime right away.  I am an older anime viewer.  I like deep story lines, with layers of artistic meaning.  (ex. Full Metal Panic, Blood +, Death Note, Fruits Basket etc.) So I assumed NANA would be a very formula driven romance anime; something to kill time and little else. \\n\\n\r\nBoy was I wrong.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom the moment it began, I was hooked.  I watched the entire 47 episodes in one day.  The artistic elements layered brilliantly. Between the narration, use of music, tone, and setting it is easy to become overwhelmed.  It was like watching Sunset Blvd or the Wizard of Oz with a critical eye. Layers of meaning hidden within.\\n\\n\r\nIf NANA does have any weaknesses, perhaps the one solid gripe could be some of the animation.  Some of the characters are drawn very alike with a different hair style.  But overall, the animation is of very good quality. \\n\\n\r\nThe only true flaw, however, would be the ending episodes. The pacing was excellent throughout the series, until the end. The last few episodes feel rushed.  Perhaps they ran out of funds, or were planning another season.  Whatever the reason, the series should have had a few more episodes. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, NANA is universal.  It tackles mature subjects and examines self-nature, and the human experience.  It challenges the viewer, and encourages them to look into their own nature.  NANA is not just for women, but men as well.  The situations are characterizations are so realistic, you can't help but question yourself. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Komatsu 'Hachi' Nana is on her way to live with her boyfriend Shouji, while Osaki Nana is trying to make it big with her band. The girls are rather different despite having the same name and being the same age. Nana is the cool, punk rocker that everybody looks at with jealousy, while Hachi is the adorable and clingy 'girl next door.'\r\nNANA tells the story of love and all the things that come with it, itpulls at your heartstrings and makes you genuinely feel bad for the characters when they are at their lowest.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about NANA would be the characters. They're all very believable and well developed, they drag you along for the ride of their joys and pains. You laugh and cry with them. Even, the side characters are more than just the people in the background. They all have unique personalities and dreams that make them feel so life-like.\\n\r\nHowever, at times I felt it hard to like Hachi. She can be annoying and sometimes you just wanna slap her and tell her to grow up.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is beyond words. The opening themes are beautifully animated and get you just in the right mood for the anime. The ending theme animations are rather boring to watch, but the songs are all beautiful and they seem to get more depressing as the anime progresses.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the relationships, NANA knows just how to portray them realistically. The love triangle between Nobu, Takumi and Hachi made me cry buckets. The relationship that Nana and Ren have in this anime was beautiful, and knew just how to make you cry when something went wrong between them. Again, this is all due to the characters being so likeable. You wanted everyone to be happy. \\n\r\nAnd of course the best relationship was between Hachi and Nana. Their friendship was more than beautiful, it was true friendship and even though it could be heartbreaking at times to watch them drift apart, they always would find each other and reconcile. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I simply enjoyed NANA. I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to watch a realistic romance anime with beautiful music, great characters and nice, simplistic art.",

As opposed to soo many other anime romances I've seen, this is the only one that really makes me say: \"Hey that has happened to me before.\" I found myself engrossed in the lives of the characters. Rooting for them when they were down, yelling at certain characters because they were being an arse, crying whenthey cried. (I know sappy, right?) If you haven't picked up this series for whatever reason you should put away preconceived notions and at least give a try.

            "content": "One of the best things about anime and what sets it apart from other mediums of entertainment is the sheer amount of creative freedom you can have with any particular show. No matter how ridiculous or impossible a premise may be, anime can achieve it. However, does anime work the other way around? Despite it being animated as opposed to having actors (excluding voice actors, of course), can an anime that is so deeply rooted into reality as we know it still work just as well? All it takes is one word to answer this. Nana.\r\nIn a broad sense, all Nana really is is twogirls living their lives in Tokyo (circa 1998-2001 or so). What makes this show really worth it's fairly long runtime is the great characters, their interactions with one another, how they react to said interactions, etc. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime really knows how to make use of it's 47 episodes. The first 5 or so episodes focuses mainly on the two main leads, Nana Komatsu (or Hachi as she is referred to in the anime), and Nana Osaki and their backstories (this is one of my favourite parts of the anime btw, as it indirectly shows the key differences and similarities between the two using only their individual, unrelated backstories alone, which I thought was brilliant). As time goes on, more and more characters are introduced, and around the 3/4 mark, it almost turns into an ensemble cast. The focus is still on Hachi and Osaki primarly, but this structure leads to having this decently sized cast of characters to all feel like real people.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, the greatest quality of this anime is how real the characters feel. Each main character has so many different quirks, different ways of adapting to situations, etc. that it not only makes it feel like this show could have actually existed as a real life story, but it makes you feel like you are there, living this experience with them. You feel happiness when a character is happy, and you feel sad when a character is sad. There were points where the drama got so deep that it was hard for me to continue to the next episode. This is a testament not to how melodramatic the anime is, because if anything, even though the drama is heavy, it never feels out of place because of the raw emotion these characters bring. It's a testament to how much the story impacted me on an emotional level that it became to much for me personally to handle. I just want to emphasize that this isn't a negative on the shows part at all, it's just my own personal take on it.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to take time discussing these characters as it would take forever to talk about them because of how multilayered they are. Also, and I know I say this a lot, but it's best to really experience these characters for yourself to have your own take on everything.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there is so much good stuff going on with these characters and these ingeniously crafted situations they are put into, as far as I can tell, it isn't an incredibly deep and and profound story. Yes, there are overarching themes throughout Nana, the biggest one being the theme of regret. This once again isn't necessarily a bad thing, just don't go into it thinking you going to get something like Serial Experiments Lain or Evangelion or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing I would like to mention story-wise is the rather copious amounts of inner monologuing by our two main leads. This is the only thing that could be counted as a negative in my opinion. It does lead to some much needed insight into these two characters are thinking and their take on any given situation, but sometimes it just gets too, dare I say, pretentious with some of it that it sometimes doesn't even feel like these two characters are thinking these things. Not to say these characters are stupid (although you may come to the conclusion that one of them is), but it just felt out of character when some of these lines came up on the screen. This isn't anything that really takes away from an overall amazing experience just because of how great everything else is, but this is a review after all, so it can't be all praise. :P\\n\\n\r\nNana's artstyle succeeds in giving a very grounded feel to everything. If an anime that was trying to be very realistic had some moe or something in it, it would totally ruin the tone of the anime. I'd call the character designs an improved version of the CLAMP style of designs. They really are great. The facial expressions are of note too, as those can be very fundamental to giving some much needed information about a character, and the animators handled them well. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack didn't do too much for me, so that's all I'll say about it. The OP's and ED's fared much better though. The voice acting was also top caliber, especially with Romi Park's take on Nana Osaki. \\n\\n\r\nNana really is something all anime fans should watch at some point or another. While it might not be 2deep4u, you won't get this amount of raw emotion anywhere else in anime. Like I mentioned before, I didn't talk about specifics regarding characters, nor their goals, personal strifes, etc. as I want you all to experience those for yourself. Just let it be known that all of it, from Hachi's struggle with relationships to the struggles of BLAST and their relationship with Trapnest, of whom they have close (and not so close) ties is all brilliant works of storytelling.",

            "content": "I heard so many things about how painfully realistic this anime was which made me hesitant about watching it because entertainment is supposed to be a refuge from reality not something that makes you go head-to-head with it. Regardless, I ended up watching all 47 episodes of Nana, and what can I say? It was amazing and I have no regrets. Shows like this are valuable because they portray romantic relationships and friendships for what they really are (hint: not all sunshine and roses).\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nNana doesn\u2019t really have a storyline to speak of, it simply follows the lives of two young women: NanaKomatsu and Nana Osaki. The two women lead vastly different lifestyles but end up befriending each other on a train. The story essentially explores the difficulties of being an adult in modern society\u2014more specifically being a happy adult in modern society. There\u2019s a lot of foreshadowing and ominous moments throughout the series. The narration makes it all the more dramatic. A lot of people complained about how the ending was a cliff hanger but I preferred it that way because it gave the audience a chance to imagine an epilogue for themselves (and the ending was heart-warming). \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\r\nThis anime is somewhat \u201cold\u201d (2006) so the art isn\u2019t exactly breath-taking. However, the character designs are impeccable and really suit each character. The dark hues that are present in pretty much every scene set the mood for the bitter-sweet happenings that occur throughout the show and they also do well to place the focus on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI fell in love with the OST of Nana long before I watched the actual anime. This show does have a Music tag so I suppose that\u2019s to be expected. The lyrics of the songs contain so much depth and even if you listened to them without understanding a single word, you would still be moved. The seiyuu did a great job voicing these characters, honestly, I can\u2019t imagine them sounding any other way. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe essence of Nana is in its characters. The character development that occurs throughout the show is bound to have you wiping away tears saying, \u201cAwh, look at my baby all grown up.\u201d Each and every character in this anime possesses a unique personality and they\u2019re all lovable. Well, except Takumi (but he\u2019s hot so we\u2019ll cut him some slack). There weren\u2019t any \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d characters. I\u2019d say that you could apply the concept of yin yang to pretty much all the characters since sometimes you would want to coddle them and at other times you would want to violently shake them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI have so much appreciation for Nana and it\u2019s definitely one of my favourites. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d but it\u2019s full of comic and heart-warming moments. I would definitely watch this anime again and I 100% recommend it\u2014especially if you\u2019re on the verge of entering the adult world and you\u2019re already starting to get sick of this individualistic society where bonding with people seems so difficult. \\n\\n",

And I'm, as a young man, not afraid of writing a small comprehensive review about anime that theoretically belongs to those for girls and young ladies. The story seems to be very simple at the beggining and more than a casual life of teenagers, but as plot goes ahead, the events become more and more dramatic. AND THIS SI INCREDIBLE!!! I felt sometimes broken, sometimes very sad, but I guess it is the drama of everyday-life and and it's a gift to make us discover sooooo deeep feelings inside. During the whole series i felt down at least 6589824622 times and as Iwrite in my reviews every time - MUSIC IS A KEY!!! Thanks for soundtracks, one more GIANT  thanks for the 1st opening and for those characters and fates!! I would love to watch it again and again because story is always actual nowadays! Good luuuuck!!!",

            "content": "Nana is a contender for best show in it's respective genre which honestly doesn't say much\r\nThe majority of romance anime have always been incredibly generic and if you have seen 1 you have seen them all . Perfect examples are guy being swarmed by 8 girls or tough distant pretty boy falls for the shy clumsy girl over and over and over and over again . No variation whatsover\r\nNana while definitely not perfect tries to change that by adding psychological elements and often having the show's characters BS called out on\r\nNana is about two girls with the same name but completely different personalities and backgroundsbecoming soul sisters and the show splits evenly between the two as they face certain dilemmas about who they are , what have they done and where do they want to end up \\n\\n\r\nThe best aspect of the show is that Nana and Hachi are FAR from perfect and there will comes times where  you will not feel sorry for them in the traditional way especially in Hachi's case but why is that? Let me explain\\n\\n\r\nNana no.1 otherwise called Hachi is a cute , clumsy and sometimes kindhearted person but she is also cunning , promiscuous, vain , selfish and immature . Her biggest complex is that she wants to find a purpose in life and she believes that she can find that purpose only when she is with a guy that showers her with money and attention . The show calls her out on her BS many times but it can get pretty inconsistent as in one episode she is branded as a sociopath and the next as a tragic heroine \\n\\n\r\nNana no.2 is a aspring punk musician with dreams of making it to the top no matter what believing money to be the most important thing in life . She has abandonment issues because people she loved ever since she was a child abandoned her thus she shows signs of being unhealthily possesive/obsessive often having panic attacks from her fears . As the show goes on it is established more and more that her demeanour is a facade originating from her insecurities\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast get a lot of sceentime as well and they are the exact same way with all of them having insecurities and downright psychotic tendencies especially when it comes to Takumi . \\n\\n\r\nThere are many problems with Nana and sometimes it comes off as the anime version of shows like the Bold and the Beautiful where people use other people as crutches one too may times because they can't be with the one they want but the biggest one is ....It's unfinished \\n\\n\r\nYou see both Nana's have monologues where they talk about eachother and the world around them but it's obvious that they are talking at least 10 years after the events of the anime which would justify their bond and how they feel about eachother but we never get to see that ...Plot points are left unfinished and overall the anime goes absolutely nowhere and the characters haven't grown one bit by the time you are done watching ....\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for this is that the manga has been on hiatus since 2009 and while a lot of interesting things happened in the books we will probably never see it on film ...The unfortunate part is that from the little I've seen that's where the majority of the character development happens (Especially for Punk Nana)\\n\\n\r\nAs this review has gone long enough let me say that the artwork is unique and beautiful and the voice acting is really good but I wasn't a huge fan of the soundtrack to be honest ...\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was an enjoyable experience despite some shortcomings\\n\\n\r\n7/10 (Good) :)",

The only thing that kept distracting me was the teardrop in the middle of the head, it was the same tone as the shading on the face.\u00a0 They also used a lot of stress lines. \r\nStory: was actually very well made. When I started it I thought it would just be one of those anime that wouldn't have anything special about it. I was wrong. It actually made me feel really sorry for the characters.I found myself having to stop watching many times because my heart kept getting really tight. I was screaming at the TV a lot while watching. At night I find myself thinking about the anime instead of sleeping. It's not as sad as Clannad, but a different type of sadness you feel when you know the pain the person is going through. I thought that the end wrapped up the story very nicely, it made the pain in my chest to turn to happiness.\\n\r\nMusic: was very well done. I thought at sometimes the music didn't quite fit, but at other times it fit perfectly. I loved the openings and endings so much I made them ringtones for my phone. I thought that one of the ost sounded like old porn music.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I couldn't understand. What was with episode 6? It was the exact same as the first one. I mean a recap episode is fine and all, but at least add something to it and not just have the same episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this anime was very good and will give it a 9 and would recommend it to people who likes sweet-sour love stories.\\n\\n\r\nI REALLY LOVED NOBU.",

            "content": "---Nana is an outstanding anime. It has it's flaws and low points, it's definitely not perfect but boy, it is fantastic. ---\r\nIf you watched series that focuses on relationships of high school students or idk, middle school you're going to feel a bit annoyed and that cringe in some episodes because of the actions of the characters at least it happened to me. I love romance animes but they end up annoying me because it doesn't feel real and the characters are usually so predictable. After watching the same romance stories with predictable characters this is REFRESHING. \r\nThe characters are in their twenties or more,they are more mature and the actions actually are relatable. The romance is definitely there and do you know why I love the romance in this anime, it's because IT MOVES QUICKLY. This is not an anime where you wait 20 episodes for two characters to kiss or confess! (I'm looking at you Toradora, Kaichou wa Maid sama and your kind)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime focuses on Nana and Nana (aka Hachi) and their relationship and their relationships with other characters and it is a ride. It is not overly romanticised, it feels honest and genuine and they are not fairy tale like. It tackles real and serious topics like depression, addiction, violence, sex, figuring how to live alone, surviving in society, finding friends and keeping friends, finding a guy/girl to love and cherish, jealousy everything you can imagine and they are the issues of our days still and it is still %100 relevant. This is not your usual shoujo romance anime, this is the real shit.\\n\\n\r\nArt is not the best thing about this anime. I have no words about the character design because they are most definitely unique and true to their origin, the manga, I'm talking about the overall quality. This anime looks like it's from 1999 not 2006. It's from the same production company, Madhouse, and it's the same year as Death Note, Black Lagoon, Claymore and Monster and they are all great animes where the art is just outstanding but this falls short. I feel like they could've done so much better but good thing is it doesn't take anything from the actual story. Sound is amazing, I love the fashion and the characters, I love everything about it.\\n\\n\r\nI can't go into how amazingly built these characters are, everything do has a reason and they're connected to something inside. You know their characters, you feel like you know these characters they become your friends and you get so invested you have to talk about it with someone or else you are going to explode so you go on to a writing a long ass review about it. Nana is wonderful regarding characters. They have flaws they are not perfect and they are not who you want them to be. You will get angry at them and be disappointed but that is because they feel like they are real characters they are not perfect. No one is perfect in this world and that's why these characters are actually perfectly imperfect. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment is over the top, I love this anime. I love it more than I loved my other romance favourites like Clannad and Guilty Crown, this tops them easy and I don't think I'll get over this anime for a couple of weeks now, or more. \\n\\n\r\nI feel like everyone should watch this anime, you will get bored a bit at times and you will rage because of how stupid some actions of some characters are but it's worth it. So go download it or buy it, it's worth it and enjoy it. \\n",

I don't take too much time contemplating on them, because I know I'm too indecisive. \r\nThis anime was very dramatic. If it wanted to, it could be an extreme soap opera. A plus is that the music is pretty catchy, so head straight to gendou after you hear the theme songs! The band \"the Black Stones\" are cool to follow as the strive to become professional punk band and it's interesting to see Osaki Nana's side of the story. \r\nHowever there is always the other Nana, the one who constantly falls in love atevery turn. As the anime goes on her love troubles get obnoxious. On the other hand it teaches the lesson that love is always changing.\\n\\n\r\nAt the first glance the two Nanas look like they would not get along, but they prove to be foils to eachother. What brings these characters together is what really is fascinating and their relentless change of relationships. The strong bond that holds the characters together is intriguing to the viewer. When watching this anime one goes to love and hate certain individuals and feel compassionate toward them. The emotions that tie everyone together have a major impact on the story because of the inconsistent concept of love. \\n\\n\r\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;NOW. I will give you a breakdown of the story&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\\n\r\n Basically two girls move to Tokyo and try to acheive their goals. One wants to be  housewifte ( the whole white picket fence deal), The other a professional rockstar as the vocalist. Along the way they have too many love problems. The end. \\n\r\nThis is the simplified version. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was unclear, i wont spoil it, but it gave me a certain messege. If you're unsatisfed, think of a deeper meaning. I must warn you, you who may or may not be planning to watch this, this is no disney ending.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a whole lot of bad connotation here, but if you are considering.... watch it.",

Sorry.\r\nOverall: Watch this animeif you want something but not fighting animes with 229&ouml;1 episode.",

You let out a huge breath that you didn't even know you were holding, and you think, \"Damn.

There is a formula that most animes/manga follow when it comes to romance, but this one breaks the mold. The chracters are amazing and realistic.  You will love some, you will hate some, and you will feel so many emotions as you cheer for Nana and Hachi to find happiness.  These characters are very flawed and very human which makes them easy to identify with.   Iwould suggest that every girl watch Nana at least once.",

Maybe to others it was not a tear jerker, but some moments in the anime really reminded me of my own personal life. Not everyone has a rock star boyfriend, but I believe almost everyone has experienced heartbreak and felt lost at some point in their life, so it is an anime that is very relatable. I learned to love and care for the characters. At all times I found myself rooting for allthe characters, not just the main ones. I definitely had my \"OH NO,WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!?\" moments. I was extremely conflicted while watching this anime, it even made me question most of my love life decisions. Although it was it's serious moments, NANA is loaded with comedy. It has an older dated art style, but it really adds to the atmosphere of the anime. I recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy a great story and shed a couple of tears.",

It doesn't give you very much and if you want more, pick up on chapter 43 of the manga because the anime follows super close so you won't be missing out. I loved the anime though. It was so refreshing from most romance anime and i love to call it the \"Show of Ships\" because you can literally ship just about anyone on the show, though I am biased to two couples, NGL. I have already rewatched it and it just gets better. \r\nThe art style took some getting used to, but other than thatI really fell in love with Nana. The music is great and there are some good covers on YT. \\n\r\nI would recommend and if you think you won't like it because of the description or the promotional picture, if you give it a chance, it might surprise you. I stayed away from this anime for a long while because I thought it was going to be something totally different but what'd you know? So give it a chance if you're hesitant! It's really good!!",

First off let me say the nice things about this anime. \r\nGreat Characters, great development of the characters, great atmosphere.  Theres alot great about this anime.\r\nThe bad. HORRIBLE ENDING. through the whole series they use the moments at the beginning and the ending of the show to build up to this great reveal at the end. You spend the whole show guessing and re-guessing what the reveal could be. then the ending episode starts and you can see the reveal hinting around the edges and then creditsno more show no explanation and the last episode takes a turn to show that something has happened but fails to do anything with it.  credits role and all i can do is feel DAMNIT ANOTHER FUCKING ANIME THATS JUST A VEHICLE TO MAKE PEOPLE BY THE MANGA. WHY WHY CAN THE JAPANESE NEVER FINISH A STORY LINE!!!! \\n\\n\r\nso being that this turns out to just be a vehicle to make you read the manga i looked it continues and what they could have done with that last episode even not finishing the story would have been amazing but instead they squander 47 episodes worth of your life and will leave you feeling like you wasted your time. its LOST all over again.",

            "content": "It took me a long, LONG time to get around to watching this series. 47 episodes for a romance series I suppose made me hesitant... But once I started watching, I just couldn't stop. I laughed, cried, and felt angry at all the times the writers intended.\r\nStory: The story was amazing. Truth be told I started watching because I was hoping for girl x girl sort of romance, but that didn't seem to be the case. But, the romance found in this show was incredibly realistic and heavy, so if you're a romance fan, you're sure to cry.\r\nArt: As expected of Madhouse, the art isincredible. It's an old series, yet it still surpasses the art of most of the anime that comes out today.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I loved the music. Given that music is one of the main factors for this series, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the music - that which is sung by the bands, and the OST itself, is all very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I don't think I've ever seen an anime series with character complexity that rivals those in Nana. I got far more than I was expecting from this anime when it comes to character development and character complexity. Definitely one of the best. The friendship between Osaki Nana and Katsumi Nana is beautiful, and frustrating at the same time... But it's a very memorable friendship regardless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved this series. I laughed and I cried. Things didn't go the way I was hoping, but I suppose that's fine since this is probably one of the most realistic anime series I've ever seen. And romance doesn't always go the way you hope.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Honestly, I wanted to give this a 9/10 just out of spite due to things not going the way I wanted them to. I was so damn invested in the story that I even felt a bit stressed, hoping, PLEADING - for things to go the way I wanted... But they didn't. Still, this is easily one of the best anime series that exists, and it will ABSOLUTELY withstand the test of time. If for some reason you've contemplated watching Nana, but haven't brought yourself to do so... if you're reading this, then give it a shot. Just watch, and suddenly you'll blink \"It's over already?\" \\n\\n\r\nThat's just how good this is.",

They're all complex with different strengths weakness and flaws. All the characters have interesting backgrounds that explain why they are who they are and what made them the people they are in the present day. The portrayal of realistic relationships are so real. The show's energy is just raw andreal. It also deals with topics like sex, prostitution, codependency, unhealthy relationships, vulnerability, cheating, unrequited love, unplanned pregnancy, and happiness.

To be happy because deep down you see yourself in their image and you too yearn for happiness. For things to work out..",

Contained in 47 episodes (along with three recaps) is the joy of viewing something relatively old that still has an edge over recent series with regard to actual content.\r\nLike I said earlier, the start of this anime is slow and somewhat misleading. One thing is for surethough, every episode was worth it and has it's own purpose. I believe that this is one of the few shows that actually focus on character development and is still enjoyable. Unlike other anime shows, the beginning of this series introduces most of the characters, and tells us about their circumstances. Also, you can pretty much relate to the circumstances of one of the main characters, despite the fact that it is highly unlikely to happen in our lives.\\n\r\nCharacter designs are acceptable, considering that the most of the main cast belong to a band and that this is a shoujo anime. However, their personalities can be questionable and very annoying at times, so you should keep that in mind. It's very difficult to understand the characters' thought process, so be prepared to get infuriated at least once in almost all episodes.\\n\r\nThe difficult thing to swallow is the artwork, because, aside from the fact that this has been released earlier, this series is basically a shoujo/josei anime, which explains the difference in art. With that being said, other than the characters, the art is similar to those in mainstream (usual) shows. So that's less one thing to worry about.\\n\r\nI kind of liked the sound aspect of this show, but I can't say that I loved it. More or less it's pretty normal except for the actual singing and \u201cengrish\u201d (English in a Japanese accent)\u2014nothing noteworthy in particular.\\n\r\nI had fun watching the goofy moments; I almost had tears in the sad moments. As soon as the plot and pacing went up a notch, I didn't want to stop watching as I was looking forward to the next episode. The plot may not seem plausible in real life, but the interpersonal relationships of these characters seem quite realistic. \\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\nStory 8/10 (3.2)\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10 (2)\\n\r\nArt 7/10 (1.4)\\n\r\nSound 7/10 (1.05)\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 7.65/10 ~> 8\\n\r\nDefinitely worth the watch if you're looking for drama, but it's a no-go if you're looking for great music. Just keep in mind that this is a gloomy anime especially when each episode ends!",

I would love for Ai Yazawa to give us more of the story so that we could look forward to more episodes of this anime. If I compared to the manga, then the anime would be better because the ending seems more final and you do not expect anything else. Another highlight of this anime is the fashion, it was so edgy and cool and you can not help but want to copy.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nFor starters (...) . In my list under \"more\" with some spoilers are some extra personal comments/rage/rant/NSFW/swearing I had for this Anime.\r\n\u2726Story\r\nAlmost impossible to tell anything without spoiling, but to keep it short. It's a drama/romance story that absolutely infuriated me. Might be \"punk rock\" stereotype, but basically world is full of alcohol, drugs, casual relationships and casual sex, cheating and all sort sort elements that just absolutely made me rage. As I really despise such stuff and really consider intimacy and love much more sacred thanmost people in this world. In short, concept of love/sex/marriage etc. is ruined thing  IRL. I'm a \"vanilla\" lover.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow.. aside contents that truly infuriated and depressed me, the story of this Anime had actual progression, growth and development. Which was really nice and probably 1 of the main reasons I couldn't drop nor really rate it bad. Also the method of conveying emotions was also quite strong. Aside anger it still made me emotional even though in lot of cases I had thoughts like \"you don't have rights to use word love or claiming or feeling hurtful.\" But that is mostly aimed for the Nana (not the punk Nana)\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to say. is that story as structure is pretty good, but the contents were absolutely dreadful. The very \"western\" and nicely said \"loose\" culture was quite disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nShould add, that I felt the way it was \"wrapped up\" quite underwhelming, more as it felt it was simply paused and maybe even rushed. But even if manga goes on, I will most definitely not ever go near it.. this experience was enough for me.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nFor its time the art was pretty good. Oddly stickman figured but had unique trait to it. Lot of bondage and chains although, but yeah. Punk in a nutshell.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music compartment. The bands music sucked (not fond of it). The OST had quite some memorable tracks. And I did quite love the ending songs.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nA lot of frustration, most will be under \"more\" of animelist entry. As mentioned before, the character drama, growth and development had actual strong presence. Lot of strong emotions were also delivered. But honest being told, I almost hated every possible character. If not hated, they they really infuriated me.\\n\\n\r\nProbably only characters I can say I liked were Jun and her boyfriend. As well liked Yasu.\\n\\n\r\nMost were quite broken and with issues characters. But holy moly.. Nana...she was just pure rage-generator for me.\\n\\n\r\nPunk Nana had issues but actually was pretty much quite \"vanilla\" love'wise. As bond between her and Ren was quite good. Aside that she was quite likeable.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah, lot of moronic drama, but that is the purpose of drama. But kudos for being the most infuriating Anime regarding story and characters I've ever seen... and felt..\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\n... can't say I enjoyed it. I hated so many aspects of this Anime, so many characters infuriated me to an unreal amount and the depression was real here. Just Nana throwing word \"love\" \"being hurt\" around just.. seriously.. made my candle so lit, it just instantaneous combusted. The way she was emotional and loose.. just...unreal. Reminds me of many IRL people.. that have similar culture (well our IRL culture in a nutshell) ...'\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah. To sum it all up. In a sense of \"structure\" this anime was quite good. In a sense of my personal enjoyment.. this was probably one of the most dreadful Anime I've seen so far in my history with Anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story 10/10 Nana is hands down my favorite anime in regard to the story line. I have longed for an anime that brings the same emotional response with the story line and satisfaction after finishing. Other people may detest longer series, but I'm definitely here for it. Whomever labeled this as a shoujo is insane. It is so mature and complex, nothing compares!\r\nArt 10/10\r\nWell of course compared to art from today, Nana has too skinny of characters with somewhat unrealistic features, but I love it anyway. It was the first anime I watched (well besides Spirited Away,) that drew me in because of the Artdisplayed on the preview page.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nNot much to add here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nI was nervous this would be cliche with two characters on the same train with the same name, but opposite personalities. Amazingly, this was not the case. Nana and Naha (aka Hachi) brought me to tears by the end of the series. Their relationship was amazing during their youth and they gave each other a good reality check in some cases. The romantic relationships (I will not spoil) were realistic, relatable, and heavy. I could see myself in each characters reactions to each other and their inner turmoil.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nIf I haven't said this enough already, I enjoyed this series so much. I am in agony every time I watch a series and realize it will never meet the standards I have set due to Ai Yazawa. I would watch it again and again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nLOVED NANA. You will too. \\n",

            "content": "\"Rated R for frequent use of Tobacco, Alcohol and Partial Nudity\"\r\nImagine HiHi Puffy AmiYumi with that FCC warning, and you wouldn't be far off. Every episode begins with one of the two talking fondly of the past, looking back at the events to play out, to us the audience, with nostalgic hindsight. While never talking directly to each other in these future monologues, they refer to each other in a very loving tone wishing to tell them how they felt at the time.\r\nI honestly began to wonder as this became a constant theme, of their relationship budding, if the story would end with them justending up being lesbians. ...not that there's anything wrong with that. But the story is very much just about friendship, its about two female women dealing with love, drama, sex, life, money problems, and helping each other through it. While very 90's and the technology of the time definitely plays a part, its seems almost timeless outside of that. That these two and their problems could exists in any other time and you would still believe that they were friends.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I did find distracting that I did joke about earlier is the frequent drinking and smoking. It's not trying to be edgy with it, glamorise or even use it for humor. But I don't think there was a single episode where a character didn't have a cigarette or open a beer. It was kind of distracting. The small amount of nudity there was, was never lingering shots, but more focusing on the intimate moment that was usually playing out. But with it's heavy subject matter of affairs, slut shaming, pregnancy as well as abortion, on top of all the smoking and drinking, it always feel natural. It feels like a real world story, that these are things people in their mid twenties deal with. It's not the kind of anime set out to change the world, or give a new twist on things. It's just the story of two women sharing their lives, their friendship, and their name.",

            "content": "I've always heard about NANA, but for some reason, I've procrastinated on it all my life until now. This meant that I had subconsciously had really high expectations for NANA. Well, NANA not only met those, but utterly surpassed them. \r\nFor those who haven't seen this yet, I'll tell you a quick few reasons why NANA is a show you must watch before you die. \r\nCHARACTERS CHARACTERS CHARACTERS\r\nThis show is all about characters. They are so well written and just SO UGH REAL. Say good bye to all the flat typical shoujo characters and hello to NANA's characters. They will make you laugh and wrenchyour heart out. Everything from character design, personalities, and relationships(complicated as HELL but not soap opera-like)\\n\r\nPUNK NANA = love of my life. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack ME JAMMIN' 24/7\\n\r\nThe first 2 seconds of the guitar intro of Rose(first OP) gives me SO MUCH FEELS. Like I don't think I've skipped a SINGLE OP. At first I was just headbanging, but as I learn more about the story I become all sentimental. Honestly, the guitar is awesome. Other than Rose, there are many great soundtracks. A Little Pain is another great one among many others. NANA got me into Jrock/punk/visual kei. \\n\\n\r\nThemes \\n\r\nThe recurring themes in this anime really adds another layer to this story. They not only make the story and characters more real, but also just makes them so much more relatable. To me, the themes are what really gave this anime the emotional appeal, and I'm only sentimental because to certain extents I can relate to these characters and CARE for them as if they were real. There are many themes in this anime and I won't waste my time listing them, and really I just want you to watch it and see for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, JUST SO MANY GREAT QUOTES in this series. My favorite being Shouji's: \"I think I'm farsighted, when things are far away I can see them clearly, but when they are up close I can't\" (not exact quotes but that's the jist of it, regardless, I was literally balling my eyes out at that point so yeah) \\n\\n\r\nAhh, the writing is just amazing\\n\\n\r\nOne final note that really hit it home for me, is the fact that this show is just so mature. From character relations to the story itself, it is just like our real life. NANA is really a rare diamond. Don't watch and regret for the rest of your life. \\n",

            "content": "This is my first review ever so I apologize if my thoughts aren't coherent.\r\nI like Nana, I really, really Like Nana. Nana Is one of those show's that actually does romance in anime correctly. I actually feel like there are very few animes that do romance correctly. I mean, obviously doing romance correctly is subjective but when I say \"does romance correctly\" I mean, the characters actually interact and react in situations of romance like actual real people. \r\nNone of this, kids in anime in highschool don't want to come to terms with their feelings and they don't want to tell each other they loveeach other because they're too shy or nervous, crap. \\n\\n\r\nBut I'll get back to that later. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story to Nana Is incredible, It's a slice of life anime that manages to have depth because It follows the characters moments of joy, anguish, shortcomings, challenges, desires and what keeps each character motivated, even side characters get an impressive amount of screen time and development towards them. \\n\\n\r\nBut any anime can have characters get developed with those traits, but that isn't what makes Nana special. What makes Nana special is the execution and delivery of those traits. When characters interact in moments of joy and anguish or when they speak of their motivations, they feel and interact like real people. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, when something depressing happens in Nana, it isn't so extremely over the top and dramatic that it's ridiculous but it is believable and moving enough that It seems almost life like. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned above, romance in Nana is done incredibly well because the characters are extremely convincing and life like, I don't really know much about the voice actors involved but I do know they do an incredible job sounding convincing during emotional and romantic scenes, I'm basically repeating myself but I can't really say more without spoiling so many important scenes in the show, just watch it and experience it for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that I think put people off about Nana the most is the artwork and while It does seem pretty shoddy, you get used to and It's not like its completely intolerable and I feel that the art style can be somewhat fitting sometimes as well. The animation as well can be pretty medicore at times but It's not so terrible that It's a complete detriment to the anime and it's definitely tolerable. One of the things I like about Nana specifically art style wise is the character design as the way that the characters are designed fit the voices and personalities of the characters very very well which makes their personalities way more life like and convincing.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack during emotional or happy scenes isn't one of the biggest selling points to Nana but, once again it's not so terrible that It's a detriment to the execution and delivery of the story and it's characters. I feel like the soundtrack isn't really all too interesting or doesn't really bring more out of emotional scenes, it isn't a detriment I just feel like the soundtrack is sort of just, there to fill in the space where a soundtrack has to be.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I think the soundtrack and sound design is at it's best during the scenes where Nana and her band actually get to play music, because in those scenes the soundtrack and sound design work hand in hand beautifully together. \\n\\n\r\nNana has three openings and they're all pretty solid, nothing else to say in that regard. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nana is an amazing ride and experience and you'd be doing yourself a huge favor by watching it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The story is extremely relatable and realistic, resonating strongly with young adults. The plot is merticulous and beautifully woven, each character is unique and provides an insight into human nature.Despite the seriousness of the anime, it is able to effectively convey humour which provides relief to the tension. The bittersweet ending provides a well rounded resolution to the anime that leaves the audience feeling satisfied yet sentimental.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my all time favourite anime and I definitely recommend it, but the first few episodes are quite slow but dont give up on it.\\n",

Everyone has their regrets, their pains and their make mistakes. We see funny friendship moments, the ups and downs of being in love, and relationships that seem solid to slowly fade away. We feel the loss, the pain and the good times together with them, since everything is so subtle and identifiable with real life.",

            "content": "Nana Mixed Review\r\nNana is an interesting series for it\u2019s time. Released in Spring of 2006 and gaining a MAL score of almost 8.5, proving it to be able to, at least for now, stand against the test of time. I got recommended it by a friend, and I\u2019ve heard of good things about it, but does it really prove to be an anime on the same level as Madoka Magica, Shokugeki no Soma, or Mob Psycho 100. Well, let\u2019s analyze it. To begin, let\u2019s start with the standard MAL method.\r\nStory: I think their idea left tons of room for potential, and was one well. Thebase concept is Nana, a girl who is going to Tokyo to meet up with her boyfriend she hadn\u2019t seen in a year. On her way there, she meets a girl who is the same age, going to the same place, and having the same name. After their meeting, they part ways before Nana (who I am going to refer to as Hachi) before meeting again in their shared apartment. Hachi wants to be something resembling a housewife, which Nana wants to be a Punk Rock star, and she\u2019s damn good at it. Anyways, the story follows these two through their journey to Nana\u2019s dream of being a star and Hachi\u2019s attempt at a happy relationship. It follows their story as they deal with their relationships and their goals. Overall, the story itself is really good, very unique, but I had to take off points because, there were points where it was slow or doesn\u2019t make sense. They cut out parts I thought should be necessary, and there were major issues. My most annoyed part was Nana\u2019s backstory, and episode six. They were trying to maintain a sense of mystery with Nana at first, and they gave pretty much everything we need to know about her past early in those recaps, which kills the sense of mystery and would\u2019ve been far better if they had waited. Episode 6 was by far their worst, being lazy and giving us no real insight into the characters. You could\u2019ve skipped all of episode 6 and it would\u2019ve made no different. \\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: I\u2019m gonna keep this short because story rant was too long. It\u2019s mediocre at best. It\u2019s nothing unique or special, it doesn\u2019t really help the story or storytelling, and doesn\u2019t do anything creative or unique. There are nice moments, but it\u2019s blotted out by lazy moments where the animation takes a dip.\\n\r\nArt (5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Alright, what else can I give this? Normally, I skip intros for fear of spoilers, and even when I do listen, they rarely impress me. While I didn\u2019t like all the intros or outros, with the song \u201cWish\u201d being the worst for me, not bad, but still, I always listened to the opening and closing, and even when Nana or Reira isn\u2019t rocking out on stage to a kickass song, the classical music always works with the mood during a dramatic scene. My only issue is they use the same classical music piece every time, like if you look up sad violin on youtube and get the same song the first ten results. Still though, I found myself downloading and listening to the songs not watching.\\n\r\nMusic (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This one was difficult for me, because I couldn\u2019t tell if it deserved a 6/10 or a 10/10, so I went for the middle. I liked the realism with the characters. For their personalities, I felt they acted very realistic for their situations. I feel none of the characters acted out of place, and I don\u2019t dislike any of them, they have their development and most importantly, they feel like people. They don\u2019t feel 2D. Not only that, the character interactions are fantastic, with many of the dialogue scenes being my favorite, and the best for me being the interaction between Hachi and Nana. With this, I was tempted to give it a 10, but where it fails comes with the potential. All these characters had great potential, but I feel they never went in depth, at least, not really, with the characters and what they were capable of. They seemed to get somewhat into characters, but never took the time to explore them to the truly deep extent. If I had to make a comparison, it\u2019s like a beginner diver taking pictures, sure, we see the beauty, but only part of it. Not only that, I feel the character interactions, especially between Nana, Hachi, Shouji, etc, became few and far inbetween as the series progressed, making the story harder to watch for me. Also, they gave the wrong idea with some of these characters, the best case I can think of is Shouji and Sachiko. Let me be clear, I don\u2019t dislike either of these two, in fact, I loved them, but since they didn\u2019t go out of their way to show us deeply why Shouji fell for Sachiko, since we didn\u2019t see the progression, it feels as though he never loved Hachi that much in the first place, and makes Shouji seem like the bad guy. He\u2019s a coward, and an idiot at times, but he\u2019s not a bad guy. Overall, pretty good, but nowhere near the best I\u2019ve seen. I feel despite it being so long, 50 episodes, this fails at creating characters in ways that stories with half the amount of episodes succeeds in. If this was longer, this may have been really good, but now, it just feels underdone.\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is pure opinion, so I\u2019ll try to keep it brief. There were times where it was great, and the character interactions were great. To me, the narration is what makes the story, but there were many times the story to me felt bland, slow, or downright boring. Overall, it was good, not great, okay.\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnding: This is an odd one, since this isn\u2019t actually a MAL category, but for me, this is significant. For most series, and ending is supposed to provide a nice closer, and for the best series, the ending is what leaves the most powerful impact, making you think, feel, and really remember the series. Your Lie in April, Angel Beats, Madoka Magica, and Assassination Classroom are really all proof of this (I have series that don\u2019t make you cry by the ending but these are here to prove a point). An ending usually won\u2019t deal much damage for me, but an ending, depending on how it\u2019s done, can make or break a series for me. This one destroys it, not just being bad, but one of the worst endings of an anime. The ending felt underdone, it left too much in the air and told us nothing about the real importance. It made you think, but not in a good way, and it felt the maker should\u2019ve waited. I know the mangaka for Nana got sick or something, so the series is kinda abrupt, but this ending felt just\u2026 so underdone that it hurts me to watch. This is bad, awful, and hurts the series badly for me.\\n\r\nEnding (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was okay, nothing fantastic or worth watching twice. There were times it felt really underdone or the storytelling sucked, and I started to get bored of it as it progressed, but it is still worth checking out at least once. While the ending really did suck, I was borderlining whether to give it a six or a seven, and since the ending is what you leave with, I tried to avoid bias and give it a seven.\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, it is pretty okay, nothing worth watching a dozen times, but still worth watching. If they had kept it going for another season and spent more time developing the characters and story, working on their methods of storytelling, and fixed the animation, this would definitely become a classic, but overall, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the level as the aforementioned anime. With that, it\u2019s time to leave. Bye.\\n",

I never re-watched it because honestly, it became sort of tedious. If Nana was categorized into American television genres it would be a \"soap opera\" mixed with \"teen drama\" you know the kind where the teenage daughter of a multimillionaire gets pregnant from a boy who is going to become a professional baseball playerbut it turns out he's an illegal immigrant whose dad slept with his half-sister (obviously not the premises of Nana, but you get the kind of ridiculous situations and setting I mean). As the story goes on, the situations that occur and the actions some characters do become so unbelievability ridiculous and dramatic. Despite that, it is still good enough to give a chance.",

But no with NANA, noooooo. \\n\r\nJust to finsh this up it is an amazing heart warming anime, I mean sure it has it's parts where you think, &quot;Gawd, I don't care. lets get a move on with the plot here!&quot; , but most long animes make you think that.\\n\r\nBut anyway go to you're GOOGLE bar or where ever and type in &quot; NANA episode 1&quot;.........NOW!\\n\r\n- Breakingnotes ;D",

She always made stupid decisions that seemed to make me really angry. As well many of the other characters were selfish and made really idiotic choices. Overall I found the story line frustrating, at many times I found myself shouting out loud saying \"NO!\" or \"What the hell?!\" or \"Why did they do that?\". If you like stories that have you always wondering what will happen next because everything in their lives always screws up, thenyou'll really enjoy this one. The art overall was really good in my opinion and the voices for the characters really suited them as well, so it was believable. It really wasn't such a bad anime to watch, but I found it just depressing at many moments and I suppose I was looking for something a little more up beat. What I would compare it to is the depressing qualities that the \"Peach Girl\" anime had. Always something going wrong.",

The characters are colourful and I find myself being able to relate to every single one of them. The reason for this is because each of them have more than a handful of flaws. Nana Osaki is possesive, Hachi is weak-willed and an idealist, Takumi has little compassion and does not know how to show his feelings, etc. This anime/manga really should be labelled as \"awfully tragic\" It made me feel emotions I didn't think we're possible while watching/reading it. \r\nAnyways as we will probably never solvethe dozens of mysteries Ai Yazawa has woven into this masterpiece, all we can do is speculate and read a little fan fiction here and there :) \\n\\n\r\nQuestion:who do you think are Ren Ichinose's parents?",

            "content": "Ai Yazawa's 'Nana' is truly amazing. I originally picked up the manga before devouring the anime, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how the story unfolded on the screen. 'Nana' is heartwarming and lovable, and whether you want to or not you end up rooting for the characters (mainly the Nana's, of course!) \r\nThe romance is mature without crossing any lines. It's a nice break from the school-age shows that seems to dominate anime. No flirting ambiguously for episodes upon episodes- there are hookups, and heartbreaks, and honest, passionate loves. \r\nArt (8/10)\r\nNana has a very distinct art style, with lots of shading and tall,thin characters. They look and feel real. Their movements are natural, and it shows that Ai Yazawa tried to emulate the 'real world' instead of one imagined. My only complaint is that sometimes the characters look a little 'off'- Hachi in particular wears very strange expressions from time to time that pulled me out of my immersion. I don't think she translated from the manga to the anime as well as the other characters did.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) \\n\r\nNana has a relatively limited soundtrack, but it's used to the fullest effect. There is one particular snippet that appears before 'big' moments, typically near the end of the episodes, that gives me goosebumps when I hear it. The show is in large part about music, so I'm not surprised it has such a solid soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\r\nDynamic and constantly evolving, the characters in Nana are as real as they come. No one is ever quite what they seem, and they all have believable strengths and weaknesses. The plot of Nana *is* the characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\r\nNana is one of best shows I've watched this year. Once you're hooked, you're hooked! The world needs more josei series like this.",

            "content": "Incredible is the way I describe this series. Loved it for second one to the end. It also one of those anime that plays with your emotions a lot and in do so make it a extremely emotional roller coaster ride. This is personally one of my favorite anime of my list. So why don't we finally get to the specifics shall we.\r\nStory:\r\nLet start with the fact that there are multiple points of view to this story from the many characters that are in the series. But the main stories are of the two Nana's, yes if you don't know there are two characters namedNana in the series, which later on one is nick named Hachi to help clear confusion among other reasons. The to Nana's are complete opposite of each other coming for me different worlds with their own friends and pasts. From that you get immersed in the two characters story, which are equally incredible and well thought out . Nana comes from a hard life just trying to keep her head above the water to survive, while hachi lived a normal life trying to deal with the normal obstacle people run into through life. How do two people of opposite worlds meet, let call the pure luck, love, and the fight to save a dollar. What do i mean by those, lets start with pure luck. Both Nana and hachi are both heading to Tokyo and sit next to each other. After starting a conversation they soon find they have the same name. With that hachi strike up the reason for her going to Tokyo. Which bring the other string that ties them together. They are both going to Tokyo for love of a man whom is now living there, one going to a art college whom hachi made a promise to go to and live with him. And Nana to find her boyfriend whom is working to become famous in a band. Lastly the fight to save a dollar, they will come to meet each other again while trying to find a apartment to live in, they both go to the same place to rent to get in a argument over whom was there first. But come to the conclusion splitting the rent would be cheaper and it was plenty big enough for the two of them. This is point of no return for which there two live now become unchangeable intertwined and real story begins. I'm not going any further then this if you want more watch the series you will never regret it.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSad to say i had to give this below a 9 at a 8. Why you ask it would be because as good as it really is, it really reminded me of a clamp series with the overly slender long legs and arms sometimes. But it wasn't as bad as clamp at least. Nothing against clamp. But other then that art was really well drawn and the color choices were great. The characters were constantly changing which kept the anime at a new feel through out the series too. Over all i can't put out a complaint that make me even think to say it not worth the watch. \\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis was nothing short of perfect. If it wasn't Nana singing with all her beauty it would be Reira whom is voiced by singer Olivia Lufkin whom is a angel with her incredible voice, She is a singing voice of the character the voice actor was Aya Hirano to keep things clear. You want to hear Nana's singer look up Anna Tsuchiya if Oliva is an angel then Anna is the singer calling you from the dark and with her voice you go to the dark with out a second thought. I you get nothing else out the series it would be just the great music, but seriously if that all you get out the series then all i got to say is  were you paying an attention to the story...\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nTo many characters to get into, but you will fall in love with most and hate rest, but that's only cause that is the role they were meant to play. But both nana's story with run you through all the emotions you have. But with that you will become so into the story you will just want more. Plus the other character have their stories that are just as interesting and all the character story cross through out which causes new and more interesting character development to occur. Once you get into the characters the story with make sure to keep you following every step the character make. I mean you in for some incredible story and character development and you will only want to keep on watching till it over. Plus if you didn't get enough it only continues on in the manga so give that a go as well.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed it till the ended even if it was a needles to the heart, with all the emotion you go through in the anime. I loved everything about the anime i only wish i had the time to read more the manga or if they would continue the series. But i have no regret in any shape or form with this anime. By writing this it make me feel the need to re-watch the series just cause i loved it so much. Please if anything give it a few episode please don';t give up on the first episode like many out there do. Please as with all anime don't stop just cause you dislike what you saw in episode 1. Thank you reading this i hope you all got something out of this.\\n\\n\r\nThank You for your support.\\n\r\nSilent Voice\\n\r\nI.N.H. Anime Review",

Their personalities, styles, and jobs are different, but they have two same things: name (Nana) and age. This anime revolves mostly on their friendship and the accomplishments throughout the future. Episode 2~ 4 or 5 were about the two Nanas' past and after that, we finally get to start the anime!\r\nAnd even though you might want to skip some episodes, DO NOT SKIP IT! Every single word have clue and meaning.\r\nThiswas one of the animes that contained good romance, good friendship, good emotions, good illustration, and plot.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime seriously made me cry, laugh, and swear at the same time. You would never regret watching this!\\n\\n\r\nP.S this anime has so much wonderful music! you would fall in love with it!\\n\r\nHave fun watching it!",

I also saw the first movie and I liked it but it goes to fast.. I finally finished reading the Manga and I was blown away.... I don't want to spoil it for people who have not read it but when it came to Ren I cried it broke my heart... and freaking Takumi he pisses me off I totally wish he could get it together..

            "content": "I\u2019ve never seen such realistic drama in anime or manga in any series so far. It\u2019s almost like witnessing a real life drama from someone I knew. The drama in this series genuinely worked for them.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\r\nABOUT THE STORY\r\nThe story was about very different people who struggled with confusing feelings of friendship and love. It has a very strong touch of \u201cSlice of life\u201d genre and so the story was more in the heavy drama and mature type of story, just what you expect from Ai Yazawa. All of the works of Miss Yazawa has that sense of real life drama. Atfirst, I wasn\u2019t really impressed with the type of heavy drama in the series\u2019 main plot because I am really not a big fan of heavy drama type of stories. As the story went by, as expected I was most of the times irritated, confused, with mixed emotion, and in love with the series. Before I realized it, I was giving lots of comments after every episode, I would reflect about it before going to sleep, and the most unexpected of all, I was already too involved with the series. I strongly believed it showed how great the series was despite having a very heavy drama type of story. Perhaps, it was all because of the strong realistic side of it which lots of series nowadays lacks. Most of the series today has the strong tendency to become too dramatic or too cheesy which is something that would not happen in real life. The author managed to make it something that lots of people would genuinely relate to and so they would anticipate what will happen to the story.\\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe characters made the series a lot more real. Each of the characters has their own issue to deal with something that any type of viewers would relate their lives with. Every character would leave an impression to viewers and so you wouldn\u2019t say that their character just supports the main characters. Yasu and Shin was the most likeable among the supporting roles because of their maturity and strong influence to others. I wasn\u2019t really into Ren because of what he has done to Nana most importantly what he did to her in the manga form (read it and you will understand why Nana became so broken because of him). He himself was involved with drugs because he became unstable after leaving Nana. He was the one who loved Nana the most but he was also the one who can\u2019t do something for her. If you can\u2019t at least be happy with what you choose at the expense of leaving someone important then what\u2019s the use of hurting and leaving that someone, right? Hated Takumi so much who fooled around almost all the time even after getting married. He was in fact genuinely in love with Reira but still fooled around and ended up hurting her. Of course, I was in love with character of Nana the most. Though she wanted all the people she loved stay beside her, she was still independent and strong. She knew very well what she wanted and would worked hard for it even after Ren left her. Just as much I love Nana, the one I hated the most in the series was Hachi. She was the complete opposite of Nana. As in 180 degrees opposite! She was the type of girl who loved the idea of falling in love. She was with different guys because of her half-assed resolve and her strong dependant to each of them. The worst of all, she got herself pregnant by the worst guy of them all. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, she ended up hurting Nobu who genuinely was there for her because she chose the useless guy who fooled around. In fact, she herself wasn\u2019t sure if who was really the father of her child. That\u2019s how much she fooled around, too. What\u2019s really surprising was the fact that Nana and Hachi\u2019s combination of characters was the strongest role in the series. Well, I guess that would be because their characters as one was the main plot of the story that\u2019s why it was entitled \u201cNANA\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nThe animation wasn\u2019t really that amazing but every important scenes where the characters\u2019 strongest emotions showed or where they said important cool lines was magnificently done. To be honest, that\u2019s one of the main reasons why the series as a whole was amazingly done. The dialogues were absolutely captivating. In fact, the dialogues were one of the reasons why the story became more realistic because you can really relate to it. It felt like it was something that real-life person would say. Let\u2019s not forget the music or soundtracks of the series which was one of the strongest edges of the series from any other animes. The music was really captivating. It made every scene with beautiful lines became magnificent and left a strong impression to any viewers. Something that you would always remember even after watching it. Even I, collected all the music and soundtracks of the series from opening themes and ending themes to insert songs and character songs.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a story that you can really relate to and would leave you thinking then this series is for you. Being fed up with overly dramatic or too cheesy type of series, this series will make you really involve with its amazing story.\\n",

The character development is great, and I grew really attached to the series. I was really disappointed when I finished the last episode, I didn't want it to end at all! Especially since the last episode is pretty much a filler. Each character was so.. human. I do not know how else to describe it. You could relate to them, youfelt sorry for them. You almost wanted to reach out your hand to touch them. There were times when I laughed and there were times when I cried. This anime stayed in my head long after I finished watching it. That's what so great about Nana. It's nothing fancy. Just reality with all of its beauty and pain on your screen. So wonderfully written and told like a story you want to hold on to and never let go.",

Usually I would watch 2-3 episodes a day and then kind of try and analyze what I had just seen. \r\nWhat I really loved about it was the way in the beginning of each episode one of the Nanas had a little monologue kind of revealing what the episode was gonna be focusing on and the same works for the ending of each episode.\r\nI have doadmit though that I felt the amazing part of the show kind of died off in the beginning of the episodes around 30. It kind of became too much of a cliche to my mind and there was too much of the classic love drama involved.\\n\r\nAnother disappointing part was the ending. I feel like it kind of ended too suddenly and the ending itself really wasn't what I expected at all.\\n\r\nIn conclusion I kind of feel like I was let down.

The story revolves around the love affairs of the two Nanas' love lives. The story for both of them circles around them moving away from their home towns to live in Tokyo. For Nana Osaki, she has dreams to become a big time musician, while Hachi just wants to move in with her current boyfriend Shoji (doesn't last long though). Then there lives intermingle, when Hachi delves into Osaki's love life, which then opens up Hachi's love life to Osaki's Band members and theband members of Trapnest.\\n\\n\r\nGo figure that the story twists and turns as even sex life plays into the plot. Towards the end, sex plays a VERY big role.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime an 8/10. Why you may ask? The ending left many questions and to me, the ending is everything. All I can hope is that the anime goes onto a second season and gives me more of those dramatic situations.\\n\\n\r\nPS: For those who acknowledge the \"Truth\" and \"Above the Influence commercials,\" you won't be very happy. *Wink, wink. ;)",

I teared up on a lot of parts during this series, the human emotion and realistic characters and the music is what makes this an awesome series. It does have flaws where some parts there isn't much of a plot going on just who is having sex with whomever. Some peoplemight find Nana Komatsu a little annoying of a character, but if you get past its flaws you might find something well worth your time.

            "content": "Here is a list of reasons that I consider this a classic:\r\n- Manages to keep the focus on the two protagonists yet at the same time, each of the supporting cast of characters are well managed.  Each of the characters in this show are so unique, and unpredictable, but not not unpredictable in a random way, but in a way that makes them real people rather than caricatures/roles.  I swear to god you know people like these. \r\n- Avoids clich\u00e9s in two ways\u2014resolutions of relationships and second in the dynamic between the bands.  While one of the Nana\u2019s has a warm \u2018happy-ending\u2019in her relationship (well, in the anime at least), the other Nana doesn\u2019t end up in a fairytale situation, which is not to say it ends up badly for her, just that they don\u2019t take the obvious route with both relationships.   The second way they avoid clich\u00e9s is in the interaction of the two bands, early in the series, it looks like one of the bands will be the villains, and that the show will center around the bands being matched up against each other.  It doesn\u2019t end up like that at all. In fact\u2026..\\n\\n\r\n- \u2026..there are no villains in this show.  Perhaps this is something unique to the \u2018slice of life\u2019 genre, I haven\u2019t watched many  of them (Clannad is the only other one), but there was no character in this that was a villain.  There\u2019s one male character in one of the bands that gets a lot of hate online, but a lot of that hate I\u2019ve noticed is from female fans, and I think it\u2019s related to the above point of the fairytale ending, there\u2019s a lot of projecting that I detect in the hate he receives.  I disagree with that hate and find him to be completely on point. \\n\\n\r\n- For guys with girlfriends/wives that are skeptical about this whole \u201ccartoons\u201d hobby of yours, this is a great show to show them how real and adult anime can be.  Careful though, they WILL be hooked and it\u2019ll be funny how they\u2019ll be the ones wanting you to marathon through it with them. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a wonderful anime, and you get so attached to the characters and their dreams.  Because of of the open-ended ending, it is probably the first anime for which I will actually read the Manga\u2014I\u2019ve never read a Manga before, which is why I\u2019ll stay with the 10/10.  I\u2019d considered giving it a lower score because of the ending but the fact that I\u2019ll actually read the manga\u2014something I thought I\u2019ll never do, is reason to keep it at a 10. \\n\\n\r\nPS. Can\u2019t forget to give a shout to the soundtrack, all music in this anime is made by the actual characters in the anime itself, interesting concept. Also the music is actually part of the story, so pay attention to it!  I\u2019m mostly a hip-hop/dance guy, I barely listen to any Rock music at all, but I still enjoyed the punk-rock music in this.  Maybe it was because of how the music is actually weaved into the story. \\n",

But when I watched the first episode , I felt kind of sadness, despite the first episode was funny!\r\nAnyway, this anime was keeping touch with my feelings, it's easy to any one to feel that. maybe the special world of the feelings that \"Ai Yazawa\" made  in this anime was a very genius. you can feel the sadness, the happiness, the loveness, the hateness and the big friendship between Nana and Nana.\r\nthe friendship was soclear and have a special mean in this amazing anime, no one can imagen how and when the friendship of nana and nana was begining, \"was unexpected\", even for them!\\n\r\nThe another genius was this way to make tow of the most different personalities the best friends ever!\\n\r\nThe worst thing that the end was really unclear or rather we should say vague .\\n\r\nExcept that this anime was amazing, and you should go and see it, go now!",

This anime gave me to many emotional feels that I cried every time while watching it. The story is very sweet and music in it is pretty amazing. I can feel that I can relate to both characters. First of with Nana Komatsu. I can relate cause all she wants is to be loved by the one she wants to spend the rest of her life with. Who doesn't want a life likethat. As  for Nana Osaki she is talented and has a wonderful voice. She's determined to be successful in her future and follow her dream with it. That's one of the things I'm doing. \\n\r\n   Nana is a really good anime and wonderful story line. In the end of Nana I can tell you that I was mad and couldn't sleep well at night. But i understand the choices that she made. To me, Nana was like a life lesson to me. it was indeed a great story.",

The reason for this is that this one is my all-time-favourite anime for many reasons.\r\nThe story is perfect but actually the characters make it interesting. All of the characters all really well-thought and unique. I'm also addicted to the first opening song which is the debut song of the Black Stones.\r\nThat's it. Like I said, this may not be helpful to you but I can tell you one thing. If you like rock music, style, romance, surprising character development, and first of all stories aboutfriendships, you'll love this. I love it. It's a shame that Ai Yazawa couldn't finish the manga.",
