            "content": "Many anime strive for a horror element and settle for the gore.  Others try for the psychological approach and get lost in the relationships.  This, however, is a shining star among them all.\r\nGhost Hound foregoes all the gore and heads straight for the downright creepy.  The animation style, though soft and fairly unassuming, only enhances this creepy-factor once the ball starts rolling.  Each episode title is taken straight from psychology texts, and exploits the given theme with finesse and underhanded tact.\r\nNothing is overdone.  Everything is like a current flowing underground, or a train rumbling by only a mile away.You can't see it, but you can feel the presence.  The atmosphere is set with an amazing score which seems to taunt all those soft and unassuming characters with the terror to come.\\n\\n\r\nOnly it isn't obvious.  \\n\\n\r\nMany anime try to shove &quot;the horror of it all&quot; down your throat, leading to some nausea and perhaps a little surprise.  This, however, slips beteen the cracks and tugs at your primal half, makes you start to wonder whether or not you really are safe in your own head.  The imagery shifts like flashbacks from a memory only half-recalled (they address that topic, actually) and the atmospheric music only sucks you in deeper.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, too, are well-rounded and fascinating, from Makoto and is utterly horrifying grandma, to Masayuki and his social eccentricities, to Tarou and that FREAKY &quot;lucid dream&quot; he keeps having.  (&quot;Lucid Dream&quot; is episode 1)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf you love shows and movies that just crawl inside and start to make you think really hard about things you once thought were absolutes, then this is the show to see.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one downside is the lack of dialogue, but in a horror, images and sounds carry so much more meaning, and these images and sounds are guaranteed to make tingles rund down your backbone.  The other downside--a trifle, really--is that the first episode takes a few minutes to really take off, but once it does, the anime never slows down.\\n\\n\r\nIt is an anime for the true psychological horror fan, and Production I.G. was brilliant for making this their 20th anniversary release.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, those little astrally projected bodies?  Man, even if the show's creepy-factor doesn't appeal to you, those little things are just too cool for words.",

            "content": "I decided to watch the series, because the scriptwriter of Ghost Hound also wrote Serial Experiments: Lain, Texhnolyze and Hellsing, all of which I am quite drawn to (especially SEL). I must say, that this anime is a great job, perfect for a 20th anniversary release.\r\n~ s t o r y ~ 8 / 10 ~\r\nIf some of you think: 'Those cute characters and a psychological plot? No way!' I am glad to tell you, that you are wrong. At first, when I saw, that GH is of 22 episodes, I was sure, that it will be verbose and / or tedious (i'm used to13-episode psychological animes), but I'm glad I tried watching it despite that thoughts. Of course, the plot needs a half of the first episode to take off, but once it does, it doesn't stop (actually, it's going faster and faster to the climax). The anime is a specific type of an illustrated encyclopedia: trauma, mental disorders, possession, out-of-body experiences, mind, brain, afterlife and more - every one of these is shown in a few different points of view, either scientific or spiritual. I gave it an 8, because I just expected something more. The plot is not confusing at all, I mean, there is the puzzle-mode on, but once explained, it becomes perfectly clear. At least some of the aspects...\\n\\n\r\n~ a r t ~ 9 / 10 ~\\n\r\nI love the idea of different angles and showing the action from the characters point of wiew. The landscapes and character projects are quite nice. Some of the ghosts, retrospections or halucinations are drawn really CREEPY. And by creepy I mean, that at night when going to the bathroom you wish not to find anything like that in your room when you come back. They're so random, they give goosebumps. The thing I dislike, is what they did to OBE - but, oh well, it's just an anime, not a science book.\\n\\n\r\n~ s o u n d ~ 9 / 10 ~\\n\r\nNot much of music, but when it's finally playing in the background, it has a feel of GITS's soundtrack. Old japanese music, just without the vocals.\\n\r\nIMO the opening was the worst: it really didn't suit the anime.\\n\\n\r\n~ c h a r a c t e r ~ 1 0 / 1 0 ~\\n\r\nCharacters are the metier of Ghost Hound. Nicely designed, with vivid personalities. Everyone will find a bit of himself in some of them. \\n\\n\r\n~ O V E R A L L ~ 9 / 10 ~\\n\r\nGreat series with an enjoyable plot, nice art and sound and wonderful, mysterious characters. However, I recommend this anime only for people who like psychological series - others may think of Ghost Hound as a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nHave fun ^^.",

Unlike most horror series that feature plenty of shocking, gory moments and psychological dramas that show the absurd, extremes of the human psyche; Ghost Hounds goes for a more technical approach. Sadly this leads to a great series with an incredibly complex story.  \r\nIt is about four different kids who have suffered from different traumatic events; in their past and now have the ability to traverse this \u201cunseen world\u201d. That\u2019s just the initial plot of the series and as the story begins, you will see abunch of stuff and have no idea what on earth is going on. Slowly but surely, little bits of this mysterious and uncanny story are revealed and during this process you\u2019ll be force fed a lot of psychological terminology. Yet it still takes some time for the story to become somewhat interesting. Then you\u2019ll be able to enjoy the series, as it develops into a sensational experience, whilst learning a fair bit of neurology, psychology and Japanese folklore. At the same time it is easy to consider dropping the series, for those who are unable to get into it. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of this anime was superb, having an extraordinary amount of detail put into the little-less things and with interesting, surreal surroundings when expressing the unseen world. The characters were well designed and moved fluidly but the pale colour tones did make some look unappealing. At least the rich environments and scenery made up for the short comings.\\n\\n\r\nIt was pretty tricky to judge this anime on the quality of the sound, because there wasn\u2019t much there. During the weird apparitions and flashbacks there was a great deal of weird SFX used, to which is perfect for setting the creepy mood. However with barely any music at all, in the end, it just sounded pretty bland.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a mildly interesting anime showing the parallels of the psychological and the supernatural however other than the technical aspects of this anime (e.g. animation), this series can be a pretty dull and lifeless experience. With so much terminology to take in, anyone can feel like dropping this at any moment and going for a much easier show to understand. But the series does become fairly interesting to watch later on, when things become clearer and the story finally start to move forward. So before watching this series you\u2019ll have to think to yourself, \u201cIs this the type of series I would enjoy?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "REVIEW CONTAIN CONCLUSIVE SPOILER\r\nFor the first half of the show, Ghost Hound have got everything right, from the creepy soundtrack that formed its designated atmosphere to the countryside setting that we're so fond of in horror anime. The series gave off the same kind of atmosphere that Higurashi and Shiki gave me, which shows how great it was directed. The unique camera angle amplifying the creepy tone of the series to a level where \"horror\" would be one of the appropriate genre for the series while the colorful and unique representation of the \"hidden world\" surely did its job to allow the viewers to seethe story in a more frightening way, making them more prone to the dark assumptions that viewers can't help but to make in a series like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was perfect in almost every way, just enough room to maintain a balanced space, captivating the viewers with various thrilling experiences and allowing them to make assumption about what will happen next, whether its the horrifying secrets that the three main characters would find out about their past or the problems that forms around their morbid town. The show does maintain a large cast near the end of the series but all of them were thoroughly developed, what also support this is the three main characters as they were interesting to a certain point where seeing their interaction as they help each other uncover the secret to their past is one of the main focus, for both the series and its viewers.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the series does maintain a great sense of atmosphere and characters development, its ending fall short to what most viewer would have assumed for it to played out. Near the end of the series, the original plot (Solve Taro's past trauma, who did what and the various morbid discoveries that each character would discover as they delve deeper into the past and the \"hidden world\"),  was left behind to be replaced  with two new ones, which unfortunately ruin the ending for me, as these two new plot line have almost nothing to be relevant with the original purpose of the story, sure there were some connection here and there but it was far too fragile to be in truthful relation with the original story, it just felt like the show tried to expand its storytelling limit and failed pretty bad, resulting in the undesirable answer to the whole affair about Taro's kidnapping incident as the viewers only received a happy and simple resolution to the the scary kidnapping that was so well presented that it should have made most viewers expecting something a little bit more shudder worthy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Ghost Hound was a very well played out series from beginning... to the middle, for the way that the ending was told results in a total lost of the original plot. But don't get me wrong, if you're really into thrillers and the like, this series must be on your \"plan to watch\" or \"completed\" list because, ending aside, the series did a great job of presenting itself as a psychological thriller in many ways.",

In my honest opinion, this anime is like a marriage of Serial experimental Lain and Ghost Hunt( if you haven watch them, go watch em!). I am also interested of their homework done on the facts and researches regarding unexplained /truth of supernatural events. With all this combination of greatness, even though i am at only 10th episodes, it certainly my must-watch , till the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAdvice(s):\\n\r\n1) For all ages, definitely a must watch for those who likes horror , supernatural genre, not for the weak hearted.\\n",

            "content": "I just finished watching this anime and it wasn't good. It leaves the audience feeling incomplete as there are a lot of questions left unanswered, and also with a heavy sense of disappointment. When the last episode ended the first thing that came to my mind was, \"...ok...so...is that it?\". I'd only recommend this anime to people who don't really want to be drawn and hooked to an anime, but those who are just wanting something to pass the time with and have absolutely nothing better to do. (I hate being this harsh, but it really wasn't good)\r\nStory: 4\r\nLet me just start off by sayingthat the concept of the story was promising and deeply intriguing. However, despite this there was bad linkage, poor pace, and a very poorly thought out conclusion. Let me explain. The anime is about 3 boys who become friends and start to experience soul traveling through a series of events. The beginning is quite promising as the main protagonists all have interesting dark backgrounds, and the authors also utilize very dark themes such as suicide, and the occult. However, despite all these amazing ingredients they didn't seem to do a lot with it. Yes, they create very good and fascinating concepts, but they failed to develop it any further or add any more depth to it. All it turned out to be was a good idea and nothing else. Every time something interesting would happen, they would just drop it and leap onto another concept. Additionally, the pace of the anime was very dragged out. And each episode just created a feeling a heaviness and not excitement. If you're looking for a fast paced engaging psychological horror/thriller this is not it. In all, the story, just didn't hit the mark, but simply fell flat on it's face.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art work was very good in my opinion.(but I'm not a very \"artsy\" person so don't quote me on this) The drawing of the characters, and the background/scenery were all quite beautifully done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI really liked the sound which was utilized in the anime. I thought it was superb. The eerie like sounds they would use, and also the kind of disconnected far off sounds which were heard when the characters would be soul traveling was very interesting and set the mood. However, unfortunately, since the story within the anime was slow paced and un-engaging, the sound effects did little to increase the enjoyability of it...well it did do a little, but not all that much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nAs I said before, the main characters all had dark backgrounds which made them interesting at first but then as the anime continued, the development was very poorly done. The only character which was very interesting, and whose pieces fell all together at the end was Makoto. He was the character who really pushed me into watching the anime through to the end, as he was the only one which sort of made it interesting/engaging for me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3 and Overalll Score: 3 \\n\r\nIn all, I didn't enjoy this anime. It was dragged out, there were a lot of unanswered questions and the conclusion was just rushed. The plot failed to really go anywhere interesting, and most of the characters were not very intriguing nor had good character development. \\n\r\nWatch it if you have nothing better to do, but honestly, I wouldn't recommend it.",

            "content": "Story 8/10\r\nOnly on the penultimate episode did I discover that the original suppose for this series was penned by Masamune Shirow. It doesn't really show, although as that was in 1987 it isn't so surprising. Why it took 20 years to make such a great anime is anyone's guess.\r\nAnyway, the story is very good. A dark and moody tale at heart, this anime mulls through the lives of its protagonists and a semi-real world of astral projection and spirits. It does so in a way immediately attributable to Nakamura Ryuutarou's (Serial Experiments Lain) direction. I enjoyed SEL's rasping static sensory deprivation, and I love ithere too. The bassy atmosphere death rattles the viewer through several inter-connected disturbing backstories, and drapes the lead characters in harsh, heavy shadows.\\n\\n\r\nThe dark story involves the \"unseen world\" of disconnected spirits, and is played out as part mystery, part science. The exposition and investigation is mainly from the perspective of juniour high school students, connected by those dark backstories; and this is perhaps one of the small blemishes on the series. While the \"difficult past and large responsibilty on young shoulders\" plot element is powerful despite its regular use in anime, I think the children retained a little too much of their childish appearance during the progression of this series. Indeed it was not Shirow's intention to have such young protagonists.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSimulteneously beautiful and slightly wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality is very high, as you would expect from Production I.G. But perhaps the tones and designs of the children, again, bring the show down slightly. The atmosphere created by the backdrops, creatures and settings throughout was exceptional, but the flat-coloured characters distracted slightly from that and just felt a little out of place. A few bad choices were also made during astral projection. The initial \"baby\" characters look a little too silly, as do some of the later apparitions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, the designs and smoothness need some applause for their left-of-mainstream quality. Very well put together; sometimes even creepy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLike SEL, one of the things that brings the atmosphere and animation and script together is the sound used to bind them. The fuzz, the buzz, the scrapes, the dinks - all work fantastically with the mood and direction. Although you could argue that the general impression is almost too similar to SEL, it works very well regardless. OP is also well suited. Japanese VAs are good, and mild-mannered enough to pull off the roles very professionally and convincingly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe very believable story behind what is something of a fantastical show is exposed beautifully through the main cast. Common personality types crop up but remain under-done to perfection, easily escaping the horrible tendency in asian media to ham-up emotions. The leads are well defined and maturely designed. There could be a little more conflict in there, and some things perhaps shouldn't go quite as smoothly as they tend to do for those characters, but I was very satisfied with the way things turned out. All but one or two characters are important in their own way, and most hold themselves together well and deserve their screen time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.9/10\\n\\n\r\nWith such good all round scores it's tempting to go even higher with the overall mark, but all I'll do is recommend this to anyone who enjoys a mature anime. Though the series runs for 22 episodes there were no points when I felt cheated because of that. There's no filler in here. The fascinating story unfolds generously, without recourse to distraction. Although I felt a couple of things could have been explained a little more, the ending was a satisfactory finish for what is literally a one-in-a-thousand anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow to hunt out the next classic hidden within swathes of soggy cardboard and freaky pillows.",

            "content": "Let me preface this \"8\" by saying I thought the storyline for this anime was really terrific! A definite 10/10. It is complex without being too over-the-top (for the genre it is under, that is) and unfolds gradually, but not too slowly either. Each character, minor or protagonist, has an ever expanding role and someone you may think you will only see once or in the background often has a greater story to tell. \r\nAnother wonderful aspect of this anime is that rarely is someone as they appear to be and where certain situations could have played out in a typical fashiontook a very different role instead. My favourite example of this was Taro's therapist/counselor, Dr. Hirata, but there are a number of others that follow.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while some of the plotlines intersect, the one's that do not, still believeably flow within the plot and are usually very interesting. It isn't often I have come across subplots that while separate,continue to be relevant and intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP song is fun and different, not completely makign sense to the anime itself right away, but then it grows on you and feels as though it actually fits rather well. I still couldn't get into the ending theme song or the scratchy static noises the anime sometimes used as suspenseful \"Oh no! What will happen in the next episode!!\" sound bites or for re-capping an episode, however that is my own preference and I suspect others would disagree. \\n\\n\r\n The art style was also interesting to me, not just for the art itself but the direction it took. One of the best examples of this is the landscape, which is as much a character itself as it is a background. It is at times, such an important element of the plot, you forget the it is setting and not an actor, because it isn't just land as a setting, but it has its own history and plotline which is explored. \\n\\n\r\n Another example of the art talent lies in this anime's direction. There are some very interesting perspectives and angles the directors and artists chose to take for it, some of which pertain to the aforementioned land uses, while others are due to a particular characters perspective or to create a creepy atmosphere or tell the story better. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't swear by it or recommend it to everyone I know, I would recommend it generally, because overall, I found this show to be slower, creepy and intense, but also original, subtle and engaging. The best description I have read for this anime came from the review by Cyh when 's/he' states: \"Nothing is overdone. Everything is like a current flowing underground, or a train rumbling by only a mile away.\" Which sounds rather abstract on paper (or in this case, the screen), but after having seen the full breadth of the show makes a great deal of sense to me. Like a river it seems to meander, but unlike many anime by the end has come to a place where it has expanded fully and reached an entertaining crescendo.",

            "content": "The show starts out with a really creepy opening of something flying around and only getting glimpses of what\u2019s happening from his eyes. We find out that it was all a damn dream from our main character. Taro Komori seems like a rather normal boring guy who lives with a family of brewers. And yet they bring up strange things about his past that seem to be bothering him. I can\u2019t lie, even with knowing the description of the anime; this all was a bit confusing in the beginning. They jump around a lot and the only thing I really got was that Taro wasable to astro project and has dreams of the past. As the show goes on, it does get slightly better and there are times that they kept me on the edge of my seat but it is extremely logical and have a mountain of dialogue before something gets done. \\n\\n\r\nMasayuki seems much more like the person we should be following. He is the outsider who is gathering information on what goes on around the other two. He seems to have more of an understanding that things are happening then Taro and Makoto.  It\u2019s that or Taro and Masayuki\u2019s stories should switch a bit. Miyako is pretty silent but is also one that I wished we could get more info on right up front. She seems to have even more understanding as to what is going on about the spiritual world. \\n\\n\r\nI like how they show the outer body experience like being in water to where you can\u2019t really hear anything around you. What I don\u2019t like is that they seem to have only one goal throughout the whole show and that\u2019s to find out what went on a long time ago. It just makes the characters sound like broken records at times. Now I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s no good. I did like it but I wish that they had more episodic ghost show with the overall plot mixed in with it.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of this show talks about the mind and how philology plays a big part in what happens when you have trauma at a young age. Unfortunately, it seems that they try to base it all on ghosts and astro projections. Sometimes it feels like they are just trying to make up excuses to what\u2019s going on with the kids. At some point, they even talk about the destruction of nature though I really don\u2019t see what it has to do with all of the supernatural ideas or the children turning into strange beings.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation lacks just a little, making it look a little like Sayonara Zetsubo-Sensei with a little bit of CG mixed into it. Sometimes it looks a bit on the plain side, not really standing out from any other anime or even lacking from others. Still, I have to give it props for trying to be different then the others. The close ups give a very creepy look to the show. Unfortunately, some of the characters look like they have large heads even when not in a spiritual form. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is really hunting and creepy in the opening, but set the mood well. What doesn\u2019t set the mood is the basic clips from the show. It just seems like a lack of love was given to the opening in this aspect. The scripting is a bit odd; sometimes the characters seem to talk to someone even if they haven\u2019t said anything at all. There are also some strange passes in the way sentences are said and sometimes the volume isn\u2019t right. Even with the strange script, I still like how the voices are. They have voices I would imagine them to have.\\n",

            "content": "Where do I begin?... The premise is nice. The execution was fair. \r\nTaro (our whiney main-main character), Makoto (rebel extraordinaire) and Masayuki (professional milf hunter) are our three almost immediate MC's for this evening. They all have dramatic pasts that lead them to spend the rest of their days with regret not far from their minds. Masayuki is the bridge that connects Tarou and Makoto with his intrusive personality. Miyako is later introduced as main character 4? yeah... I guess we just hand out MC like it's no big deal around here. Don't question it. Read the synopsis if you want more, but it's reallyhard not to spoil anything, so I have to be vague.\\n\\n\r\nFlaws: I would like to mention the flaws before I mention what makes this anime stand out. This show... tries to touch on the subject spirituality as well as science of the brain. Cool, right?  Meh, sorta. The problem is that they later try to mix in religion as well as try to have some sort of crush between two MC's. It's here where the animu starts to derail a bit. It tried to add a fourth boy, Michio to the mix who can instantly do this thing that the other boys learned to do (while keeping a human form) called soul traveling. A sort of out of body experience. The problem here is that the other boys had a reason to soul travel. To solve traumas. He just does it without having any. No explanation is given either. The crush thing goes no where, so there was really no reason to have it. They also only touch on religion briefly before just going for a cult approach. Oh yeah... Character development? Nope, everyone that needed it just 180's near the end of the anime. What little dialogue we get starts to get choppy near the end.\\n\\n\r\nWhat it does well: This animu brings up a lot about different diseases and conditions with the brain. It also effectively brings up the spiritual side of the coin in a kind of speculative point of view. Miyako is probably the show's best character in terms of character development she goes from not understanding her place in the world (it's implied so you have to pay attention) to finally accepting her dad as an understanding individual. The show also has that small but big feeling in the sense that you actually feel like there is a world beyond what you are seeing by referencing newspaper articles and places in the world. I like that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this anime did what it needed to and an itty bit more. It's an anime to get you thinking and really nothing beyond that. Sure there are feels here and there but without knowing what the other characters think other than Taro it just falls flat. I enjoyed it, almost couldn't stop watching, it's good for it's time. If only they polished up the last few episodes a bit.",

            "content": "This is not a synopsis.\r\nGhost Hound is an anime that I stumbled across a year and a half ago while looking for more fuel for a horror genre anime craze that I managed to suffer.  Upon watching the first episode and nearly quitting halfway through, I dropped the series...  until three weeks ago.  I started watching it again, I decided I was going to drill my mind right through it.  So I did.  I found that the, boring, static plot was unfolding very slowly.  There were no lovable or badass characters as far as I'm concerned, nothing interesting, nothingthought provocative at all for the first few episodes - probably just a background setup.  But suddenly, though I dare not unveil what happens, my mind is blown.  I managed to spend the rest of the series waiting for the episode where it is revealed that all the characters were on shrooms, but it never happened.\\n\\n\r\nStory:  Mind blowing.  There are few known variables.  The story is where the variables emerge from.  I would definitely say there is no filler, that's a plus.  Some characters are digging for events of the past (lost memory, truth), some are striving for the present (trying to rid themselves of fear, or family related problems).  All in all, the story is OK, I'd give it a 8 if it weren't for the pacing issues at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Art is good.  Doesn't really stand out, but it conveys its intended purpose just fine.  There are plenty of psychedelic scenes that are done well enough.  8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is where this series shines.  It manages to converge audio and video in one big mind trip.  The sounds are very unique.  I don't even recall anything besides the OP and ending that could be called \"music\" by the general term, but it is indeed fantastic.  10 points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Characters are good.  One that is constantly angry, withdrawn, and rather burdened by his family's past.  In my opinion, he is the best character in the series.  The next best is the main heroine - also withdrawn, unwilling to associate with the males of the story at first, she eventually warms up partially. The primary character of the series is one which is concerned at first with his own fear, but he eventually shifts his concerns to everyone else.  The last character that is listed as a main character is just trying to erase the results of bad deeds of a time that predates the story.  Characters are overall so-so.  7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I won't say I didn't like this series - I certainly did.  It just lacked the hooking factor of some other anime I have seen.  The characters and story did not support the enjoyment factor as much as the sound and audio mix.  7/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Average of everything!  8/10.",

            "content": "In short, this is one of the best anime series I have seen so far.  In one word it\u2019s profound, and it\u2019s a must-see, regardless of the genre you prefer. The only thing that made me falter in giving it a ten was the art which I did not enjoy at all. It\u2019s too simplistic and disproportional. But it actually manages to compensate in a way I thought it impossible.\r\nThe story starts off innocently. There's a boy named Taro who has had a very traumatic experience with which he tries to deal with. However, the feel of the story is ominous from the beginning.Even though it seems normal enough, you cant's help but wait in anticipation for something bad to happen.  Soon, strange things do start to happen, and slowly we are drawn into the Unseen world, full of both beautiful and disturbing things.\\n\r\nThe story has a beautiful flow, and it really develops perfectly. Nothing is rushed or muddled, and even though it deals with ghosts and the paranormal, it\u2019s surprisingly plausible, mostly because it questions the established notions of science (neurology, psychology, physics) and it offers an alternative view on things that we think are perfectly explained by the science. This scientific trait of the story gives it an extra eerie twist, because it questions reality explained by reason and logic. What is reality and what is the dream world? In which do we reside?\\n\r\nEvery single character has a personality not made according to your standard anime-character-mould. And this personality develops with the story, which makes this series exceptionally enjoyable. You have to stick with them in order to see who they really are. Every character seems to be more then it meets the eye.  It\u2019s just a feel of the character, not some mysterious past tragedy, or something conventional like that. The fact that the main cast is made out of high school boys makes this anime even spookier. They are all very troubled, the way you don\u2019t want  a fifteen-year-old to be troubled. The adults don\u2019t offer any consolation, and although most try to understand, they are simply at a lost as to what to do in these peculiar circumstances.\\n\r\nI saved the best for the last. The sound in Ghost Hound is the most amazing, extraordinary thing I\u2019ve so far encountered in any anime. It plays with your brain in a way you don\u2019t even realize until you turn off the lights and go to sleep.  After watching the first four episodes, I was not scared, however I had one of the worst nightmares ever that night, and it was all sound. The sounds that prevail in this anime are something I call night sounds. When everyone and everything is asleep, you can hear the furniture moaning, you can hear the wind stroking the walls outside your room. There\u2019s also a lot of noise in Ghost Hound which gives it a perfect feel, and some jazz which is maybe the best genre for this anime, with its unpredictability. \\n\r\nAnd I have to stress that there is no horror tricks with sudden loud sounds combined with a scary scene. It\u2019s all atmosphere, the combination of sound, story and characters that makes this anime amazing. Ghost Hound  is eerie, disturbing, it will make you uncomfortable, but it won\u2019t use some cheap tricks to make you jump in your seat..\\n\\n",

I can't even begin to describe how many things the anime does wrong, since there are 22 episodes worth of things. The goofy ghosts and exceptionally weak main character aren't helping.\r\nPlease, for the love of god, don't get trapped like I did. I saw a 7.63 but a few 10 and 9 reviews and thought, hey maybe it's not that bad (I had just seen the awesome Shinsekai Yori and Ghost Hound was recommended as like that).\r\nThe only reason I watched thiswas because of the cliff hangers. My brain compelled me to keep watching it despite how bad it was due to the constant cliffhangers which would make me think \"oh next episode there will be a great illuminating explanation for this\". \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is horrible. Please do not watch this until you've watched every other thing, and done everything you want to do in life, and are on your deathbed, and even then, don't watch this.",

            "content": "Wow, this was a great thriller title. Ghost Hound implemented use of psychological and philosophical elements to look into the developments surrounding the central characters of the series and piecing together the mysterious occurrences within the small town of Suiten. Like Serial Experiments Lain, Ghost Hound retains a subdued, mundane mood throughout its run during the show's normal mode and bumps up its suspense during moments when the boys experience out-of-body experiences in the spirit realm and dream of memories from their tragic pasts. The series does rather well at fleshing out the tragic pasts of Taro, Masayuki and Makoto where the series gets intothe heads of the boys as they perceive and/ or try to recall the events that occurred during their earlier years. In addition, we get to see the growth of their characters as they come to terms with their past tragedies as they come to understand their situations better.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of plot developments, Ghost Hound takes its time in unveiling pieces to the various paranormal occurrences taking place in the town. Strange creatures have been spotted at random points within the town and hints are dropped over a string of crimes having occurred around the time that Taro's abduction took place. In addition, the series does bring up seemingly unconnected situations which involve a fanatic local cult, a biotech plant and the young daughter of a shrine priest that Taro takes interest in. But as the series presses on, these situations clash together where their linearity makes enough sense at resolving any lingering plot developments to Ghost Hound once the character developments with the three boys get resolved.\\n\\n\r\nThe major element to Ghost Hound that will make or break one's enjoyment of the series are the frequent mentions and debates of psychological and philosophical concepts. Psychological analysis is frequent as Dr. Hirata is around at a number of points to bring up mental disorders of the brain that effect patients that he helps, in particular Taro. The philosophical element comes in the form of a number of theories brought up on spiritual and existential concepts connected to the out of body experiences that the boys have in their travels to the spirit realm. I do believe that these elements are relevant within the series to keep the audience guessing over whether the experiences with the boys are the result of either a spiritual experience or something of scientific basis coming off the mental scars they had from their pasts.\\n\\n\r\nThe only major flaw I found within the series was its final episode where the series seemingly introduced some new concepts that it never had time to fully develop and having a bright mood which isn't consistent with Ghost Hound's earlier episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, Ghost Hound does well enough at delivering with visuals and music to fit in well with the blurring of moods that the show presents at various points. In terms of the normal world, the show makes use of bright colors and defined details in rendering its scenery and character designs to fit with its mundane mood. The out of body experiences and flashbacks from the boys are what lead to the title's visual highlights. Various abstract settings are shown to create a seemingly unique atmosphere for the spiritual realms that the boys visit such as the nerves that make up Taro's brain, a room full of various monitors and the real world rendered in limited color. Adding to this unique experience are occasional first-person shots from the eyes of the boys as they either go in and out of consciousness or experiencing flashbacks, such as Taro trying to catch up with his sister through an alley.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to the series is mostly low-key and minimal, with music only added in whenever necessary to enhance mood within tense scenes. The OP and ED are unique choices to help one get into Ghost Hound with the OP's quirky and upbeat tone plus the ED's subdued and gentle ballad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ghost Hound proved to be quite the interesting mind trip for me with its implementation of psychology and mysticism in exploring the tragic pasts of Taro and his friends plus the mysterious developments occurring within the town they live in. I strongly recommend this series to anyone hoping for an anime that is outside the norm of conventional titles and will keep you guessing over what direction it will lead.",

            "content": "I kind of have mixed feelings towards Ghost Hound.  Being into MindF$#k type animes like Lain and Higurashi the plot immediately intrigued me. The eerie opening with the song Poltergeist was one of the few selective openings I didn't skip over after a few episodes(it set the mood).  Now on the topic of the story, I really enjoyed the complex  plot. The art is dark and well-done which definitely adds to the creepy element(which hardly lets off until the latter episodes). The sound in this anime is definitely  it's strong point. It could be called brilliant in terms of building upsuspense(I constantly had shivers sent down my spine throughout). In addition to that,  the ending is pretty well done. The character development is also good especially with the three main characters.  Each episode kept me wanting more which is surprising due to the slower pacing of the story. I remember finding myself at episode six wondering how are they going to fill 22 episodes. That might be just because I lack imagination. But anyways, the only obvious letdown of the story to me would be the ending. Which I felt was abrupt and left me with a few unanswered questions. In that sense, Ghost Hound left me a little empty(But hey, it could of been worse).  All in all, nothing short of an enjoyable series(enough to write a review on it).",

            "content": "When I first encountered this Anime, I was really excited because it was advertised as a dark, edgy show that was well produced; qualities that are very difficult to find in most shows.  The setting is in a small town that gives off such unsettling vibes that it sometimes gives the feeling that it could have been picked up by the silent hill franchise.  The characters are introduced well, and begin to get fleshed out with a plot that deviates completely from the classic Anime stereotypes.  In short, this Anime looks and sounds beautiful.But all of this sounds good, why the low score?  Unfortunately the Anime lacks the central drive of a plot to keep the show moving for the entire 26 episodes.  Sometime around the 17th episode mark, the plot does a COMPLETE 180, and the entire ambiance of the Anime is lost along the way.  The show goes from unsettling and dark to Shounen and 'we can do it' in 60 seconds; I can still feel the whiplash in my neck from trying to keep up with the abrupt change.  \\n\\n\r\n     All in all, the show is beautifully glossy and has a very original concept, but the director missed a great opportunity to make something great and instead succumbed into making something distinctly on the wrong side of mediocre.\\n",

            "content": "Shinreigari: Ghost Hound is a 22 episodes long Psychological/Mystery anime by Production IG that came out in 2007. After i finished it just recently, my first thought was: \"Man, i can\u00b4t believe it took me so long until i finally watched this!\"\r\nHowever...this show centers around three high school boys with traumatic experiences in the past, who try to solve a mysterious puzzle in the small mountain village of Suiten. \r\nI was mentally prepared for a brainf*** since Ghost Hound was created by the same guy who did Ghost in the Shell and a few important staff members also worked on Serial Experiments Lain. Nevertheless, despitebeing heavily influenced by psychoanalysis in the first half and a mix of mainly spirituality and a bit of theoretical physics in the second half, the story is actually not too hard to follow if you pay full attention. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a really fascinating story that completely drew me in right from the start with it\u00b4s somewhat dark and spooky appearance. The at first seemingly multiple plotlines come together to form one gigantic puzzle in a smart and sometimes unexpected way. Shinreigari also uses multiple \"unpleasant\" sound effects to add to the atmosphere and to get the viewer out of his cmfort zone even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest strenght of Ghost Hound in my opinion are the many important supporting characters. Each of them are portrayed in such a way that they could possibly turn into a pro- or antagonist at any given point as it is unclear what their own interests and intentions are. The character development is simply brillant, especially that of our main girl Miyako.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also offers a few unusual but great \"extras\" as it calls the episodes not episodes but \"focuses\" and titles every focus  after a scientific term. The preview of the next focus after the ending credits is always accompanied by a brief summary of an important moment in the history of science and/or psychoanalysis. What\u00b4s more, once you start this series you have a hard time to stop your session as Ghost Hound offers hands down some of the best cliffhangers i have ever come across.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of animation is crystal clear for 2007 standards and shouldn\u00b4t really upset anyone who stumbles across the show eight years later like myself. The ending song is beautiful, the jazz-like opening is very different from most anime OPs but in my opinion does not fit the show at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i, enjoyed Shinregari GHOST HOUND at lot. I marathoned it in just three sessions and i would definetly recommend marathoning this rather then watching it at a slow pace. So if you are in the mood for something darker, make sure you don\u00b4t miss this!\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Many anime strive for a horror element and settle for the gore.  Others try for the psychological approach and get lost in the relationships.  This, however, is a shining star among them all.\r\nGhost Hound foregoes all the gore and heads straight for the downright creepy.  The animation style, though soft and fairly unassuming, only enhances this creepy-factor once the ball starts rolling.  Each episode title is taken straight from psychology texts, and exploits the given theme with finesse and underhanded tact.\r\nNothing is overdone.  Everything is like a current flowing underground, or a train rumbling by only a mile away.You can't see it, but you can feel the presence.  The atmosphere is set with an amazing score which seems to taunt all those soft and unassuming characters with the terror to come.\\n\\n\r\nOnly it isn't obvious.  \\n\\n\r\nMany anime try to shove &quot;the horror of it all&quot; down your throat, leading to some nausea and perhaps a little surprise.  This, however, slips beteen the cracks and tugs at your primal half, makes you start to wonder whether or not you really are safe in your own head.  The imagery shifts like flashbacks from a memory only half-recalled (they address that topic, actually) and the atmospheric music only sucks you in deeper.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, too, are well-rounded and fascinating, from Makoto and is utterly horrifying grandma, to Masayuki and his social eccentricities, to Tarou and that FREAKY &quot;lucid dream&quot; he keeps having.  (&quot;Lucid Dream&quot; is episode 1)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf you love shows and movies that just crawl inside and start to make you think really hard about things you once thought were absolutes, then this is the show to see.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one downside is the lack of dialogue, but in a horror, images and sounds carry so much more meaning, and these images and sounds are guaranteed to make tingles rund down your backbone.  The other downside--a trifle, really--is that the first episode takes a few minutes to really take off, but once it does, the anime never slows down.\\n\\n\r\nIt is an anime for the true psychological horror fan, and Production I.G. was brilliant for making this their 20th anniversary release.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, those little astrally projected bodies?  Man, even if the show's creepy-factor doesn't appeal to you, those little things are just too cool for words.",

I must say, that this anime is a great job, perfect for a 20th anniversary release.\r\n~ s t o r y ~ 8 / 10 ~\r\nIf some of you think: 'Those cute characters and a psychological plot? No way!' I am glad to tell you, that you are wrong. At first, when I saw, that GH is of 22 episodes, I was sure, that it will be verbose and / or tedious (i'm used to13-episode psychological animes), but I'm glad I tried watching it despite that thoughts. Of course, the plot needs a half of the first episode to take off, but once it does, it doesn't stop (actually, it's going faster and faster to the climax). The anime is a specific type of an illustrated encyclopedia: trauma, mental disorders, possession, out-of-body experiences, mind, brain, afterlife and more - every one of these is shown in a few different points of view, either scientific or spiritual. I gave it an 8, because I just expected something more. The plot is not confusing at all, I mean, there is the puzzle-mode on, but once explained, it becomes perfectly clear. At least some of the aspects...\\n\\n\r\n~ a r t ~ 9 / 10 ~\\n\r\nI love the idea of different angles and showing the action from the characters point of wiew. The landscapes and character projects are quite nice. Some of the ghosts, retrospections or halucinations are drawn really CREEPY. And by creepy I mean, that at night when going to the bathroom you wish not to find anything like that in your room when you come back. They're so random, they give goosebumps. The thing I dislike, is what they did to OBE - but, oh well, it's just an anime, not a science book.\\n\\n\r\n~ s o u n d ~ 9 / 10 ~\\n\r\nNot much of music, but when it's finally playing in the background, it has a feel of GITS's soundtrack. Old japanese music, just without the vocals.\\n\r\nIMO the opening was the worst: it really didn't suit the anime.\\n\\n\r\n~ c h a r a c t e r ~ 1 0 / 1 0 ~\\n\r\nCharacters are the metier of Ghost Hound. Nicely designed, with vivid personalities. Everyone will find a bit of himself in some of them. \\n\\n\r\n~ O V E R A L L ~ 9 / 10 ~\\n\r\nGreat series with an enjoyable plot, nice art and sound and wonderful, mysterious characters. However, I recommend this anime only for people who like psychological series - others may think of Ghost Hound as a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nHave fun ^^.",

            "content": "Ghost Hound is a Supernatural, Psychological, Horror, Mystery, Drama series, produced by the critically acclaimed \u201cProduction I.G.\u201d studio. Unlike most horror series that feature plenty of shocking, gory moments and psychological dramas that show the absurd, extremes of the human psyche; Ghost Hounds goes for a more technical approach. Sadly this leads to a great series with an incredibly complex story.  \r\nIt is about four different kids who have suffered from different traumatic events; in their past and now have the ability to traverse this \u201cunseen world\u201d. That\u2019s just the initial plot of the series and as the story begins, you will see abunch of stuff and have no idea what on earth is going on. Slowly but surely, little bits of this mysterious and uncanny story are revealed and during this process you\u2019ll be force fed a lot of psychological terminology. Yet it still takes some time for the story to become somewhat interesting. Then you\u2019ll be able to enjoy the series, as it develops into a sensational experience, whilst learning a fair bit of neurology, psychology and Japanese folklore. At the same time it is easy to consider dropping the series, for those who are unable to get into it. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of this anime was superb, having an extraordinary amount of detail put into the little-less things and with interesting, surreal surroundings when expressing the unseen world. The characters were well designed and moved fluidly but the pale colour tones did make some look unappealing. At least the rich environments and scenery made up for the short comings.\\n\\n\r\nIt was pretty tricky to judge this anime on the quality of the sound, because there wasn\u2019t much there. During the weird apparitions and flashbacks there was a great deal of weird SFX used, to which is perfect for setting the creepy mood. However with barely any music at all, in the end, it just sounded pretty bland.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a mildly interesting anime showing the parallels of the psychological and the supernatural however other than the technical aspects of this anime (e.g. animation), this series can be a pretty dull and lifeless experience. With so much terminology to take in, anyone can feel like dropping this at any moment and going for a much easier show to understand. But the series does become fairly interesting to watch later on, when things become clearer and the story finally start to move forward. So before watching this series you\u2019ll have to think to yourself, \u201cIs this the type of series I would enjoy?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "REVIEW CONTAIN CONCLUSIVE SPOILER\r\nFor the first half of the show, Ghost Hound have got everything right, from the creepy soundtrack that formed its designated atmosphere to the countryside setting that we're so fond of in horror anime. The series gave off the same kind of atmosphere that Higurashi and Shiki gave me, which shows how great it was directed. The unique camera angle amplifying the creepy tone of the series to a level where \"horror\" would be one of the appropriate genre for the series while the colorful and unique representation of the \"hidden world\" surely did its job to allow the viewers to seethe story in a more frightening way, making them more prone to the dark assumptions that viewers can't help but to make in a series like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was perfect in almost every way, just enough room to maintain a balanced space, captivating the viewers with various thrilling experiences and allowing them to make assumption about what will happen next, whether its the horrifying secrets that the three main characters would find out about their past or the problems that forms around their morbid town. The show does maintain a large cast near the end of the series but all of them were thoroughly developed, what also support this is the three main characters as they were interesting to a certain point where seeing their interaction as they help each other uncover the secret to their past is one of the main focus, for both the series and its viewers.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the series does maintain a great sense of atmosphere and characters development, its ending fall short to what most viewer would have assumed for it to played out. Near the end of the series, the original plot (Solve Taro's past trauma, who did what and the various morbid discoveries that each character would discover as they delve deeper into the past and the \"hidden world\"),  was left behind to be replaced  with two new ones, which unfortunately ruin the ending for me, as these two new plot line have almost nothing to be relevant with the original purpose of the story, sure there were some connection here and there but it was far too fragile to be in truthful relation with the original story, it just felt like the show tried to expand its storytelling limit and failed pretty bad, resulting in the undesirable answer to the whole affair about Taro's kidnapping incident as the viewers only received a happy and simple resolution to the the scary kidnapping that was so well presented that it should have made most viewers expecting something a little bit more shudder worthy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Ghost Hound was a very well played out series from beginning... to the middle, for the way that the ending was told results in a total lost of the original plot. But don't get me wrong, if you're really into thrillers and the like, this series must be on your \"plan to watch\" or \"completed\" list because, ending aside, the series did a great job of presenting itself as a psychological thriller in many ways.",

Nothing is better than Ghost H*nt.\r\nSelling point(s):\r\nTop notch sound effect, interesting facts on researches, dark and mysterious atmosphere\r\nReason(s) of liking the anime:\r\nWell to start with, I am one of those horror fans.  1st episodes already caught my attention with their top notch story pace and astonishing sound effects, which really stirs up the eery atmosphere. In my honest opinion, this anime is like a marriage of Serial experimental Lain and Ghost Hunt( if you haven watch them, go watch em!). I am also interested of their homework done on the facts and researches regarding unexplained /truth of supernatural events. With all this combination of greatness, even though i am at only 10th episodes, it certainly my must-watch , till the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAdvice(s):\\n\r\n1) For all ages, definitely a must watch for those who likes horror , supernatural genre, not for the weak hearted.\\n",

            "content": "I just finished watching this anime and it wasn't good. It leaves the audience feeling incomplete as there are a lot of questions left unanswered, and also with a heavy sense of disappointment. When the last episode ended the first thing that came to my mind was, \"...ok...so...is that it?\". I'd only recommend this anime to people who don't really want to be drawn and hooked to an anime, but those who are just wanting something to pass the time with and have absolutely nothing better to do. (I hate being this harsh, but it really wasn't good)\r\nStory: 4\r\nLet me just start off by sayingthat the concept of the story was promising and deeply intriguing. However, despite this there was bad linkage, poor pace, and a very poorly thought out conclusion. Let me explain. The anime is about 3 boys who become friends and start to experience soul traveling through a series of events. The beginning is quite promising as the main protagonists all have interesting dark backgrounds, and the authors also utilize very dark themes such as suicide, and the occult. However, despite all these amazing ingredients they didn't seem to do a lot with it. Yes, they create very good and fascinating concepts, but they failed to develop it any further or add any more depth to it. All it turned out to be was a good idea and nothing else. Every time something interesting would happen, they would just drop it and leap onto another concept. Additionally, the pace of the anime was very dragged out. And each episode just created a feeling a heaviness and not excitement. If you're looking for a fast paced engaging psychological horror/thriller this is not it. In all, the story, just didn't hit the mark, but simply fell flat on it's face.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art work was very good in my opinion.(but I'm not a very \"artsy\" person so don't quote me on this) The drawing of the characters, and the background/scenery were all quite beautifully done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI really liked the sound which was utilized in the anime. I thought it was superb. The eerie like sounds they would use, and also the kind of disconnected far off sounds which were heard when the characters would be soul traveling was very interesting and set the mood. However, unfortunately, since the story within the anime was slow paced and un-engaging, the sound effects did little to increase the enjoyability of it...well it did do a little, but not all that much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nAs I said before, the main characters all had dark backgrounds which made them interesting at first but then as the anime continued, the development was very poorly done. The only character which was very interesting, and whose pieces fell all together at the end was Makoto. He was the character who really pushed me into watching the anime through to the end, as he was the only one which sort of made it interesting/engaging for me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3 and Overalll Score: 3 \\n\r\nIn all, I didn't enjoy this anime. It was dragged out, there were a lot of unanswered questions and the conclusion was just rushed. The plot failed to really go anywhere interesting, and most of the characters were not very intriguing nor had good character development. \\n\r\nWatch it if you have nothing better to do, but honestly, I wouldn't recommend it.",

            "content": "Story 8/10\r\nOnly on the penultimate episode did I discover that the original suppose for this series was penned by Masamune Shirow. It doesn't really show, although as that was in 1987 it isn't so surprising. Why it took 20 years to make such a great anime is anyone's guess.\r\nAnyway, the story is very good. A dark and moody tale at heart, this anime mulls through the lives of its protagonists and a semi-real world of astral projection and spirits. It does so in a way immediately attributable to Nakamura Ryuutarou's (Serial Experiments Lain) direction. I enjoyed SEL's rasping static sensory deprivation, and I love ithere too. The bassy atmosphere death rattles the viewer through several inter-connected disturbing backstories, and drapes the lead characters in harsh, heavy shadows.\\n\\n\r\nThe dark story involves the \"unseen world\" of disconnected spirits, and is played out as part mystery, part science. The exposition and investigation is mainly from the perspective of juniour high school students, connected by those dark backstories; and this is perhaps one of the small blemishes on the series. While the \"difficult past and large responsibilty on young shoulders\" plot element is powerful despite its regular use in anime, I think the children retained a little too much of their childish appearance during the progression of this series. Indeed it was not Shirow's intention to have such young protagonists.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSimulteneously beautiful and slightly wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality is very high, as you would expect from Production I.G. But perhaps the tones and designs of the children, again, bring the show down slightly. The atmosphere created by the backdrops, creatures and settings throughout was exceptional, but the flat-coloured characters distracted slightly from that and just felt a little out of place. A few bad choices were also made during astral projection. The initial \"baby\" characters look a little too silly, as do some of the later apparitions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, the designs and smoothness need some applause for their left-of-mainstream quality. Very well put together; sometimes even creepy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLike SEL, one of the things that brings the atmosphere and animation and script together is the sound used to bind them. The fuzz, the buzz, the scrapes, the dinks - all work fantastically with the mood and direction. Although you could argue that the general impression is almost too similar to SEL, it works very well regardless. OP is also well suited. Japanese VAs are good, and mild-mannered enough to pull off the roles very professionally and convincingly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe very believable story behind what is something of a fantastical show is exposed beautifully through the main cast. Common personality types crop up but remain under-done to perfection, easily escaping the horrible tendency in asian media to ham-up emotions. The leads are well defined and maturely designed. There could be a little more conflict in there, and some things perhaps shouldn't go quite as smoothly as they tend to do for those characters, but I was very satisfied with the way things turned out. All but one or two characters are important in their own way, and most hold themselves together well and deserve their screen time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.9/10\\n\\n\r\nWith such good all round scores it's tempting to go even higher with the overall mark, but all I'll do is recommend this to anyone who enjoys a mature anime. Though the series runs for 22 episodes there were no points when I felt cheated because of that. There's no filler in here. The fascinating story unfolds generously, without recourse to distraction. Although I felt a couple of things could have been explained a little more, the ending was a satisfactory finish for what is literally a one-in-a-thousand anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow to hunt out the next classic hidden within swathes of soggy cardboard and freaky pillows.",

            "content": "Let me preface this \"8\" by saying I thought the storyline for this anime was really terrific! A definite 10/10. It is complex without being too over-the-top (for the genre it is under, that is) and unfolds gradually, but not too slowly either. Each character, minor or protagonist, has an ever expanding role and someone you may think you will only see once or in the background often has a greater story to tell. \r\nAnother wonderful aspect of this anime is that rarely is someone as they appear to be and where certain situations could have played out in a typical fashiontook a very different role instead. My favourite example of this was Taro's therapist/counselor, Dr. Hirata, but there are a number of others that follow.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while some of the plotlines intersect, the one's that do not, still believeably flow within the plot and are usually very interesting. It isn't often I have come across subplots that while separate,continue to be relevant and intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP song is fun and different, not completely makign sense to the anime itself right away, but then it grows on you and feels as though it actually fits rather well. I still couldn't get into the ending theme song or the scratchy static noises the anime sometimes used as suspenseful \"Oh no! What will happen in the next episode!!\" sound bites or for re-capping an episode, however that is my own preference and I suspect others would disagree. \\n\\n\r\n The art style was also interesting to me, not just for the art itself but the direction it took. One of the best examples of this is the landscape, which is as much a character itself as it is a background. It is at times, such an important element of the plot, you forget the it is setting and not an actor, because it isn't just land as a setting, but it has its own history and plotline which is explored. \\n\\n\r\n Another example of the art talent lies in this anime's direction. There are some very interesting perspectives and angles the directors and artists chose to take for it, some of which pertain to the aforementioned land uses, while others are due to a particular characters perspective or to create a creepy atmosphere or tell the story better. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't swear by it or recommend it to everyone I know, I would recommend it generally, because overall, I found this show to be slower, creepy and intense, but also original, subtle and engaging. The best description I have read for this anime came from the review by Cyh when 's/he' states: \"Nothing is overdone. Everything is like a current flowing underground, or a train rumbling by only a mile away.\" Which sounds rather abstract on paper (or in this case, the screen), but after having seen the full breadth of the show makes a great deal of sense to me. Like a river it seems to meander, but unlike many anime by the end has come to a place where it has expanded fully and reached an entertaining crescendo.",

            "content": "The show starts out with a really creepy opening of something flying around and only getting glimpses of what\u2019s happening from his eyes. We find out that it was all a damn dream from our main character. Taro Komori seems like a rather normal boring guy who lives with a family of brewers. And yet they bring up strange things about his past that seem to be bothering him. I can\u2019t lie, even with knowing the description of the anime; this all was a bit confusing in the beginning. They jump around a lot and the only thing I really got was that Taro wasable to astro project and has dreams of the past. As the show goes on, it does get slightly better and there are times that they kept me on the edge of my seat but it is extremely logical and have a mountain of dialogue before something gets done. \\n\\n\r\nMasayuki seems much more like the person we should be following. He is the outsider who is gathering information on what goes on around the other two. He seems to have more of an understanding that things are happening then Taro and Makoto.  It\u2019s that or Taro and Masayuki\u2019s stories should switch a bit. Miyako is pretty silent but is also one that I wished we could get more info on right up front. She seems to have even more understanding as to what is going on about the spiritual world. \\n\\n\r\nI like how they show the outer body experience like being in water to where you can\u2019t really hear anything around you. What I don\u2019t like is that they seem to have only one goal throughout the whole show and that\u2019s to find out what went on a long time ago. It just makes the characters sound like broken records at times. Now I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s no good. I did like it but I wish that they had more episodic ghost show with the overall plot mixed in with it.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of this show talks about the mind and how philology plays a big part in what happens when you have trauma at a young age. Unfortunately, it seems that they try to base it all on ghosts and astro projections. Sometimes it feels like they are just trying to make up excuses to what\u2019s going on with the kids. At some point, they even talk about the destruction of nature though I really don\u2019t see what it has to do with all of the supernatural ideas or the children turning into strange beings.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation lacks just a little, making it look a little like Sayonara Zetsubo-Sensei with a little bit of CG mixed into it. Sometimes it looks a bit on the plain side, not really standing out from any other anime or even lacking from others. Still, I have to give it props for trying to be different then the others. The close ups give a very creepy look to the show. Unfortunately, some of the characters look like they have large heads even when not in a spiritual form. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is really hunting and creepy in the opening, but set the mood well. What doesn\u2019t set the mood is the basic clips from the show. It just seems like a lack of love was given to the opening in this aspect. The scripting is a bit odd; sometimes the characters seem to talk to someone even if they haven\u2019t said anything at all. There are also some strange passes in the way sentences are said and sometimes the volume isn\u2019t right. Even with the strange script, I still like how the voices are. They have voices I would imagine them to have.\\n",

            "content": "Where do I begin?... The premise is nice. The execution was fair. \r\nTaro (our whiney main-main character), Makoto (rebel extraordinaire) and Masayuki (professional milf hunter) are our three almost immediate MC's for this evening. They all have dramatic pasts that lead them to spend the rest of their days with regret not far from their minds. Masayuki is the bridge that connects Tarou and Makoto with his intrusive personality. Miyako is later introduced as main character 4? yeah... I guess we just hand out MC like it's no big deal around here. Don't question it. Read the synopsis if you want more, but it's reallyhard not to spoil anything, so I have to be vague.\\n\\n\r\nFlaws: I would like to mention the flaws before I mention what makes this anime stand out. This show... tries to touch on the subject spirituality as well as science of the brain. Cool, right?  Meh, sorta. The problem is that they later try to mix in religion as well as try to have some sort of crush between two MC's. It's here where the animu starts to derail a bit. It tried to add a fourth boy, Michio to the mix who can instantly do this thing that the other boys learned to do (while keeping a human form) called soul traveling. A sort of out of body experience. The problem here is that the other boys had a reason to soul travel. To solve traumas. He just does it without having any. No explanation is given either. The crush thing goes no where, so there was really no reason to have it. They also only touch on religion briefly before just going for a cult approach. Oh yeah... Character development? Nope, everyone that needed it just 180's near the end of the anime. What little dialogue we get starts to get choppy near the end.\\n\\n\r\nWhat it does well: This animu brings up a lot about different diseases and conditions with the brain. It also effectively brings up the spiritual side of the coin in a kind of speculative point of view. Miyako is probably the show's best character in terms of character development she goes from not understanding her place in the world (it's implied so you have to pay attention) to finally accepting her dad as an understanding individual. The show also has that small but big feeling in the sense that you actually feel like there is a world beyond what you are seeing by referencing newspaper articles and places in the world. I like that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this anime did what it needed to and an itty bit more. It's an anime to get you thinking and really nothing beyond that. Sure there are feels here and there but without knowing what the other characters think other than Taro it just falls flat. I enjoyed it, almost couldn't stop watching, it's good for it's time. If only they polished up the last few episodes a bit.",

            "content": "This is not a synopsis.\r\nGhost Hound is an anime that I stumbled across a year and a half ago while looking for more fuel for a horror genre anime craze that I managed to suffer.  Upon watching the first episode and nearly quitting halfway through, I dropped the series...  until three weeks ago.  I started watching it again, I decided I was going to drill my mind right through it.  So I did.  I found that the, boring, static plot was unfolding very slowly.  There were no lovable or badass characters as far as I'm concerned, nothing interesting, nothingthought provocative at all for the first few episodes - probably just a background setup.  But suddenly, though I dare not unveil what happens, my mind is blown.  I managed to spend the rest of the series waiting for the episode where it is revealed that all the characters were on shrooms, but it never happened.\\n\\n\r\nStory:  Mind blowing.  There are few known variables.  The story is where the variables emerge from.  I would definitely say there is no filler, that's a plus.  Some characters are digging for events of the past (lost memory, truth), some are striving for the present (trying to rid themselves of fear, or family related problems).  All in all, the story is OK, I'd give it a 8 if it weren't for the pacing issues at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Art is good.  Doesn't really stand out, but it conveys its intended purpose just fine.  There are plenty of psychedelic scenes that are done well enough.  8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is where this series shines.  It manages to converge audio and video in one big mind trip.  The sounds are very unique.  I don't even recall anything besides the OP and ending that could be called \"music\" by the general term, but it is indeed fantastic.  10 points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Characters are good.  One that is constantly angry, withdrawn, and rather burdened by his family's past.  In my opinion, he is the best character in the series.  The next best is the main heroine - also withdrawn, unwilling to associate with the males of the story at first, she eventually warms up partially. The primary character of the series is one which is concerned at first with his own fear, but he eventually shifts his concerns to everyone else.  The last character that is listed as a main character is just trying to erase the results of bad deeds of a time that predates the story.  Characters are overall so-so.  7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I won't say I didn't like this series - I certainly did.  It just lacked the hooking factor of some other anime I have seen.  The characters and story did not support the enjoyment factor as much as the sound and audio mix.  7/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Average of everything!  8/10.",

            "content": "In short, this is one of the best anime series I have seen so far.  In one word it\u2019s profound, and it\u2019s a must-see, regardless of the genre you prefer. The only thing that made me falter in giving it a ten was the art which I did not enjoy at all. It\u2019s too simplistic and disproportional. But it actually manages to compensate in a way I thought it impossible.\r\nThe story starts off innocently. There's a boy named Taro who has had a very traumatic experience with which he tries to deal with. However, the feel of the story is ominous from the beginning.Even though it seems normal enough, you cant's help but wait in anticipation for something bad to happen.  Soon, strange things do start to happen, and slowly we are drawn into the Unseen world, full of both beautiful and disturbing things.\\n\r\nThe story has a beautiful flow, and it really develops perfectly. Nothing is rushed or muddled, and even though it deals with ghosts and the paranormal, it\u2019s surprisingly plausible, mostly because it questions the established notions of science (neurology, psychology, physics) and it offers an alternative view on things that we think are perfectly explained by the science. This scientific trait of the story gives it an extra eerie twist, because it questions reality explained by reason and logic. What is reality and what is the dream world? In which do we reside?\\n\r\nEvery single character has a personality not made according to your standard anime-character-mould. And this personality develops with the story, which makes this series exceptionally enjoyable. You have to stick with them in order to see who they really are. Every character seems to be more then it meets the eye.  It\u2019s just a feel of the character, not some mysterious past tragedy, or something conventional like that. The fact that the main cast is made out of high school boys makes this anime even spookier. They are all very troubled, the way you don\u2019t want  a fifteen-year-old to be troubled. The adults don\u2019t offer any consolation, and although most try to understand, they are simply at a lost as to what to do in these peculiar circumstances.\\n\r\nI saved the best for the last. The sound in Ghost Hound is the most amazing, extraordinary thing I\u2019ve so far encountered in any anime. It plays with your brain in a way you don\u2019t even realize until you turn off the lights and go to sleep.  After watching the first four episodes, I was not scared, however I had one of the worst nightmares ever that night, and it was all sound. The sounds that prevail in this anime are something I call night sounds. When everyone and everything is asleep, you can hear the furniture moaning, you can hear the wind stroking the walls outside your room. There\u2019s also a lot of noise in Ghost Hound which gives it a perfect feel, and some jazz which is maybe the best genre for this anime, with its unpredictability. \\n\r\nAnd I have to stress that there is no horror tricks with sudden loud sounds combined with a scary scene. It\u2019s all atmosphere, the combination of sound, story and characters that makes this anime amazing. Ghost Hound  is eerie, disturbing, it will make you uncomfortable, but it won\u2019t use some cheap tricks to make you jump in your seat..\\n\\n",

            "content": "Wow, this was a great thriller title. Ghost Hound implemented use of psychological and philosophical elements to look into the developments surrounding the central characters of the series and piecing together the mysterious occurrences within the small town of Suiten. Like Serial Experiments Lain, Ghost Hound retains a subdued, mundane mood throughout its run during the show's normal mode and bumps up its suspense during moments when the boys experience out-of-body experiences in the spirit realm and dream of memories from their tragic pasts. The series does rather well at fleshing out the tragic pasts of Taro, Masayuki and Makoto where the series gets intothe heads of the boys as they perceive and/ or try to recall the events that occurred during their earlier years. In addition, we get to see the growth of their characters as they come to terms with their past tragedies as they come to understand their situations better.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of plot developments, Ghost Hound takes its time in unveiling pieces to the various paranormal occurrences taking place in the town. Strange creatures have been spotted at random points within the town and hints are dropped over a string of crimes having occurred around the time that Taro's abduction took place. In addition, the series does bring up seemingly unconnected situations which involve a fanatic local cult, a biotech plant and the young daughter of a shrine priest that Taro takes interest in. But as the series presses on, these situations clash together where their linearity makes enough sense at resolving any lingering plot developments to Ghost Hound once the character developments with the three boys get resolved.\\n\\n\r\nThe major element to Ghost Hound that will make or break one's enjoyment of the series are the frequent mentions and debates of psychological and philosophical concepts. Psychological analysis is frequent as Dr. Hirata is around at a number of points to bring up mental disorders of the brain that effect patients that he helps, in particular Taro. The philosophical element comes in the form of a number of theories brought up on spiritual and existential concepts connected to the out of body experiences that the boys have in their travels to the spirit realm. I do believe that these elements are relevant within the series to keep the audience guessing over whether the experiences with the boys are the result of either a spiritual experience or something of scientific basis coming off the mental scars they had from their pasts.\\n\\n\r\nThe only major flaw I found within the series was its final episode where the series seemingly introduced some new concepts that it never had time to fully develop and having a bright mood which isn't consistent with Ghost Hound's earlier episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, Ghost Hound does well enough at delivering with visuals and music to fit in well with the blurring of moods that the show presents at various points. In terms of the normal world, the show makes use of bright colors and defined details in rendering its scenery and character designs to fit with its mundane mood. The out of body experiences and flashbacks from the boys are what lead to the title's visual highlights. Various abstract settings are shown to create a seemingly unique atmosphere for the spiritual realms that the boys visit such as the nerves that make up Taro's brain, a room full of various monitors and the real world rendered in limited color. Adding to this unique experience are occasional first-person shots from the eyes of the boys as they either go in and out of consciousness or experiencing flashbacks, such as Taro trying to catch up with his sister through an alley.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to the series is mostly low-key and minimal, with music only added in whenever necessary to enhance mood within tense scenes. The OP and ED are unique choices to help one get into Ghost Hound with the OP's quirky and upbeat tone plus the ED's subdued and gentle ballad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ghost Hound proved to be quite the interesting mind trip for me with its implementation of psychology and mysticism in exploring the tragic pasts of Taro and his friends plus the mysterious developments occurring within the town they live in. I strongly recommend this series to anyone hoping for an anime that is outside the norm of conventional titles and will keep you guessing over what direction it will lead.",

            "content": "I kind of have mixed feelings towards Ghost Hound.  Being into MindF$#k type animes like Lain and Higurashi the plot immediately intrigued me. The eerie opening with the song Poltergeist was one of the few selective openings I didn't skip over after a few episodes(it set the mood).  Now on the topic of the story, I really enjoyed the complex  plot. The art is dark and well-done which definitely adds to the creepy element(which hardly lets off until the latter episodes). The sound in this anime is definitely  it's strong point. It could be called brilliant in terms of building upsuspense(I constantly had shivers sent down my spine throughout). In addition to that,  the ending is pretty well done. The character development is also good especially with the three main characters.  Each episode kept me wanting more which is surprising due to the slower pacing of the story. I remember finding myself at episode six wondering how are they going to fill 22 episodes. That might be just because I lack imagination. But anyways, the only obvious letdown of the story to me would be the ending. Which I felt was abrupt and left me with a few unanswered questions. In that sense, Ghost Hound left me a little empty(But hey, it could of been worse).  All in all, nothing short of an enjoyable series(enough to write a review on it).",

            "content": "When I first encountered this Anime, I was really excited because it was advertised as a dark, edgy show that was well produced; qualities that are very difficult to find in most shows.  The setting is in a small town that gives off such unsettling vibes that it sometimes gives the feeling that it could have been picked up by the silent hill franchise.  The characters are introduced well, and begin to get fleshed out with a plot that deviates completely from the classic Anime stereotypes.  In short, this Anime looks and sounds beautiful.But all of this sounds good, why the low score?  Unfortunately the Anime lacks the central drive of a plot to keep the show moving for the entire 26 episodes.  Sometime around the 17th episode mark, the plot does a COMPLETE 180, and the entire ambiance of the Anime is lost along the way.  The show goes from unsettling and dark to Shounen and 'we can do it' in 60 seconds; I can still feel the whiplash in my neck from trying to keep up with the abrupt change.  \\n\\n\r\n     All in all, the show is beautifully glossy and has a very original concept, but the director missed a great opportunity to make something great and instead succumbed into making something distinctly on the wrong side of mediocre.\\n",

            "content": "Shinreigari: Ghost Hound is a 22 episodes long Psychological/Mystery anime by Production IG that came out in 2007. After i finished it just recently, my first thought was: \"Man, i can\u00b4t believe it took me so long until i finally watched this!\"\r\nHowever...this show centers around three high school boys with traumatic experiences in the past, who try to solve a mysterious puzzle in the small mountain village of Suiten. \r\nI was mentally prepared for a brainf*** since Ghost Hound was created by the same guy who did Ghost in the Shell and a few important staff members also worked on Serial Experiments Lain. Nevertheless, despitebeing heavily influenced by psychoanalysis in the first half and a mix of mainly spirituality and a bit of theoretical physics in the second half, the story is actually not too hard to follow if you pay full attention. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a really fascinating story that completely drew me in right from the start with it\u00b4s somewhat dark and spooky appearance. The at first seemingly multiple plotlines come together to form one gigantic puzzle in a smart and sometimes unexpected way. Shinreigari also uses multiple \"unpleasant\" sound effects to add to the atmosphere and to get the viewer out of his cmfort zone even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest strenght of Ghost Hound in my opinion are the many important supporting characters. Each of them are portrayed in such a way that they could possibly turn into a pro- or antagonist at any given point as it is unclear what their own interests and intentions are. The character development is simply brillant, especially that of our main girl Miyako.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also offers a few unusual but great \"extras\" as it calls the episodes not episodes but \"focuses\" and titles every focus  after a scientific term. The preview of the next focus after the ending credits is always accompanied by a brief summary of an important moment in the history of science and/or psychoanalysis. What\u00b4s more, once you start this series you have a hard time to stop your session as Ghost Hound offers hands down some of the best cliffhangers i have ever come across.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of animation is crystal clear for 2007 standards and shouldn\u00b4t really upset anyone who stumbles across the show eight years later like myself. The ending song is beautiful, the jazz-like opening is very different from most anime OPs but in my opinion does not fit the show at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i, enjoyed Shinregari GHOST HOUND at lot. I marathoned it in just three sessions and i would definetly recommend marathoning this rather then watching it at a slow pace. So if you are in the mood for something darker, make sure you don\u00b4t miss this!\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Ghost Hound is an anime based on mystery and paranormal events. I have rewatched it several times over the years and I can say that it's quite enjoyable.\r\nStory: The story starts with Komamori Taro, a boy who, at the age of 3, was kidnapped together with his sister. They were left alone strapped to some beds in an old abandoned hospital for days before they were found, at which point Taro's sister Mizuka was already dead. Through the series we see Taro trying to deal with the trauma from that period, even as the series go more into the supernatural. I think the story isvery good, though there are some problems with the pacing (but not much) and the story can be hard to follow at times. Also, I think that they could have taken a bit more time on the ending, maybe extended it by an episode.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The art style is great, vividly switching between grey tones, contrasts and strong colors to amplify the mood of the show. The same goes for most part for the sound as well, as the sound have been tuned so you'll feel there's something supernatural and/or creepy about the sounds and voices in the Hidden Realm.\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are well made with their own back stories, personalities and problems to deal with.\\n\r\nOverall: It's a good show that could have been slightly better, given longer time. It should be a good watch for most people who enjoy mystery, supernatural stuff, some drama and a bit of comedy.\\n\r\nEnjoy",

You decide.\r\n Though my understanding of this anime, Shinreigari: Ghost Hound, It is about a boy, named Tarou Komori, who had been kidnapped, along with his older sister, at the age of three years old. He was the only one who made it out alive.\r\n Tarou and his friends decide to investigate on this matter eleven years later.\r\nAs the story builds, you start to figure out that the kidnapping was not what you thought it was; it had a greater meaning to it. (Not goingto spoil it for you, sorry)\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- The opening song was awesome.\\n\r\n- The story builds over time which is a good thing for an anime of the mystery genre.\\n\r\n- You get a new perspective on the subject of \"Out of Body Experiences\" which is a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- I didn't really understand what Masayuki's father and Reika Outori's relationship was. (Maybe I'm just too young to understand or something?)\\n\r\n- Whenever someone saw a spirit  and it goes away, it was as if they were hallucinating or something because sometimes other people don't see what they saw. (I don't know, it just seems weird to me.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nIt was an awesome anime and I really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to people who like mysteries or things that are supernatural. And also I would recommend this to people who don't mind the mentioning of different gods.",

It manages to be fun and profound at the same time.  \r\nIt touched on so many things of the I base my own spiritual philosophy on:  The Apparent World, the Unseen World(s), that we are spiritual beings first and physical beings second, that everything is part of SPIRIT and has a level of consciousness, our \"mind\" is more than our brain, that the emotions we attach to events/things mold our lives and frequently need clearing, that intense negative emotions attract even morenegative energy from this world and from beyond, the quantum concept of the matrix that is SPIRIT, and more.  They even talked about energy clearing techniques like eye movement and tapping, energy meridians, and such.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd on top of all that, it was a well crafted story with simple, yet effective character designs and lush landscapes.  Its rural setting was also a welcome change from the usual urban crush.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound track is amazing.  If at all possible, watch this one with a good sound system.  Other than the awesome opening theme, I am not talking about a lot of music, but rather sound effects, tension building asian flutes and drums, static, breathing, heart beats, and low level frequencies you don't hear but feel.  Ghost Hound is the first Masterpiece I've seen in a long, long time.",

            "content": "If you're looking for an anime with no fan service, one that works hard to portray its atmosphere without falling back on flashy, but lazy and common, background music and explosions and violence, I highly recommend Ghost Hound. It's very atmospheric and is enjoyed best by yourself, home alone, all lights off. Its art, music, dialogue, and plot work hard to create a thrilling, creepy, visceral experience that dabbles equally in the paranormal and in science.\r\nThe audio/visual experience on its own makes the show well worth watching. I could feel the anxiety, the panic, that the main characters felt as they confronted their trauma andthe dark mystery of the town. I will admit that some of the depictions of spirits are on the goofy side, but overall the art in this series (including the music/audio) is very well done in terms of portraying a mood to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nI also enjoyed the overall story arch and character development. You watch the main characters grow as they work to confront their pasts and the dark mysteries pervading Suiten, the town they live in. Adding in psychological explanations for the 'soul travelling' and other experiences, in addition to the religious/spiritual explanations, is an interesting twist on what might otherwise be a typical paranormal thriller. It might leave you wondering who's right -- psychology or spirituality?\\n\\n\r\nThe story dabbles in some big themes, largely perception of one's self and surroundings, and connections between spirituality and psychology. While I felt the ending left me wanting (just a little), the show did successfully get me to consider some deeper questions without obviously pushing those questions onto me. I highly, highly recommend to anyone who tends to enjoy more mature, thoughtfully created stories.",

I first started watching it years ago, but never committed to finishing it for reasons unknown. Starting from episode one, I once again found myself intrigued. Cringing at frightening scenes, and enjoying the overall story. I like to keep my reviews somewhat brief, but with this piece, it will be hard on the account of the many tides it takes you through.\r\nLet's start with the best aspects of the series. The animation was captivating. The style and color patterns were exceptional, but the animation wasat it's prime during the \"scarier\" scenes. These \"scarier\" scenes are worth watching alone. They were truly unique to Ghost Hound, and I haven't seen anything similar to them. While the art was great, the sound had to be  the best aspect of this piece. It was consistently accurate to the situation at hand, and flowed flawlessly with the story. Speaking of, the story was great in many ways. It seemed to cover most major genres in one way or another. The concept was again, unique to the series itself, and typical cliches took a rain-check as well. I'll button up the positives by noting the satisfying ending, all though adding a bit more wouldn't have hurt.\\n\\n\r\nWell, time to pick out some negatives. The biggest blemish I witnessed had to fall in the execution portion. Parts and pieces of the story seemed to fall out of relevance or get scrapped all together. More could have been done throughout the story to fill these gaps without trying too hard. Also, certain characters seemed to be convenient pawns, while offering little to the story itself. I'll draw the curtain on this segment by again touching on the ending. More could have been done. With the last scene especially. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ghost Hound was a powerful, easy to watch series. I never really got bored, and enjoyed every episode. For whatever reason it I highly recommend watching it in Autumn, just feels like the proper time. While it did touch on every genre, I'd fit it most under mystery/thriller, so if you have a particular niche for those, definitely give it watch! \\n\\n\r\nI give Ghost Hound a mighty 10/10 shrine steps",

            "content": "I've decided to watch this anime, it was made for the 20th anniversary of Production I.G.\r\nArt: I\u2019ve watched it in 1080p, and I must say it\u2019s superb! They put a lot of detail into the landscapes, scenery and to the background. I love the angles, the first person view when they are in OBE. The only thing I\u2019m not happy with is their beginning forms when they are in OBE. The monsters in the Unseen World look really strange, sometimes even disturbing. 9/10\r\nCharacters: They are nicely designed, everyone will find a bit of himself in some of them. My favourite was Miyako, the Shinto priest\u2019sdaughter, who has the ability to see ghosts, and sometimes she is possessed by spirits. She is acts mature for her age (she is an elementary school student). I also have to mention the counselor of Tarou, though he has a minor role, I found him a bit creepy.  Also, it\u2019s really rare when  I\u2019ve felt so much hatred against a fictional character, she was Nomiko, the head of the religon started by the Oogami family. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound, music: Probably this is the best thing about this anime! Although there wasn\u2019t much music going there (mostly traditional Japanese drums), the sound effects were very well used! The sounds are very unique. During the flashbacks, and some of the creepy scenes they perfectly set up the mood. The seiyuu team did very good job as well 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOP, ED: Opening: it\u2019s different. Although for the first few listening it doesn\u2019t make so much sense, but it grows on you. Ending: I really, really love it! :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Enjoyable plot, nice art and sounds, interesting elements, mysterious characters. Some say the ending was a bit rushed, (though at first the pace was really slow) and it didn\u2019t answer most of the questions, it might be true. I watched this series in 2 days, I tried to pay attention to everything, and I didn\u2019t find too much, or really important things unanswered. I have to admit, I started watching it for some horror stuff, (last year I watched Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, I wanted to see something similar) but it developed something more, different. About the half of the series the creepy stuff disappeared, and it rather focuses to the psychological things, but the story kept me watching this. It\u2019s almost a masterpiece, but something is missing from it. So I have to say if you\u2019re a psychological/horror fan, this is a must-watch. \\n\\n\r\n(This review is also avalaible in my blog)",

            "content": "I was surprised by this show. I went in with admittedly high expectations, and for the most part they were met. On the other hand, it was definitely too short: the last episode left a lot of loose ends and unresolved issues that could have been explored if the anime had been just two episodes longer.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story was fairly solid all the way through. My biggest problem was that it really fell apart at the end. It wasn't a dramatic and show-breaking failure, but it's unfortunate that all of the events in the show culminated in a half-hearted conclusion that left too many questionsunanswered. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8/10, 9/10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the sound effects in the show: it actually reminded me a lot of Boogiepop Phantom, with noises that would be disturbing and jarringly out of place. The art was also pretty good, though the \"baby\" projections were more of an eyesore than they were disturbing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were definitely the strongest aspect of the show. To be honest, it was probably the support characters I liked more than anyone else: I didn't find Taro to be especially deep, and though it was repeatedly hinted Masayuki had a much more complex personality than he revealed, there was very little development in that direction, which just made him feel cliched. Of the main characters, Makato was definitely my favorite in that he demonstrated the most growth, but I was really pleased to see Michio grow from being a support character to joining the main cast. Likewise, the sub-plot (if you can call it that) with Taro's psychiatrist was also very interesting, and his personality was virtually the exact opposite of what I'd expected, which was refreshing. That said, toward the end, there were a few things that felt too rushed (namely the developments concerning Taro and Masayuki's mothers), and also a few unexplained relationships that were hinted at but should have been better explained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show up to the finale, but I went into the last episode feeling that it would be impossible to have a satisfying conclusion, and that unfortunately proved to be the case. In light of everything they could have done with the show, I'm grateful that most of the choices were generally good, but I can't help but feel the plot got lost during the character development in the middle of the series, which ultimately made it impossible to finish well.\\n\\n\r\n*Slight update- in retrospect, judging a show based largely on it's final episode is rather unfair. It's quite entertaining up until then, and my score hopefully reflects that better*",

            "content": "When I started watching ghost hound I was drawn in by something. I immediately thought to turn it off because I found it boring and somewhat pointless, but what drew me to watch more was the scare factor. The sounds on the show were horrifying and they knew just the right way to get the audience attention. The plot was so scattered that its quite hard to explain what the story was about. The story that I got out of it was a boy who went through a horrible accident where his sister ended up dieing. In the story they bring a few characters intoplay somehow relating them the the boys incident. All of the boys start going through something called soul traveling and weird things begin to happen. I was very disappointed in this story because I feel if they would have stuck to a simple plot or was rearranged better this could have been a good story. It felt very mediocre and I felt it needed directed better. I really wouldn't suggest this anime to anyone, unless there real bored and wanted something odd to watch, or to waste time.",

Specifically, there isn't a concrete issue that they deal with, there are a lot of problems and disturbing situations that this teenagers must experience. The show is mysterious until the end. There are a lot of things left unexplained, but maybe it is better for humans not to know certain things or at least I believe that this might be thereason the creator didn't reveal (or even didn't think of) the truth behind the unseen world in which the characters travel constantly. \\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art was nice. Every character had unique features, and the details shown in the town are also really beautiful. Finally, I should state that the spirit of the prehistoric animals were also quite interesting.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIn this series, some of the scenes didn't actually have background music, which made everything more realistic. Also the music generally was kind of traditional. Finally I really liked the opening and ending, especially the ending.\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nEvery character in this series was unique, both in appearance and personality. There was deep character development even for some characters that were not really so important in the show. The main characters grow stronger as time passes by and that can be clearly seen at the end.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFinally I can say that this show made me really want to watch the next episode as soon as possible. It was really addicting, I wanted the mysteries to be solved and was curious to see what would happen next.\\n\\n\\n",

It has a very original and interesting plot. The art looks very good in my opinion (for being a 2007 anime). You will find some beautiful and surrounding places. But against that all, I think they ruined this anime (or at least the ending of it) with the last episodes, it starts decaying from episode 14. From there, it turns boring and the main story is left aside, introducing \"out of plot\" unnecessary scenes and characters. Also the final episodemakes no sense, it seems very forced. Most of the things thast happened throughout the series keep unresolved and unexplained. This anime had a lot of potential, but they wasted it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite of that all, I would recommend this anime, as it is very interesting and curious, also the atmosphere is very \"terrorific\" sometimes (in a good way) which makes it look cooler, along with the \"astral travel\" thing, which also in real life is a very nice experience. I felt very identified with ths anime, as I also have experienced very similar things as the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, just do not expect a good series finale, just enjoy the episodes for what they are, if you are interested in astral travel, psychological and scientific themes you will like it.\\n\\n\r\nRegards.",

Now, admittedly, this show has supernatural elements (about episode 4) and it is labelled as a psychological thriller. But that's the point I don't like. I want to warn people now, if you want to go in to this show spoiler-free, STOP READING NOW.\r\nIt uses PTSD (Post-Traumatic StressDisorder, for people who don't know) as it's psychological hook. And that's the point. Even shows like Paprika and Paranoia Agent use other 'supernatural' elements other than elements of mental illnesses while Ghost Hound tries to spook or at least make the viewer uncomfortable by showing dreams that are similar to visions or dreams of PTSD sufferers. I'm sorry but if I wanted to know about PTSD, I'd ask my friend who went through a tough point in her life, or I'd research it, I WOULDN'T watch a show. I'm making it sound like more of a big deal than it is, but it's just jarring expecting a thriller from supernatural elements yet the main hook is a real mental illness that many can imagine and that's probably the problem. Supernatural thrillers, um, thrill because they seem unimaginable. PTSD IS imaginable.",

            "content": "(This is my first review so plz bare with me)\r\nNowadays the psychological horror genre tends to focus on the horror part of things like gore, jumpscares, death, etc. \"Ghost Hound\" takes a different approach to this genre and decides to focus on the psychological part and talks about topics like OBEs (out of body experiences), biological psychology, and traumas.\r\nStory (7/10):\r\n\"Ghost Hound\" tells the story of 3 boys, Taro, Masayuki, and Makoto, who have had traumatic experiences in the past that receive the power of moving between the Visible and Unseen realm. In the Unseen realm they are able to see spirits of mostly dead peopleand animals. After receiving these powers strange events begin to occur in the town they live and the boys begin to look into these. The story begins rather slow with its introduction episodes and setting up but near the middle it picks up the pace and begins answering questions set in the beginning. However, the ending was not as satisying as I expected and it seemed like some of these mysteries and problems and been left unsolved.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\r\nThe characters are the highlight in \"Ghost Hound\". IMO all the characters have enough screen-time to be classified as interesting and relatable. From Hirata the psychologist, to Yazaki the mayor, even that one guy who never talks. All these characters have at least enough time to be able to understand their intentions. Most of the characters have some traumatic event occur to them before or during the events of the anime and the way it changes their life and attitude is very well shown. Of course, the most well developed characters are the 3 mains but how the influence of their past is shown in them is just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nOverall the artwork looked really clean and had some moments where it even enhanced the creepiness. The spirits in the Unseen Realm have a range of design from animals that actually exist to fantasy-like designs. Another art element that surprised me was the first-person view that was shown mostly inside the Unseen Realm. Although there are some anime that fail in this aspect \"Ghost Hound\" surprised even in its CGI.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe OST of \"Ghost Hound\" was a very different one. The music was very soft but very creepy at times. The OST also added a touch of classical japanese music at times which fit in very well. It was greating at setting the atmosphere and I definetely recommend watching this anime with headphones on at all times. As for the OP I actually liked the song and the video. It didn't add to the creepiness of the anime but it did pump me up for another episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\nOverall, I think \"Ghost Hound\" is a psychological horror that brings back the psychological side into it. It was really fun watching the mysteries unfold and seeing how the characters came to terms with their pasts\\n\\n\r\nPros-\\n\r\n-Relies on \"creepiness\" rather than jump scares\\n\r\n-Characters are well designed and developed\\n\r\n-OST adds to the environment\\n\r\n-Explores real psychological terms\\n\\n\r\nCons-\\n\r\n-Needs a more satisfying ending\\n",

            "content": "so, this is my first review, so I thought I should do it on one that I liked:\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Ghost Hound was very unique; it took the psychological element further than most, and very literally, as the story deals with the human psyche quite a bit. That being said, it isn't shy on exploring scientific theories and religious beliefs quite heavily, so for some, it might be good to keep a dictionary handy :) Personally, I enjoyed this element a great deal, and found it interesting to no end. That aside, the story moves along at a good pace for the most part; slow,but fast enough to keep you interested. If it weren't for the ending, I would give the story a 10, but I though the climax/ending felt a little forced and maybe even inappropriate; however, it still retained pleasantness. Story gets a 9\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in Ghost Hound was lovely. I really enjoyed all the landscapes, and the character designs were nicely done; also, the images of the \"Unseen World\" were both intriguing and slightly creepy. So, while the art was definitely excellent, it also wasn't really superb, so I think I'd give it a 9\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound was AMAZING. The sound effects were absolutely astounding; whether it was weird, eerie effects meant to make the mood more creepy, or even the fact that the voices carried noticeably differently when in a closed room or on top of a mountain, it was extremely well done. The music is a lot of cool percussion work, and some marvelously simple yet deep background music and melodies. The music and sound effects definitely carry the mood well. The opening and ending themes also were well suited, and I liked both a lot. Sound gets a 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters were realistic, yet interesting, and were well developed and vivid. For the most part, they were very well done, and well suited for their rolls. However, though there were a few that caught my attention, I wasn't particularly entranced by any, so I'd give them a 9 (though quite close to a 10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed Ghost Hound a great deal, and have rewatched it a few times. I loved being able to finish an episode, and then look up some of the terminology they used and explore the ideas they presented. However, this kind of enjoyment isn't for everyone (just a warning). Even so, for me, it's a 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI was really impressed by Ghost Hound, and it will forever be a favorite. I loved the way it utilized creepiness more so than pure horror, with fascinating and brilliant effect. Personally, for me, this anime earns a 10, but in all fairness, my final verdict is a 9, given the mean score of the above. \\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful, and that you get a chance to enjoy Ghost Hound.",

None can match what they did here, at least, none that I know.\r\nI want to rewatch it rigth away, mainly due to some questions that may have never be answered... But I wanna try to understand them anyway.\r\nIt's nice how the characters develop themselves, and how they grown on you. I started the anime don't liking anyone in particular, but ended up rooting for all of them. \r\nOverall, I liked it. Maybe they could have spent more time toreach the final episode, answered more questions properly... And improved the end, 'cause it could have been better. But it really is a great anime, and I didn't feel wasting my time with it.",

            "content": "Ghost hound can be disturbing , eye opening, hypnotizing, and life changing to watch. If you are a big fan of psychology  you would love this. The story is about a boy with PTSD (if you don't know what that is , it's a disorder caused by extreme trauma . A lot of war veterans have this) The boy has terrifying  memories that he dreams of when he and his sister were kidnapped and left to die at a abandoned hospital. Sadly his sister dies and in the dreams instead of her talking you hear buzzing . This anime has crazy jazz andwhen you watch scenes it has noises like when the TV fazes out or fly noises.\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hound pulls you in and you feel like you are in the middle of it. It is very complicated to explain but I can try. First there is the boy with PTSD and another boy who is the troubled  and  angry at the boy with PTSD . He thinks that because people blamed his father for the kidnapping that he it's the other kids fault that he killed himself , then there is another guy who is funny and cheerful but has a dark past and deep regret for bullying someone to death.\\n\\n\r\n They start having Out of Body Experiences and figuring out things about the kidnapping and strange things in the town. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is  for mature people  and you have to be emotionally ready to watch this but I recommend it if you are studying psychology   or like things that are deep.",

            "content": "I am not going to lie....22 episodes in and I really still can't fully tell you what this anime was about and there were questions I wanted to have answered that weren't but in the end this is probably another favorite of mine.\r\nI've not seen a lot of Psychological horror. This is not an anime with superpowers, Ninjas, Virtual Reality or anything flashy. This is an anime that gets in your head, confuses you, freaks you out a bit and captivates you from the get go and I absolutely love the mind fuck of it all.\u200b\r\nA. Plot(8 out of 10)\r\nIt's really hard to say whatthe plot is because there is so much going on in these 22 episodes however I believe the overall plot is about these 3 teen boys who each have experienced or witness a traumatic event in their lives and it has forever changed them. The town they live in holds a dark and devastating secret and as the anime goes on, the viewer as well as other characters begin to uncover the sick truth about the town and the sinister stuff going on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs our three main characters try to focus on their past traumas and overcoming them, they are thrown into a present situation that could very destroy them if they don't stop it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nB. Characters(9 out of 10):\\n\\n\\n\r\nRarely ever do I find an anime where I can't stand any of the characters and I genuinely like all of them.. Our three mains are Taro who faced a traumatic experience at the age of 3 but it is the aftermath 11 years later that leaves him troubled, Makoto who holds so much rage in him due to an event linked to Taro that forced him to witness something he never wanted and leaving him with questions unanswered and Masayuki who is hiding a devastating secret behind his jokes and smiles.\\n\\n\r\nAll 3 of the main characters are compelling and they have some amazing growth throughout the 22 episodes. Taro of course is your typical goody two shoes but he isn't completely predictable and Makoto is the brooding, angry, emoish type of guy who I usually love because they are the most interesting. However, Masayuki is my favorite from the get go because he is the most diverse and multi-layered of the 3 characters and there is still a lot of mystery to him.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMichio and Miyako(This anime loves people with M names apparently) are also apart of the main group and they were decent. If there was a weaker aspect of the characters, it probably goes to the secondary characters. There are so many secondary characters and the plot tries to focus on our mains to the point where the secondary characters, while interesting, felt less like characters and more like devices to aid our main characters. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nC. Animation, Sound and Music(10 out of 10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this anime was beautiful. Not overdone but not oversimple. From the human character designs to the souls and even astral projections. I was quite impressed. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic in this anime was always very fitting. Sometimes in anime, the music can kind of distract you or even outright clash(Happy sounding music in an otherwise sad scene or extremely melodramatic music). The Opening and Ending songs are pretty enticing as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat of course shocked me is the sounds....it is kind of creepy. At the start of each episode and the mid-way point, there is this staticy/robotic voice with a ghastly tone that place that sort of adds more to the eerie vibe of the anime. It annoyed me at first but I did greatly enjoy it as the anime went on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nD. The Ending(6 out of 10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one major flaw to this anime it is last few episodes, especially the final episode. It wasn't awful but it felt rushed and it left so many questions unanswered. Not questions that you can sort of leave up for interpretation....but actual question where you want to know the answer because we spent so much time talking about it and it still isn't answered.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt felt rushed and the rushness sort of clashes with the animes first 19 episodes where they gradually took their time vs the last 3 episodes sort of just decided to go crazy and fast. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't a bad ending but I did expect more and I felt ii weakened the anime a bit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nE. Overall:\u200b\\n\\n\\n\r\nI loved the anime. Aside from a weak ending and weak secondary characters, the story is compelling because there are so many things happening....you want to be apart of the mystery. You want to know what is happening next and you are rooting for these boys to face their demons and to grow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely an anime I can recommend everyone to watch because it is so good and I loved it.",

            "content": "Here we have Studio Production I.G. working on this new psychological supernatural anime called Ghost Hound. A studio with some good experience handling psychological shows like this such as Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex, but then some questionable supernatural shows like Blood+. Then this was created by Masamune Shirow, the creator behind Ghost in the Shell. Plus, this was directed by Ryuutarou Nakamura, the director behind Serial Experiments Lain. At the very least, Ghost Hound should have zero issue delivering upon the psychological part of the anime, but what about the supernatural?\r\nThe show takes place in a small town called Suiten focusing aroundthree boys who somehow gain the power of astral projection and connect with the \u201cunseen world\u201d or otherwise a parallel world inhabited by ghosts. Due to traumatic experiences the characters have, this allows such an ability. The story follow their cross between the two worlds, and end up involved and unravel a strange mystery connected to a small girl whom has the ability to channel spirits.\\n\\n\r\nStory and plot are uniquely mixed together quite well between the psychology and mystery of the show. This comes as no surprise based on the show\u2019s creator. It really blends together with a writing of the show, but fails at being exciting from the overall execution. This is mostly due to the insane amount of detail and pace of the show by it telling literally everything and each and every detail it can think of. One example of this is an entire episode dedicated to explaining how complicated the human brain is. It does have a point to the show, and the information may be interesting to some. However, this is just one example of an instance for a show with constant information dumps filled with puzzles and the plot\u2019s loss of focus because of it.\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hound does have superb atmosphere and filled with dark and dreary colours. This keeps a somewhat gritty edge and an intriguing mystery also blends well into this fact. The plot vastly benefits from the creepy atmosphere as well as the story only revealing small bits and pieces of the mystery at a time leading to the viewer using their imagination to fill holes. This is a gripping experience. The ultimate downfall is not the main characters themselves or even the ultra-strange ghost-baby-blob forms their astral projections take on, but it is the movement of what is important to the plot. As mentioned before, the plots loss of focus.\\n\\n\r\nInformation exposition dump aside, and whether this is interesting or not vastly depends on the viewer\u2019s taste in that regard to hurt or benefit the show. It does take away from good pacing, plot focus, and causes the loose ends to be concluded haphazardly. At the beginning there is a kidnapping which is solved but brushed aside, which is a major plot point to the entire first half of the show. This is followed by some biology experiments, which almost seemingly questions the previous plot point, and then leads to yet another strange plot. The concepts involved such as \u201cplaying God\u201d and psychotic behaviors are done fairly well. However, Ghost Hound tries way too hard to expand the story and the plot devices addressed fail, such as with the ending. Does the average viewer even want to make it that far, feel irritated by the experience, or is it satisfactory is a tough question to answer for this show?\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hound is flawed in many ways, but does contain the mystery, contents, and concepts for a possibly intriguing watch. By far, this show would have vastly benefited more for the masses at half the length and cutting out the insane science and psychologically detailed dialogue. It really just falls way short on the supernatural element and what the show could have been in the end.",

If you're wanting cheap scares and gore, I suggest you watch another anime, but that doesn't stop it from being scary. (It scared me enough to not want to leave my bedroom...) It's a compelling story that really makes you think about the way you take in the world around you. Personally for me, I just couldn't stop watching it. I couldn't wait to seewhat happened next. Plus, the anime teaches you some interesting neurological terminology-- just throwing that out there. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nA simple, yet beautiful art style. Very enjoyable to look at throughout. The spirits of the Hidden Realm were very interesting, and very eerie. Oh, and even though their original O.B.E forms were silly looking, I couldn't help but giggle at those little bums.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nNow, the sound is what really gave the anime it's haunting, eerie atmosphere. It has old, traditional sounding Japanese music, and the sound effects were sometimes just downright creepy. It sent shivers down my spine. Oh, and in my opinion, I loved the Opening song. It just sounded good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nAll of the main boy characters had their own compelling, tragic pasts that really kept you interested the whole time. They were all very colourful characters with great personalities. No one was boring, no one was annoying.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [9/10]\\n\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hound has an amazingly creepy, haunting atmosphere, an interesting storyline, and colourful characters. It really grabs your attention, and keeps it throughout the anime. And after you're finished, you'll be left wondering about the world around you. Sometimes, it could be a little slow, but nonetheless it was a very enjoyable anime, and it will definitely be one of my favourite animes of all time. \\n\\n",

            "content": "**Spoilers Alert**\r\nThis type of anime was very new to me, it involved a psychological element in its work, with both that of religion; gods. \r\nAt the beginning, I was gradually writing it off as something I would drop because of its slow pace, and strange settings, but, they grew on me, and I accepted the \"Bleghgegeeg\" jarble that appeared sometimes. \r\nIt made me question the likelihood of Gods, cults and other traditions and gave me ideas about shamans and priests from old times.\r\nThe ending to me was odd, when Taro was so close to finding his goal, he pushes it away, and accepts things asthey are, and then Miyako (to me) started crying for no reason about him talking about his sister, even though she went through a completely different emotional trauma from being leader of a cult unknowingly. I would have thought that Taro and Miyako we're going to 'hook up' in the end, but because of their age, doubted it (which turned out to be true) and then those random things happened. There was one element I liked about the ending though: the transition of the cycle from old generation to new generation (the photos taken at the shrine) which then fades out leaving us all to wonder.",
