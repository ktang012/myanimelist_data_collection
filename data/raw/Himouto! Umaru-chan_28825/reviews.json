            "content": "I don't recommend this anime.  Things included in this show are unlikable characters, terrible comedy, and essentially everything you've already seen before.  I get it, the chibi form of the main character is cute and marketable, it's being used on banners and logos and whatnot, but it's all just a ruse.\r\nNow let me make this clear.  I love slice of life anime.  I loved Nichijou, Barakamon and the list goes on.  However this particular anime has a few breaking flaws.  First off, the main character is a bratty teenager who basically gets whatever she wants and if she doesn't,she throws a tantrum.  Do you even understand how much I wanted to stick my hand into the screen and bitch slap the ever-living shit out of this cheeto lookin' ass?  You know when you go out, there's always that one kid who just screams and throws a tantrum because they're spoiled to hell and their parents don't do shit so you're stuck with this terrible annoyance that you can't do anything about?  This anime is basically that.  Twelve whole episodes of that.  The characters are just not likable and the comedy doesn't vary.  It's the same shit throughout the whole series.  The main character puts on an angelic front when she's out in public and everyone loves her, then she comes home and turns into an orange potato and does whatever the hell she wants and whines when she doesn't get her way.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the whole anime.  Not even kidding.  I mean sure, let's bring in another character in different episodes, but it's the same exact thing that happens every time.  This isn't even a \"this annoying character starts off as someone you hate but gradually becomes someone you love\" type deal.  She stays an annoying brat throughout the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nI am genuinely boggled that this is rated as high as it is.  I can get behind anime with the pure intention of comedy like Gintama, Baka Test etc. but this does it so terribly that it's not even funny, literally.",

            "content": "Here's my thoughts on the show summarized in one sentence:\r\nHimouto brings a fun style of comedy to the viewer for the first few episodes, and then recycles those same jokes over and over until you're sick of them.\r\nAs for the more technical side of things:\r\nStory- Umaru is a practically perfect girl while with her friends, but a little lazy weeaboo shit when at home with her brother. You'd think I was oversimplifying it, but I'm really not. The plot is rather stagnant and doesn't change much throughout the show (this isn't necessarily a bad thing)\r\nArt-\r\nSo average that it's bad. Let me expound on that sentence:Most shows with an \"average\" artstyle usually have 1 especially notable thing about the art. With Himouto, you could say that this would be her childlike form, but that's  really just taken from other shows too. \\n\\n\r\nSound- Decent soundtrack and OP. Nice to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- They all seem interesting at first, but then lose said interest when you realize how linear they are. They do their role okay though, so can't say it's the worst I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Show is very entertaining for the first couple episodes, then becomes stagnant. Not sure what to tell you on this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- Himouto does a decent job as a comedy, and if you don't mind jokes seeming a bit similar to ones previously used, give it a shot. Can't give this show too high of a rating because simply getting rid of your boredom for an hour or two just won't suffice.",

            "content": "I\u2019m not going to lie. Watching Himouto! Umaru-chan (My Two-Faced Little Sister) makes me feel like a kid all over again. Each week, each episode is like an indoor and outdoor adventure of its own. Titular character Umaru Doma is the class superstar as well as the model that almost everyone looks up to. Her brother, Taihei Doma, is kind of like the sidekick providing her shelter, food, and a sense of comfort for her when she\u2019s living at home. Really though, this series took me by surprise like an unexpected storm. And I\u2019m talking about the type of otaku storm where you have tosee it to believe it.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the 4-koma of the same name, the series is adapted by studio Doga Kobo. In recent years, they are better known for their work with slice of life stories. Essentially, that\u2019s how this show is like. The first episode easily establishes Umaru\u2019s ulterior character. She literally lives a double life. At school, she acts mature, friendly, and in general someone that people idolizes. At home, she is almost the complete opposite with a lazy lifestyle, obsessive otaku personality, and acts like a NEET. This makes the show a bit odd at first seeing how each episode reflects on her double life style. What the series does well on this perspective is to demonstrate genuine comedy. The show makes fun of the otaku culture by saturating it with an immense amount of parody. Umaru\u2019s character is someone that people would least expect to be an otaku from the outside. Yet, the show satires that with her lifestyle at home. In retrospect, the show delivers what I would call a cultural comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also consists of other characters ranging from Umaru\u2019s shy childhood friend Ebina, self-proclaimed rival Sylphynford, and the bizarre and frightening girl, Kirie Motoba. Each of them has a different personality that makes them stand out on their own. Their interactions with Umaru usually brings out the honesty of their characters. Furthermore, each episode provides a better insight about Umaru as well. We learn more about Umaru from both sides of her lifestyle. And through that, the show can make us feel attached to the characters. Umaru\u2019s relationship with her brother can also be quite entertaining to watch. Her brother is the average type of guy with an average job and working an average salary. Umaru often makes him run errands for her although she sometimes gets scolded. Their relationship is the typical brother and sister type with no absurdity involving incest or abuse. As lighthearted as it can be though, the chemistry between some characters can be a bit dull. While most times, the on-screen chemistry has an attachable feel, the concepts are usually recycled tropes. Umaru\u2019s otaku lifestyle can also be a bit odd to get used to considering that it\u2019s so different compared to the outer image she created at school. Selfish and lazy. Those are not good attributes for a young girl like her. But even so, the show satires her personality and connects them with her lifestyle without over exaggeration.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the series focuses on a more episodic basis, there are a few reoccurring elements throughout the story. Umaru\u2019s double life is obviously one of them but also some of the competition she faces. This includes her love of video games and she later on creates a third personality specifically used to face her rival Sylphynford. Kirie\u2019s relationship with Umaru also brings an interesting idea to the show. \u201cWill someone at school eventually discover Umaru\u2019s true identity and personality?\u201d The show almost made this slip apart in the early stages and often or not, it keeps the audience at their seat of wondering that question. Finally, while there\u2019s no actual dramatic romance in the show, we do get a bit of the puppy love with Ebina. Like I mentioned before, the main supporting characters consists of different personalities and roles to make this series colorful and diverse. \\n\\n\r\nIn essence, the artwork is simplistic yet effective. Umaru\u2019s outer image is crafted with an appealing appearance with her perfectly rounded face, smile, colorful hair, and even body structure as shown in pool class. However, the more entertaining aspect comes with her deformed character. When at home, her character design is that of a kid wearing a hamster shaped hoodie. Furthermore, her behavior and reactions are often like a spoiled brat. The visual style and reactive expressions makes us believe who she is as the two-faced little sister. On the contrary, her brother looks average all throughout the series. And while there\u2019s no explicit fan service in the series, Ebina\u2019s character is designed ways that can raise some eyebrows. All that aside, the artwork is well done in terms of overall coverage.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s soundtrack is not to be underestimated. Although it lacks any sort of distinctive OST, the way comedic scenes are done is often convincing thanks to the matching soundtrack. Similarly, conversations and dialogues performed by the characters makes you curious about what they will say next often. This is especially true for Umaru as she leads a double life. And from her performance, Umaru\u2019s VA Ami Tanaka deserves a bit of praise for portraying a character with completely different personalities. Other noticeable voices includes Kirie with her intimidating tone or Sylphynford\u2019s pride. The OP and ED theme songs are also creatively done. In particular, the OP song fuses the double life imagery of Umaru.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Himouto! Umaru-chan runs the risk of being a big joke, it ultimately has enough comedy and convincingly gets the audience to laugh. There\u2019s enough jokes in the series that makes it look like satire and in general makes fun of the otaku culture thanks to Umaru. It also has enough time to not forget about the other characters. Furthermore, Umaru\u2019s daily adventures will often get the audience curious to see what she is capable of doing next. As a series that stars a peculiar girl with two-faces, this is more than just a show about a brother and sister.",

Well, it is; In the first three episodes at least.\r\nBasically, Umaru is a high school student who's admired by everyone because of her kind personality, looks, and brains. But once she's at home, she's a lazy weeb who bosses her brother around 25/8 to do shit for her. The art is decent, I guess, but the main point is suppose to be Umaru's personality, or at least I think it is.\r\nThere's some side characters, but they don't do much. The animehas 0 plot. The entire series is just the same repetitive scenes and jokes. Umaru doesn't improve as a person, even though there were multiple occurrences where the plot could've developed, but nothing. Although the episode where she gets to be with her mother for Christmas was really touching, it was the only time that there was some kind of emotional factor in the series.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I watched this anime in hope that I could just relax and laugh, but after episode 5 it got pretty boring, and it was just generic scenes of Umaru being spoiled and playing video games. People hype this anime way too much. It had so much potential, but nothing happens.",

            "content": "A very peculiar creature is living among us, elusive for so many years due to its ability to perfectly imitate a human being. First discovered by SankakuHead in 2013, but his findings are in a language known only to few, but thanks to the hard work of cryptologists at Dogakobo they have provided us with SankakuHead's findings in a format we can make sense of and I am writing this report after going through their findings.\r\nThough without a botanical name as yet, but persons around it refer to the creature as 'Umaru', so we shall refer to it as such within the course of thisreport.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance the Umaru seems to be a casual and playful creature, it is largely lethargic in nature and enjoys to indulge itself in as much frivolities as it can. Its preferred natural habitat is a suburban apartment with dimmed lightning at low temperatures, it spends most of its time consuming human entertainment such as Television, Video games and the Internet, its main diet though mostly consists of barbecued foods and chilled drinks, however we have witnessed it consuming fruits and vegetables but it shows a strong adverseness to it and only consumes it when forced or as a last resort when starvation kicks in. The Umaru is capable of becoming dangerous however when not allowed its usual diet, environment or entertainment, throwing tantrums and wailing at most occasions.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting thing about the Umaru though is its ability to camouflage so perfectly whenever it leaves its habitat and ventures into human society, we have no idea how its capable of doing this but when it does it takes on the form of the perfect human being; smart, beautiful and quite flawless in every aspect of its activities. This has led it to be awed and adored by most in society but heads will surely be turned if and whenever its nature in its own habitat is exposed to them.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its somewhat selfish and secluded lifestyle it still has a couple of close human companions which it interacts with. It has a blood brother which it lives with by the name of Taihei, but as far as we can tell from investigation he seems to be human, but being a blood relative of the Umaru that section of the investigation is marked as inconclusive at this point. Taihei does most of the housework due to the Umaru's lethargic nature, he is well aware of all its  characteristics but expresses no serious alarm about it, he does constantly try to lecture and reform the Umaru to the right way but at this point to no success. They express a fondness and affection for each other as siblings, but her usual anecdotes are a constant nuisance to him and we on the investigation team found their interactions amusing and a times heart warming to see.\\n\\n\r\nDogakobo's interpretation of the Umaru and its surroundings is very lovely to look at indeed, though simplistic and not in too much detail it still carries a nice mix of color tones that is very lovely to look at. There are no overly excessive motions but constant motion even in small bouts is present to always make sure things never seem dull.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion there is still much we don't know about this creature and its environment, but from the little that we have seen here it is apparent that it is a charming, playful and a times boisterous, and its many antics and characteristics have often left us laughing or at least left us with a smile on our face and we're sure will be pleasing to many.",

            "content": "If my sister acted the way the main character does in this show I think I'd take her round the back and shoot her.\r\nWow, that was quite the dark opening, wasn't it? Let's...Let's try that again (cough cough).\r\nThis show makes me want to find the nearest kitchen utensil and then locate the nearest plug socket so that I will never have to look at this orange football ever again...(that's better!)\r\nIf you can't yet tell from my terrible jokes I really do not like this show. What started off a harmless comedy with some fun little jokes stays as such throughout the entire show with nocharacter growth while repeating the same gag over and over again. When this anime was airing last year there was no escaping the orange tic-tac since she was used for every single reaction image and post on every website forum. She was everywhere and unfortunately is still around now. Every Comic-Con I go to, not only am I surrounded by about twenty overweight Narutos, seventy-two Rems and six-hundred Deadpools but also about a million Umarus. As far as the eye can see, all I witness is a shitty waifu. Even in my porn this annoying sister is beginning to show up...and that creeps me out.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this anime is pretty paper thin and the crust of each scenario and joke is centred around the little sister character being an absolute cunt to her big brother. Teaching kids everywhere that it's fine to throw a tantrum and cry if you don't get your own way just to get your pussy of an older brother to go buy you some potato chips and some cola. Rinse and repeat every episode. Umaru, as a character, is both selfish and annoying in her lifestyle. She has two sides to her life; one in which she is a model student at her school and one in which she shrinks down and becomes the useless slob that she is at heart. While this can provide some comedy for the show most of the comedy is derivative of Umaru crying to get her own way or simply watching her play games and eating food. \\n\\n\r\nUmaru's main problem is that she doesn't grow as a character in the slightest. She stays exactly the same throughout the show and the fact that the show hints at her realising that she is a little too selfish is a kick in the balls to the audience as they never do anything with it and she devolves back into the cunt that she is. Many little sisters of this nature have the same problems in anime. Take for example Kirino from the anime 'my little sister can't possibly be this much of a cunt'. She too is a selfish prick and never changes in her narrative but to be fair, Umaru is not as much of a bitch as she is...she is just annoying. Umaru, in a way, glorifies the lazy and self-entitled lifestyle that some kids are living today. You can call me cynical, and perhaps I am for thinking about this show in this nature but the entire show comes across that being a worthless member of society is okay as long as you can get someone to buy you stuff while you remain a selfish asshole.\\n\\n\r\nThe older brother is a character whom I want to reach through the computer screen and slap. As someone who has three little sisters myself, one of which is about the same age as Umaru herself I feel embarrassed by how much of a pussy he is. He never actually stands up for himself or tries to make Umaru see the error of her ways. He is just there and that's it. In terms of the supporting cast, they're a bit more lively and interesting and have more in the way of comedy. I liked Ebina the most...especially her boobs. Yes, it's shallow but if the show is this shallow, I might as well be too. The comedy is kind of hit or miss for me. While there were some moments that I felt were generally well executed there were plenty in which I couldn't care for and most of the time the writers constantly repeat jokes throughout the show. The narrative is pretty bare-bones and I'm not expecting anything remarkable out of a slice-of-life show's story but when the cast is this boring and the comedy is this stale I lose interest fast. The music was okay at best but the wooden train flute got annoying really quickly. The animation and art design was decent and get the job done but is nothing remarkable as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Umaru is a show with weak comedy and one of the worst main characters I have ever seen. Umaru was just too much of a dick for me to properly enjoy myself with this show and every time she was on screen I wanted to punch her through the monitor. One may argue that I am taking the show too seriously and that I should enjoy it for what it is. That's fine, but the show's comedy is so awful that I find that impossible. If you want to learn how to be the ultimate useless member of society, then watch this show. Awaken the Umaru in you... \\n",

            "content": "This anime went from being horrible to somewhat decent to horrible again.\r\nThis is my first review and I plan to write more in the future, so I hope I can explain well why I hate this show so damn much.\r\nFirst things first: The story.\r\nThere is none.\r\nUmaru, while being popular at school and great in every subject, just turns into a lazy otaku at home, doing nothing but gaming, watching anime, reading Manga and having her older brother she lives with do even the smallest things for her. \r\nThat's it.\r\nThere is no plot progression - aside from some season-related episodes - there is no character development,which would be rather necessary to get something out of the main character.\\n\\n\r\n\"But it's just a comedy\", you might say, \"It only has to be fun, what do you expect.\"\\n\\n\r\nOf course giving a show that bad a score only based on the fact that it has little to no story wouldn't be fair. Instead, I should focus on the humor, it's a comedy after all.\\n\r\nAnd the humor the show has... is so, so terrible. It always happens at the expense of the wrong characters, and the most unlikeable characters end up coming out on top - I can't find the humor in that.\\n\r\nI will admit that there were a few moments that felt kinda genuine, but whenever the show tried to have emotional moments otherwise, it got immediately ruined afterwards for the sake of some bad and predictable joke. [1/10]\\n\r\nThis is, naturally, directly tied to the cast of the show, which has to be one of the most unlikeable casts I have ever seen in a comedy.\\n\r\nUmaru is manipulative and lazy, almost sociopathic in the way she treats her older brother and there is no motivation for her to change her manners completely when she goes outside. She doesn't work as a character, because her \"outside\" and true personality don't fit together at all. There is no way someone could live like that - only hanging around at home, eating snacks and playing games, but still being perfectly healthy, slim, fantastic at sports and great at school without learning or training or doing anything at all. Also she has some kind of chibi form whenever she's in lazy mode and despite only having other clothing, no one aside from her brother ever recognizes her.\\n\r\nHer Brother Taihei, while being pushed around constantly, tries to change his sister for the better, but always ends up cleaning after her, buying stuff for her and feeling bad because he gets fed up with her more than one time. He goes to work yet still manages the household all on his own, and he's so much into his adorable little sister it gets annoying really fast.\\n\r\nEbina, Umaru's friend, has even less personality than that, she likes to hang out with Umaru, is shy, dumb, in love with Taihei and has big boobs.\\n\r\nKirie, another friend, is also shy, but really violent with her older brother.\\n\r\nBut it's absolutely okay, because her brother, who is a friend of Taihei's, is perverted and stupid. Nothing is wrong with girls constantly hitting guys for whatever reason, right? Isn't it just fun?\\n\r\nThen there's Sylphyn, who's competitive with Umaru, a foreigner who speaks very politely and always a bit hyper.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I'm supposed to find all of this funny somehow? I can't. \\n\r\nA character-based comedy is supposed to get the fun out of character interactions, reactions and the situations they find themselves in, but when the whole cast is either bland or horribly unlikeable, the humor doesn't work.[1/10]\\n\\n\r\nAs for art and animation, they are okay, but not great.\\n\r\nThe anime shines with really nice colors and some good, but mostly bland character designs. [5/10]\\n\r\nThe sound is also mixed. The show has a rather catchy opening, forgettable ending and boring, bland insert music.\\n\r\nThe only thing remarkable here is Umaru's Seiyuu. In my opinion, she does a great job in trying to give anything likeable to her role and I hope she gets parts in much better Anime in the future. [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nAs for my overall enjoyment... the show had some nice, relaxing parts in it, which is why I kept watching until the end, but after episode 12, I wondered why I bothered at all. [4/10]\\n\\n\r\nTotal score (NOT calculated mathematically): 1/10\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. What could have been a nice comedy focused on otaku culture turned into some really unlikeable characters I don't care about having fun. And also created one of my most hated anime characters of all time.\\n\r\nHopefully at least Umaru's Seiyuu will benefit from having been a part of this.",

            "content": "\u201cAll I want for Christmas 2015 is Ebina Nana-chan. ^^\u201d\r\nI first known about Himouto! Umaru-chan after searching what anime I should watch after finishing spring season. Honestly, I consider this as my main priority to watch for Summer 2015, but after watching Gakkou Gurashi! (Considered as my highest priority for SM 2015) I still make Himouto! Umaru chan as my second highest priority to watch in 2015, so no hard feelings for Himouto lovers. :D \r\nAnd I\u2019m really glad I watch Himouto Umaru-chan, one of the best combination of comedy and slice of life anime in my life, I don\u2019t know for others but itmay depends on their perspectives but for me I totally enjoy it. Down below is my full review about this series. Other than that, I\u2019ve learn so much from this anime that I completely forgotten to do my homeworks. And yet, most of the scenes in this series I can almost relate to my everyday life where my sister is struggling to control me when it comes to anime related staffs. Anyway, back to the review.\\n\\n\r\nI really like how they scripted the story from the manga, well except some of the scenes may be cut-out but overall it was well adapted and I like how they make the story simple and not too complex, (my perspective). Other than that, the pacing of the story is not too rushed or too slow, just right, (I haven\u2019t read the manga so excuse if I\u2019m wrong). Most of the story focuses on Umaru who has a two-faced side being one a perfect sister with strong intelligence on the outside and seconds after stepping into the house, turning into annoying yet cute otaku Umaru-chan and Taihei whom he has to deal all kinds of problems that his sister cause or make a big tantrum and this is where comedy played a big role in this series. Not much of bikini scenes except for the ED song video and the final episode if you don\u2019t drop the series. Nonetheless, this is a good 2015 summer anime for those who loves comedy and slice of life show. Not much of romance content, but still have those ship moments. Don\u2019t forget, this show has a lot of references from other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe work is done by Doga Kobo, a studio which make good anime for example Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, Yuru Yuri and recent anime Plastic Memories. Their animations are really decent, not bad for 2015 animations. The background is not too saturated as it follows the mood of the character and character designs are not too bland, in fact Umaru is quite cheerful when she is in cola mode. I love how the original character, Sankakuhead design all the characters of the series, it\u2019s pretty cute especially Ebina. Overall, not much of weird animations made by Doga Kobo.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the seiyuu which I haven\u2019t heard before are pretty new to the anime industries, yet they did an amazing job voice acting on all the characters in this series, especially the seiyuus of Umaru, Ebina, Kirie and Sylphynford. Not bad for first starters. The OP song is very catchy and perfectly match the personality of Umaru since she loves to play video games so much and the ED song well quite enjoyable to listen. OST or background music are lovely too. And the sound effects when Umaru transforms is almost related to Yuru Yuri\u2019s \u201cAkari disappearance effect\u201d because the director is from Yuru Yuri!\\n\\n\r\nI love all the characters of this series, they all have unique appearances and personality. I love how Umaru being an otaku at home and loves to talk all about games and anime to his brother because that\u2019s what I did in real life, but I do prefer her on the outside personality though and well the good thing about her is she cares for her onii-chan since he work really hard to financially support her. Sylphynford is Umaru\u2019s not really kinda rival and she loves to challenge umaru just because she is below her but nonetheless they do spent together as TSF and UMR. Kirie, is more like Tomoko from Watamote except that she is cute and shy, well Tomoko is cute too so yeah. She\u2019s having a hard time to talk with other people because of her shy personality but hopefully she would make more friends in the future, well at least Umaru help her. Ebina, ahh my favorite character of the series even though she is just a supporting character. What is so special about Ebina? Boobs? Nope, her air-headness and her kawainess throughout the series, I just wanna pet her head so much. Since she came from Akita, she is trying to improve her standard Japanese language so she can speak without making any Akita dialect, well except if she is in a good mood after tasting Tokyo\u2019s food. Other than that i completely enjoy seeing her in each episodes, makes me happy.\\n\\n\r\nWith most of the episodes has completely finished airing, I feel sad that the show had ended but at the same time, I\u2019m happy that they adapted this from the manga, I would say this is the best 2015 anime summer from my perspective and I enjoyed much watching on this, it helps me to cool down my stress after heavy load of school hours and help to cheer me up when I\u2019m feeling moody. The good thing is that, this has no incest relationship because if it does, well that\u2019s up to your imagination. Overall, this has easily made to be one of the recommendations for anyone who wanted to watch slice of life and comedy for 2015.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it all up, it has been an amazing ride with the Umaru and her friends and of course onii-chan throughout the whole series. Also thank you Oota Masahiko for directing Himouto Umaru Chan, he did well on directing this and making it a fun series to watch, he is the director who directs Yuru Yuri S1 and S2, hopefully there would be a season 2 for this, because it was freaking funny and cute to watch. Eventhough it is long and may be completely nonsense but I hope this review is helpful as I went a lot of process of thinking and rewriting the review again for the past few days. Thanks! And have a nice Umaru day!~\\n",

            "content": "Most of the humour and appeal of Himouto! Umaru-chan comes from the protagonist being strikingly similar to its target audience; a lazy, entitled otaku teenager who always gets what they want. You're meant to identify with this cola-obsessed girl to the point of empathizing with her every move, and that obviously worked. Within days of the first episode airing, the show became a meme. It was (and at the time of writing, still is) hard to enter an anime discussion without catching a stray gif or picture showing Umaru in her chibi form, because people loved that they saw themselves or their behaviour in thiscute little character. A month later, the show's viewer base had unexpectedly doubled. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the first time this model has succeeded. In 2013, both Oregairu and WataMote garnished immense popularity by using a character the audience could relate to, through teen angst and depression respectively. And as much as I'd like to lump Himouto! Umaru-chan in with those two, it feels different. It's not some one-off attempt at being relatable, but a series that wants to tell a story through the eyes of its audience. And I completely hated it until I came to that strange realization. \\n\\n\r\nWhile beautiful and endearingly polite on the  outside, the titular Umaru turns to a horrible blob of laziness as soon as she arrives home. She lives with her older brother, Taihei, who thankfully brings no themes of incest to the table. As Taihei's a strict and punctual businessman, the two don't exactly get along. All that happens between the two from there on does nothing but highlight Umaru's much-needed flaws (bad behaviour ahoy), but also makes you feel pretty sorry for her older brother. His patiently putting up with her and loving her regardless is what ends up turning the theme on its head\u2014it's a critique of the consumer as much as it is a critique of Umaru, even though the characters are too one-note to allow it to work. With all of this trickery going on, the entire premise is much more suited to a drama than the mangaka may realize. Since a better option is available, it becomes pretty disappointing to see the conventional slice of life comedy route being taken every step of the way.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from the aforementioned two, the entire cast is fairly unremarkable. You've got your shy oppai twintail girl, the energetic rival, and the mysterious tsundere who has a crush on Umaru. Taihei also has two coworkers, who unknowingly happen to be related to two of Umaru's friends (sigh). Moreover, we don't get to know very much about these characters beyond their basic stereotypes. Everyone's certainly able to provide a few laughs along the way, though it always seems like a distraction from the real matter of familial tension. The team behind the anime seems to have a quota to fill for uninteresting or typical scenes, so you never get more than a five-minute glimpse at the better material. It's a sadistic game, and the way it's dragged out is extremely frustrating. In the last episode, about four of five prior misunderstandings or lies are perpetuated. Not only does this keep the plot from progressing, but the frustration is furthered when the final scene alludes to the lack of development in Umaru. As I've said before, joking about such a serious problem instead of combatting it is a dire mistake. \\n\\n\r\nComplaints about the literary portion aside, it's probably the best-looking show of the Summer 2015 season. Dogakobo is clearly proud to prove that you don't need detailed cuts or any exotic art direction to make something look great, only nice colours and consistently smooth animation. If one thing were to set the mismatched anime aside from its competition, this would be it. Have you not already seen it, I'd advise you to look up the OP for the show. Aside from the catchy nature of the song itself, it's a fantastic showcase of what I'm talking about. \\n\\n\r\nSo even though I wouldn't recommend the anime, you can't exactly go wrong with it. It's inconsistent in a lot of places and somewhat hard to actually wrap your head around, but you'll be sure to get a few giggles and a grand treat for the eye. Lest I forget, Sylphynford is a total cutie. If you end up having a little more fun with it than I did, you have my envy.",

            "content": "Do you want to watch something that will put a smile on your face regardless of what mood you are in? Specifically, an anime that has one particular character that has the charisma and charm to make an entire series into a glorious package of fun and cuteness all by herself? If you do, oh boy, do I have an anime for you.\r\nHimouto Umaru-chan is one experience that still perplexes me as I am writing this. Not just because of how much I loved it, but also how something like this could exist. It is essentially a gag comedy anime with the most generic formulayou could ever witness if you were reading this idea on paper. An otaku girl who, even though she is an all-star student to her peers on the outside, tries to keep her secret away from the people around her, even her close friends. Only her brother is aware of this since he lives with her and takes care of her despite her wacky and almost nerve-racking antics that drive him almost to the edge of insanity. When you read these two sentences, more often than not, you would most likely shrug off and browse off to the next anime on the anime list. But hear me out for a spare moment of your time.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll start with the most substantial positive to Himouto Umaru-chan: Umaru-chan. There is no denying her cuteness exists, there\u2019s not. But since I know cuteness is not a character structure that is very clear to many people, I will explain her merits with less vague terms than just being cute. What character merits she has, one, in particular, she manages to show off with high tenacity and spark is charisma. Thanks in no part to how she transitions from your stereotypical perfect girl to a wild chibi character who loves to play games, drink copious amounts of cola, and reading the latest manga issue. After all, who could not relate to a character that exhibits these quirks?\\n\\n\r\nThere are two aspects to this aspect that make it enjoyable: how seamlessly the art style shifts from normal to chibi character design and how the voice actress shifts her voice pitch from this transition. It gives Umaru-chan a great sense of character, not really from a development standard, but an engaging one at that. Her presence in the world demands your attention to her in many ways that could quickly become annoying by the 2nd or 4th episode when poorly done. But to the writer\u2019s credit, they know how to pace off the comedic chibi bits and add in new and exciting subtle ways to make the jokes involving her seem fresh and new with each episode. Even when she is outright selfish and acting like a crybaby, she still comes off as incredibly lovable thanks to the considerable charm that he inhibited from her over-the-top design and personality.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect to her that I enjoy immensely is her relationship with her brother, Taihei. You could say it is a relationship, albeit a bit exaggerated, that is both hilarious and somewhat realistic if you\u2019ve ever had an annoying little sister, or brother, who annoyed you. Despite her constant barraging of wants and needs to her big brother, they still form a close relationship of sibling love that is honestly touching in a few episodes where Taihei does good things for her out of the kindness of his heart, and vice versa with Umaru-chan. Her over-the-top personality doesn't overshadow him as he does carry himself as another funny character in what can be described as the best sibling duo in anime in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nHimouto Umaru-chan\u2019s brand of comedy is one other big positive that sets itself higher than most comedies that center around otaku life. For one, it does not overly state that the otaku lifestyle is inherently tremendous or bad at the same time. It mostly keeps the message subtle so that it does not distract us from the comedy bits too much. It has no well-defined message written into the narrative or characters since it knows what type of show it is and runs with it as a silly comedy. This is where the subject matter of being an otaku is seen better than most that try to because it can be enjoyed by everyone who has a particular view on this specific issue that can be against or for it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the comedy jokes themselves, most of them hit the mark quite well. A lot of it centers around satire of real-life issues that we all go through, whether it is how we go through the internet, social situations, and our need for material goods more than anything else. What\u2019s great about it is that you do not have to be a self-described otaku, or know the culture for the matter, to get the jokes. Such as not getting any internet connection for today and realize how life seems meaningless without it, and so on. The banter with Umaru-chan and her brother is always the biggest highlight in the show\u2019s comedy, as I\u2019ve mentioned before about the great relationship they have. And there are even some funny moments with the supporting cast; unfortunately, they are not on the same comedic level of our two siblings.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast, what little there is that garner a significant role in a specific arc, have their moments here and there. Umaru-chan\u2019s best friend, Ebina, is undoubtedly one note in how she is continuously shy whenever she is near people. Not to say that they are not funny by any stretch, it just does not raise the bar for one of the best shy girls in anime. Sylphinford is pretty hilarious as Umaru-chan\u2019s gaming rival. Kirie Motoba, however, is my least favorite of the cast. It mostly comes down to the fact that whenever she is with any other character, like Umaru-chan, her personality gets overshadowed by how bland it is.\\n\\n\r\nI want to give an honorable mention to the OP/ED, which I rarely ever do in reviews only if it is something special. To which Umaru-chan\u2019s is quite the special one that always sets the stage for what you are in for. Just from the first ten seconds of the OP always makes me bob my body up and down to the rhythm of the cute repetition of Umaru-chan shouting \u201cUmr hai\u201d over and over makes me giddy with excitement every time. Aimi Tanaka\u2019s performance proves she can be exciting not only with her voice over but also her singing, even if it isn\u2019t the best voice in the business.\\n\\n\r\nFinding a great otaku comedy is hard to come by. As many as there are, some are good or decent enough to think of it as a good time waster and some are wholly average or below that do not have any punch to their jokes. Himouto Umaru-chan has officially risen my optimism for more comedies of this nature like this one to come out more often. It succeeded in proving to me that this type of comedy is far from dead. I know some may groan at that notion, but if more studios take notes from Himouto Umaru-chan, I\u2019m all for it.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

            "content": "By day she is known as the famous perfect girl with princess like qualities: Umaru-sama, but by night she transforms into the fridge raiding, cola drinking, snack munching, and brother mongering girl known as: Umaru-chan. She is the epitome of cute and fun characters; she gives off the kind of aura that makes you want to forgive her for even her biggest grievances. She is adorable, she is malicious, she is conniving, and all the while still manages to be sweet. She is the kind of character who will make you froth at the mouth with anger, and then seconds later offer you her favoritething begging for forgiveness. She is heartwarming and reminded me instantly of my time watching Oreimo (How can my little sister be this cute), minus the incest obviously. We are introduced to a girl who when outside is: kind, loving, mature, serious, and someone that others look up to. However as soon as she gets home and puts on her orange hamster cloak she transforms into the annoying yet lovable pest that she truly is, a quality she is only willing to show around her brother. This show is hilarious and a blast, as it should be expected seeing as how it is a comedy.\\n\r\n----Spoiler Free----\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 7\\n\r\nThis show has a wonderful main character, however she is unfortunately the only character who seems to shine out of all the cast, this show reminds me a lot of Nyarko-san, in that the whole entire show is supported by a single really well fleshed out and lovable character. While the cast as a whole may have great chemistry, and complement each other perfectly (ie. Umaru and her brother) leading to tons of funny and enjoyable moments. It still must be noted that none of the other characters really get developed any further, and at the end of the show they are the exact same person as they were at the start. The same can be said for even the main character Umaru-chan, while she does face her mistakes head on, and seemingly learns from them. The episode will end and i the next episode she'll do something which basically mirrors what she was scolded for. This lack of growth is a given though, seeing as how all of the comedic elements stem from the duality in her character, and how she only reveals certain characteristics to certain people. That topped with the perversion of her originally perfect image lead to a rather jarring, and because of that funny story.\\n\r\nPlot: 7\\n\r\nPacing: 8\\n\r\nWhen you start up a slice of life/ comedy show, you don\u2019t go into it expecting much in terms of plot development, the reasoning behind that is similar to why there isn\u2019t any character development. The comedy aspect of these types of shows often relies on the state that the characters are currently in, in order to create a parody of reality, one that we as humans find to be funny. Going into more detail about that, this show has little to no real advancement in plot and stays in its comfort zone throughout the entire story. The show is divided up into a bunch of little skits, most of which take place in the comforts of their home, wherein Umaru, the main character, is made to reveal what we as an audience are seeking to see, a funny and abnormal character whom we seem to become fond of and attached to. \\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nOnce again there isn\u2019t much that can be said about the art. It didn\u2019t serve us up any new kind of controversial art style, nor did it really push its own boundaries. It, like this show, stayed in its comfort zone utilizing a more warm and bubbly feeling animation style. The art was all in all well directed and fitted the tone and mood of the show. As for the music, like the art style, it fit the show well with some nice and quirky music to accompany Umaru\u2019s escapades, and an above average intro song. The background music while not standing out did a nice job creating and maintain the atmosphere of the show.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nIn the end I find that the most important part of a show is whether it is enjoyable or not, and let me tell you, oh is this show enjoyable. I found myself smiling throughout a majority of the show and sympathizing with the characters who I had grown to adore. I considered giving a perfect score in terms of enjoyment however there were times where the comedy went over my head due to culture differences, or times where the sits just plain had nothing of interest to bring to the show. And so it is for those reasons that I award Himouto Umaru-chan with\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 80/100\\n\r\nThank you for reading. Definitely be sure to check out the show if you haven\u2019t seen it already, and I hope you have a nice day.\\n",

Umaru tries to hide her true self(otaku) because she fears how will her family,friends and peers react if theyfined out that she, Umaru,epitome for elegance,brilliance and perfection,is actually a stinky otaku who likes to play video games,read manga and sleep all day. Umaru is represents every anime fan,gamer,bookworm that hides his hobbies,his passion because of social stigma.We do this because we care to much what people think about as,we fear that we will be ridiculed because we love Chinese cartoons ENOUGH. Commrades , it is time to stop this oppression,it is time to grab our anime figurines , our husbando and waifu pillows it is time for REVOLUTION.\\n\\n\r\nArt-Very good art style.I like bright colors because it puts in exposition lighthearted tones in this anime.Animation is fluid,characters are consistent in their appearance(not like Namis boobs in One Piece anime).\\n\\n\r\nSound-Decent, nothing special in my opinion.It like soundtrack from forgotten Nintendo game-nobody really cares that much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-You have your standard archetypes like good brother,one weird friend,one shy friend,one crazy friend but I enjoyed them. Well written with some twists here and there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-It is anime with decent humor and solid story.Nothing extraordinary but is good anime for relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9/12 communist lolis\\n\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "This anime was recommended to me by one of my friends. I'm just gonna point this out now but this is pretty much your average comedy slice of life anime with cliches all over the place. If you're looking for a great story then this is not for you. Also if you dislike this '' annoying '' imouto type who forces her onii-chan to do everything you'll seriously hate this.\r\nStory 5/10 : \r\nAs i've stated before, this doesn't have a good storyline. It's pretty much how the main characters spend their days. What i do like is however that they try to hint alot ofrelation and expose the main things about the anime. They will try to make you hyped about when her secret will be revealed or trying to create some shipping. There's even hint of backstory. However this anime will not bother doing any of that since they have to keep the manga running forever, you know.  The loose and unconnected storyline might get you confused however remember that every episode is a singular episode with some connections here and there.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what seperates this anime from others. It's an extremely calming slice of life without any tension or drama. This is a perfect show to watch if you just wanna laugh and enjoy since it really doesn't want to create any tensional problem or any development in anything all. This is however great since every comedy anime has some type of conflict. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 :\\n\\n\r\nI can't comment much on this except that the character design is good however nothing special. However sadly it is below average in terms of animation compared to today (not overall) which does minus point it, however there's nothing large to notice so do not get put down by thinking it has bad art.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem people has with the art is that they dislike chibi and moe type of character designs which is what this anime excels at. Honestly there's not really much of loliness here and you shouldn't be annoyed unless you have a grudge against moe. I personally like moe designs and also like cute female characters which is literally the definition of Umaru so it's a big plus for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM is very relaxing and sets the mood most of the time. This is a very good point of the anime, but as said there's absolutely nothing memorable whatsoever in terms of OST. I've never said '' yes, the OST finally came up ''. I even forgot it even existed. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very good in this anime. I really think most of the characters fit their voice actors and they're also very skilled. I don't have any complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is probably very hated and very loved. I can't explain it so just try listening to it and you'll see what i mean. I personally like the opening, although there's nothing more to it. It's memorable due to the parodic tone the opening has. The ending song is not bad but i really couldn't care less about it. The OP/ED however sets me in a somewhat correct mood which is a plus.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10 :\\n\\n\r\nHonestly you have this set of typical characters which are likeable. I even did some shippings because they were likeable and the main girl (Umaru) really takes on an interesting social point. Although it might see very common but trying to hide your indoor life from your life with other people is something we're all mostly doing and can even cost you your real life relationships if you're too deep. I really like how Umaru is trying to hide her otaku life. This is actually i myself am doing at school with like 99% of the people there. I am not open with ANY non anime watcher at all. My school personality and real life are too different.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's the problem you ask? I did say that the characters are likeable. This by no means mean that they got depth. This also means they hardly got any character development. They remain the exact same as the start. Umaru is probably the one i expected to get developed the most however i was left disappointed. She is still this character who drags around her Onii-chan to do everything. You can somewhat see her opening up to the people around her however she is still kind of the exact same thing.\\n\\n\r\nObviously i know the point of this anime but it's still sad, you know :(.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThis does what it's meant to. It's really enjoyable and keeps you to watch it. I do not recommend you binge-watch it after the mid-point (the early point worked well when i binged watched it). It will eventually tire you out and you will give it a lower score than you intented to. The comedy is good but it somewhat repetitive with these overused scenes however i don't think this will stop you from enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really isn't anything special and is pretty much a very good relaxing anime with some annoying cliches. This doesn't have any conflict at all nor does it have much character development at all. It's really just a fun anime without any cliffhangers which you might enjoy unless you really dislike moe art. What sets this back is this tone of not wanting to continue any department.",

The episodes are very repetitive, and not much happens other than Umaru bossing her brother around and being an absolute pig. At least the art is tight, but a turd is still a turd no matter how much glitter you throw on it. \r\nI hate this show so much.

            "content": "There are a lot of people who, for some reason, fancy Hyundai. Back in my previous reviews, I did have an a-ok tone over Hyundai (or was I just trying to be nice), but as time went by, I was beginning to think the cringe it would be to own one. I would like to really sit and talk to someone who owns such and repeatedly ask them if they know what a car is, and if they know any other automakers from Japan, Germany, America, even Italy.\r\nIs it because Hyundai looks \u201cfluidic\u201d and \u201cbeautiful to look at\u201d? I wanna know because this kind ofimprudent query is the very kind of impulse I feel over asking an anime-fan or otaku on why they like Himouto! Umaru-chan.\\n\\n\r\nBecause why does Himouto! got a SEVEN+ score here in MAL? Is it because of her \u2018kawaiiness\u2019?\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m somehow okay with it, the same okay-ish I feel on Hyundai, which is a car brand I honestly never bother. The thing is, \u2018why bother\u2019? Just why are we bothering with Hyundai if there are Subarus, BMWs, Alfas and Fords around, and the price-ranged Toyotas, Nissans and Hondas; is the same way as why bother with Himouto! if there are KinMoza, Non Non Biyori, Yuru Yuri, and a lot more KyoAni\u2019s to add to the moeblob list?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe perhaps it\u2019s because of the very eponymous character, Umaru-chan herself. Otakus dig this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 4\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a slice-of-life, CGDCT thing this. However, the antics and comedies that Umaru herself does, with the characters such as her brother and friends Nana and Kirie are a bit of a daft, like an automatic transmission (presumably from Hyundai) that does make the engine roar, but couldn\u2019t give the power needed, or due to the fact that it lags most of the time the gear is shifted. As projected of CGDCT, plot and storyline are easy and relaxing. Himouto did seem to deliver these along with Hayate-ish parodies, but the charm of the story really doesn\u2019t pick up, unlike KinMoza for example.\\n\\n\r\nLet me put it this way for comparison: KinMoza and Himouto does have one particular thing shared: they both are otaku-societal tropes about what anime fans are and can be. The former focuses on \u2018genkis\u2019 and \u2018engrish\u2019 and \u2018japanophiles\u2019 and \u2018british-philes\u2019; while the latter focuses on \u2018otaku-ness\u2019 and \u2018gamers\u2019. Putting a seeming \u2018genki kawaii shoujo\u2019 in the guise of Umaru giving the otaku-slash-gamer-slash-lazy-kawaii persona should have worked, as WataMote\u2019s Mokocchi surely did. But somehow, it didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThough to give it a benefit-of-doubt, Himouto might work on the surface, when you\u2019re too consumed about Umaru\u2019s \u2018kawaiiness\u2019 that you can\u2019t think more for yourself, or you\u2019re simply not discerning about plot and characterization, you ended up rating this beyond 7 really.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 1\\n\\n\r\nSo Himouto should have worked its charm but didn\u2019t. What I can devise though, is the characterization of Umaru-chan herself. Let me quote from the show itself: \\n\\n\r\n\u201cMy younger sister, Umaru, is pretty and popular. She's kind, smart, and gifted with many talents. She's the perfect high school student, without any flaws.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSee what I mean? Umaru is a goddamned MARY-SUE. This is the very type of character that I\u2019d like to put an Excalibur-face on, every literature-oriented person loathes and grimaces, the epitome of a traditional mary-sue where every author (who does learn literature and proper creative writing, and not just a housewife) is taught to avoid making. Mary-sues, especially the traditionally pretty, popular, gifted, perfect, no flaws, this is not just a Mary-sue, it\u2019s Bella Swan in kawaii and kirei desu, just without the uber-romance. (KEYWORD: traditional Mary-sue)\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s entitled opinion. But if you have decency of not wasting your own time watching a one-dimensional, flat, unmoving, static character in the eponymous role who assumes a \u2018perfect\u2019 image, does throw fits and tantrums while maintaining \u2018perfection\u2019, then let me tell you that Japan releases about twenty anime titles per quarter of the year. Go to www.livechart.me and count \u2018em all: that\u2019s about eighty and I mean 80/EIGHTY anime titles on average per year. Why can\u2019t you go with the other titles instead?\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 5\\n\\n\r\nSound is moe-good. I know I\u2019ve noted the seiyuus but right now, I really don\u2019t want to bother. Oh, in Umaru\u2019s UMR-mode, her seiyuu really does sound like Kanae Itou. Maybe I\u2019d give this a 6. While in her little-shit mode, she does have a little bit of Aki Toyosaki sounding, so that\u2019s a 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 3\\n\\n\r\nI \u201cmight\u201d have enjoyed it like enjoying driving a Hyundai, you know, when it is the only car you\u2019ve got and you don\u2019t want a bicycle, or if zombies are on your tail. The thing is though, Himouto isn\u2019t the only anime on my list: there was Kekkai-Sensen that needed to be finished, Sore ga Seiyuu that was faithfully made for a seiyuu-fan like me, Fate Illya season 3 which I know will still be lolitastic, Etotama, Shirobako, Charlotte (which is effing horrible but that\u2019s on a different review), IdolMaster Cinderella, and most especially Non Non Biyori Repeat. Bothering with Himouto is like bothering to spend time checking a Hyundai when you\u2019ve got enough cash to get a Toyota or even a Subaru.\\n\r\nHence, the score of 3 you\u2019re seeing here is mostly directed to Kirie, who rather resembles Mokocchi.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 5\\n\\n\r\nI personally don\u2019t like Himouto. Parodies can't save this one for me because there's Hayate, Danna ga Nani, Lucky Star, even Gintama. If you\u2019re asking why still I watched it from episode 1 to end is only because of MAL-listing, so that I can put this title on my anime list and move on. Another reason is because I do hate it when some otakus ask me in cases when I haven\u2019t fully watched it, then why am I criticizing the show. Thus, I\u2019ve watched it, not because I like it, but only to fill the 560+ list of anime I already have and to prevent Himouto-fans from shitdorsing their Mary-sue.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this is a review written by someone who has 560-something anime on his list, a seasoned-fan of moeblobs, and I would like to stress that I\u2019ve seen a lot of CGDCTs from K-On to Yuyushiki, YuruYuri, AcchiKocchi, and I do love seiyuus, but Himouto never compels the iconic cute things of these aforementioned titles. My take is that when it comes to CGDCTs and/or slice-of-life, it\u2019s always about the characterization over the plot. CGDCT lovers probably wouldn\u2019t give a damn about where the plot goes and comes around, but more of how the shoujo and her seiyuu would do cute things and moe antics, easy on the mind, relaxing on the heart. \\n\\n\r\nPutting a mary-sue on this formula and this turn of one-dimensional thoughtlessness is just a complete waste of time.\\n\r\nThough it doesn\u2019t seem so to Himouto-fans, or those who don\u2019t bother watching Boku wa Tomodachi and Accel World and won\u2019t do character-analysis, and thus are just so happy watching Umaru\u2019s superficial kawaiiness. For these \u201cHimouto fans\u201d, that\u2019s all fine and prudent in your point-of-view\u2014stick to your Mary-sue, as hand in heart I respect that, just as the same gauge of respect towards Hyundai-lovers. Or wait\u2014I think I do have the answer to my Hyundai-question: maybe these Hyundai-lover people really don\u2019t mind on what a car is, or as long as Hyundai does look good on the exterior design. Guess that principle applies for Himouto fans also.\\n\r\nAgain, why I scored this 5 overall has a lot to do with Mokocchi-look-alike Kirie, and Umaru\u2019s seiyuu. Screw the plot, chaps\u2014I\u2019m all for Kirie and Umaru\u2019s seiyuu, parody-less or not.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: For me there\u2019s none really; but MAL rated this as SEVEN+, and MAL users can\u2019t perhaps ever be wrong (no BellaSwan fan was wrong, too, right?).",

            "content": "Laziness.  The pinnacle of human bliss.  Doing absolutely nothing is something of a rarity these days as we all run around like headless chickens doing god knows what in order to properly execute whatever we have to do in our lives.  So, what if we followed the life of one someone who is blessed with such a simple life?  Here's Himouto!  Umaru-chan!\r\nStory: Umaru Doma is the pinnacle of high school perfection.  She's friendly, she is the best in both academics and sports, and she very beautiful and all around the most popular girl in school.  But underneath thatfacade, when she arrives home, she transforms, donning her signature hamster hood and turning herself into her true form, the himouto, (A Hikkiomori Imouto, basically) where her perfect appearance is melted away to reveal the selfish and cola loving beast that's inside...  And, that's pretty much the whole story.  \\n\\n\r\nAdapted from a manga whose average chapter page length is only 11 pages, Himuto plays as a slice of life show that reflects off of a bunch of minisodes grouped together to form one complete episode.  By mostly taking chapters that relate to one another with a common theme and stringing them together, Himouto's storyline is mostly linear story with some progression to move the story along, mostly in the form of the way characters interact to each other and in some cases, how they act.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for any central themes, Himouto occasionally goes into a slightly more serious note by relating to the sibling relationships within the series.  It's a nice touch because it doesn't actually bring much away from the story and actually, kind of adds a nice bit of depth to the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nBut for the most part, the show focuses primarily on Umaru and her selfish Himouto lifestyle.  The comedy of the show is drawn from the various antics that she gets into or executes in order to get whatever she wants, as well her tripolar behavior that makes her a bit of a more complicated character than you would think, sort of.  Umaru herself shows a lot of selfishness and laziness as a character, so, if you don't like people like that, then I would not suggest watching this show.  (Also, don't question the whole chibi shrinking thing she does when she devolves into Himouto form.  Apparently, it's a physical change, and I have no idea how she does it.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique base story\\n\r\n+ Little bit of character depth\\n\r\n+/- Comedy comes from the title character and her antics  (good or bad depending how you perceive that kind of personality)\\n\r\n-  Show is mostly unchanging and static with the way it presents its content\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Since this show mostly reflects off of the older brother/little sister relationship, every character but one in this series belongs in one of these camps.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have the title character of the series, Doma Umaru.  As the mascot and main plot point of the series, Umaru as a character is a very odd creature.  As I mentioned before, she is \"tripolar\", as she has more than one \"form\" that she lives her life in.  As a result, Umaru is quite the piece of work.  Her first form is her \"outside\" form where she is the calm, collected, beautifully perfect self that she is.  This is the form that Umaru wants to be seen as outside of her house, hence the reason why she adopts this as the way she wants to reveal herself to the world.  And then we have her true form, \"Himouto\", where she dons a hamster hood and devolves into the size of a chibi for maximum laziness.  As the main form showcased in the series in general, Himouto is Umaru's true nature, which is a selfish, spoiled little hamster with a pension for whining for whatever she wants, lazing around at home by playing games or watching anime, and drinking cola; LOTS and LOTS of cola.  And finally, we have \"UMR\", her gaming persona.  UMR is the least used form in Umaru's arsenal.  Mostly used for gaming or arcade related purposes, UMR really only serves to help Umaru deal with one of the other imoutos in the series, a point I will get back to on later.  As a character, she doesn't particularly develop as a person.  She occasionally has lapses of realization and pops out a sweet little moment for a second, but the show eventually just returns back to its status quo with Umaru being selfish again, recreating the never ending cycle of pain for her brother and for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about her brother, let's talk about him.  Doma Taihei, the Onii-chan of Umaru.  As a hardworking sales rep, Taihei is a man who is very devoted in his time and energy in trying to support both he and his sister since the two of them live in the same apartment.  Very frustrated by the way his sister acts with her constant whining and complete disregard for his own feelings, Taihei serves as the straight man for the series, while also being a bit weak because he succumbs to Umaru's cries rather easily.  While the series mostly focuses on Umaru, Himouto also puts a good bit of focus into Taihei and the relationship between the two siblings which is nice, but unfortunately doesn't last long because of the status quo of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nFor side characters, we have three other pairs that correspond to the \"older brother/little sister\" relationship which are Kirie, Sylphin, and Ebina who each have an older brother that also appears in the series.  (Though, Ebina's isn't revealed in the anime.) As characters, each of the other characters in the series serve as characters to fill in the blanks.  They're not neccesarily deep, they don't have many actual character traits to them, there's almost no character development for them, and they are all fairly trope-like.  But, all three of the other girls in the series progressively get to know Umaru through one of her three forms.  (Ebina with \"Outside\" Umaru, Kirie with \"Himouto\" Umaru, and Sylphin with \"UMR\" Umaru.  So, this is where the tripolarness sort of comes in handy.  Sort of.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Interesting main character (Umaru is known to be liked and hated as a character)\\n\r\n-  Characters are mostly one trick ponies\\n\r\n-  Little to no character development\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for Umaru is a moe-like style with bright colors that reflect off of the lighthearted feeling that the show gives off.  There really isn't much to say about it since the art is pretty standard.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for comedy, Himouto takes a lot of the common comedic tropes for anime, utilizing dramatized backgrounds, different facial expressions for characters, and lots and lots of Umaru.  They also have quite a bit of references in this series, so if you like references, this show has quite a few.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ References in the artwork\\n\r\n+ Decent but standard quality art\\n\\n\r\nSound: Now for the sound.  Himouto's tracks are quite few in number, as the show has it's OP and it ED, as well as the two other songs in the series that serve as the background songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is a very addictive song, as it encapsulates the complete madness that is Umaru's Himouto form and as such is, while not a masterpiece, a very catchy song, which makes it memorable, I guess.  The ED on the other hand is a little song that is sung by the seiyuus of the four girls.  Even with that though, it's not a song I find to be particularly memorable as it's pretty generic and doesn't have anything to it that'll latch its tune into your mind.\\n\\n\r\nFor the two or so background tracks that are in the series, there's not really much to say about them.  Using a calm and airy tone for the songs, they bring about the kind of emotion that's supposed to be conveyed during the scene.  There's nothing really memorable about them aside from adding a bit more to what Umaru is doing in that point in time.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Catchy OP\\n\r\n-  Rest of the soundtrack was average at best\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  So, all in all, did I enjoy this adaptation?  Well, I can safely say that I did.  Himouto as a series is one that really just focuses on the fun that it wants to convey, not really taking itself seriously and really just lets Umaru do whatever she wants.  They actually did rather well with translating the tiny 11 page chapters into a full-length episode, which I at first was unsure how they were going to do it.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  Umaru as a series is one of my more favorable casual reads, and seeing some of my favorite scenes come to life is always a grand little treat.  It was just as wacky as the original series, they didn't cut any corners, and it was overall, still very enjoyable.  Plus, it's a series that actually has some progression, so it's also pretty quaint in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI was a bit sad that they didn't actually show Ebina's brother, since that would've completed the entire set of \"Onii-chan/Imouto\" characters in this show.  Of course, that would've caused more complications because there's some buildup to that, but still.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend watching this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes, actually.  Honestly, I'd say just give this series a shot.  It's a fun little series that doesn't take itself too seriously, and while everyone is one-sided, makes for quite a charming little cast.  Of course, if you're not a big fan of moe-style art, people who are completely selfish, or watching a girl down a gallon of cola in a matter of seconds, then you may reconsider the decision.",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT EVEN THOUGH THIS SERIES HAS NO PLOT\r\nThis is bar none, the worst anime I have ever seen. That's right. \"Mars of Destruction,\" \"Eiken,\" and \"Pupa,\" can safely be considered masterpieces compared to this cancerous monstrosity of an anime. Allow me to elaborate upon my position... \r\nI love slice of life anime, and have always been a big fan of series' that deal with everyday people doing everyday things. The simplicity of a slice of life concept allows for us as viewers to relate to any given character, and really get to know them, since the entirety of a series hinges on them andtheir life, without any specific overarching plot. Essentially, I love the character studies that are done in slice of life anime. We have the opportunity as viewers to participate in, and get to know a given character, or characters, who live lives much like ours, and can relate to us on various levels. \\n\\n\r\n\"Himouto! Umaru-chan,\" falls into this descriptor I have laid out, and we do get to know our characters pretty well in their mundane, everyday lives. Umaru, the main character in this series, is a model student, gorgeous, and well loved by her classmates. By all conventional metrics, she is the epitome of a successful adolescent. She is responsible, diligent, respectful and sophisticated. Or so we think... Umaru has a well kept secret. When classes are over, and she returns home for the evening, she is a complete WEEB. She is an avid gamer, anime watcher, and junk food eater. As anime fans ourselves, this may seem like the dream sometimes, right? Umaru can definitely be relatable to us in terms of the interests she holds, and the enjoyment she derives from said interests.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where my beef begins, and pretty much ends too. This is the entirety of the show. Umaru faking her school life, going home, and doing weeb stuff. That's it. As I mentioned previously in slice of life anime, I look to partake in a character study. I look to see the growth in a character as a series progresses. I look to the characters, because they define the story. If there is no character development, there is no story. This is where \"Himouto Umaru-chan,\" falls apart. As a character, Umaru is not only one dimensional, she is also incredibly annoying! Immature, bratty, spoiled and entitled, she embodies everything that is wrong with anime culture. There are frustrating and annoying characters in many series' that I enjoy; however, these characters are often clearly defined, undergo changes, and move in a certain direction, for better or worse. They may be stagnant in their annoyance, but we can see many sides of them as a series progresses. This is not the case with Umaru. We are treated to the exact same character in every single episode. And being a show defined by the actions of its characters, we are by extension treated to the exact same episode, over and over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nI held on to hope in this series for so long. I waited earnestly for some type of character development or turning point. But alas, I waited in vain. There are moments where Umaru seems genuinely sympathetic, caring and vulnerable, especially when interacting with her older brother and guardian. These moments are her most interesting, as they show a side of her that seems more real, and deep. I don't mind that she does her weeb stuff, but I've wanted to further get to know Umaru the person. We get to know Umaru's interests, Umaru's tantrums, Umaru's favorite snacks, but we never really know for sure just who Umaru is. \\n\\n\r\nThis being said, I hate this anime. I can't stand Umaru, I can't stand her older brother that spoils her. I feel bad for Umaru's friend Ebina, and I can't stand Umaru's creepy video gamer friend. There is absolutely nothing to like here. Even the theme song is super annoying. Yep, this series just gets on my nerves. I don't recommend it to anyone. \\n\\n\r\nFinal score-1\\n\\n",

I would. First off, let me explain that I have no problems with you liking this show, I guess I can see why someone would like it, and I also urge you to form your own opinions on it by going and watching it yourself. That being said, let me tell you why I hate this show with a passion.One person, Umaru. God, I hate her with all my heart, I was hoping that she would get some sort of comeuppance, but no. Umaru is a mary sue and everything goes her way, she never changes or develops really, and she always gets what she wants. I am not saying that she has to lose it all and become extremely depressed in order to make me enjoy it, but at least SOMETHING. I only continued watching this series  out of respect for a friend, since I promised him I would watch it all. After the frst episode, I should of stopped. Other than Umaru's dreadful character, I guess I would give it a 4/10, the story isn't amazing and not to mention when not infuriating, it was boring. However, I know that many do like, so I can probably assume that I am the outlier here, so I would personally recommend that you don't spend precious time watching this, however, you should always give the first episode a try, just in case you do like it.\\n",

I get it, the chibi form of the main character is cute and marketable, it's being used on banners and logos and whatnot, but it's all just a ruse.\r\nNow let me make this clear.  I love slice of life anime.  I loved Nichijou, Barakamon and the list goes on.  However this particular anime has a few breaking flaws.  First off, the main character is a bratty teenager who basically gets whatever she wants and if she doesn't,she throws a tantrum.  Do you even understand how much I wanted to stick my hand into the screen and bitch slap the ever-living shit out of this cheeto lookin' ass?  You know when you go out, there's always that one kid who just screams and throws a tantrum because they're spoiled to hell and their parents don't do shit so you're stuck with this terrible annoyance that you can't do anything about?  This anime is basically that.  Twelve whole episodes of that.  The characters are just not likable and the comedy doesn't vary.  It's the same shit throughout the whole series.  The main character puts on an angelic front when she's out in public and everyone loves her, then she comes home and turns into an orange potato and does whatever the hell she wants and whines when she doesn't get her way.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the whole anime.  Not even kidding.  I mean sure, let's bring in another character in different episodes, but it's the same exact thing that happens every time.  This isn't even a \"this annoying character starts off as someone you hate but gradually becomes someone you love\" type deal.  She stays an annoying brat throughout the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nI am genuinely boggled that this is rated as high as it is.  I can get behind anime with the pure intention of comedy like Gintama, Baka Test etc. but this does it so terribly that it's not even funny, literally.",

You'd think I was oversimplifying it, but I'm really not. The plot is rather stagnant and doesn't change much throughout the show (this isn't necessarily a bad thing)\r\nArt-\r\nSo average that it's bad. Let me expound on that sentence:Most shows with an \"average\" artstyle usually have 1 especially notable thing about the art. With Himouto, you could say that this would be her childlike form, but that's  really just taken from other shows too. \\n\\n\r\nSound- Decent soundtrack and OP. Nice to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- They all seem interesting at first, but then lose said interest when you realize how linear they are. They do their role okay though, so can't say it's the worst I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Show is very entertaining for the first couple episodes, then becomes stagnant. Not sure what to tell you on this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- Himouto does a decent job as a comedy, and if you don't mind jokes seeming a bit similar to ones previously used, give it a shot. Can't give this show too high of a rating because simply getting rid of your boredom for an hour or two just won't suffice.",

            "content": "I\u2019m not going to lie. Watching Himouto! Umaru-chan (My Two-Faced Little Sister) makes me feel like a kid all over again. Each week, each episode is like an indoor and outdoor adventure of its own. Titular character Umaru Doma is the class superstar as well as the model that almost everyone looks up to. Her brother, Taihei Doma, is kind of like the sidekick providing her shelter, food, and a sense of comfort for her when she\u2019s living at home. Really though, this series took me by surprise like an unexpected storm. And I\u2019m talking about the type of otaku storm where you have tosee it to believe it.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the 4-koma of the same name, the series is adapted by studio Doga Kobo. In recent years, they are better known for their work with slice of life stories. Essentially, that\u2019s how this show is like. The first episode easily establishes Umaru\u2019s ulterior character. She literally lives a double life. At school, she acts mature, friendly, and in general someone that people idolizes. At home, she is almost the complete opposite with a lazy lifestyle, obsessive otaku personality, and acts like a NEET. This makes the show a bit odd at first seeing how each episode reflects on her double life style. What the series does well on this perspective is to demonstrate genuine comedy. The show makes fun of the otaku culture by saturating it with an immense amount of parody. Umaru\u2019s character is someone that people would least expect to be an otaku from the outside. Yet, the show satires that with her lifestyle at home. In retrospect, the show delivers what I would call a cultural comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also consists of other characters ranging from Umaru\u2019s shy childhood friend Ebina, self-proclaimed rival Sylphynford, and the bizarre and frightening girl, Kirie Motoba. Each of them has a different personality that makes them stand out on their own. Their interactions with Umaru usually brings out the honesty of their characters. Furthermore, each episode provides a better insight about Umaru as well. We learn more about Umaru from both sides of her lifestyle. And through that, the show can make us feel attached to the characters. Umaru\u2019s relationship with her brother can also be quite entertaining to watch. Her brother is the average type of guy with an average job and working an average salary. Umaru often makes him run errands for her although she sometimes gets scolded. Their relationship is the typical brother and sister type with no absurdity involving incest or abuse. As lighthearted as it can be though, the chemistry between some characters can be a bit dull. While most times, the on-screen chemistry has an attachable feel, the concepts are usually recycled tropes. Umaru\u2019s otaku lifestyle can also be a bit odd to get used to considering that it\u2019s so different compared to the outer image she created at school. Selfish and lazy. Those are not good attributes for a young girl like her. But even so, the show satires her personality and connects them with her lifestyle without over exaggeration.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the series focuses on a more episodic basis, there are a few reoccurring elements throughout the story. Umaru\u2019s double life is obviously one of them but also some of the competition she faces. This includes her love of video games and she later on creates a third personality specifically used to face her rival Sylphynford. Kirie\u2019s relationship with Umaru also brings an interesting idea to the show. \u201cWill someone at school eventually discover Umaru\u2019s true identity and personality?\u201d The show almost made this slip apart in the early stages and often or not, it keeps the audience at their seat of wondering that question. Finally, while there\u2019s no actual dramatic romance in the show, we do get a bit of the puppy love with Ebina. Like I mentioned before, the main supporting characters consists of different personalities and roles to make this series colorful and diverse. \\n\\n\r\nIn essence, the artwork is simplistic yet effective. Umaru\u2019s outer image is crafted with an appealing appearance with her perfectly rounded face, smile, colorful hair, and even body structure as shown in pool class. However, the more entertaining aspect comes with her deformed character. When at home, her character design is that of a kid wearing a hamster shaped hoodie. Furthermore, her behavior and reactions are often like a spoiled brat. The visual style and reactive expressions makes us believe who she is as the two-faced little sister. On the contrary, her brother looks average all throughout the series. And while there\u2019s no explicit fan service in the series, Ebina\u2019s character is designed ways that can raise some eyebrows. All that aside, the artwork is well done in terms of overall coverage.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s soundtrack is not to be underestimated. Although it lacks any sort of distinctive OST, the way comedic scenes are done is often convincing thanks to the matching soundtrack. Similarly, conversations and dialogues performed by the characters makes you curious about what they will say next often. This is especially true for Umaru as she leads a double life. And from her performance, Umaru\u2019s VA Ami Tanaka deserves a bit of praise for portraying a character with completely different personalities. Other noticeable voices includes Kirie with her intimidating tone or Sylphynford\u2019s pride. The OP and ED theme songs are also creatively done. In particular, the OP song fuses the double life imagery of Umaru.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Himouto! Umaru-chan runs the risk of being a big joke, it ultimately has enough comedy and convincingly gets the audience to laugh. There\u2019s enough jokes in the series that makes it look like satire and in general makes fun of the otaku culture thanks to Umaru. It also has enough time to not forget about the other characters. Furthermore, Umaru\u2019s daily adventures will often get the audience curious to see what she is capable of doing next. As a series that stars a peculiar girl with two-faces, this is more than just a show about a brother and sister.",

Well, it is; In the first three episodes at least.\r\nBasically, Umaru is a high school student who's admired by everyone because of her kind personality, looks, and brains. But once she's at home, she's a lazy weeb who bosses her brother around 25/8 to do shit for her. The art is decent, I guess, but the main point is suppose to be Umaru's personality, or at least I think it is.\r\nThere's some side characters, but they don't do much. The animehas 0 plot. The entire series is just the same repetitive scenes and jokes. Umaru doesn't improve as a person, even though there were multiple occurrences where the plot could've developed, but nothing. Although the episode where she gets to be with her mother for Christmas was really touching, it was the only time that there was some kind of emotional factor in the series.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I watched this anime in hope that I could just relax and laugh, but after episode 5 it got pretty boring, and it was just generic scenes of Umaru being spoiled and playing video games. People hype this anime way too much. It had so much potential, but nothing happens.",

            "content": "A very peculiar creature is living among us, elusive for so many years due to its ability to perfectly imitate a human being. First discovered by SankakuHead in 2013, but his findings are in a language known only to few, but thanks to the hard work of cryptologists at Dogakobo they have provided us with SankakuHead's findings in a format we can make sense of and I am writing this report after going through their findings.\r\nThough without a botanical name as yet, but persons around it refer to the creature as 'Umaru', so we shall refer to it as such within the course of thisreport.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance the Umaru seems to be a casual and playful creature, it is largely lethargic in nature and enjoys to indulge itself in as much frivolities as it can. Its preferred natural habitat is a suburban apartment with dimmed lightning at low temperatures, it spends most of its time consuming human entertainment such as Television, Video games and the Internet, its main diet though mostly consists of barbecued foods and chilled drinks, however we have witnessed it consuming fruits and vegetables but it shows a strong adverseness to it and only consumes it when forced or as a last resort when starvation kicks in. The Umaru is capable of becoming dangerous however when not allowed its usual diet, environment or entertainment, throwing tantrums and wailing at most occasions.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting thing about the Umaru though is its ability to camouflage so perfectly whenever it leaves its habitat and ventures into human society, we have no idea how its capable of doing this but when it does it takes on the form of the perfect human being; smart, beautiful and quite flawless in every aspect of its activities. This has led it to be awed and adored by most in society but heads will surely be turned if and whenever its nature in its own habitat is exposed to them.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its somewhat selfish and secluded lifestyle it still has a couple of close human companions which it interacts with. It has a blood brother which it lives with by the name of Taihei, but as far as we can tell from investigation he seems to be human, but being a blood relative of the Umaru that section of the investigation is marked as inconclusive at this point. Taihei does most of the housework due to the Umaru's lethargic nature, he is well aware of all its  characteristics but expresses no serious alarm about it, he does constantly try to lecture and reform the Umaru to the right way but at this point to no success. They express a fondness and affection for each other as siblings, but her usual anecdotes are a constant nuisance to him and we on the investigation team found their interactions amusing and a times heart warming to see.\\n\\n\r\nDogakobo's interpretation of the Umaru and its surroundings is very lovely to look at indeed, though simplistic and not in too much detail it still carries a nice mix of color tones that is very lovely to look at. There are no overly excessive motions but constant motion even in small bouts is present to always make sure things never seem dull.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion there is still much we don't know about this creature and its environment, but from the little that we have seen here it is apparent that it is a charming, playful and a times boisterous, and its many antics and characteristics have often left us laughing or at least left us with a smile on our face and we're sure will be pleasing to many.",

            "content": "If my sister acted the way the main character does in this show I think I'd take her round the back and shoot her.\r\nWow, that was quite the dark opening, wasn't it? Let's...Let's try that again (cough cough).\r\nThis show makes me want to find the nearest kitchen utensil and then locate the nearest plug socket so that I will never have to look at this orange football ever again...(that's better!)\r\nIf you can't yet tell from my terrible jokes I really do not like this show. What started off a harmless comedy with some fun little jokes stays as such throughout the entire show with nocharacter growth while repeating the same gag over and over again. When this anime was airing last year there was no escaping the orange tic-tac since she was used for every single reaction image and post on every website forum. She was everywhere and unfortunately is still around now. Every Comic-Con I go to, not only am I surrounded by about twenty overweight Narutos, seventy-two Rems and six-hundred Deadpools but also about a million Umarus. As far as the eye can see, all I witness is a shitty waifu. Even in my porn this annoying sister is beginning to show up...and that creeps me out.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this anime is pretty paper thin and the crust of each scenario and joke is centred around the little sister character being an absolute cunt to her big brother. Teaching kids everywhere that it's fine to throw a tantrum and cry if you don't get your own way just to get your pussy of an older brother to go buy you some potato chips and some cola. Rinse and repeat every episode. Umaru, as a character, is both selfish and annoying in her lifestyle. She has two sides to her life; one in which she is a model student at her school and one in which she shrinks down and becomes the useless slob that she is at heart. While this can provide some comedy for the show most of the comedy is derivative of Umaru crying to get her own way or simply watching her play games and eating food. \\n\\n\r\nUmaru's main problem is that she doesn't grow as a character in the slightest. She stays exactly the same throughout the show and the fact that the show hints at her realising that she is a little too selfish is a kick in the balls to the audience as they never do anything with it and she devolves back into the cunt that she is. Many little sisters of this nature have the same problems in anime. Take for example Kirino from the anime 'my little sister can't possibly be this much of a cunt'. She too is a selfish prick and never changes in her narrative but to be fair, Umaru is not as much of a bitch as she is...she is just annoying. Umaru, in a way, glorifies the lazy and self-entitled lifestyle that some kids are living today. You can call me cynical, and perhaps I am for thinking about this show in this nature but the entire show comes across that being a worthless member of society is okay as long as you can get someone to buy you stuff while you remain a selfish asshole.\\n\\n\r\nThe older brother is a character whom I want to reach through the computer screen and slap. As someone who has three little sisters myself, one of which is about the same age as Umaru herself I feel embarrassed by how much of a pussy he is. He never actually stands up for himself or tries to make Umaru see the error of her ways. He is just there and that's it. In terms of the supporting cast, they're a bit more lively and interesting and have more in the way of comedy. I liked Ebina the most...especially her boobs. Yes, it's shallow but if the show is this shallow, I might as well be too. The comedy is kind of hit or miss for me. While there were some moments that I felt were generally well executed there were plenty in which I couldn't care for and most of the time the writers constantly repeat jokes throughout the show. The narrative is pretty bare-bones and I'm not expecting anything remarkable out of a slice-of-life show's story but when the cast is this boring and the comedy is this stale I lose interest fast. The music was okay at best but the wooden train flute got annoying really quickly. The animation and art design was decent and get the job done but is nothing remarkable as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Umaru is a show with weak comedy and one of the worst main characters I have ever seen. Umaru was just too much of a dick for me to properly enjoy myself with this show and every time she was on screen I wanted to punch her through the monitor. One may argue that I am taking the show too seriously and that I should enjoy it for what it is. That's fine, but the show's comedy is so awful that I find that impossible. If you want to learn how to be the ultimate useless member of society, then watch this show. Awaken the Umaru in you... \\n",

            "content": "This anime went from being horrible to somewhat decent to horrible again.\r\nThis is my first review and I plan to write more in the future, so I hope I can explain well why I hate this show so damn much.\r\nFirst things first: The story.\r\nThere is none.\r\nUmaru, while being popular at school and great in every subject, just turns into a lazy otaku at home, doing nothing but gaming, watching anime, reading Manga and having her older brother she lives with do even the smallest things for her. \r\nThat's it.\r\nThere is no plot progression - aside from some season-related episodes - there is no character development,which would be rather necessary to get something out of the main character.\\n\\n\r\n\"But it's just a comedy\", you might say, \"It only has to be fun, what do you expect.\"\\n\\n\r\nOf course giving a show that bad a score only based on the fact that it has little to no story wouldn't be fair. Instead, I should focus on the humor, it's a comedy after all.\\n\r\nAnd the humor the show has... is so, so terrible. It always happens at the expense of the wrong characters, and the most unlikeable characters end up coming out on top - I can't find the humor in that.\\n\r\nI will admit that there were a few moments that felt kinda genuine, but whenever the show tried to have emotional moments otherwise, it got immediately ruined afterwards for the sake of some bad and predictable joke. [1/10]\\n\r\nThis is, naturally, directly tied to the cast of the show, which has to be one of the most unlikeable casts I have ever seen in a comedy.\\n\r\nUmaru is manipulative and lazy, almost sociopathic in the way she treats her older brother and there is no motivation for her to change her manners completely when she goes outside. She doesn't work as a character, because her \"outside\" and true personality don't fit together at all. There is no way someone could live like that - only hanging around at home, eating snacks and playing games, but still being perfectly healthy, slim, fantastic at sports and great at school without learning or training or doing anything at all. Also she has some kind of chibi form whenever she's in lazy mode and despite only having other clothing, no one aside from her brother ever recognizes her.\\n\r\nHer Brother Taihei, while being pushed around constantly, tries to change his sister for the better, but always ends up cleaning after her, buying stuff for her and feeling bad because he gets fed up with her more than one time. He goes to work yet still manages the household all on his own, and he's so much into his adorable little sister it gets annoying really fast.\\n\r\nEbina, Umaru's friend, has even less personality than that, she likes to hang out with Umaru, is shy, dumb, in love with Taihei and has big boobs.\\n\r\nKirie, another friend, is also shy, but really violent with her older brother.\\n\r\nBut it's absolutely okay, because her brother, who is a friend of Taihei's, is perverted and stupid. Nothing is wrong with girls constantly hitting guys for whatever reason, right? Isn't it just fun?\\n\r\nThen there's Sylphyn, who's competitive with Umaru, a foreigner who speaks very politely and always a bit hyper.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I'm supposed to find all of this funny somehow? I can't. \\n\r\nA character-based comedy is supposed to get the fun out of character interactions, reactions and the situations they find themselves in, but when the whole cast is either bland or horribly unlikeable, the humor doesn't work.[1/10]\\n\\n\r\nAs for art and animation, they are okay, but not great.\\n\r\nThe anime shines with really nice colors and some good, but mostly bland character designs. [5/10]\\n\r\nThe sound is also mixed. The show has a rather catchy opening, forgettable ending and boring, bland insert music.\\n\r\nThe only thing remarkable here is Umaru's Seiyuu. In my opinion, she does a great job in trying to give anything likeable to her role and I hope she gets parts in much better Anime in the future. [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nAs for my overall enjoyment... the show had some nice, relaxing parts in it, which is why I kept watching until the end, but after episode 12, I wondered why I bothered at all. [4/10]\\n\\n\r\nTotal score (NOT calculated mathematically): 1/10\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. What could have been a nice comedy focused on otaku culture turned into some really unlikeable characters I don't care about having fun. And also created one of my most hated anime characters of all time.\\n\r\nHopefully at least Umaru's Seiyuu will benefit from having been a part of this.",

            "content": "\u201cAll I want for Christmas 2015 is Ebina Nana-chan. ^^\u201d\r\nI first known about Himouto! Umaru-chan after searching what anime I should watch after finishing spring season. Honestly, I consider this as my main priority to watch for Summer 2015, but after watching Gakkou Gurashi! (Considered as my highest priority for SM 2015) I still make Himouto! Umaru chan as my second highest priority to watch in 2015, so no hard feelings for Himouto lovers. :D \r\nAnd I\u2019m really glad I watch Himouto Umaru-chan, one of the best combination of comedy and slice of life anime in my life, I don\u2019t know for others but itmay depends on their perspectives but for me I totally enjoy it. Down below is my full review about this series. Other than that, I\u2019ve learn so much from this anime that I completely forgotten to do my homeworks. And yet, most of the scenes in this series I can almost relate to my everyday life where my sister is struggling to control me when it comes to anime related staffs. Anyway, back to the review.\\n\\n\r\nI really like how they scripted the story from the manga, well except some of the scenes may be cut-out but overall it was well adapted and I like how they make the story simple and not too complex, (my perspective). Other than that, the pacing of the story is not too rushed or too slow, just right, (I haven\u2019t read the manga so excuse if I\u2019m wrong). Most of the story focuses on Umaru who has a two-faced side being one a perfect sister with strong intelligence on the outside and seconds after stepping into the house, turning into annoying yet cute otaku Umaru-chan and Taihei whom he has to deal all kinds of problems that his sister cause or make a big tantrum and this is where comedy played a big role in this series. Not much of bikini scenes except for the ED song video and the final episode if you don\u2019t drop the series. Nonetheless, this is a good 2015 summer anime for those who loves comedy and slice of life show. Not much of romance content, but still have those ship moments. Don\u2019t forget, this show has a lot of references from other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe work is done by Doga Kobo, a studio which make good anime for example Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, Yuru Yuri and recent anime Plastic Memories. Their animations are really decent, not bad for 2015 animations. The background is not too saturated as it follows the mood of the character and character designs are not too bland, in fact Umaru is quite cheerful when she is in cola mode. I love how the original character, Sankakuhead design all the characters of the series, it\u2019s pretty cute especially Ebina. Overall, not much of weird animations made by Doga Kobo.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the seiyuu which I haven\u2019t heard before are pretty new to the anime industries, yet they did an amazing job voice acting on all the characters in this series, especially the seiyuus of Umaru, Ebina, Kirie and Sylphynford. Not bad for first starters. The OP song is very catchy and perfectly match the personality of Umaru since she loves to play video games so much and the ED song well quite enjoyable to listen. OST or background music are lovely too. And the sound effects when Umaru transforms is almost related to Yuru Yuri\u2019s \u201cAkari disappearance effect\u201d because the director is from Yuru Yuri!\\n\\n\r\nI love all the characters of this series, they all have unique appearances and personality. I love how Umaru being an otaku at home and loves to talk all about games and anime to his brother because that\u2019s what I did in real life, but I do prefer her on the outside personality though and well the good thing about her is she cares for her onii-chan since he work really hard to financially support her. Sylphynford is Umaru\u2019s not really kinda rival and she loves to challenge umaru just because she is below her but nonetheless they do spent together as TSF and UMR. Kirie, is more like Tomoko from Watamote except that she is cute and shy, well Tomoko is cute too so yeah. She\u2019s having a hard time to talk with other people because of her shy personality but hopefully she would make more friends in the future, well at least Umaru help her. Ebina, ahh my favorite character of the series even though she is just a supporting character. What is so special about Ebina? Boobs? Nope, her air-headness and her kawainess throughout the series, I just wanna pet her head so much. Since she came from Akita, she is trying to improve her standard Japanese language so she can speak without making any Akita dialect, well except if she is in a good mood after tasting Tokyo\u2019s food. Other than that i completely enjoy seeing her in each episodes, makes me happy.\\n\\n\r\nWith most of the episodes has completely finished airing, I feel sad that the show had ended but at the same time, I\u2019m happy that they adapted this from the manga, I would say this is the best 2015 anime summer from my perspective and I enjoyed much watching on this, it helps me to cool down my stress after heavy load of school hours and help to cheer me up when I\u2019m feeling moody. The good thing is that, this has no incest relationship because if it does, well that\u2019s up to your imagination. Overall, this has easily made to be one of the recommendations for anyone who wanted to watch slice of life and comedy for 2015.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it all up, it has been an amazing ride with the Umaru and her friends and of course onii-chan throughout the whole series. Also thank you Oota Masahiko for directing Himouto Umaru Chan, he did well on directing this and making it a fun series to watch, he is the director who directs Yuru Yuri S1 and S2, hopefully there would be a season 2 for this, because it was freaking funny and cute to watch. Eventhough it is long and may be completely nonsense but I hope this review is helpful as I went a lot of process of thinking and rewriting the review again for the past few days. Thanks! And have a nice Umaru day!~\\n",

            "content": "Most of the humour and appeal of Himouto! Umaru-chan comes from the protagonist being strikingly similar to its target audience; a lazy, entitled otaku teenager who always gets what they want. You're meant to identify with this cola-obsessed girl to the point of empathizing with her every move, and that obviously worked. Within days of the first episode airing, the show became a meme. It was (and at the time of writing, still is) hard to enter an anime discussion without catching a stray gif or picture showing Umaru in her chibi form, because people loved that they saw themselves or their behaviour in thiscute little character. A month later, the show's viewer base had unexpectedly doubled. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the first time this model has succeeded. In 2013, both Oregairu and WataMote garnished immense popularity by using a character the audience could relate to, through teen angst and depression respectively. And as much as I'd like to lump Himouto! Umaru-chan in with those two, it feels different. It's not some one-off attempt at being relatable, but a series that wants to tell a story through the eyes of its audience. And I completely hated it until I came to that strange realization. \\n\\n\r\nWhile beautiful and endearingly polite on the  outside, the titular Umaru turns to a horrible blob of laziness as soon as she arrives home. She lives with her older brother, Taihei, who thankfully brings no themes of incest to the table. As Taihei's a strict and punctual businessman, the two don't exactly get along. All that happens between the two from there on does nothing but highlight Umaru's much-needed flaws (bad behaviour ahoy), but also makes you feel pretty sorry for her older brother. His patiently putting up with her and loving her regardless is what ends up turning the theme on its head\u2014it's a critique of the consumer as much as it is a critique of Umaru, even though the characters are too one-note to allow it to work. With all of this trickery going on, the entire premise is much more suited to a drama than the mangaka may realize. Since a better option is available, it becomes pretty disappointing to see the conventional slice of life comedy route being taken every step of the way.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from the aforementioned two, the entire cast is fairly unremarkable. You've got your shy oppai twintail girl, the energetic rival, and the mysterious tsundere who has a crush on Umaru. Taihei also has two coworkers, who unknowingly happen to be related to two of Umaru's friends (sigh). Moreover, we don't get to know very much about these characters beyond their basic stereotypes. Everyone's certainly able to provide a few laughs along the way, though it always seems like a distraction from the real matter of familial tension. The team behind the anime seems to have a quota to fill for uninteresting or typical scenes, so you never get more than a five-minute glimpse at the better material. It's a sadistic game, and the way it's dragged out is extremely frustrating. In the last episode, about four of five prior misunderstandings or lies are perpetuated. Not only does this keep the plot from progressing, but the frustration is furthered when the final scene alludes to the lack of development in Umaru. As I've said before, joking about such a serious problem instead of combatting it is a dire mistake. \\n\\n\r\nComplaints about the literary portion aside, it's probably the best-looking show of the Summer 2015 season. Dogakobo is clearly proud to prove that you don't need detailed cuts or any exotic art direction to make something look great, only nice colours and consistently smooth animation. If one thing were to set the mismatched anime aside from its competition, this would be it. Have you not already seen it, I'd advise you to look up the OP for the show. Aside from the catchy nature of the song itself, it's a fantastic showcase of what I'm talking about. \\n\\n\r\nSo even though I wouldn't recommend the anime, you can't exactly go wrong with it. It's inconsistent in a lot of places and somewhat hard to actually wrap your head around, but you'll be sure to get a few giggles and a grand treat for the eye. Lest I forget, Sylphynford is a total cutie. If you end up having a little more fun with it than I did, you have my envy.",

            "content": "Do you want to watch something that will put a smile on your face regardless of what mood you are in? Specifically, an anime that has one particular character that has the charisma and charm to make an entire series into a glorious package of fun and cuteness all by herself? If you do, oh boy, do I have an anime for you.\r\nHimouto Umaru-chan is one experience that still perplexes me as I am writing this. Not just because of how much I loved it, but also how something like this could exist. It is essentially a gag comedy anime with the most generic formulayou could ever witness if you were reading this idea on paper. An otaku girl who, even though she is an all-star student to her peers on the outside, tries to keep her secret away from the people around her, even her close friends. Only her brother is aware of this since he lives with her and takes care of her despite her wacky and almost nerve-racking antics that drive him almost to the edge of insanity. When you read these two sentences, more often than not, you would most likely shrug off and browse off to the next anime on the anime list. But hear me out for a spare moment of your time.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll start with the most substantial positive to Himouto Umaru-chan: Umaru-chan. There is no denying her cuteness exists, there\u2019s not. But since I know cuteness is not a character structure that is very clear to many people, I will explain her merits with less vague terms than just being cute. What character merits she has, one, in particular, she manages to show off with high tenacity and spark is charisma. Thanks in no part to how she transitions from your stereotypical perfect girl to a wild chibi character who loves to play games, drink copious amounts of cola, and reading the latest manga issue. After all, who could not relate to a character that exhibits these quirks?\\n\\n\r\nThere are two aspects to this aspect that make it enjoyable: how seamlessly the art style shifts from normal to chibi character design and how the voice actress shifts her voice pitch from this transition. It gives Umaru-chan a great sense of character, not really from a development standard, but an engaging one at that. Her presence in the world demands your attention to her in many ways that could quickly become annoying by the 2nd or 4th episode when poorly done. But to the writer\u2019s credit, they know how to pace off the comedic chibi bits and add in new and exciting subtle ways to make the jokes involving her seem fresh and new with each episode. Even when she is outright selfish and acting like a crybaby, she still comes off as incredibly lovable thanks to the considerable charm that he inhibited from her over-the-top design and personality.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect to her that I enjoy immensely is her relationship with her brother, Taihei. You could say it is a relationship, albeit a bit exaggerated, that is both hilarious and somewhat realistic if you\u2019ve ever had an annoying little sister, or brother, who annoyed you. Despite her constant barraging of wants and needs to her big brother, they still form a close relationship of sibling love that is honestly touching in a few episodes where Taihei does good things for her out of the kindness of his heart, and vice versa with Umaru-chan. Her over-the-top personality doesn't overshadow him as he does carry himself as another funny character in what can be described as the best sibling duo in anime in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nHimouto Umaru-chan\u2019s brand of comedy is one other big positive that sets itself higher than most comedies that center around otaku life. For one, it does not overly state that the otaku lifestyle is inherently tremendous or bad at the same time. It mostly keeps the message subtle so that it does not distract us from the comedy bits too much. It has no well-defined message written into the narrative or characters since it knows what type of show it is and runs with it as a silly comedy. This is where the subject matter of being an otaku is seen better than most that try to because it can be enjoyed by everyone who has a particular view on this specific issue that can be against or for it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the comedy jokes themselves, most of them hit the mark quite well. A lot of it centers around satire of real-life issues that we all go through, whether it is how we go through the internet, social situations, and our need for material goods more than anything else. What\u2019s great about it is that you do not have to be a self-described otaku, or know the culture for the matter, to get the jokes. Such as not getting any internet connection for today and realize how life seems meaningless without it, and so on. The banter with Umaru-chan and her brother is always the biggest highlight in the show\u2019s comedy, as I\u2019ve mentioned before about the great relationship they have. And there are even some funny moments with the supporting cast; unfortunately, they are not on the same comedic level of our two siblings.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast, what little there is that garner a significant role in a specific arc, have their moments here and there. Umaru-chan\u2019s best friend, Ebina, is undoubtedly one note in how she is continuously shy whenever she is near people. Not to say that they are not funny by any stretch, it just does not raise the bar for one of the best shy girls in anime. Sylphinford is pretty hilarious as Umaru-chan\u2019s gaming rival. Kirie Motoba, however, is my least favorite of the cast. It mostly comes down to the fact that whenever she is with any other character, like Umaru-chan, her personality gets overshadowed by how bland it is.\\n\\n\r\nI want to give an honorable mention to the OP/ED, which I rarely ever do in reviews only if it is something special. To which Umaru-chan\u2019s is quite the special one that always sets the stage for what you are in for. Just from the first ten seconds of the OP always makes me bob my body up and down to the rhythm of the cute repetition of Umaru-chan shouting \u201cUmr hai\u201d over and over makes me giddy with excitement every time. Aimi Tanaka\u2019s performance proves she can be exciting not only with her voice over but also her singing, even if it isn\u2019t the best voice in the business.\\n\\n\r\nFinding a great otaku comedy is hard to come by. As many as there are, some are good or decent enough to think of it as a good time waster and some are wholly average or below that do not have any punch to their jokes. Himouto Umaru-chan has officially risen my optimism for more comedies of this nature like this one to come out more often. It succeeded in proving to me that this type of comedy is far from dead. I know some may groan at that notion, but if more studios take notes from Himouto Umaru-chan, I\u2019m all for it.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

            "content": "By day she is known as the famous perfect girl with princess like qualities: Umaru-sama, but by night she transforms into the fridge raiding, cola drinking, snack munching, and brother mongering girl known as: Umaru-chan. She is the epitome of cute and fun characters; she gives off the kind of aura that makes you want to forgive her for even her biggest grievances. She is adorable, she is malicious, she is conniving, and all the while still manages to be sweet. She is the kind of character who will make you froth at the mouth with anger, and then seconds later offer you her favoritething begging for forgiveness. She is heartwarming and reminded me instantly of my time watching Oreimo (How can my little sister be this cute), minus the incest obviously. We are introduced to a girl who when outside is: kind, loving, mature, serious, and someone that others look up to. However as soon as she gets home and puts on her orange hamster cloak she transforms into the annoying yet lovable pest that she truly is, a quality she is only willing to show around her brother. This show is hilarious and a blast, as it should be expected seeing as how it is a comedy.\\n\r\n----Spoiler Free----\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 7\\n\r\nThis show has a wonderful main character, however she is unfortunately the only character who seems to shine out of all the cast, this show reminds me a lot of Nyarko-san, in that the whole entire show is supported by a single really well fleshed out and lovable character. While the cast as a whole may have great chemistry, and complement each other perfectly (ie. Umaru and her brother) leading to tons of funny and enjoyable moments. It still must be noted that none of the other characters really get developed any further, and at the end of the show they are the exact same person as they were at the start. The same can be said for even the main character Umaru-chan, while she does face her mistakes head on, and seemingly learns from them. The episode will end and i the next episode she'll do something which basically mirrors what she was scolded for. This lack of growth is a given though, seeing as how all of the comedic elements stem from the duality in her character, and how she only reveals certain characteristics to certain people. That topped with the perversion of her originally perfect image lead to a rather jarring, and because of that funny story.\\n\r\nPlot: 7\\n\r\nPacing: 8\\n\r\nWhen you start up a slice of life/ comedy show, you don\u2019t go into it expecting much in terms of plot development, the reasoning behind that is similar to why there isn\u2019t any character development. The comedy aspect of these types of shows often relies on the state that the characters are currently in, in order to create a parody of reality, one that we as humans find to be funny. Going into more detail about that, this show has little to no real advancement in plot and stays in its comfort zone throughout the entire story. The show is divided up into a bunch of little skits, most of which take place in the comforts of their home, wherein Umaru, the main character, is made to reveal what we as an audience are seeking to see, a funny and abnormal character whom we seem to become fond of and attached to. \\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nOnce again there isn\u2019t much that can be said about the art. It didn\u2019t serve us up any new kind of controversial art style, nor did it really push its own boundaries. It, like this show, stayed in its comfort zone utilizing a more warm and bubbly feeling animation style. The art was all in all well directed and fitted the tone and mood of the show. As for the music, like the art style, it fit the show well with some nice and quirky music to accompany Umaru\u2019s escapades, and an above average intro song. The background music while not standing out did a nice job creating and maintain the atmosphere of the show.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nIn the end I find that the most important part of a show is whether it is enjoyable or not, and let me tell you, oh is this show enjoyable. I found myself smiling throughout a majority of the show and sympathizing with the characters who I had grown to adore. I considered giving a perfect score in terms of enjoyment however there were times where the comedy went over my head due to culture differences, or times where the sits just plain had nothing of interest to bring to the show. And so it is for those reasons that I award Himouto Umaru-chan with\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 80/100\\n\r\nThank you for reading. Definitely be sure to check out the show if you haven\u2019t seen it already, and I hope you have a nice day.\\n",

            "content": "OH MAN OH BOY\r\nStory-When weaboos watch this anime for the first time they usually think\"Well this is some generic waste of budget that is made for the kids with autism\"BUT(there is always some BUT).This anime perfectly embodies Freudian theory of Id and Ego.Main character, Umaru, is in constant struggle to balance her wild,lazy and otaku life style(this is her Id,the beast inside of her if you like) with her Ms. Perfect persona(her Ego-struggle for perfection).Here we see how public opinion affects human mind, his soul,his sanity. Umaru tries to hide her true self(otaku) because she fears how will her family,friends and peers react if theyfined out that she, Umaru,epitome for elegance,brilliance and perfection,is actually a stinky otaku who likes to play video games,read manga and sleep all day. Umaru is represents every anime fan,gamer,bookworm that hides his hobbies,his passion because of social stigma.We do this because we care to much what people think about as,we fear that we will be ridiculed because we love Chinese cartoons ENOUGH. Commrades , it is time to stop this oppression,it is time to grab our anime figurines , our husbando and waifu pillows it is time for REVOLUTION.\\n\\n\r\nArt-Very good art style.I like bright colors because it puts in exposition lighthearted tones in this anime.Animation is fluid,characters are consistent in their appearance(not like Namis boobs in One Piece anime).\\n\\n\r\nSound-Decent, nothing special in my opinion.It like soundtrack from forgotten Nintendo game-nobody really cares that much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-You have your standard archetypes like good brother,one weird friend,one shy friend,one crazy friend but I enjoyed them. Well written with some twists here and there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-It is anime with decent humor and solid story.Nothing extraordinary but is good anime for relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9/12 communist lolis\\n\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "This anime was recommended to me by one of my friends. I'm just gonna point this out now but this is pretty much your average comedy slice of life anime with cliches all over the place. If you're looking for a great story then this is not for you. Also if you dislike this '' annoying '' imouto type who forces her onii-chan to do everything you'll seriously hate this.\r\nStory 5/10 : \r\nAs i've stated before, this doesn't have a good storyline. It's pretty much how the main characters spend their days. What i do like is however that they try to hint alot ofrelation and expose the main things about the anime. They will try to make you hyped about when her secret will be revealed or trying to create some shipping. There's even hint of backstory. However this anime will not bother doing any of that since they have to keep the manga running forever, you know.  The loose and unconnected storyline might get you confused however remember that every episode is a singular episode with some connections here and there.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what seperates this anime from others. It's an extremely calming slice of life without any tension or drama. This is a perfect show to watch if you just wanna laugh and enjoy since it really doesn't want to create any tensional problem or any development in anything all. This is however great since every comedy anime has some type of conflict. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 :\\n\\n\r\nI can't comment much on this except that the character design is good however nothing special. However sadly it is below average in terms of animation compared to today (not overall) which does minus point it, however there's nothing large to notice so do not get put down by thinking it has bad art.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem people has with the art is that they dislike chibi and moe type of character designs which is what this anime excels at. Honestly there's not really much of loliness here and you shouldn't be annoyed unless you have a grudge against moe. I personally like moe designs and also like cute female characters which is literally the definition of Umaru so it's a big plus for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM is very relaxing and sets the mood most of the time. This is a very good point of the anime, but as said there's absolutely nothing memorable whatsoever in terms of OST. I've never said '' yes, the OST finally came up ''. I even forgot it even existed. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very good in this anime. I really think most of the characters fit their voice actors and they're also very skilled. I don't have any complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is probably very hated and very loved. I can't explain it so just try listening to it and you'll see what i mean. I personally like the opening, although there's nothing more to it. It's memorable due to the parodic tone the opening has. The ending song is not bad but i really couldn't care less about it. The OP/ED however sets me in a somewhat correct mood which is a plus.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10 :\\n\\n\r\nHonestly you have this set of typical characters which are likeable. I even did some shippings because they were likeable and the main girl (Umaru) really takes on an interesting social point. Although it might see very common but trying to hide your indoor life from your life with other people is something we're all mostly doing and can even cost you your real life relationships if you're too deep. I really like how Umaru is trying to hide her otaku life. This is actually i myself am doing at school with like 99% of the people there. I am not open with ANY non anime watcher at all. My school personality and real life are too different.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's the problem you ask? I did say that the characters are likeable. This by no means mean that they got depth. This also means they hardly got any character development. They remain the exact same as the start. Umaru is probably the one i expected to get developed the most however i was left disappointed. She is still this character who drags around her Onii-chan to do everything. You can somewhat see her opening up to the people around her however she is still kind of the exact same thing.\\n\\n\r\nObviously i know the point of this anime but it's still sad, you know :(.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThis does what it's meant to. It's really enjoyable and keeps you to watch it. I do not recommend you binge-watch it after the mid-point (the early point worked well when i binged watched it). It will eventually tire you out and you will give it a lower score than you intented to. The comedy is good but it somewhat repetitive with these overused scenes however i don't think this will stop you from enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really isn't anything special and is pretty much a very good relaxing anime with some annoying cliches. This doesn't have any conflict at all nor does it have much character development at all. It's really just a fun anime without any cliffhangers which you might enjoy unless you really dislike moe art. What sets this back is this tone of not wanting to continue any department.",

The jokes are mostly the \"oh look at me i'm so lazy and quirky and *relatable*\"-type and that just gets redundant. The episodes are very repetitive, and not much happens other than Umaru bossing her brother around and being an absolute pig. At least the art is tight, but a turd is still a turd no matter how much glitter you throw on it. \r\nI hate this show so much.

            "content": "There are a lot of people who, for some reason, fancy Hyundai. Back in my previous reviews, I did have an a-ok tone over Hyundai (or was I just trying to be nice), but as time went by, I was beginning to think the cringe it would be to own one. I would like to really sit and talk to someone who owns such and repeatedly ask them if they know what a car is, and if they know any other automakers from Japan, Germany, America, even Italy.\r\nIs it because Hyundai looks \u201cfluidic\u201d and \u201cbeautiful to look at\u201d? I wanna know because this kind ofimprudent query is the very kind of impulse I feel over asking an anime-fan or otaku on why they like Himouto! Umaru-chan.\\n\\n\r\nBecause why does Himouto! got a SEVEN+ score here in MAL? Is it because of her \u2018kawaiiness\u2019?\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m somehow okay with it, the same okay-ish I feel on Hyundai, which is a car brand I honestly never bother. The thing is, \u2018why bother\u2019? Just why are we bothering with Hyundai if there are Subarus, BMWs, Alfas and Fords around, and the price-ranged Toyotas, Nissans and Hondas; is the same way as why bother with Himouto! if there are KinMoza, Non Non Biyori, Yuru Yuri, and a lot more KyoAni\u2019s to add to the moeblob list?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe perhaps it\u2019s because of the very eponymous character, Umaru-chan herself. Otakus dig this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 4\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a slice-of-life, CGDCT thing this. However, the antics and comedies that Umaru herself does, with the characters such as her brother and friends Nana and Kirie are a bit of a daft, like an automatic transmission (presumably from Hyundai) that does make the engine roar, but couldn\u2019t give the power needed, or due to the fact that it lags most of the time the gear is shifted. As projected of CGDCT, plot and storyline are easy and relaxing. Himouto did seem to deliver these along with Hayate-ish parodies, but the charm of the story really doesn\u2019t pick up, unlike KinMoza for example.\\n\\n\r\nLet me put it this way for comparison: KinMoza and Himouto does have one particular thing shared: they both are otaku-societal tropes about what anime fans are and can be. The former focuses on \u2018genkis\u2019 and \u2018engrish\u2019 and \u2018japanophiles\u2019 and \u2018british-philes\u2019; while the latter focuses on \u2018otaku-ness\u2019 and \u2018gamers\u2019. Putting a seeming \u2018genki kawaii shoujo\u2019 in the guise of Umaru giving the otaku-slash-gamer-slash-lazy-kawaii persona should have worked, as WataMote\u2019s Mokocchi surely did. But somehow, it didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThough to give it a benefit-of-doubt, Himouto might work on the surface, when you\u2019re too consumed about Umaru\u2019s \u2018kawaiiness\u2019 that you can\u2019t think more for yourself, or you\u2019re simply not discerning about plot and characterization, you ended up rating this beyond 7 really.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 1\\n\\n\r\nSo Himouto should have worked its charm but didn\u2019t. What I can devise though, is the characterization of Umaru-chan herself. Let me quote from the show itself: \\n\\n\r\n\u201cMy younger sister, Umaru, is pretty and popular. She's kind, smart, and gifted with many talents. She's the perfect high school student, without any flaws.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSee what I mean? Umaru is a goddamned MARY-SUE. This is the very type of character that I\u2019d like to put an Excalibur-face on, every literature-oriented person loathes and grimaces, the epitome of a traditional mary-sue where every author (who does learn literature and proper creative writing, and not just a housewife) is taught to avoid making. Mary-sues, especially the traditionally pretty, popular, gifted, perfect, no flaws, this is not just a Mary-sue, it\u2019s Bella Swan in kawaii and kirei desu, just without the uber-romance. (KEYWORD: traditional Mary-sue)\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s entitled opinion. But if you have decency of not wasting your own time watching a one-dimensional, flat, unmoving, static character in the eponymous role who assumes a \u2018perfect\u2019 image, does throw fits and tantrums while maintaining \u2018perfection\u2019, then let me tell you that Japan releases about twenty anime titles per quarter of the year. Go to www.livechart.me and count \u2018em all: that\u2019s about eighty and I mean 80/EIGHTY anime titles on average per year. Why can\u2019t you go with the other titles instead?\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 5\\n\\n\r\nSound is moe-good. I know I\u2019ve noted the seiyuus but right now, I really don\u2019t want to bother. Oh, in Umaru\u2019s UMR-mode, her seiyuu really does sound like Kanae Itou. Maybe I\u2019d give this a 6. While in her little-shit mode, she does have a little bit of Aki Toyosaki sounding, so that\u2019s a 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 3\\n\\n\r\nI \u201cmight\u201d have enjoyed it like enjoying driving a Hyundai, you know, when it is the only car you\u2019ve got and you don\u2019t want a bicycle, or if zombies are on your tail. The thing is though, Himouto isn\u2019t the only anime on my list: there was Kekkai-Sensen that needed to be finished, Sore ga Seiyuu that was faithfully made for a seiyuu-fan like me, Fate Illya season 3 which I know will still be lolitastic, Etotama, Shirobako, Charlotte (which is effing horrible but that\u2019s on a different review), IdolMaster Cinderella, and most especially Non Non Biyori Repeat. Bothering with Himouto is like bothering to spend time checking a Hyundai when you\u2019ve got enough cash to get a Toyota or even a Subaru.\\n\r\nHence, the score of 3 you\u2019re seeing here is mostly directed to Kirie, who rather resembles Mokocchi.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 5\\n\\n\r\nI personally don\u2019t like Himouto. Parodies can't save this one for me because there's Hayate, Danna ga Nani, Lucky Star, even Gintama. If you\u2019re asking why still I watched it from episode 1 to end is only because of MAL-listing, so that I can put this title on my anime list and move on. Another reason is because I do hate it when some otakus ask me in cases when I haven\u2019t fully watched it, then why am I criticizing the show. Thus, I\u2019ve watched it, not because I like it, but only to fill the 560+ list of anime I already have and to prevent Himouto-fans from shitdorsing their Mary-sue.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this is a review written by someone who has 560-something anime on his list, a seasoned-fan of moeblobs, and I would like to stress that I\u2019ve seen a lot of CGDCTs from K-On to Yuyushiki, YuruYuri, AcchiKocchi, and I do love seiyuus, but Himouto never compels the iconic cute things of these aforementioned titles. My take is that when it comes to CGDCTs and/or slice-of-life, it\u2019s always about the characterization over the plot. CGDCT lovers probably wouldn\u2019t give a damn about where the plot goes and comes around, but more of how the shoujo and her seiyuu would do cute things and moe antics, easy on the mind, relaxing on the heart. \\n\\n\r\nPutting a mary-sue on this formula and this turn of one-dimensional thoughtlessness is just a complete waste of time.\\n\r\nThough it doesn\u2019t seem so to Himouto-fans, or those who don\u2019t bother watching Boku wa Tomodachi and Accel World and won\u2019t do character-analysis, and thus are just so happy watching Umaru\u2019s superficial kawaiiness. For these \u201cHimouto fans\u201d, that\u2019s all fine and prudent in your point-of-view\u2014stick to your Mary-sue, as hand in heart I respect that, just as the same gauge of respect towards Hyundai-lovers. Or wait\u2014I think I do have the answer to my Hyundai-question: maybe these Hyundai-lover people really don\u2019t mind on what a car is, or as long as Hyundai does look good on the exterior design. Guess that principle applies for Himouto fans also.\\n\r\nAgain, why I scored this 5 overall has a lot to do with Mokocchi-look-alike Kirie, and Umaru\u2019s seiyuu. Screw the plot, chaps\u2014I\u2019m all for Kirie and Umaru\u2019s seiyuu, parody-less or not.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: For me there\u2019s none really; but MAL rated this as SEVEN+, and MAL users can\u2019t perhaps ever be wrong (no BellaSwan fan was wrong, too, right?).",

            "content": "Laziness.  The pinnacle of human bliss.  Doing absolutely nothing is something of a rarity these days as we all run around like headless chickens doing god knows what in order to properly execute whatever we have to do in our lives.  So, what if we followed the life of one someone who is blessed with such a simple life?  Here's Himouto!  Umaru-chan!\r\nStory: Umaru Doma is the pinnacle of high school perfection.  She's friendly, she is the best in both academics and sports, and she very beautiful and all around the most popular girl in school.  But underneath thatfacade, when she arrives home, she transforms, donning her signature hamster hood and turning herself into her true form, the himouto, (A Hikkiomori Imouto, basically) where her perfect appearance is melted away to reveal the selfish and cola loving beast that's inside...  And, that's pretty much the whole story.  \\n\\n\r\nAdapted from a manga whose average chapter page length is only 11 pages, Himuto plays as a slice of life show that reflects off of a bunch of minisodes grouped together to form one complete episode.  By mostly taking chapters that relate to one another with a common theme and stringing them together, Himouto's storyline is mostly linear story with some progression to move the story along, mostly in the form of the way characters interact to each other and in some cases, how they act.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for any central themes, Himouto occasionally goes into a slightly more serious note by relating to the sibling relationships within the series.  It's a nice touch because it doesn't actually bring much away from the story and actually, kind of adds a nice bit of depth to the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nBut for the most part, the show focuses primarily on Umaru and her selfish Himouto lifestyle.  The comedy of the show is drawn from the various antics that she gets into or executes in order to get whatever she wants, as well her tripolar behavior that makes her a bit of a more complicated character than you would think, sort of.  Umaru herself shows a lot of selfishness and laziness as a character, so, if you don't like people like that, then I would not suggest watching this show.  (Also, don't question the whole chibi shrinking thing she does when she devolves into Himouto form.  Apparently, it's a physical change, and I have no idea how she does it.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique base story\\n\r\n+ Little bit of character depth\\n\r\n+/- Comedy comes from the title character and her antics  (good or bad depending how you perceive that kind of personality)\\n\r\n-  Show is mostly unchanging and static with the way it presents its content\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Since this show mostly reflects off of the older brother/little sister relationship, every character but one in this series belongs in one of these camps.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have the title character of the series, Doma Umaru.  As the mascot and main plot point of the series, Umaru as a character is a very odd creature.  As I mentioned before, she is \"tripolar\", as she has more than one \"form\" that she lives her life in.  As a result, Umaru is quite the piece of work.  Her first form is her \"outside\" form where she is the calm, collected, beautifully perfect self that she is.  This is the form that Umaru wants to be seen as outside of her house, hence the reason why she adopts this as the way she wants to reveal herself to the world.  And then we have her true form, \"Himouto\", where she dons a hamster hood and devolves into the size of a chibi for maximum laziness.  As the main form showcased in the series in general, Himouto is Umaru's true nature, which is a selfish, spoiled little hamster with a pension for whining for whatever she wants, lazing around at home by playing games or watching anime, and drinking cola; LOTS and LOTS of cola.  And finally, we have \"UMR\", her gaming persona.  UMR is the least used form in Umaru's arsenal.  Mostly used for gaming or arcade related purposes, UMR really only serves to help Umaru deal with one of the other imoutos in the series, a point I will get back to on later.  As a character, she doesn't particularly develop as a person.  She occasionally has lapses of realization and pops out a sweet little moment for a second, but the show eventually just returns back to its status quo with Umaru being selfish again, recreating the never ending cycle of pain for her brother and for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about her brother, let's talk about him.  Doma Taihei, the Onii-chan of Umaru.  As a hardworking sales rep, Taihei is a man who is very devoted in his time and energy in trying to support both he and his sister since the two of them live in the same apartment.  Very frustrated by the way his sister acts with her constant whining and complete disregard for his own feelings, Taihei serves as the straight man for the series, while also being a bit weak because he succumbs to Umaru's cries rather easily.  While the series mostly focuses on Umaru, Himouto also puts a good bit of focus into Taihei and the relationship between the two siblings which is nice, but unfortunately doesn't last long because of the status quo of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nFor side characters, we have three other pairs that correspond to the \"older brother/little sister\" relationship which are Kirie, Sylphin, and Ebina who each have an older brother that also appears in the series.  (Though, Ebina's isn't revealed in the anime.) As characters, each of the other characters in the series serve as characters to fill in the blanks.  They're not neccesarily deep, they don't have many actual character traits to them, there's almost no character development for them, and they are all fairly trope-like.  But, all three of the other girls in the series progressively get to know Umaru through one of her three forms.  (Ebina with \"Outside\" Umaru, Kirie with \"Himouto\" Umaru, and Sylphin with \"UMR\" Umaru.  So, this is where the tripolarness sort of comes in handy.  Sort of.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Interesting main character (Umaru is known to be liked and hated as a character)\\n\r\n-  Characters are mostly one trick ponies\\n\r\n-  Little to no character development\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for Umaru is a moe-like style with bright colors that reflect off of the lighthearted feeling that the show gives off.  There really isn't much to say about it since the art is pretty standard.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for comedy, Himouto takes a lot of the common comedic tropes for anime, utilizing dramatized backgrounds, different facial expressions for characters, and lots and lots of Umaru.  They also have quite a bit of references in this series, so if you like references, this show has quite a few.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ References in the artwork\\n\r\n+ Decent but standard quality art\\n\\n\r\nSound: Now for the sound.  Himouto's tracks are quite few in number, as the show has it's OP and it ED, as well as the two other songs in the series that serve as the background songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is a very addictive song, as it encapsulates the complete madness that is Umaru's Himouto form and as such is, while not a masterpiece, a very catchy song, which makes it memorable, I guess.  The ED on the other hand is a little song that is sung by the seiyuus of the four girls.  Even with that though, it's not a song I find to be particularly memorable as it's pretty generic and doesn't have anything to it that'll latch its tune into your mind.\\n\\n\r\nFor the two or so background tracks that are in the series, there's not really much to say about them.  Using a calm and airy tone for the songs, they bring about the kind of emotion that's supposed to be conveyed during the scene.  There's nothing really memorable about them aside from adding a bit more to what Umaru is doing in that point in time.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Catchy OP\\n\r\n-  Rest of the soundtrack was average at best\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  So, all in all, did I enjoy this adaptation?  Well, I can safely say that I did.  Himouto as a series is one that really just focuses on the fun that it wants to convey, not really taking itself seriously and really just lets Umaru do whatever she wants.  They actually did rather well with translating the tiny 11 page chapters into a full-length episode, which I at first was unsure how they were going to do it.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  Umaru as a series is one of my more favorable casual reads, and seeing some of my favorite scenes come to life is always a grand little treat.  It was just as wacky as the original series, they didn't cut any corners, and it was overall, still very enjoyable.  Plus, it's a series that actually has some progression, so it's also pretty quaint in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI was a bit sad that they didn't actually show Ebina's brother, since that would've completed the entire set of \"Onii-chan/Imouto\" characters in this show.  Of course, that would've caused more complications because there's some buildup to that, but still.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend watching this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes, actually.  Honestly, I'd say just give this series a shot.  It's a fun little series that doesn't take itself too seriously, and while everyone is one-sided, makes for quite a charming little cast.  Of course, if you're not a big fan of moe-style art, people who are completely selfish, or watching a girl down a gallon of cola in a matter of seconds, then you may reconsider the decision.",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT EVEN THOUGH THIS SERIES HAS NO PLOT\r\nThis is bar none, the worst anime I have ever seen. That's right. \"Mars of Destruction,\" \"Eiken,\" and \"Pupa,\" can safely be considered masterpieces compared to this cancerous monstrosity of an anime. Allow me to elaborate upon my position... \r\nI love slice of life anime, and have always been a big fan of series' that deal with everyday people doing everyday things. The simplicity of a slice of life concept allows for us as viewers to relate to any given character, and really get to know them, since the entirety of a series hinges on them andtheir life, without any specific overarching plot. Essentially, I love the character studies that are done in slice of life anime. We have the opportunity as viewers to participate in, and get to know a given character, or characters, who live lives much like ours, and can relate to us on various levels. \\n\\n\r\n\"Himouto! Umaru-chan,\" falls into this descriptor I have laid out, and we do get to know our characters pretty well in their mundane, everyday lives. Umaru, the main character in this series, is a model student, gorgeous, and well loved by her classmates. By all conventional metrics, she is the epitome of a successful adolescent. She is responsible, diligent, respectful and sophisticated. Or so we think... Umaru has a well kept secret. When classes are over, and she returns home for the evening, she is a complete WEEB. She is an avid gamer, anime watcher, and junk food eater. As anime fans ourselves, this may seem like the dream sometimes, right? Umaru can definitely be relatable to us in terms of the interests she holds, and the enjoyment she derives from said interests.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where my beef begins, and pretty much ends too. This is the entirety of the show. Umaru faking her school life, going home, and doing weeb stuff. That's it. As I mentioned previously in slice of life anime, I look to partake in a character study. I look to see the growth in a character as a series progresses. I look to the characters, because they define the story. If there is no character development, there is no story. This is where \"Himouto Umaru-chan,\" falls apart. As a character, Umaru is not only one dimensional, she is also incredibly annoying! Immature, bratty, spoiled and entitled, she embodies everything that is wrong with anime culture. There are frustrating and annoying characters in many series' that I enjoy; however, these characters are often clearly defined, undergo changes, and move in a certain direction, for better or worse. They may be stagnant in their annoyance, but we can see many sides of them as a series progresses. This is not the case with Umaru. We are treated to the exact same character in every single episode. And being a show defined by the actions of its characters, we are by extension treated to the exact same episode, over and over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nI held on to hope in this series for so long. I waited earnestly for some type of character development or turning point. But alas, I waited in vain. There are moments where Umaru seems genuinely sympathetic, caring and vulnerable, especially when interacting with her older brother and guardian. These moments are her most interesting, as they show a side of her that seems more real, and deep. I don't mind that she does her weeb stuff, but I've wanted to further get to know Umaru the person. We get to know Umaru's interests, Umaru's tantrums, Umaru's favorite snacks, but we never really know for sure just who Umaru is. \\n\\n\r\nThis being said, I hate this anime. I can't stand Umaru, I can't stand her older brother that spoils her. I feel bad for Umaru's friend Ebina, and I can't stand Umaru's creepy video gamer friend. There is absolutely nothing to like here. Even the theme song is super annoying. Yep, this series just gets on my nerves. I don't recommend it to anyone. \\n\\n\r\nFinal score-1\\n\\n",

Outdoors, Umaru seems like the perfect high school girl with beauty, intelligence, athleticism, and talent. But once indoors in her brother's apartment, she lazes around, playing video games, and constantly nagging her brother to buy her what she desires. As the series continues, you see the adventures Umaru goes on as her different personalities help her make different classmate friends.\r\nArt: Decent artwork, cute character design, and lots of pop culture references/parodies.\r\nSound: Nice and catchy OP\r\nCharacter: Every character has a wonderful unique personality. \r\nUmaru is overachieving on the outside but a lazybrat in private. She has different personas like UMR (gaming mode) and Komaru (her imposing as Umaru's litte sister)\\n\r\nTaihei is a hardworking salaryman who cares about his sister, Umaru, and loves too cook. \\n\r\nEbina-Chan is Umaru's classmate and friend who is from Akita.

Funny comedy for those who love slice of life. Himouto!

I would. First off, let me explain that I have no problems with you liking this show, I guess I can see why someone would like it, and I also urge you to form your own opinions on it by going and watching it yourself. That being said, let me tell you why I hate this show with a passion.One person, Umaru. God, I hate her with all my heart, I was hoping that she would get some sort of comeuppance, but no. Umaru is a mary sue and everything goes her way, she never changes or develops really, and she always gets what she wants. I am not saying that she has to lose it all and become extremely depressed in order to make me enjoy it, but at least SOMETHING. I only continued watching this series  out of respect for a friend, since I promised him I would watch it all. After the frst episode, I should of stopped. Other than Umaru's dreadful character, I guess I would give it a 4/10, the story isn't amazing and not to mention when not infuriating, it was boring. However, I know that many do like, so I can probably assume that I am the outlier here, so I would personally recommend that you don't spend precious time watching this, however, you should always give the first episode a try, just in case you do like it.\\n",

            "content": "I don't even remember why I started watching this anime.\r\nIt's not my usual genre. In fact, thinking hard on it now, I think I picked it up because I heard /a/ was torn between loving and hating Umaru for being The Perfect Girl Who Is Secretly An Otaku, and that was all the reason I needed in the end. \r\nSo I tried episode one. And I am immediately hit with the surprisingly catchy and fun theme song; I am a particular fan of the Hamsters + Umaru stampede scenes, which warm my black heart considerably, and the elegant bridge in the middle is a verynice touch for what is to come. \\n\\n\r\nFrom that moment forward, I watched Umaru transform to the radiant, unattainable, and awe-inspiring high schooler to hideous moeblob of spite, manipulation, selfishness, and laziness, and then back again. And I should have hated her, for all intents and purposes. Umaru is a garbage princess borne from a trash dumpster. Umaru is unquestionably a horrible little girl who has no qualms with using others for her own material gains -- especially poor Taihei onii-chan -- but instead, I found myself (horrifyingly) loving her for how much I identified with her. While I am arguably not nearly as evil as she is and I do not steal my loved one's credit cards, I was startled by how overjoyed I was to get a heroine who maintained a flawless outer persona in personality and character, but tossed on her comfy clothes and immersed herself in snack food and weeb garbage when she got home without a care in the world. \\n\\n\r\nImportantly, though, is that despite Umaru's myriad of shortcomings, there is the very real existence of her guilt when she overdoes it or something goes terribly wrong, and while the hoops she made her brother jump through frequently bordered on cruel, it was always apparent by the end that they honestly loved each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt is that last point is what actually makes this series work for me. Personally, I cannot stand the trash characters who are heinous to everyone without any redeeming morals or scenes. Umaru avoids this narrowly with moments of empathy and mutually heartfelt love. Plus, it doesn't hurt that Taihei gets a little revenge every now and then. The lapses in comedy are punctuated by these more real and honest moments, highlighting her more wordly thoughts and feelings, as well as focusing on the family aspect of the show. When Umaru isn't raising hell, we find her worrying about her brother and him worrying about her. We see Taihei go out of the way to buy her favourite food even after a long and tiresome day at work, and him becoming completely lost when she's not bothering him. We see Umaru, in her bedtime walk through town, basking in the quiet solace of the night, reveling in her private moment. Even the side characters are afforded this luxury, as the series has a running theme of brother and sister relationships -- the scene of Tachibana's brother grabbing her after her freak out in the middle of a tournament is strange and out of nowhere, it seems, but when it sinks in you can't help be left with warmth.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on the other hand, my greatest qualm with the series is that I am always disappointed and pretty disgusted to see young girls tossed into sexualizing scenes that are meant to make it more marketable. Umaru is not exempt from this highly unfortunate trope. While I am relieved that these scenes are kept to a minimum, especially compared to other shows, they are not non-existent, they make me uncomfortable, and they truly add nothing of any real and meaningful substance to the narrative or characters involved. Additionally, the other reasons for giving this an 8/10 are just that while Himouto! Umaru-chan is really funny, it's not above and beyond funny; and while it does have its underlying moments of depth that step away from the pure comedy, they're not quite profound enough to really hit home.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Himouto! Umaru-chan is something I truly enjoyed keeping up with, and something I cried at when it was over. She will forever hold a special place in my heart as my favorite brand of little hellion. Because she is a hellion.\\n\\n\r\nUmaru is a hellion, and I love her for it.",

However, it is surprisingly enjoyable: although watching shows can easily be a bore for me, I watched all episodes in something that was almost a rush.\r\nStory (6):\r\nThe story is simply a cute girl who excels at school, sports, beauty, literally everything, but is a slacker when home: she spends her entire day playing games, reading manga and drinking cola. Annnnd, for most part, that's all. Yes. Really, that's all.\r\nArt(9):\r\nThe art was pretty good, and kind of helped inthe comical effect. Alongside with pretty much everything in this show, it was simple as well, but smooth.  I liked it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7):\\n\r\nFar from outstanding, but good and well used.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(6):\\n\r\nOther than Umaru, there was almost zero character development for all characters. They felt like some stereotypes in anime and manga, however, they managed to be almost likeable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10):\\n\r\nI laughed a lot with this anime! I really can't deny it's flaws, but I cant as well deny how fun it was for me. It, somehow, made me remember of myself when I was younger: and this sort of time travel was relaxing and very, very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(8):\\n\r\nLike I said, Himouto! Umaru-chan has its flaws and etcetera, but its definitely worth a watch.  It is, certainly, a good watch for the bored ones and it will be very relaxing to the stressed ones.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER. jk there ain't shit to spoil.\r\nHimouto! Umaru-chan is a series about Umaru, a Mary Sue, the high school girl you dream of having as your gf, or waifu for that matters (not happening brah, srsly?), or so that\u2019s what everyone thinks of her. When she gets home, the perfect schoolgirl fa\u00e7ade is dropped, revealing her lazy, irresponsible side, which I find cute, relatable and annoying at the same time.\r\nThe series doesn\u2019t have an overarching plot, instead it follows these episodic formulas: \r\n- Umaru gets back from school, enters lazy mode, brother goes back from work, gives her a scolding but endsup being her slave as always.\\n\r\n- Umaru hangs out or have friends over, and either she keeps up her usual outer shell OR she pretends to be her own sister while retaining her lazy attitude. Meanwhile, the brother ends up being a slave, again as always.\\n\r\n- Umaru hangs out at the arcade using the alias UMR, beat the crap out of every games and fools around with that annoying girl. The brother doesn\u2019t even get screentime in this situation which is worse than being a slave. Poor dude.\\n\r\nThus, the series can be hard to follow as a whole, characters end up not getting any development and it gets very stagnant after a while. It relies on comedy which is repetitive and isn\u2019t that good tbh, but occasionally it did give me a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: relatively one-dimensional, little to no development and background information.\\n\\n\r\nUmaru: She\u2019s actually 95 but she used that secret anti-aging technique which angered doctors worldwide, she\u2019s so smart she\u2019s beaten the US and Soviet Union in the space race, she\u2019s so loved and admired by everyone that she has yet to receive a love-letter or a confession (what the fuck?), she\u2019s so sparkly that not even Edward Cullen from Twilight can out-sparkle her, she\u2019s so godly at gaming she made South Korean Challenger players look like North America and Europe West Bronze players, \u2026 Blah blah blah. She\u2019s perfection incarnate, except that she\u2019s annoying as fuck.\\n\\n\r\nShe whines about unreasonable shits a lot, and everytime she does I have the urge to bitch-slap her so hard that her nationality changes from Japan to Yugoslavia. Now she does show her gratitude and humility once in a while but it\u2019s so trivial, no one cares. She doesn\u2019t received any real development or background despite being the main character, and derps around for the entirety of the series. Talk about the life everyone wants.\\n\\n\r\nTaihei (slave brother): I simply admire this guy\u2019s tolerance. He\u2019s there to be the normal guy in the midst of all these weirdos, but in the end he\u2019s just gonna end up being a slave to the corporate world and his sister. If I were him I would\u2019ve thrown her bitch ass out before episode 1 even airs.\\n\\n\r\nEbina: Personally, I think she\u2019s the most interesting character in the show as her origin and personalities are very fascinating, but instead she\u2019s shoved aside to be a recurring gag character. I would\u2019ve loved to see how she\u2019s coping with city life, how she met and became Umaru\u2019s bestie or how her crush on the slave would turn out, etc. But instead I get a frying pan (her blushing face seems hot enough to burn the sun to crisps), two huge milky coconuts (I love coconuts don\u2019t get me wrong), and some Morse Code gibberish coming out of her head. She\u2019s desperately in need of more screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest: Just there for more gags, they\u2019re of no importance whatsoever and often came off as annoying to me. Any potential characterization to these characters are thrown out the window.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fairly colorful and beautiful for today's standards, but nothing groundbreaking. Sometimes it gets sloppy but that's tolerable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Again, pleasant enough for the ears but nothing really standing out either, I skipped both OP and ED every ep.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I feel like Umaru\u2019s going through the stage of trying to keep up with society\u2019s expectations and being herself at the same time. I went through this stage for a relatively short time then learned to not give a flying fuck about what people want me to do/be/do/be/do (I\u2019m sorry that was a bad Scooby-doo pun). I do empathize with her in this sense, but it doesn't change the fact that she's more annoying than poorly synchronized subtitles.\\n\\n\r\nThere should be a s2 about Umaru coming out of her shell and people accept her for who she is, or her becoming more responsible. AND A SCENE WHERE THE BROTHER BITCH-SLAPS HER SO HARD HER NATIONALITY CHANGES FROM JAPAN TO YUGOSLAVIA.\\n\\n\r\nEbina definitely needs moar characterization and development. I practically dragged my ass through the series for this (but now I\u2019m sad). How come the smoke detector never ever goes off? Japanese technology get your shit together\\n\\n\r\nI kinda enjoyed the series despite the repetition and apparent flaws it has, it helped me ease up on stress because of college laifu. If you like to just sit back and relax, watching cute girls to cute things, or lazy things, pardon me, this will suit you, otherwise you won\u2019t find complexity or inspirations in this series.",

            "content": "This review is of both series because I dislike when anime feel the need to make a seperate series rather than just making a second season of the same anime. Also I feel like the distinction is somewhat arbitrary since my review would basically be the same for either this series or Himouto! Umaru-chan R.\r\nOverall - 5:\r\nHimouto! Umaru-chan is an alright anime, but it certainly isn't anything special. The only defining feature of the anime would probably be the somewhat iconic hoodie that umaru wears. In all honesty there isn't much that is very good about this anime, but at the same time it's notbad either.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4:\\n\r\nSome of the mini plots are interesting, and some of the situations are humorous, but the overall story is very much lacking. I realize that they don't intend for there to be a huge overarching story, but the things they chose to make important are for the most part unnecessary. Umaru assumes different forms to different people, but the fact is her friends like her no matter what form she is in, and there aren't a whole lot of jokes around them not knowing she is all the same person. It seems like it's deception for deception's sake and I really wish they did away with it.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7:\\n\r\nNo complaints, the show looks good, and the way they draw chibi umaru can lead to some rather hilarious looking scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is boring, but The tracks fit well into the show. This is why it isn't rated too low, but there's nothing too good about the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6:\\n\r\nThe characters are the focus of the show, and a lot of them are pretty good, but even some of the most important characters fell flat the majority of the time. One of the more frustrating things is trying to keep track of all the different character relations, made even worse by the separate umaru forms I mentioned before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6:\\n\r\nThis show holds my attention alright, and there are moments or scenes that are memorable, but for the most part it feels like it's a lot of the same thing.",

Umaru reminds me of the friend and above, so endears me with her despite being a sometimes bloody, his brother Taihei hasa somewhat heavy character and contrasts well with Umaru and I love Ebina - chan, you too will love her, others characters are equally good but do not have much relevance.\\n\r\nThe drawing style is good but has its errors, many frozen pictures (scenes without animation) and many of the characters just seem to change eye color hair and breasts, a good way to save budget.\\n\r\nThe opening, my god the opening, the first time I heard, I thought, what the hell ?, but after I finished loving, the ending is good and just that.\\n\r\nThis anime left me a very good taste, SPOILER: there are things of which I would like to know more as Who are the parents of Umaru and Taihei?

            "content": "This is the worst show I have ever watched (also the worst manga I have ever read): it's shallow, annoying, repetitive and contains nothing good from either characters or plot. I will explain my statement in next paragraphs.\r\nThe show is about an excellent and popular schoolgirl who behaves completely different when she returns home. She turns into a spoiled brat who does nothing but playing games, reading manga or watching anime. Her brother lives with her, despite being older and more responsible, he lets her do whatever she wants and fulfills her demands. \r\n I don't feel there is any story in the show, allepisodes follow this pattern: Umaru wants something (a game, magazine, etc) and annoys her brother to buy it for her, her brother refuses and she starts a mess, brother gives up after a while and says \"it cannot be helped\", so he buys her what she desires and that's the end. The show is centered on Umaru, all the characters and events develop around her and go in her favour, there is no feel of progress or story moving on, just Umaru using others to get what she wants and things go where they were at start of the episode. \\n\r\nArt and sound are the only elements which weren't horrible, but they aren't much good either. Art is basic and nothing special, also sounds and music aren't memorable but not bad.\\n\r\nThe show lacks in character customization terribly. The protagonist is displayed as cute, while having nothing but bad traits: arrogance, manipulation, disrespect, childish behaviour, sloth, etc. Other characters are far more likable than her, some of them have quirky characteristics or seem nice people, but in the end no matter what they stand for, they just adapt to protagonist's desires like it doesn't contradict their morals. No matter how many times it seems there may be some progress when characters socialize, in the end Umaru jumps in and ruins the atmosphere, she is the main reason why this show is terrible. Question is why would anyone make a character like that and set it as a protagonist, also put in a show with no story at all...\\n\r\nThe only enjoyment I had was when some characters faced each other and there were few funny moments, until Umaru came and turned everything about herself. What is the purpose of the show? The protagonist was nothing but a nuisance which removed every element of comedy. The show would have a point if Umaru changed in the end, to realize her behaviour, but no, her brother and other characters let her use them to get what she wants. It is annoying to see someone making a fuss over a toy, especially when the other person is trying to get some sleep or returned after stressful day at work. It wasn't funny at all, I felt bad for her brother having to deal with her... I hoped he would teach her lessons how to become a responsible person, but no, he is a weak character who talks about responsibilities but lets her get away with anything she does to him.",

            "content": "I like to think i'm open minded when I watch shows. And Slice of life for me is a hit or miss. So when I see shows such as this advertised I thought: \"neat\"! Like Gudetama or Domo little mascots will always catch my attention. So I thought id give this a chance. Me and my sis watched all of this in one day and then turned to each other and started listing the different better ways we could have spent six hours. And it was definitely not watching this.\r\nThe story is about Umaru-chan whose public life is her being a mary-sue. She literally isthe embodiment of perfection. Good grades, she's pretty, everyone loves her. But when she goes home she literally transforms into a gluttonous lazy brat. Who plays video games, eats junk food, and mooches off her guardian. And the rest is just her doing her thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, let's just say I don't care for the opening theme. It's really annoying, like the first ten seconds made me want to turn the show off and listen to a choir of tone deff smokers. Its so annoying its so shrill, I was begging crunchy roll to suddenly add a skip intro feature but to no avail. Each time it came on just listening to the first five seconds while trying to grab the remote and fast forward put me in a bad mood. And the credit theme I had no words I just skipped to the next episode so I didn't have to listen to it. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have the animation which is typical. And doesn't really add anything. It looks and feels like any other slice of life. Even when Umaru is in her chibi form it looks bland. Her movements aren't fun, not stylized. Its basically a giant blob rolling around screaming. So it's less then average.\\n\\n\r\nThen we get to what's really terrible about this show. None of the characters offer anything. Her \"friends\" are basically moe teenage girl versions of the three stooges. Which actually sounds funny but they aren't. They just seem like one note body pillow cases and I'm sure that's what they were made for. Umaru's brothers no better he's just your basic pushover that really needs a backbone but never gets one. Your suppose to feel bad for him...I guess. But he just sits there letting her get her way. I kept hoping he's going to crack and straight up tell her no and enforce it.....but he doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally the worst part is our protagonist Umaru herself. God I wanted to smack her every second she was on screen. The embodiment of selfishness with no negative repercussions. She sits around all day playing video games and stuffing her face. And forcing her brother to basically bow to her every will. While keeping an amazing social status of no one finding out about her true self. She forces her brother to spend his hard earned money on crap for her that she ignores after a week. He even buys a car! A @#%$#%& CAR! And he just treats her like oh sister if your happy so am I. Her voice is basically that of a smug toddler. She plays games constantly yet doesn't know what a router is? There's literraly no negative repercussions for her actions. At least none that affect her directly. She's an all around unpleasant character.\\n\\n\r\nNow the thing is, you can write a charecter like this, but you need to do at least one of two things. 1. They need to be likable. Give them a fun personallity. Make them appeal to the audience, not ignore them. 2. Make them suffer. If they dont suffer for their mistakes they dont appear human, and thus arent likable. If she'd too much of a mary sue, yet has no humanity...,she'd boring and in return unlikable.\\n\\n\r\nSo its really not my cup of tea. So if you ask me give this one a pass.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a very valuable anime for me, made me smile every episode, and it was also more than just a comedy.\r\nThe Intro is awesome. I am holding myself to not get up and dance while watching the intro.\r\nFirst, I don't only like it because it's a \"slice of life\" anime. I usually don't watch an anime because of the topic or type. I watch them because of the characters and their personalities. (if I like them or match with the people I know). \r\nAnd Umaru is a wonderful character. Her cute angry moments, her smug grin and her little moments that she changes hermind or does something by thinking her friends, basically her whole personality is 10/10. And all of her personality fits with her childhood. That's awesome. She is the only character that makes that anime valuable. \\n\\n\r\nBUT, she is not a character that everybody would like. I know exactly the people who would hate it. And I know exactly the people who would love it. She is a type of character that you would like or hate. So this is a type of anime you would like or hate.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are fine. I can match them with the people I know from real life. And they are just acting their personalities. So, didn't see anything wrong with them. Especially Ebina, all of her lines and acts are matching with her history and personality. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, characters are very realistic I can match their lines and acts with real-life situations. And they are very lovely.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, art and drawings in anime are about feelings. Anime is about feelings for me. Others just a normal film or series that is drawing in an anime like style. Anime different because you can see the feelings in that art. You can match a feeling of a character with a memory of a feeling that you had before. \\n\r\nA very simple example is when a character lays down to bed after a very long day, you can match that character with yourself. In real-life maybe you didn't look like that but it was the exact feeling you felt before. \\n\r\nThere was nothing wrong with that in the anime. The art perfect in its \"own style\".\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the story is tricky because there is no an obvious story.\\n\r\nIt's a slice of life and daily life anime. The thing makes it loveable is the characters. But the story part was very rich too in its own style. Umaru's childhood, Ebina's history, Taihei and Umaru's childhood memories. There are many little lovely moments in their life. Just like real-life. It was good for how it suppose to be. I really wanted to see Alex Sylphinford and Umaru together but It didn't happen ^^\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are many Master-Piece anime better than this little Daily life anime. But It was a Master-Piece in its own type.\\n\\n\r\nIt's my 2nd favorite slice of life anime. Simple(?), lovely and funny.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall it was perfect for me. Every little moment, every little reference, every little part that I found in my life.  It was perfect to watch it. Also, she reminds me someone that I know.",

I found myself sometimes screaming at the screen because of some weird and stupid thing Umaru did, and you can bet, she does a lot of stupid things.\r\nThe comedy is on point with all the characters and the anime and gaming references make up for some interesting details that, if you understand, will have you raising the corners of your mouth.\r\nOverall,this anime is a comedy that will not leave you hanging.\\n\r\nAlso, my personal opinion, Kirie is best girl.\\n",

It's one of those shows like Sakamoto Desu Ga and Renkin San-kyuu that has a separate story for each episode, like American cartoons, rather than a continuous season, like typical anime. I personally don't see anything wrong with it.\r\nPeople are also complaining about both the art style and shallow characters, but they're forgetting that it's COMEDY.\r\nStory\r\nLike I said, it has no true plot, but I think it does a good job of having a small subplot each episode.

            "content": "Sloths of the world rejoice, for now there is an anime that centers itself around the age-old practice of lazing around! Himouto! Umaru-chan engages viewers in a cutesy, feel-good, sometimes repetitive series that brings some new ideas to the field of Slice of Life anime. \r\nStory (read the synopsis first!)\r\nThe show is episodic in nature, focusing on isolated events occurring between Umaru and either her brother, her friends, or herself. Some portions follow Taihei instead, as he could be considered the deuteragonist. Examples of events include Umaru's competition at a fighting game tournament, deciding the best snack food complements, and eating out at a ramenshop. Most are cute and fun in their own way, though some events such as her wanting her brother to buy something or begging for \"hamburg steak\" at dinner repeat themselves often. The best scenes are the ones where she individually hangs out with her brother or friends, making us privy to the two (or three) individuals' growing bond. Some of the supporting characters also have their own scenes, such as Kirie's conflicts with her brother, Bomber.\\n\\n\r\nHimouto! succeeds at getting the viewer initially invested through the concept of a \"inwardly flawed yet outwardly perfect\" character. Umaru-chan is cute as hell, no denying that, easily being the selling point of the series. If you like watching cute things, Himouto! is great for that. Male audiences are attracted through Umaru's tomboyish like interests in action manga and video games, while females are attracted through normal Umaru's feminine presentation out in public. Unfortunately, for myself and any other males invested in the series, the feminine portion seems to overtake the tone. While that's great for the other demographic, as this is a series that was intended to be a seinen, a lot of the value dropped off because of the cultural disconnect. I'm sure everyone, however, can relate with the idea of having two separate selves, one you show in public and the other,  more legitimate one you let loose at home.\\n\\n\r\nGenre and Characteristics \\n\\n\r\nSlice of Life animes follow the life of a specific character and his or her friends or family. Himouto! is no different from this regard, though main character Umaru's life stands out as being one focused on lazing around or being irresponsible. How you feel about Slice of Life anime in general will likely be analogous to your enjoyment of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue of the story comes in its redundant patterns. A lot of the charm of the original concept wears off around the midway point of the series as you find the same actions and themes repeating themselves with little to no change in presentation. This, unfortunately, is a flaw that is what holds most Slice of Life animes from reaching that \"great\" or \"fantastic\" tier, often greatly hindering any potential re-watch value as well. \\n\\n\r\nModern references dominate much of Himouto!, as Umaru is meant to mimic a particular entertainment consuming demographic in it being a seinen. She reads manga (inspired by Shounen Jump's One Piece), watches anime, plays games (modeled after JRPGs or MMOs), and eats junk food (notably potato chips and \"cola!\"). I found these references to be pretty endearing and enjoyed their presence, as it inspires the show with a bit of real world familiarity.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\\n\r\nHimouto! was fairly aesthetically pleasing, presenting itself with warm, bright colors and decent facial animation. If you like orange, you're in luck. Also, the visual effects used, often to accompany whichever Umaru we were currently experiencing, did much to convey the differences between the two. The fantasy like situations including a particular Game of Life scenario (ep. 6) and the assault upon the RNA viruses (ep. 10) were well designed and creative in their execution.\\n\\n\r\nAtmospherically, I felt the animation did shine at certain points. Taihei's wandering (ep. 7) through a residential area was particularly beautiful, showcasing a beautiful orange hue and blazing sunset up above. The rain scene (ep. 11) also displayed a gorgeous use of water, both visually and aurally, creating for the peaceful, pre- and post-rain atmosphere that Taihei was supporting. Unfortunately, these moments were fleeting, but still worth noting. Strangely enough, they both involved Taihei as well, hmm...\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, however, compared to other Slice of Life series such as Nichijou, the animation wasn't particularly unique or outstanding in its stylistic design. Great but nothing special would likely be the best explanation for what to expect visually.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nI was quite content with the voice acting. Each voice fit the personality of their respective characters well, particularly Sylphinford Tachibana's confident gait and Ebina Nana's dialectal murmur. There's also a surprising variety of ways I learned you can say \"onii-chan\", thanks to Aimi Tanaka's (Umaru-chan) considerable use of the word.\\n\r\nThe music found in the series is fairly average. Nothing bad, but nothing outstanding. At times, the main track can get a bit repetitive, much like the show does itself. Slice of Life animes are rarely ever known for their soundtracks, so I do not consider this as much of a detriment as I would for a series of greater depth.\\n\\n\r\nI'm a fan of the OP for the series, especially knowing that it was voiced by the main character's voice actress. Visually, it's well done, and represents the energetic, back-and-forth spirit of the show. The ED is alright, much more muted and feminine in nature, likely to mimic Umaru's outside form more than her couch potato evolution.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\r\nUmaru is the main focus of the series in almost all respects. She's fairly likable, relatable to some people, but at times you find yourself getting bored with her. She never really evolves as a character, always swapping between the kind Umaru and devilish Umaru-chan, though it would be unfair to say she's particularly flat. Taihei, at times, allows her to realize that her overall lazy demeanor creates an unnecessary stress on her caring brother, which does indicate some sort of personal growth. Largely, though, the same Umaru-chan we have in episode one is the same at the end of episode twelve, and it's debatable whether or not that's okay, even in a Slice of Life series. \\n\\n\r\nTaihei Doma is almost as featured as little sister Umaru is. A salaryman with an responsible spirit, Taihei takes care of Umaru in the absence of her parents. What struck me as as odd was, despite the show being heavily centered around Umaru herself, I found Taihei to be the most likeable and realistic character of the bunch. He has his flaws, as shown in his inability to scold Umaru or social inadequacies and anxiety, but overall he comes off as strong enough to be that stable deuteragonist that the series needed. \\n\\n\r\nUmaru's friends in big-breasted, shy Ebina Nana, reserved, loyal Kirie Motoba, and energetic, competitive Sylphinford Tachibana are okay. I liked them without a doubt, but despite their individual quirks and \"backstories\", all of them serve to exist seemingly only for Umaru's sake. Rather than be developed into interesting and unique characters, which could have been achieved when considering what history of them we've witnessed, they're more caricatures of certain personality traits (shyness - Ebina, anxiety - Kirie, competitiveness - Sylphinford) set to revolve around Umaru rather than enrich her.\\n\\n\r\nTaihei's friends in Bomber (Kirie's brother), Alex (Sylphinford's brother), and Kanau are given even less screentime despite having strong potential for development as well.\\n\\n\r\nIf Himouto! Umaru-chan zoomed out a little from Umaru and focused on the rest of the characters a little more, it'd have been a much more enjoyable series without losing much emphasis on Umaru herself. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Himouto! does exist in the better half of the Slice of Life animes, though in a genre where \"average\" dominates the majority, it's hard judge the impact of such a placement. It's a dreadfully cute series with some high moments, but sadly one that doesn't have much sticking power. If you do decide to give it a try, be sure to get your snacks and cola ready. To love the Umaru-chan is to be the Umaru-chan!\\n\\n\r\n\"Eating delicious things and watching fun things... I'm so happy. At this moment,  I am truly alive!\" -Umaru Doma\\n\\n\\n",

So I know this dead horse has been beaten so far into the ground its reached China, but I still think I should put my two cents into this anime. So I guess don't think of this as a review and take it as, a fat autistic weeaboos late night ranting.\r\nI know I dropped this at 4 episodes and I am posting this as the sun literally rises out of my window so expect this to be kinda slopperly written, but I hope this helps with your decision on whether or not to watch this.\r\nSo I only recentlywatched Umaru and I gotta say it is pretty bad. Nothing too bad I mean this isn't The Room levels of bad but it isn't the best anime ever. Bebop takes that throne.\\n\\n\r\n---Characters---\\n\r\nThe main cast consists of \"Future Heart Attack victim\", \"Homicide suspect waiting to happen\" \"Boobs McGee\" \"Airhead\" and \"Elliot Rodgers as a woman\" and are mostly dry forgettable and boring for the most part. I legit forgot most of their names literal seconds after watching episode 4. \\n\\n\r\nUmaru is the worst character by far, the sheer brattiness of her just, triggers me to the point where I want to just slap her and tell her to grow the hell up. \\n\\n\r\nHer brother.. Glasses... Is just as bad, he is pretty much an enabler, instead of teaching her how to behave and showing her some discipline he just tolerates her bullcrap. Like stand up for yourself..\\n\\n\r\n---Art---\\n\r\nIts servicable. Not too bad not amazing by any standards. The characters are cute like Ebina, she is the best character in the anime mostly cause her design is adorable enough to make me want to cuddle her. Even Umaru's chibi form made me go \"n'aaww\" back in 2015. \\n\\n\r\n---Sounds---\\n\r\nThe sounds are absolute trash, what even is the ost it sounds like the sound recorders slammed their faces against some instruments and called it a day. The opening is pretty bad as well. The most generic of generic anime music plus annoying asf vocals.\\n\\n\r\n---Enjoyment---\\n\r\nThe comedy was dry as hell only making me laugh several times, I know humor is subjective and people could have found the same boring jokes over and over again to be hilarious but you here the \"oh she is so pretty and cute she must be a celebrity \" quip I start driving nails into my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for cute girls doing cute things than there is a whole load of anime coming out soon or already out that beats this hands down. This also applies to if you want a comedy anime, there is so much better options out there.\\n\\n\r\n---Summation--- \\n\r\nI'm glad most of the anime community forgot about this anime. It fails as a comedy and a satirical look on Otaku and gamer culture. It's just, boring, uninspired crap that became popular due to... Who even remembers. I give this a rating of 5 out of 10.",

            "content": "Himouto Umaru-chan or My Two Faced Little Sister at first LA was irritated by this, but later on, like the title...LA began to see another \"face\" to this anime.\r\nBy all means Himouto Umaru-chan is a slice of life comedy of a closeted otaku girl Umaru Doma voiced by ''Aimi Tanaka'' who orders her big brother Taihei Doma voiced by ''Kenji Nojima'' while doubling her life by having a perfect school life and really at first LA saw Umaru as an irritating obnoxious character due to her nature of being a lazy otaku and along with her treatment of her older brother got LA to labelher as an irritation, HOWEVER LA kinda warmed up to her and by extension this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy really revolves around Umaru and what she can get away with her with laziness and it can be predictable at times, but sometimes the comedy shines out (along with the gaming and anime references makes it that much better) as well as bringing development to the main cast mainly through the character interactions and relationships but more importantly Taihei and Umaru's rocky yet \"Aww they really do like each other\" sibiling relationship (NOT incest, LA didn't mean it THAT way).\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, Taihei and Umaru gets the most focused in terms of their own individual and relationship development (and was because of this that LA warmed up to Umaru from being a \"irritating perfect brat to a fleshed out character who happens to laze around\" and LA will say that LA has done what Umaru done to so brings in some level of nostalgia and hypocrisy on LA's part), other characters such as Nana Ebina voiced by ''Akari Kageyama'' who is a friend of Umaru and downstairs neighbor of Taihei and Umaru and just happened to be LA's favourite character of the anime (odd since LA usually doesn't like Ebina's character archetype), Kirie Motoba voiced by ''Haruka Shirashi'' who is another friend of Umaru and Sylphinford Tachibana voiced by ''Yurina Furukawa'' the eccentric genki rival of Umaru all get their times in the limelight and interacting with Taihei and Umaru. Luckily LA thought that the cast outside of Taihei and Umaru would be stereotypical however they don't by the end of the anime, they too becomes fleshed out outside of their personality all through their interactions from Taihei and Umaru, best character example is Kirie as she was the extremely shy tsundere type but later on LA warmed up to her through Taihei and Umaru's interactions with her.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was anything about this anime's concept LA would talk about is that it feels like a parody vers. of Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai just replace romance genre with comedy (Seriously, closeted otaku main female heroine who is nearly perfect at everything, a \"rival\" friend and the anime more or less showing that the siblings \"really are in good terms of each other by the end of it\").\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, Aimi Tanaka does a good job in voicing Umaru (both vers.) and although squeaky it's hardly annoying (though her tantrums kinda do), Akari Kageyama does a good job voicing Ebina only because she's voicing a shy silent type, though LA's favourite voice actor would actually have to go to eccentric genki Yurina Furukawa.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by Doga Kobo, the animation is detailed enough for a comedy anime as the backgrounding besides the references are decent enough but the nice touches on the gaming and anime references just that much better in a generalized way, where LA praises the animation is on the character designs on the cast, they are all distinct and noticeable (even the minor characters).\\n\\n\r\nHimouto Umaru-chan is a look at the extremely comedic vers. of both of \"perfect kid in a school\" and \"lazy otaku\" and trying to juggle them in the form of Umaru the abnormal one with Taihei being the resistant and the \"normal one\" but with comedy and slice of life elements placed in quite well.\\n\\n\r\nLA at first saw this anime as annoying at first all due to Umaru personality but with LA's hypocrisy through Umaru (\"in some form\", LA isn't saying LA fully embodies her, but is some form as there are always people who want to be lazy just because) along with what made this anime get out of the \"anime with an annoying lead\" and show a bit more substance in the form of sibling bonds (and by extension giving Umaru a bit more of a personality other than being just lazy), character interactions from both the main and minor characters and the referential humor. \\n\\n\r\nLA does have one question about this anime though, the anime never addresses how Umaru's chibi vers. \"works\", LA only brings this up as the characters acknowledges Umaru's chibi vers. and some of the characters see her chibi vers. as a \"different character\" from Umaru's human form and the anime never addresses it.\\n\\n\r\n Himouto Umaru-chan is definitely a unique spin at looking at a girl with opposing double lives with lots of comedy, slice of life and gaming nostalgia and very much like this anime's title, it has two faces (Umaru's chibi and human form), if you look at only one side of face, it's either annoying and irritating or just funny and nostalgic but if you can look at both faces with some open arms then this anime can still be comedically enjoyable even with it's \"annoyances\" that will disappear before the halfway point and that's LA's opinion on Himouto Umaru-chan as a whole.",

            "content": "Surprise surprise, another slice of life anime this season! Apparently I first knew about Himouto! Umaru-chan before it came out when I was browsing the pre-order listings in a certain anime shop, and I found this anime through a cute Umaru nendo. The owner said that it would surely be famous when it airs, so I decided to check out the series. The synopsis seemed interesting (although at the time, it was vague) so I decided to put it on my watchlist for this season.\r\nThe story revolves around Umaru, a girl all-so-perfect-in-every-way in school, but she has a deep secret which totally tells a differentside of her - slacking like what a hikikomori would do, reading manga and watching anime, eating junk food, etc. She has to hide this secret towards her friends for her own good and keeps her perfection still. She lives with his working brother, Taihei, who just does not like her attitude at home since he finds it annoying and irritating. Being a slice of life anime, well, one would expect your typical slice-of-life-ness. But this anime shows more of what one person with two sides would do. You see how Umaru manages to hang around with her friends, while still being a total hikki at night-time. Of course, his brother will find her quite annoying and usually argues over her hikki-state, and some many find it annoying too when she whines like a little sister who demands everything. Nevertheless, the story is captivating if you like to see how one handles two sides.\\n\\n\r\nI really like the comedy that plays out well in the anime. There are great hilarious moments as well as many references that one can spot within a few episodes. There are also segments that focuses on other characters that are pretty good. Honestly, who would just want to see Umaru being the only focused character of the anime? Some of these segments may have show more of the characters\u2019 personality and they are pretty chilling or heart-warming to see. Overall, the whole story is very nice and maybe if you can stand the bitterness of Umaru\u2019s little sister devil, I think it is worth a shot.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime portrayed Umaru\u2019s two sides well. Her character of being too perfect may be a bit boring or uninteresting for people, and perhaps her character of being an annoying little sister can piss people watching the anime off, but I find them quite interesting and it might take a while to get used to this thing. She seemed to develop quite a while, being more open to her friends and trying to do things on her own, but in the end, she is still almost the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast has not only the Doma siblings (Umaru and Taihei), but also Umaru\u2019s friends and their siblings, and a few minor characters. Ebina is Umaru\u2019s neighbour and classmate who come from a different province. She is shy and self-concious, that actually makes most of the viewers happy, proclaiming the best girl indeed. Kirie is another classmate of Umaru\u2019s who although may look menacing to the people around her, she is actually shy. She admires Umaru greatly and treats Ebina as her affection rival. Sylphynford is also another classmate of Umaru who likes to compete with her, but in the end hangs out with her. All of these three actually have a nice development as they changed while being around Umaru for a while. It is really nice of how the story manages to give them some focus. \\n\\n\r\nFor a slice of life, it is normal for the anime to look nice and pleasing. I mean, let\u2019s be honest - looking at chibi Umaru is cute, despite how annoying she can get. Her character designs, both as normal and chibi, is nicely shown and cute as well. The other character designs are good-looking as well, and I really love the facial expressions the anime brings. The sceneries are good and I like to see how the references being placed as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is so catchy and great to listen. I think it is a great way to bring the excitement of what the anime will show. A great cheerful song sung by Umaru\u2019s voice actress Aimi Tanaka. The ending song, sung by the four voice actresses of the four girls in thr anime, has a different mood compared to the opening song - a much more light-hearted relaxing song to listen. The soundtrack is great to listen, a normal thing to say. The voice acting is done pretty well for the many voice actors/actresses who are relatively new to the voice acting scene. How they express their emotions to the characters is a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Himouto! Umaru-chan is an enjoyable anime, one that struck out this season and one that can quite memorable for a long while. It is one great slice of life anime that not only shows the life of a two-sided person, but also around her peers with different thoughts too. It is one that also shows how we can be as similar as her when it comes to being alone watching anime, so some can pretty much relate to her. I personally would like a second season, but seeing that Dogakobo would never want to do a second season, the manga (and the OVA coming soon) is suffice for now.\\n\\n\r\nSo, give it a try. It is a nice watch.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nUnlike Himouto! Umaru-chan, I do not have a younger sister. However, I do have a younger brother. Admittedly he is not-so-little anymore, but he is still my baby bro nonetheless. I always tried to be a \u201cgood older brother\u201d \u2013 playing sports, earning high marks in education, and looking out for him when needed. Still, I do not think he ever looked up to me as an older brother; for much of his life he has made his own decisions, regardless of me or anyone else around him. Not that I hate him or vice versa(we love each other despite never saying the words), it is just we have been more like the best of friends rather than him viewing me as a role model of sorts. Whether that speaks more about him or myself, I cannot say.\\n\\n\r\nThis past week I met up with him, to discuss life, how he was doing, and what stories we had to share. We insulted each other, we poked fun at each other, and we belittled each other, but we were always laughing. The jokes, the melodramatic tales, and the unique scenarios we find ourselves in are separate, but we get each other. His laughter, mixed with my own, makes this known.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter what happens, he will always be my baby brother. I know that, and I know that he knows that, too. Despite the things we might do or the words we might say, my brotherly relationship to my goofball of a brother is something I will always cherish. As for Umaru of Himouto! Umaru-chan, that same mentality can be found somewhere within.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nHimouto is a simple anime. As a comedy with intermittent, heartfelt moments, the show truthfully does not do much except stick to its regular self. This is not necessarily a negative but it does leave much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDesire\u201d is an important concept since much of the comedy revolves around this notion. Umaru desires laziness, leaning on her brother\u2019s generosity and indulging in her own fantasies. Ebina desires food and romance. Kirie desires friendship. Sylphinford desires winning. With these desires in mind, the anime often constructs its comedic events around them. One scene might have Umaru chatting with her inner-selves while making popular anime references while another scene might showcase Kirie\u2019s daydreaming involving her, her \u201cMaster\u201d, and the beach. Doing so allows the show to essentially \u201cdo what they want\u201d, escaping the confines of reality in order to give the show a wider breadth of material to work with. That is to say, gratification stems from their (often unfulfilled) desires.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show bends its own reality when it so chooses, most notably when Umaru goes from prim and proper to squat and squalor. The show makes a distinction between the two halves, meaning the audience (and the characters) can (or cannot) tell that the refined Umaru is different from the reduced Umaru. This, once again, opens up another branch of comedy. The show constantly uses this disparity between the regular and the hermit Umaru in order to create contrasting comedic courses. For example, one scene has her out to eat with her brother and Ebina so she has to act \u201ccorrectly\u201d, but since she wants to purchase a new video game, her \u201ctrue\u201d self starts to emerge. This mixture of both halves \u2013 this ultra-perfect girl whining, crying, and acting silly \u2013 creates a dichotomy that naturally invokes hilarity. This kind of contrast applies to each of the other girls as well: Kirie being excited and cute yet somewhat creepy, Ebina accidentally using her normal dialect when happy, and Sylphinford acting (playfully) high and mighty but getting embarrassed when her brother appears. This contrasting motif permeates the anime, both in its narrative and in its characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for other, concrete themes, the narrative does not invest in anything too deep. Ideas such as \u201chome sweet home\u201d \u2013 when Umaru hangs out at a manga caf\u00e9 that has everything she has ever wanted yet she heads home early \u2013 and the importance of family \u2013 when Umaru feels alone after separating the apartment into two halves \u2013 are sweet for the soul but remain unexplored. That is, they exist solely to add a bit of sentimentality to balance out the stream of comedy the show provides. In this way, the comedy avoids to an extent becoming stale since the show often relies on the same gags and adorableness. Therefore shifting the tone slightly time and again does not outright take away from the laughs. Instead the show makes those laughs, when they do come around again, stronger since they are jumping from a relatively mellow level of emotion to a level of pure happiness.\\n\\n\r\nHimouto avoiding the exploration of difficult themes is not automatically a problem; the anime has no interest in going super-critical. The show simply wants to make comedy its first and foremost outlet. However there is a theme that Himouto, to some degree, expounds on: the sibling relationship. At most points throughout the anime, Umaru and Taihei\u2019s bond is tested. There are the obvious instances, where Umaru feels bad for acting difficult around Taihei and Taihei thinking about his sister\u2019s lunch so she grows up healthy. But it is not these kinder moments that portray their sibling status. Rather, Umaru\u2019s teasing, Taihei\u2019s lividness, and their ultimate reconciliations are what display the bond they share. Having a sibling \u2013 be it a brother or a sister \u2013 brings with it certain connotations. Understanding, respect, tolerance; \u201cfamily comes first\u201d is not said lightly. This clich\u00e9 literally means that that guy or girl who shares the same blood is always at the forefront of the mind. While Himouto might not necessarily have Umaru and Taihei in dramatized situations, Umaru fretting over Taihei when he gets sick or Taihei working overtime to support Umaru\u2019s future are moments that highlight the special relationship that not everyone gets to experience.\\n\\n\r\nThis theme of sibling relationships does not only apply to Umaru and Taihei. Sylphinford and her brother Alex as well as Kirie and her brother Bomber are relationships about the same idea. The former contains a bit of unnecessary distance whereas the latter is filled with miscommunication. In truth, these examples are likewise lacking intensive exploration, but these relationships at least expound on what a sibling relationship entails once again. Meaning Himouto, despite focusing so much on comedy, has at the minimum a noticeable thematic presence.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOne of Himouto\u2019s biggest strengths is the level of animation it employs. Mostly due to the simplistic art, the characters and their various actions \u2013 from Umaru\u2019s transitions between normal and hermit to Ebina\u2019s frantic disposition \u2013 are fluid. This also stems from the show\u2019s laidback nature. The characters never do anything extremely extraneous, meaning resources can be relegated to hair, faces, and limb movements. As such, the show manages to remain dynamic, fitting the show\u2019s equally dynamic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs for the characters are not as dynamic, however some of the characters are impressive. Umaru may have an argument in her favor for the fact that she is given two separate designs to coincide with her two separate personalities. Her cute side, having long hair, glinting eyes, and a model-esque smile, makes her blanket-wearing, height-missing, and doofy-grinning side a jarring spectacle. Most striking of all is Sylphinford. Her cat-like smile, light-blue, flowing hair, and fancy dresses make her stick out from everyone else in the series. Yet it is her eyes, with their cross-symbol pupils, that immediately draw the attention of the audience. There is no denying how different she looks from the other decidedly plain (read: normal) people, signifying her own need to rise above the rest. This \u201crest\u201d being Kirie, Ebina, and Taihei, each of who are visually lackluster. Kirie\u2019s purple ponytail, Ebina\u2019s huge boobs and twin-tails, and Taihei\u2019s glasses make them their own persons but nowhere near as creative as Umaru and Sylphinford.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, as was stated Himouto rarely ventures outside of its comfort zone. The art is simplistic, taking place primarily at or around Umaru\u2019s abode. Parts of the school, the arcade, or a restaurant may be visited now and again but the majority of the action takes place in the regular apartment. The result is a tame offering of the same, tired area despite how detailed the recluse location is. Lighting also contributes to the sameness since the anime rarely deals in extravagant use of fixtures or bulbs. Still, the camera and its direction deserves some praise for its occasional execution. One scene in particular takes an aerial view of Umaru and the apartment\u2019s entrance, then shifts into a first-person perspective of Umaru as she crawls along the floor and under a table to her favorite resting spot. A unique scenario \u2013 one of a select few instances where the camera does a lot of work \u2013 but worthy of attention regardless of its frequency.\\n\\n\r\nOther nuances exist \u2013 such as the inclusion of text for certain conversations or actions, the visibility of a heat wave, and the literal tilting of the frame on-screen \u2013 that, however slightly, demonstrate the show\u2019s attention to detail on an artistic level.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nArguably the characters are the backbone for comedies (characters being the backbone for all anime is another conversation entirely), meaning whether or not Himouto can stand upright relies mostly on the strength of its cast.\\n\\n\r\nFocusing solely on the main troupe \u2013 Taihei, Ebina, Sylphinford, Kirie, and Umaru (ignoring Bomber, the \u201cChristmas Cake\u201d boss, and the other very minor characters) \u2013 Taihei actually rests at the bottom of the totem pole. Much of his persona derives from the other girls. He shows kindness towards Ebina, understanding towards Kirie, and happiness towards Umaru. This, combined with his adult status, does not give him much room to change throughout the season, and that is sort of the point. As a caregiver, as a guy who has to look out for his family and his family\u2019s friends, he is more or less the rock that supports them. While he does have nostalgic asides, the anime uses Taihei as the man he is and the man he is supposed to be: one always willing to help those around him.\\n\\n\r\nEbina is not so much a helper as she is a girl seemingly out of her element. She hails from the country, her accent (which she hides) giving her away easily enough. Her strangest feature, though, is her adoration of Taihei. Her loving him is fine, it is her reasoning that is weird. On her travels, Taihei was (supposedly) the first person to look not at her ginormous bosom but instead at her, the girl hoisting said bust. Therefore, whenever Taihei is around she noticeably blushes. As for her relationship to Umaru, they are best friends, the big-boob lady floored that the perfect girl of the school would even think of hanging out with her country bumpkin self. Ebina does not do a whole lot throughout the season despite hang out with Umaru, fail to get her feelings across to Taihei, and try to make friends with Kirie, but as the genuinely sincere part of the group, she plays her role well.\\n\\n\r\nSylphinford also has a role in the group: the hyper-competitive and hyperactive girl. Loving games, anime, and manga (which she hides from her brother), she comes from a place of wealth. Aptly put, Sylphinford is a character among the characters. She has a self-imposed rivalry with Umaru \u2013 in sports, in grades, and in general life. Sylphinford always loses but she never lets this deter her. She is almost happy that she loses, or at the minimum has someone who she can call her equal. Umaru\u2019s masquerading gamer side is someone Sylphinford also competes with for nearly the same reasons. But no matter who she is with, she gives everything her all not because she wants attention but because she simply wants to have fun. She loves playing games but even more so than that she loves making other people smile.\\n\\n\r\nKirie is similar in the sense that she wants to have fun but has a hard time getting across this notion. She has an extremely awkward personality (which she hides\u2026unsuccessfully) that most people interpret as a threatening demeanor. She was lonely because nobody wanted to interact with her and because she could not muster the courage to interact with anyone else. It is not until Umaru\u2019s hermit half that she finally opens up completely, revealing to the audience a girl who is still awkward at times but actually filled with heart and love. Kirie is the only one to see growth of a sizeable magnitude: having overcome her inherent anxiety, not just with Umaru but with Taihei and Ebina later on, she comes to have the type of camaraderie she had always sought, breaking her shell slightly. And it is slightly. Kirie still has a lot of difficulty talking with everyone, even regular Umaru. But progressing to the point of having a beach vacation with five people at once is a hugely relative leap for the hugely shy lady.\\n\\n\r\nUnquestionably, Umaru is the most interesting character. Questionably, Umaru is the most complex of all the characters. Technically Umaru is a single person. However Umaru is somebody with multiple personas (which she hides). Like Spider Man and Peter Parker, she adapts herself for the people around her. For Ebina, she acts like her refined self. For Sylphinford, she acts like her gamer self. For Kirie, she acts like her lazy self. In other words, Umaru \u201cbecomes\u201d somebody else depending on who she happens to talk with. Her brother is the only one to see all these sides simultaneously because, as was aforementioned, their sibling relationship demands trust between the brother and sister. Interestingly, she does not \u201copen up\u201d to anyone despite them opening up to her. Ebina recollects her outside origins, Sylphinford laments her embarrassment, and Kirie confides her troubles. On the one hand, this is selfish of Umaru. Her friends willingly unveil themselves while she continues to dodge their glares. On the other hand, Umaru is the least selfish. Looking at the situation more closely, Umaru uses the persona that best suits each of her friends, less a ruse and more a comfort. Ebina cannot handle crazy stuff so she acts normal, Sylphinford loves to compete so she dons her UMR mask, and Kirie is better at dealing with children so she goes full-childish. In a strange way, she is a complex character, someone who contorts to fit the occasion while simultaneously being herself. She is Doma. She is UMR. She is Komaru. And yet she is not. Because, in the end, she is nobody else besides Umaru.\\n\\n\r\nUmaru easily personifies one of the definitive themes of the anime. This theme being two-sidedness (granted, Umaru has three sides). Each of the girls has the same peculiar quality \u2013 they hide some part of themselves. Indeed, the previous discussion on each character makes this connection clear. Everyone has something to hide, or more poignantly everyone has something to reveal. Men and women often view other individuals through a single lens rather than through a multidimensional scope. Meaning they are incapable of seeing all sides to another person. Ebina is quite reserved, but she has a voracious appetite, an accent, and a pure love. Sylphinford is bombastic, but she adores candy, loves \u201call things Japanese\u201d, and hates to embarrass herself in front of her brother. Kirie is overly shy, but she can play sports, she can cook cookies, and she is devoutly loyal. Ebina, Sylphinford, and Kirie reveal these traits to Umaru as time passes, and to an extent it is a relief for them. Having the opportunity to be themselves around another person, revealing who they actually are, is a wonderful feeling, one that Himouto manages to explore in a comedic yet meaningful manner.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is absolutely delightful, perfectly capturing the mood of the show. The beat is quick, the tone is ecstatic, and the instruments are fun. However it is the song\u2019s interlude, where the track shifts its tune from cacophony to calm then back to calamity \u2013 what Umaru does on a daily basis \u2013 that elevates the piece\u2019s awareness of the anime\u2019s focus, thereby improving the piece\u2019s overall execution. The ending theme cleverly tones everything down, keeping its mood mellow. The four main girls take turns singing in the first half, followed by an audible \u201caragato\u201d, and then the second half a choir of their voices. Alongside the cheerful and serene tone, the track gets better the more it is listened to. If nothing else, the piece has the audience exit each episode feeling warm in the soul.\\n\\n\r\nA minor note: the anime likes to use silly sound effects, especially with the characters. This most prominently happens with Umaru and Sylphinford, their \u201cUmaruun!\u201d and \u201cShupaan!\u201d, respectively, adding comedy to their actions. Also, the distinct sounds of hermit Umaru walking make her tiny form that much funnier. As such, the anime improves on its comedic delivery, albeit in a roundabout way.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for Himouto is above average for most of the performances. Aimi Tanaka as Umaru provides two separate voices to match the young lady\u2019s current demeanor, giving Umaru a stronger distinction between her two halves. Plus, as Ms. Tanaka\u2019s first major role, she goes above and beyond. Yurina Furukawa as Sylphinford uses quite the upbeat voice, resulting in a girl who always sounds determined. Similar to Ms. Tanaka, this is Ms. Furukawa\u2019s very first role, meaning her debut performance could not have gone any better. The best performance comes from Haruka Shiraishi as Kirie, whose grunts, gasps, and guttural noises made her into the lovable weirdo that she is. And as might be expected, this is one of her first bigger roles in the industry, her well-executed performance demonstrating a potentially bright future for her as a voice actress. Akari Kageyama as Ebina also has this as her first big role, so if anything the voice acting should be remembered for enlisting new and strong talent for the majority of the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack outside of the OP and the ED is intriguing. As a slice-of-life anime, Himouto is not grandiose in its background music, but some do manage to perk the ears. One track involves a low-note piano with constant snapping, used for the slightly ominous moments. Another almost strictly sticks to xylophones for the questionable times. Techno beats, fast-paced tunes, and lots of flutes fill the air of various pieces, creating a wide range of offerings. The music can also become specific, like during the time Umaru, Kirie, and Taihei play a video game that incorporates 8-bit recordings. Again, nothing is memorable but Himouto does a nice job of having the right piece for the right moments throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, there is not a lot to say about this one. Except for specific categories, the anime is quite average at everything it does. Yet this does not outright deter the amount of entertainment derived from the show. The characters, regardless of their meager development, are nothing short of fun. Especially Kirie, whose awkwardness and accidental creepiness, combined with her stuttering and devotion to Umaru, made her an undeniable ball of awesomeness throughout the season. Literally anything Kirie did made me laugh out loud, making her easily my favorite of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSylphinford is not too far behind. Her boundless determination, sincere praise of Umaru, and her ridiculous poses were nothing short of hilarious. Umaru, too, with her dramatized adorableness and lackadaisical attitude. Ebina, as well as Kanau, brought a dash of romance which, given my adoration for the genre, was a welcome addition. Bomber is a cool dude, too. He plays the off-kilter man to Taihei\u2019s straight man while also playing well off of lazy Umaru and his sister Kirei. The characters are a nice bout of fun, individually and collectively providing laughter throughout the experience.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, there was probably more room for different pairings. Sylphinford barely interacts with anyone besides Umaru and there is very little of Kanau despite her having a funny (and heartfelt) scene. Furthermore, besides the moments themselves being cutesy or sweet, none were moving; the events were neither sad nor frustrating to me. While I could certainly empathize with the sibling relationship ideas, I simply understood those themes and where they were heading rather than them being a set of scenes that I found myself resonating with. Regardless, the faces the characters made, the imaginations they thought up, and the simple moments they shared with one another put smiles not only on their faces but on mine, too.\\n\\n\r\nHimouto! Umaru-chan is a comedy before anything else. Its meager themes on siblings and the idea of multisided people exist but are not explored extensively. Other areas are a mixed bag: the animation is solid but the art is often par for the course. Still, this does not take away from the musical choices, the impressive debuts of the voice actresses, and the large amount of entertainment the whole package delivers. And as this one shows, regardless if it is a made-up anime family or my brother and I, having a sibling relationship is a truly unique experience.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, comedy entails desire and bending reality, with sentimental and sibling themes that are explored only adequately\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, above average actual animation, Sylphinford and Umaru are the only impressive character designs, about average artistic direction with hints of ingenuity\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, while the majority of the cast are relegated to singular roles, Umaru\u2019s adaptability and the theme on multiple sides holds a higher sense of meaning\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, great OP, good ED, okay OST, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, Kirie, Sylphinford, and Umaru were hilarious, the rest of the cast was fun, with missed pairing opportunities and emotional events.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "I watched this show months ago but only now thought of actually writing a review. This is my first time doing this by the way.\r\nI honestly thought the show was almost terrible but the best way to describe it is mediocre. It's just more NEET bait so people with low self esteem and no life feel better about themselves through the use of cute characters to represent their rotten lifestyle, and since a lot of people in the anime community follow said lifestyle, the anime became fairly popular.\r\nThe story isn't hard to keep up with, it falls under the slice of life genre therefore eachepisode has a different context or plot, something I'm usually fond of so if you fancy this genre it won't bother you. \\n\r\nThe main protagonist is Umaru, a character who seems to be the perfect high school student when outside, but actually turns into a lazy and spoiled chibi when she returns home. Supposedly everything about her seems perfect, including grades and looks, something that contradicts the fact that she runs on coke and potato chips and spends all of her time watching anime and playing games. Giving the story a 5 is more than enough, such a simple plot could give the writers many opportunities but they didn't care enough. \\n\\n\r\nUmaru is the worst character in the show. The rest of the cast is amazing compared to her (or at least some of the cast). Umaru's big brother, Taihei, is her baby sitter with no backbone and always buys her shit after she throws a tantrum or two. Ebina is the shy friend of the protagonist and everyone in this community loves her because she's a walking definition of fanservice for people who like shy girls. Sylphinford is very energetic and wants to be number one but Umaru takes her place for some reason. Kirie is a dumbass with a scary face. The rest of the cast does not concern you because they are not important. Characters get a 5 for being generic though some are better than others.\\n\\n\r\nArt style gets a 7 for being good.\\n\\n\r\nSound gets a 3 cause the BGM is terrible (it fits the show perfectly). You'll understand once you hear it. \\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this show and my standards are low. The jokes weren't funny, the protagonist was annoying, there was hardly any character development (even though there's a season 2 coming out soon and hopefully there will be something interesting happening between the characters) and the way the main character got away with literally everything made each character's behavior unreasonably stupid. Enjoyment gets a 3.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this show a 4. As bad as the show is it's definitely iconic in a way, since it has created a billions of reaction images, each one used way too much of course, and most people in the anime community have seen \"that hamster thing, right?\" at least once. Should you watch this? Probably, it may be a terrible show but it can serve as a good example of terrible shows that got very popular. Also it's important to watch popular anime so you can understand why it got popular and learn more about the anime community as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR This show is trashy but you should probably watch it so you can rant on it without being clueless on what it's about",

            "content": "No Spoilers.\r\nIt seems some people who write reviews completely miss the premise of Umaru-chan. That is we each act differently in front of others. And show our truer selves to those we feel most comfortable around. In this case, the main character is a bratty child. \r\n-It's comedy aspect is decent, though because comedy is subjective it's not helpful to rate it. \r\n-The story is that of most other slice of life where it's more episodic.\r\n-I would say it's suitable for kids and my cousins aged 5-8 loved the english dub. (Though there is end part of one episode that you may want to skipas it may be a little too spooky for a child)\\n\\n\r\n-The support characters are as mediocre as you would find in any other slice of life. The main character is cute and acts selfishly. I feel like the main character mirrors a lot of people's attitudes pretty well. Seeing how much one can get away with is human nature, especially so for the fairer sex, where most people tend to ignore poor behaviour.\\n\\n\r\n-The art and sounds are average. Nothing stood out to me to be particularly bad.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall an enjoyable anime. I couldn't say if it's re-watchable as I am biased against slice of life anime for the most part.",

The characters all have a unique and exquisite feature and personality. The main story showed the intresting life of a otaku. The interactions between lazy and cute sister vs. hardworking and dilligent brother was very funny to watch. There is a manga too which features more about the interesting himouto lifestyle. The creator of this anime put his creativity and humour into this masterpiece anime. I recommend it to many otaku's out there. In short, if your looking for a funny, cute, well plotted anime thatshows the modern life in Japan with awesome characters this anime is definitely for you!!!",

            "content": "It's a pretty good comedy anime!\r\nI really like Umaru in particular because she seems so ideal of a character. Being a perfect girl while also being an otaku is something people like to see. The same way people like Kirito being an invincible badass in Sword Art Online and scoring Asuna as a waifu, it's very ideal and something most people dream for. Even if he is kind of bland in personality. Not to say Umaru is bland, she does semble some unique characteristics and more relatability than Kirito. In terms of other characters I liked, Tachibana is probably my favorite character in the anime.I enjoy her competitiveness and positivity. \\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint about the anime is that Kirie and Nana feel somewhat too similar in personality, it seems like both of their main character traits involve shyness. I know Kirie is different with her often getting mad at Takashi and also calls \"Komaru\" her master. But there's just not differentiation for me to like either of them as of now.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some pretty good backstories surrounding the characters in Umaru, it's not just Umaru playing video games and watching anime. It's worth pulling through if you're willing to learn more about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that in Season 2 that they're given more backstory and character development. It's a good watch definitely, give it a shot at watching it. It may or may not be for you depending on how well you can tolerate Umaru's stubbornness. Good anime overall!\\n",

            "content": "Do you want to watch Himouto! Umaru-chan? You're late like me, but it's okay.... lol\r\nIt's my first time being here and this is my first review, so it might be a little silly. Don't worry, it will not have spoilers. And don't mind my bad English ^^''\r\nHimouto! Umaru-chan is about a girl named Umaru (really?). In school, she's a very pretty, popular, and dedicated student. But appearances can be deceiving, because when she arrives at her house, she literally transforms into a chibi with a hamster hood, being a completely lazy and egoist person. Are you interested? So let me tell you my opinion aboutthis anime...\\n\\n\r\n--Story (3/10)--\\n\\n\r\nScared by this score? Well, it's for a good reason. This anime doesn't have a story, it's just a slice of life thing about a girl being a completely angel in school, but when in home, she's lazy, addicted to cola and video games while torturing her older brother by using her manipulative skills. If you don't like this kind of anime, thank me for warning you. I don't really like this kind of genre, so when I finished watching it, I got disappointed. I really thought it was going to have a little conflict, but in the end, it was just a way to fool you into watching it completely... Like Umaru-chan does.\\n\\n\r\n--Art (9/10)--\\n\\n\r\nNow things got better, right? It's for a good reason too. The characters and the scenarios are great to look at. The main characters are cutely drawn and the scenes are very dynamic, with sparkling lights and Japanese Onomatopoeia. The character that I found cute in design, was Sylphin. Don't judge me if you think the opposite, I just liked her long blue hair, sparkling blue eyes, cat-like mouth, and most importantly: her ojou-sama way of talking.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound (7/10)--\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't epic or unforgettable, but this anime had music and sound effects. And they were good. It wasn't strange nor bad quality.\\n\\n\r\n--Character (8/10)--\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the characters. I found really cool the idea of Umaru being a two-faced sister, and hiding the lazy personality from her friends and others. I liked the idea of she having a rival: Sylphin. Of course she would have one, she only scored 10 in her exams! Umaru's older brother: Taihei, is a completely cool person! He cooks, cleans, and takes care of his little sister although she's a brat! And the character I really liked in the series was Kirie. I'll try not to say spoilers, but Kirie is Umaru's Number 1 Fan and she can't talk to her properly, acting really creepy. Some other things happen after this, but I will spoil the entire anime if I say and it will be really boring to watch after knowing this things... Remember when I said that it didn't had a story? So.\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment (6/10)--\\n\\n\r\nWell... I watched the entire anime, but only because I thought it would have something intriguing. But it hadn\u2019t, so it got a bit boring. And on the Anime List\u2019s page synopsis, it said that it was a comedy anime. But I didn\u2019t found it very funny. Sometimes I laughed, but not like a comedy thing, that you cry a lot. It was just a bit funny. Not comedy. \\n\r\nI only scored 6 because I could watch it completely (if it was really bad to watch I would drop it for sure), and the episodes were full of games and anime references. It was fun to find some of them.\\n\\n\r\n--Overall (7/10)\u2014\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Himouto! Umaru-chan is a watchable anime, but just to spend time. You have nothing to do? Watch this anime, it will probably be something. If you want a more thrilling or intriguing anime, that makes you excited to see what happens, watch another. Simple as that. Don\u2019t get mad and write a review just to say that this anime is shit. It has potential.\\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t worry because\u2026.. There\u2019s a second season coming! Maybe it will have a story at last! ^^\\n",

Umaru chan is an anime about a teenage girl who acts as the perfect high school girl that every boy dreams of.She's pretty,has best scores in everything and is just lovely..NOT! Umaru is literally Satan that's hiding in that damn hamster hood all day, parasitising on her older brother who does everything for her but never receives any praise or a single thanks from her.She's everything a normal person shouldn't be.I'm talking about the stuff she does aside from being a lazy good for nothing person,otaku or whatever it's called.I liked the anime,Iliked all of the cast except Umaru.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga past the events that happened in the anime so I'll just review what the anime offered.The story is mediocre,a typical slice of life anime that shows us the shenanigans of Umaru and her brother/friends,while hiding her true Satan form in school and other public places.\\n\\n\r\nArt:6/10\\n\r\nIt has some charm,I liked it but I think it could've been better animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nI think the sound was probably the best done thing in the anime,the voice acting was superb.Ebina's accent was well done and Umaru's tantrums did a good job since it made me want to punch her in the face with no remorse.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nNot so much character development,in the last few episodes they did forshadow some things that are probably already answered in the manga.I'm sad that we hadn't the opportunity to see them in anime,so that's why my score isn't so great for it.Favorite female characters are Ebina and Sylphyn(Shupaaan!),Taihei was great,if i was in his shoes I would already commit murder.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed it a lot,all the gaming,anime and real life references made me chuckle.Street fighter,one piece,jojo,evangelion,hatsune mike,lots of japanese insider jokes etc. Himouto Umaru chan isnt a great anime,but is as hell enjoyable and I recommend it if you're into comical slice of life anime.Also if you're into the cute girls do cute stuff genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :7/10",

This anime is a pretty standard comedy, not unlike Lucky Star, but all the same, I found it to be an enjoyable watch. This series, however, feels as if it needs to shove in \"character development\" and \"drama\", which feels out of place in this kind of show and is executed terribely. In these kinds of episodes, it feels like they are trying to be Welcome To The NHK, but it ends up feeling more like the \"dramatic\" episodes in Hetalia, which are also out of place. The only reason to watchthis show is to see the himouto version of Umaru be lazy, push her brother around, and make Kirie her servant. It just feels annoying when they try to push the whole \"she's living a double life, what will she do\" thing because it just never feels compelling and perfect Umaru's character is bland and unexciting. Nonetheless, I really liked the side characters in the show and there was ony one that I wasn't too fond of.  I thought Kirie's relationship with Umaru was interesting and funny, bringing an interesting dynamic to Umaru's \"himouto\" situation. Sylphyn, too, was enjoyable and felt like the only character to get any real development. Ebina, though, was a classic moe blob; she was forgetable, bothersome, and didn't add much to the show. The only thing I liked about her was her backstory about how she moved to Tokyo from Akita and she had to learn to talk like the people in Tokyo do and how she felt embarrassed about where she was from. Her accent sometimes came through when she was excited or eating familiar food, which was pretty cute. I would say that if you liked Lucky Star and are curious about the idea of a girl who acts perfect and public, but is a lazy, selfish shut-in when she comes home, then you might enjoy this anime.",

Umaru-chan was different from what I expected and was strangely compelling.\r\nI don't think it's all my fault that I thought it was a purely comedy anime though, the first few episodes presented itself as such. Even though it's not purely comedy, it's still largely comedy so I guess the initial impression isn't too far off...\r\nHowever, occasionally, there were strangely realistic parts in between comedic segments. These mostly involve Umaru's brother, Taihei, and show what comes after graduating from school, juxtaposing that lifestyle against that of a student, albeit a lazy one. Maybe it hit closer to home for me butat one particular part, I started thinking about my parents and what they might be feeling, coming home from a hard day at work to see their children playing games or lazing around in general. It was probably moments like these that compelled me to continue watching, I think.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I found that there weren't very many jokes and that a few of them take a long time to set up before getting to the punchline. For the first half of the season, anyway. Perhaps they weren't even meant to be funny and I missed the point. Maybe they were mostly character introduction and I hardly noticed. Good thing is, the anime got more interesting in the later half in terms of story (what little there is), character development and jokes.\\n\\n\r\nHere's a token mention of music and animation. They're both pretty okay, nothing stellar. I happened to notice, at one point, that one of the character's fingers were wrongly drawn but it wasn't obvious so it's fine. Music blends into the background as people talk and things happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it wasn't much as a slice-of-life or comedy anime at first but a few glints of reality keeps it compelling. Some character development later also makes it interesting.\\n\\n\r\n7/10",

It taught us about the laziness of average teen in the world but then they would just laugh and said \"She's really like me lol\". Well, I'm not judging, since I came here to review.\r\nStory (6/100)\r\nIt's really sad when the story is about double faced high school girl that very contradictory at school and home. But then I find it interesting when she must be willing to act different when her friend is nearby even worse is actually her neighbor. It's so funny though.\r\nCharacter (8/10)\r\nThe personality of the character can be change drastically. I actually should givethe credit to the seiyuu. Even if the main character is smart and has many talent, she's not arrogant and keep humble. I like it when she only think about what should she does at home rather than think negatively about others. I only find it annoys me when her brother spoiled her like a baby geez...\\n\\n\r\nOverall,I recommend this anime both for fun and introspect yourself haha~",

You do start to see Umaru's relationship with her older brother and friends develop, but it isn't central to the anime. \r\n++ Slice of life anime. There's no real overarching story line. You shouldn't go into the anime thinking you're getting a juicy story progression because that's simply not what this anime is about.\r\n++Bratty characters who often get their way. Sure, Umaru is agrade A manipulator, but in the end she really loves the people around her. So if you end up thinking \"wow what a bi**h\" then you can't blame me. \\n\\n\r\n++ Almost saccharine sweet moments. Don't underestimate how almost annoyingly cute this anime is. That's one of the reasons I love it, but it isn't for everyone. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNOT for people who need:\\n\\n\r\n--Thick plots with a classic start, climax, end style of storytelling. It's slice of life, so each episode has that to some degree (albeit mild), but there's not a long term story progression. \\n\\n\r\n-- NOT for people who get annoyed with the portrayal of female gamers, female anime fans, anime fans, people who eat junk food, people who like to be cute to the point where it borders on annoying but somehow doesn't fully get there leaving you in an awkward no fly zone of absolute mystery as to why you love umaru even though you know you shouldn't. \\n\\n\r\n-- Doesn't have fantastic music. \\n\\n\r\n-- Animation style isn't meant to be edgy or overly artistic. It's silly, cute, and very \"mainstream\" anime style character design. \\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment from plot moving forward and character development. I can't stress this enough, you're not going to get anything outside the realm of slice of life from this anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved this anime, and Umaru has fast become one of my favorite characters and one whom I joke I am like. I'd definitely only suggest this for people looking to laugh, have a good time, and not worry about paying the closest attention, because in the end it's just about the antics that surround Umaru's life.\\n",

I initially thought this premise was very limited in what can be done with it, but it worked out for 12 episodes. There were enough characters to provide many different situations for Umaru. What I found weird though, is how she seems to be able to actually transform. At least I have noother explanation why nobody seems to be able to see those two are the same person.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWell, there's nothing groundbreaking here. Basic solid comedy animation. I think the characters could have used a little more edge, but there's nothing missing in the animation department. Something I found really odd were the hamsters. Why do the look like.....that?\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt's no breaking news the opening song is catchy as hell. As far as I understood the lyrics, it also serves as a great introduction into the show and the main character. The ending is okay. The voice acting was solid all throughout, though I have to say Kirie stood out. Aimi Tanaka also did pretty well with Umarus different voices.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAfter the first episode I was convinced I would hate the Doma siblings. But Umaru showed some more depth throughout the run of this anime and I came to actually like her. Her brother...well, he developed not so much, but I didn't turn out to hate him either. The side characters are a lot of fun, there is nobody I really disliked. Ebina however could have become annoying if the anime was longer, as she didn't seem to develop in any way.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I already implied, I enjoyed Himouto Umaru-chan more than I thought I would at first. Not all the short stories ignite, but it never really gets boring. However, if they plan to make a sequel to this anime, I sure hope there will be more development in the characters or the dynamics. For this first(?) season, I am satisfied with what I got.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.8/10",

Every time I heard the ending song (in 2x mode, I might add) and could close out of my browser, the feeling was exhilarating. I did my math homework in the background of this show, and when I finished that, I'd do the math homework for the next night. Between references here and there, predictable recycled jokes, and the creators obviously struggling to make the characters \"relatable,\" this show was just plain bad.\r\nPlot - 1\r\nAgirl who is seemingly perfect around her friends, but a lazy, nagging, spoiled, good-for-nothing otaku when she's home with her brother. Seems like it'll be a fun, light-hearted slice-of-life, right? Maybe in the first 3 episodes, I'll give it that, but then it's just downright annoying. There's no plot development, Umaru doesn't change her obnoxious ways, the brother never does anything but give in, etc. etc. After episode 2, I didn't really manage to break even a smile, the comedy wasn't anything special, always relying on the main character to execute it in a predictable manner.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 2\\n\r\nAnnoyingly average art style, no really distinct features. I guess the colors are nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 4\\n\r\nOk, I think this is something you can at least kind-of agree to, regardless of your opinion on this anime. The sound was bad, not that bad, but you know what I mean. The OP was catchy, but nothing else was that striking. The ED was pretty bad. I'll give the sound a point because the seiyuus were fitting and the one that voiced Umaru was annoying enough to fit the bill, good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 1\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the characters, I'm not lying when I say that I wasn't sure whether the creators of this show were supposed to make me want to hate them or not. But they were each just as bland in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1\\n\r\nI can't count the number of times that I put the speed of this anime in 2x mode, or sometimes even 4x mode. So no, I did not enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 1\\n\r\nI wondered why I'd even bothered to keep going with this show. My friends sometimes call me a masochist, they might be right.

I really was expecting some fan service but we were clean after all, I'm actually glad they didn't include such emphasis, and hey, let's move to the bigger picture now.\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nWhile not exceptional, it really holds up to this kind of shows, the animation is not bad by any means. the character designs were on point, no excessive use of still imagery, so that'sa plus.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters (7.5/10):\\n\r\nThere aren't so many characters, to be honest, but for this short show, it does have some excuses, but, the characters that we have do differ a great deal, their personalities and even design is enough to distinguish them apart, but weirdly enough, there was a lack of character development for the main cast, in the other hand, side characters did change throughout the story, the likes of Ebina and Kirie.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (6/10):\\n\r\nAbsolutely nothing remarkable, vague even for a slice of life anime, the story doesn't progress, but then again it shouldn't, the score would have been much lower if it weren't for some serious moments every now and then, like the past between Taihei and that girl from his work...etc.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\\n\r\nYes, if there is something I absolutely adore in this show, is the adorable itself soundtracks, those little symphonies that play in the background ahhhh, man, it really adds in a big difference.\\n\r\nThe opening is very, very good, I can also say that it was one of the reasons I even stuck to this show in the first place, The ending while not very bad, does get familiar.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\\n\r\nI've had this on my to-watch-list for a very long tile now, and as any of the shows that are still collecting dust there to this very day, I was afraid that it would turn into a complete disappointment, but NO!!\\n\r\nLiterally, a very cheerful comedy slice of life, I mainly enjoyed the huge among of references, especially the \u201cOne Piece\u201d ones.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (7.6/10):\\n\r\nWould I recommend this? Not for everyone, It's for those people who had watched enough anime, read enough manga to be able to get that cheer among of references because honestly, the good part of the comedy in this show comes from the crazy references to other works.",

Perfect scores on every test and perfect social skills. At home, however, she turns into a a lazy, whiny gamer.\r\n-Taihei is Umaru's older brother who takes care of her. He's constantly annoyed with Umaru because she is always pestering Taihei to buy the latest video games for her. Taihei is also the only one earning the money for them to live.\r\n-Nana Ebina, the only person in the anime that has any sort of character whatsoever. She's shy, and fits the stereotype of \"Big breastedgirl is paranoid about people looking at her big breasts\" She also moved away from her home town, so she has to carefully think about what she says before she says it so that her accent doesn't slip.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is bland and generic. Not original at all. The music is also terrible.\\n\\n\r\nHere's a summary of every episode:\\n\r\n\"Onii-chan, buy me the video game\" \"no\" \"b-but Onii-chan, I want the video game\" \"no\" \"WAAAAAAAH\" \"OKAY HERE'S YOUR VIDEO GAME\"\\n\\n\r\nThere's no pay off at the end. You think that Umaru is going to reveal that she has this \"gamer\" side to her friends at the end. BUT SHE DOESN'T REVEAL IT AT THE END. It ends the exact way it started. The anime would also have you believe that at some point, Taihei would stand up to Umaru and not buy her the video game that she wants. WRONG. Taihei keeps buying her video games\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nThink Watamote, but instead of a top tier waifu girl who you root for the entire season, you have a whiny, bratty girl who will stop at NOTHING to get her video games. The anime gets stale after the second episode.\\n\\n",

Umaru-chan is about a girl named Umaru who is a princess while outside, but when she's in her secluded domain, she turns into a lazy, junk foodie who doesn't do anything but laze around and play video games all day. She has an older brother named Taihei who took her in when she was younger, and as she got comfortable living with him she slowly started to become more lazy. It's an interesting story that doesn't have many exciting things going on, and is mainly about the characters, but is nonetheless entertaining to watch.\r\nAs usual Art andSound is next. Usually these type of anime don't have a good OP or intriguing art-styles but this one delivers. The OP is addictive and fun to listen to and the art-style is no different. Both are great.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the characters and while this anime is very character driven, it doesn't do a bad job at delivering characters that are average. Let's start with Umaru. As I said before, she is, as the title of this anime says, two-faced. This is a problem. Umaru is too perfect for her own good. All of her classmates and even random people outside act as if she's a famous model while she doesn't do anything intriguing to promote such attitude with the people around her. This realization alone is the biggest reason this anime isn't as good as it could be. And the fact that she acts like a whiny baby when she doesn't get what she wants doesn't help. When talking about Umaru's friends, her friends are your average stereotypes you see in a bunch of other anime before this, but that doesn't mean that they aren't enjoyable to watch, it just diminishes the overall score toward this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall you have a good anime here, there's nothing special about it, it's just your average, fun anime. Is that a bad thing, no it's not at all. In the end this show is not for everyone. If you can bare the perfect character of Umaru, and bare the fact that most characters are what we have all seen before, but look past those and just enjoy the show as it is, then you should be able to give it a go. Don't let the bad reviews or the score of 7 deter you from watching this, you may enjoy something it has to offer.\\n",

            "content": "I remember watching Himouto! Umaru-chan when I was 11 and new to anime. I remember enjoying it. But looking back... It's just bad.\r\nThe biggest problem of this show is characters. To be fair, I don't think that having a frustrating character is bad on its own. If you know how to deal with it properly, it can be really good! But when the most infuriating person is a main character, something is wrong. \r\nUmaru is whiny and childish, always causing trouble for her older brother. And the worst part is that she doesn't have to deal with any consequences of her retarded behavior! She's stillthe prettiest, the smartest, basically a big Mary Sue. Even when she gets caught, she gets away with it. And she treats her big brother like a tool. It's a shame, he's my favorite character out of all this hot mess.\\n\r\nTaihei Doma is really warm and sweet. He cares about his little sister, despite her being an annoying brat. It may not be much, but it's realistic. I really like him for that. I think this show would be so much more interesting, if it all was from his perspective.\\n\r\nThe only character that was memorable enough for me to mention it was Sylphynford Tachibana. She was almost as annoying as Umaru, but she was a lot more bearable, mainly because she wasn't on-screen so often. Besides, she wasn't whiny, she was just sassy. \\n\\n\r\nI don't remember Tit's McGee and Umaru's fangirl having anything worth-noting in their personality, so I'll just skip them.\\n\\n\r\nThe story wasn't all that bad, it's just an average slice of life, after all. Nothing unique or worthwhile. If it wasn't about such an annoying person, it would be better.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything good about this show, it's surely the art style. I have to admit, Umaru is cute.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think that this show is so successful, besides its flaws, because it appeals to younger viewers and people new to anime. It was the case for me, after all.\\n",

            "content": "Before I watched Himouto, I read a couple of chapters from the manga a couple of months before the episode, and I knew that the anime would be great too. So was it?\r\n                                                      STORY\r\nThe story is rather simple. Umaru moves in with her brother, and she is a secret otaku. Although thatis the overall story, each episode is split into several different mini-stories that usually contain many laughs and parodies of Japanese culture. Speaking of parodies, there are a lot and you may come across many parodies throughout your time watching this anime. One parody that many people might not catch is that the famous Japanese department store Aeon is named Nyaon. Nya is the sound a cat makes in the Japanese language. Besides these things, don't expect to have a full blown story with plot elements. The parodies are what makes this show so great and I think many people will like The Grudge parody.\\n\\n\r\n                                              ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is typical of any shoujo anime, so don't expect any awesome cgi. I will say that I love how the characters are dressed and drawn and it really fits there personality. Whether Umaru is wearing her hamster hooded coat or her cute attire, it is fun to see how cute she really is. That brings up another good point. In my humble opinion, the Japanese have some bad fashion taste that I have seen so to see these anime characters dressed so nicely, it was another one of those special treats. \\n\\n\r\n                                             SOUND\\n\\n\r\nLet me start off by saying that the opening and ending theme songs are really great and whenever I think of Himouto! Umaru-chan anime, those are the first sounds to pop in my head. The OST is not that bad either, but don't expect a Clannad OST here. It's just your typical shoujo anime OST, except slightly better.\\n\\n\r\n                                              Characters\\n\\n\r\nThere are five main characters: Umaru (indoor and outdoor mode), Ebina-chan, Umaru's brother, Kirie-chan, and Tachibana. Each character has his or her own personality that I think people will rather adore. Some anime fans I know or at an impasse when it comes to Umaru. Some think she is selfish and stuck-up while others don't care and say it's part of the show. I, for one, like both personalities that Umaru presents to the anime. I, like everyone else, wish that her brother would put his foot down sometimes, though.\\n\\n\r\n                                           VERDICT/ENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Himouto! Umaru-chan and think that fans of comedy or the shoujo genre will like this anime too. My only real complaint is that I wish we would have seen more of Umaru's outside mode more because she is so freaking cute. Also, I think that we didn't get to see enough of Ebina-chan and Kirie-chan. Besides those two things, the anime was great and followed the manga panel by panel.",

            "content": "Eating Trash and Being Yourself: A Himouto! Umaru-chan Review\r\nOut of all the new things that came out of this summer anime season (2015) I must say; Himouto! Umaru-chan was probably my favorite. It earned that title certainly not out of awe inspiring animation, gut-busting comedic value or deep and concise storytelling, but from relate-able characters with relate-able anxieties, the light-hearted misadventures of which they bond over and the steady stream of otaku culture references that make me smile and think \u201cI get that\u201d. But before I get into any of that, just let me say this: Kirie is best girl.\r\nI mean, it\u2019s pretty obvious. Shegets anxious around others and becomes even more nervous when approaching them, unconsciously making glares which then turn away most of the people she so desperately wants to connect with. With all her quirks and mannerisms, she\u2019s easily the most endearing character in my mind. That being said, the other girls aren\u2019t too far behind her. Sylphyn has a funny name and an even funnier personality. She\u2019s very over the top and just wants to the very best at everything, like no one ever was. Ebina\u2019s very shy and self-conscious, and has really big boobs. It\u2019s pretty funny how they use this character trait of hers. Instead of making her just some underage sex object, they use her endowment as a reason for her crush on Umaru\u2019s brother, the only guy who doesn\u2019t seem to notice her huge bazongas. Some might argue this as just stupid while others may considered it brilliant. I myself would side with the latter. Anyway, Umaru\u2019s brother is the nice guy who just wants what\u2019s best for his himouto. Then there\u2019s Umaru: The conniving, garbage food loving, two-faced otaku/perfect girl that this showed is named after. She\u2019s fun and gets everything she wants, even if it takes childish, underhanded tactics to achieve those things. You know, pretending to cry to make her brother feel bad and stuff like that. She uses a perfect fa\u00e7ade to cover up the coked up, garbage eating monster that dwells beneath the hamster hood (and when I say \u201ccoked up\u201d, I am referring to the cola). But beneath that is a person who legitimately cares about her friends and is capable of selfless acts of kindness every once and a while.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, the characters are well conceived. How do I move on from here? There\u2019s, like, no transition here. Which kinda reminds me of how Himouto! Umaru-chan handles transitions. It doesn\u2019t. Just like other typical comedy shows, Himouto! Umaru-chan moves from one misadventure to the next. Which is okay, but the show does miss one thing when doing this. Resolutions. And I\u2019m not talking about one thousand and eighty pixels. I\u2019m talking about a punch line or a lesson to be learned, something to leave me with before we move on to the next thing. Sometimes the show does, but most often it just presents itself as \u201cSo that happened. Moving on\u201d. In that respect, I felt the writing could have been done a better job in making every moment count and leaving me laughing. But other than that, I felt the show did a fine job at slowly, but surely, developing Umaru into a decent human being.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a self-proclaimed \u201cdecent human being\u201d and I know that we \u201cdecent human beings\u201d like pop culture references. They make us feel all nice and smart when we understand them, and we can just shrug them off or google it if we don\u2019t. Basically what I\u2019m trying to say is: Himouto! Umaru-chan has pop culture references. Pop culture references are good. At least, I think so. Actually, what this show has is an abundant amount of otaku culture references (which some might argue is the popular culture, at least in Japan). The opening alone has parodies of Pok\u00e9mon, Mario Kart and Monster Hunter. Those are things I understand, and I like that.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I didn\u2019t like about the show was the animation. Well, it\u2019s not that I \u201cdidn\u2019t like it\u201d, per say, it\u2019s just that it was pretty basic. It had some creative choices here and there, like when Umaru went first person mode for a brief period in one scene, but other than that it was just alright. Which is okay, because they\u2019ll probably double down on the second season that I hope will come.",

            "content": "Let's put it this way, Umaru Chan was such a great show. Truly, it may be one of my top 5 contenders for the Anime of the year for me. All that aside know one thing, even if you DESPISE \"Slice of Life\" esc Anime, you need to give this one a shot. Outwardly, Umaru Chan looks like another slice of life Anime, with a younger sister and an older brother going through their everyday life (running through the brothers point of view). Though in many ways this can be true, it is buffered by the fact that Umaru herself, is a Otaku/Gamer/Food Junkie andchildish in personality, in stark contrast to her school life, where she is know as one of the most beautiful girls around her high school, always gets great grades, and is just a genuinely nice person. Kind of like a lot of us, and the show (in a lot of ways other than what was just mentioned) is highly relate able, as a Gamer/Anime fan, though this leads me to my one gripe with the show as a whole...\\n\\n\r\nTo put it out there, Umaru LOVES her home lifestyle. So much so, that she would rather lounge around play video games, and drink a lot, (and I mean a lot) of Cola, and not even bother to look outside or to go to the Beach, or really anything. And yet, she puts on a facade, this veil of \"Hey I am totally perfect and flawless, but that's all I am\". For example, one episode, Umaru decides to go to the arcade, but to do so, she disguises herself in a entirely new outfit, and takes on a much more quiet and quaint personality. WHY? Why does she feel that this NEEDS to be her persona? Is it because she wants to feel better about herself? It couldn't be, she doesn't need to. Maybe to hold a social image? But even that seems pointless, because she enjoys her lifestyle so much, that it really shouldn't bother her. As someone who used to have this problem, I used to think that I would be frowned upon for my interests, and looked at weird by my friends. But, even then, I just brought it up, and sure enough my friends were pleased to hear that I was enjoying myself, and many later started to enjoy the same things I did. To me, that doesn't seem too far fetched for Umaru and her friends, as her friends, really aren't exactly \"popular\" or perhaps better worded, Overfilling on the friends beverage. I can't imagine a even remote possibility were her friends would up and abandon her, especially for loving and appreciating her and her brother as much as they do. And on top of that, as an even bigger plot hole, why does she literally change the way her body looks? As of current, (and no, I haven't read the manga) there is no logical explanation as to why or how she morphs to her chibi form. And it is not just a viewer exclusive thing, the actual characters in the show can clearly tell that she is a small, and hyper girl, but cant ever tell that it is anything more than Umaru's little sister (A Cover Plan). Though I understand that the Manga may contain more detail as to why this occurs and who can see her like this, it is still no excuse to not include it in is's Anime adaption.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that said, all of the problems with the shows story, are quite frankly, irrelevant. Shocking as it is, Umaru Chan is by far one of the best slice of life Anime to come out in a long, long time. Episode to episode, the show remains hilariously relate able and entertaining, while also taking us through the big times of the year, and various experiences, as slice of life Anime should. And for that, I can push aside MASSIVE gaping plot holes until the next season of Umaru comes (if or ever, which I REALLY hope it does). If you are looking for an Anime that can give you a intriguing and amazing story, you won't find it here for sure. However, if it is entertainment and overall charm in a easily digestible episodic style you seek, Umaru Chan is by far the best place to go. And my favorite part of the show, aside from the hilarity and shocking moments of reliability, is that AMAZING opening. For once, the studio knew they had a good opening, they stuck with it, and REALLY nailed it. The tones and lyrics express the Anime very well, and the hyper overall song, with a subtle drop in the middle really reflects Umarus personality. To be totally honest, Umaru Chan's opening has to be one of my absolute favorites, of all the Anime I have seen. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts/TLDR: Umaru Chan is a great Anime and succeeds at what a \"Slice of Life\" Anime should, and more. Though it has massive plot holes, it is still worth the watch, and will be a delight for any Gamer/Anime fan.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, and there weren't any detailed negative reviews, so i felt i should atleast make one.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe story is basically just like a slice of life. Something happens, it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, reset. Some people like this kind of thing. I usually don't like them. This one grabbed my attention enough that i thought it would be good, but the story had little depth to it. Well, its a slice of life, so story isn't a big factor. I only gave it a 4 because the setup was good and a bit original.\r\nArt: 8\r\nProbably thebest, and maybe only good thing, about the show. The scenes are pretty, and look nice.  The Its detailed, very well done. I have to at least give credit to the animators for a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nI personally didn't like the OP. It wasn't my style, so i often skipped it. Overall, though, the music did set the tone well, and always matched the mood.  It was pretty average, not much to say. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nNow here is the thing that really makes me dislike this show. The characters don't develop at all. From beginning to end, they stay the same. No One character, Kirie, has very slight development, but its hard to notice as the whole change starts and finishes in one episode, like the first or second episode she is in. None of them have any motivations ether. Even the main character, Umaru, has no motivations whatsoever. Yes, she likes to watch anime and that is her thing. But why does she try to be so perfect at school? She has no reason. She is fine with being a slob in front of her brother, but at school? No. She doesn't even have that many friends, just one. Two by the end of the show (unless you count Sylphy, but she acts like more of a rival and only shows up in like, 1/3 of the episodes after she is introduced, which is the second episode). The show ends returning to the status quo. Umaru doesn't become nicer to her brother (even though several episodes make it seem like she wants to be). No one finds out about her secret (they basically use it as a joke that everyone is an idiot and doesn't notice), and she never ever gives us a reason to pretend she is a perfect girl at school. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nIt was somewhat enjoyable. Except for all the moments Umaru acts like and asshole and never has to answer for her actions, which happens about a million times an episode. Nothing more to say here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nThis show, really, is not a good show. If you are a shut in, and have no friends, you might like it because it lets you fantasize about what it would be like if you had friends who weren't also shut-ins like you. Maybe the reason i don't like it is because i'm not in that situation. But being unbiased, this show has nothing to go on. Compared to other slice of lifes i have watched, it is worse than some but not the worst, and nowhere near good. I would suggest staying away from this if you like story, closer, and characters that have to deal with the consequences of their actions. If you like shows for having tons of overly endowed women, a bunch of \"plot\", and all the fanservice you can imagine, possibly wrapped up with an unintelligent MC who gets into bad misunderstandings and gets slapped, i would also recommend staying away because it doesn't even have that. If you are unsatisfied with your life, watch a lot of anime, are possibly a weaboo, and like watching how anime otaku live their lives, then this is for you.  If all three of those descriptions match you, i am sorry for being a terrible generalizer ;(",

            "content": "U M R Hai U M R Hai. UMA Janai yo UMARU! Hai!\r\nThat was the intro of the opening Kakushin Teki Metamaruphose. Oh I have just shrunk in size. Wait a second let me transform back into the original me. \r\nOkay here we go. Let's not beat around the bush. Summer 2015 has been a rough season lately. Normally, Winter seasons and Summer seasons are always rough seasons for anime. \r\nSTORY (6):\r\nThe story follows Umaru with her brother Taihei who attend high school. Normally when Umaru goes home, she transformers to become a tiny person. Umaru is basically like Ant-man who transforms into a tinyperson. However, this is not an action anime. This is a romantic comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would say that I did enjoy some parts while others not so much. I did like the way how Taihei tried to be a good brother to Umaru and take good care of her. I also find the final episode when they get a car, it made me chuckle. \\n\\n\r\nThere were parts I thought that they could explore more on like why Umaru whenever she is indoors, she becomes tiny.  \\n\\n\r\nART (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good. Some subtle lip movements between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7):\\n\\n\r\nI did love the opening and ending song. The ending song is relaxing and I hope that I can listen to it day by day.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (6):\\n\\n\r\nEvery seiyuu did their best in their roles given. Especially Kirie Motoba who has frightening eyes just like Okapa from Plastic Nee-san. She is by far one of the most entertaining person in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nUmaru when she is tiny, she is adorable and her voice had some charm in her. She also did her role well. Although at times, I find her quite annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe brother Taihei was the most bland character, he was not charming or funny in anyway. He is just stoic. Although I did appreciate how Taihei was understanding towards Umaru.\\n\\n\r\nNana & Tachibana both didn't stood out to me in my opinion. But I did appreciate their character development with Umaru. However, to me they are bland as individuals.\\n\\n\r\nI also did like Sylphyn the character who opens up with Umaru in the future episodes even though they were rivals. However, her character was close to being an interesting character desu wa.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (6):\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a light-hearted comedy and just an anime to relax and have fun with, I would say give this anime a watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this anime didn't surprise me on how good this anime is and that there are more boring moments, I did appreciate a few moments and friendship moments.  And for that I give this anime a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "Boy, this show has been all over the place for quite some time as of now and oh my goodness, apparently, it is somewhat infamous. But you know what? I liked it, whether it's an unpopular opinion or not. Think whatever you want of my taste in anime, but if an anime is supposed to entertain and does it well, the least I can do is give it some credit.\r\nStory: 9/10.\r\nIt's very hard to rate slice of life objectively as this genre explores daily life in all its glory and it's never enough to start out as a funny show, it is important to stayfunny, and this show does that very well. This story is about a 16-year-old girl, Umaru, and her brother, Taihei. She is a bright and considerate student and everyone loves her. But when she comes home, she lets herself relax. But boy, what relaxation it is! Once she crosses the doorstep, she turns into a small lazy monster that doesn't want anything but anime, manga, games and snacks, lots and lots of snacks, much to her brother's disappointment (to say the least). Nothing new as the anime and manga industry has been making fun of the otaku and NEET culture for a while, but the way it is presented is silly, funny and the show does not take itself too seriously, which is why I consider it appealing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10.\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty simple and maybe it is not the best one I have ever seen, but let's not forget that comedies rarely rely on detailed and beautiful graphics and this type of cute yet simple art style is exactly what a show of this kind needs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10.\\n\r\nPlease, send help, the opening song is stuck in my head and refuses to leave. Overall, I have absolutely no complaints about thr soundtrack or the voice acting: voices fit characters well enough, the soundtrack does not ruin the atmosphere, even if it's not a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10.\\n\r\nThe main character, Umaru, seems to be the main reason why some people cannot stand this show. And, although I can see why they dislike her so much, I beg to differ as I believe that Umaru is supposed to be exaggerated and annoying. You can't help but wonder why and how Taihei manages to deal with such a lazy, needy and selfish sister. Umaru's infantile self is the very core of this show and, as I have already mentioned, her character is exaggerated for comedic purposes as we are expected watch this show and feel sorry for her brother. I like Umaru as a character (and in this particular setting), although I do not justify her actions.\\n\r\nNow, Taihei is the character that, perhaps, deserves to be disliked more than Umaru, but I do not hate him at all, even though I personally believe that he should be less of a doormat instead of tolerating his sister's behavior. He is the one we are supposed to feel sorry for (especially those of us who have siblings, I don't) and the voice of reason of this show. A pretty forgettable character and an easy target for Umaru with her silly shenanigans, but overall, he is okay, especially for a character that is the main source of Umaru's lulz.\\n\r\nUmaru's best friend, Ebina Nana, is the one I could hardly stand at the beginning because she is not just bad at socializing, she is horrible at it. In fact, she is horrible at pretty much... everything, which makes Umaru stand out even more. However, this girl has a pure and kind heart as she and Umaru genuinely care for one another and their friendship has no negative aspects whatsoever. She also helps us see that Umaru, despite her laziness, does have redeeming qualities, which is why Ebina is one of the most important minor characters in this show, just not my favorite one.\\n\r\nMy favorite minor character, however, is Tachibana Sylphinford. She is Umaru's self-proclaimed rival. At first she seems like a very annoying person who seeks attention for the sake of attention, but later on you discover that she actually enjoys taking part in competitions and is actually a nice person, just a really hyper-active and competitive one.\\n\r\nMotoba Kirie might need to see a doctor, I'm worried about this girl as she demonstrates some disturbing unhealthy tendencies throughout the show. Is she funny? Yes, she is as her attitude is explained by her shyness which makes her unable to befriend Umaru, a person she admires. The nature of her feelings remains somewhat vague as of now as she seems to have some sort of a crush on Umaru. It is not confirmed, but heavily implied and I don't think it can be misinterpreted.\\n\r\nTaihei's colleagues are quite interesting, in my opinion, but, unfortunately, they are not the main focus of the show and only appear sometimes, so there is not much to say about these guys.\\n\r\nEven though I didn't like (or didn't care for) some of the characters at first (and I even hated Ebina), I cannot say I have anything against any of the cast members now. All characters are in their places and none of them seem unnecessary or way too unimportant, so the cast is as solid as it can be in a comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10.\\n\r\nI laughed and I need more of this show. Does it inspire me to become a better person since I just so happen to see myself in Umaru at times? Perhaps, it does, but I am afraid I cannot give a clear answer to this question. It is a comedy and it is not trying to be more than that, it has little to no depth and character development is absent. However, unlike some of the shows that take themselves too seriously and, as a result, end up being ridiculous, Himouto is just an ordinary funny show, and that is the reason why I personally find it appealing.\\n\\n\r\nI keep seeing mixed reviews and I believe that there is no such thing as a right opinion, so whether you choose to watch this show or not (and whether you agree with me or not) is up to you. But here is a tip: don't overanalyze this show, it's not supposed to be taken seriously.",

Umaru-Chan).\r\nPros.\r\nPersonally, I really enjoyed it, this is very comfortable, but what exactly do I mean by the statement \"comfortable\".\r\nLet me describe, The animations were nicely drawn. There wasn't a lot of story, which makes it easier to watch for new people watching anime. \r\nThe characters are all easy made, you understood what all of them was like the first time you saw them, (kirie is an exception). \r\nThecharacters personalities are very nice, Bomber is fun and really just an awesome character. Umaru... are there even words to describe the cuteness of her Chibi form. Ebina most \"fan service\" but also cute.\\n\r\nSome few moments which had me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nCons.\\n\r\nCan get extremely boring.\\n\r\nIt feels like there is love between \"Ebina x Taihei\" Would really improve to an overall better story. Might come in season two!\\n\r\nBasically, the story is the worst thing in the anime!\\n\r\nSome of the characters are just way to predictable.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nBad story and somewhat predictable characters(not all of them)\\n\r\nCute feel towards every episode which makes you happy and enjoy it, also just love the chibi form of Umaru!\\n\r\nIt's weird because I enjoyed the characters but also felt like they were too simple.\\n\\n\r\n-Emil",

Oh boy, was I dissapointed. \r\nThe first thing that struck me was the girl itself, Umaru, who is all great and good at school, when at home she magically turned into a weeaboo-blob with zero characther traits other than she being a manipulative, selfish little shit. Then we have her brother, SubmessiveMcGee, and her two friends, Ebola-chan(Once you catch her,it's impossible to get rid of her <3)  and Tsundere no.1. (Ebina and Kirie.)\\n\r\nThe story basically goes around due to Umaru basically lying and manipulating everyone. That's all i can say. She even makes one of her best friends think the \"indoor-her\" is her little sister(!).\\n\r\nI can't say much more. The art is decent. Sound is okay. Characthers are bland, generic and predictable.

At first I was in love with the series, but then I kept watching in hopes that Umaru would get some character growth but she becomes excessive to deal with. How she treats her brother and doesn't get any consequences for her actions or behaviors is irritating to watch. I will admit there are moments where she's doable to watch her on screen. I think if she had gotten character growth to be a better person instead of aleech, my review for this series would be alot better.",

The really odd thing is there really could have been one but it seems that it was sacrificed in favor of repeatedly representing the otaku-ish antics of the main character, Umaru. Sure, you could give it the benefit of the doubt and say \"well it's a slice of life\" BUT at least other SOLs are more diverse. Each episode is almost literally the same thing with very little variation as time progresses (the only real variation being an increase ofa few characters in the show). But you'd think there'd be at least some explanation as to why Umaru had to be the one to develop a persona in public vs private.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nCan't complain much about this besides the fact that every character except Taihei, Umaru's brother, seems to have one specific expression on their face most of the time. I guess it's like, that specific expression exemplifies their personality or something. It's not terribly annoying but it's noticeable. \\n\\n\r\nSound/OST:\\n\r\nCatchy OP, never bothered to watch up to the ED at all honestly. I can't remember anything except the op though, it matches  umaru's \"true\" identity quite well, energetic and upbeat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIf you're looking for character development, don't look for it in this show. You'll know everyone's personality the first couple of times they show up. You'll know who is about to do what when they make a decision. Only Umaru hides her real one from the public but almost blows her cover a few times like a true himouto.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMeh. I have a terrible sense of humour so yeah, I giggled a few times. But this is a show you can skip ahead a few minutes of and know exactly what's going on. I wish I hadn't watched the whole thing though but I'm a sucker for cute bs. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDon't be like me and watch the whole thing. watch half of it and you'll get the gist of the show, then drop it.",

Her friends are all very likable tho a bit 1 dimensional. As a slice of life comedy, it is not boring or over the top and has a certain charm about it.

Umaru-chan, them either being negative or positive, mostly negative so I thought giving a different taste on the show will give a new perspective to the people who don't really like it. Now, what do I think of Himouto!? I think it's pretty good! It's very entertaining and funny with amazing voices for these types of characters. Now, why do I think it's entertaining? First off, it's about a Mary Sue out in public while at home she is a complete brat. It's not only interesting but very entertaining. The only thing Idon't really like about this concept is the big brother, [Taihei Doma] all he does is what Umaru wants, which gets kind of boring after a couple episodes and that brings the story down. Why doesn't Taihei do anything about it?  Sometimes you just want to yell at him for being so dull.\\n\r\nBesides Taihei being dull, the other characters work off of Umaru well, both Ebina, (the red head) Kirie, (the black haired girl) and Sylphinford (the blue hair girl) all act differently to who Umaru is, Ebina being Umaru's best friend,  Kirie being the shy girl in the back of the class, who socializes with young kids well [which is Umaru's chibi form,] and Sylphinford, Umaru's rival. \\n\r\nSure Umaru is a brat but if it's entertaining, funny, with wonderful characters, why does it have to be bad?",

Her character design is something to remember, but the story behind her show is nothing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't recommend this anime.

            "content": "This review contains my reflections on the aspects of Himouto! Umaru-chan that struck me most. It might be a bit unconventional but that's just what may make it interesting.\r\nLet's start this off by jumping in at the DEEP end.\r\nUmaru-chan is actually a show that contains some poignant messages. The main one being that it is okay to have niche hobbies and be passionate about them as long as the rest of your life isn't negatively affected by them. It's a modern illustration of the time-honored advice \"everything in moderation\". This may seem strange when talking about a show like Umaru-chan but just as the greatStoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius and Seneca taught us, Umaru-chan also shows us that moderation is key to living the good life.\\n\\n\r\nUmaru's level of obsession with her games, anime and lazing around when she's at home would seem excessive or even problematic to any random observer. People would think that such a person would have trouble functioning as a member of society. They would be concerned for Umaru's wellbeing and even think that the presence of such a person would be bad for society. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, in Umaru-chan's case she has her life under control. Her school-grades are top-tier and socially she's well adjusted and popular. When in public, she's the perfect member of society. For her, what she does is in perfect moderation and as a result we can see in the show that her life is smooth-sailing and happy. \\n\\n\r\nUmaru's brilliance is that she shows otaku/NEETs/hikki's who's life has somewhat gotten derailed that there is another way. You don't need to reject society to enjoy what you like or to live an unconventional lifestyle. The reality of life is also that you need society to survive and thrive. It's therefore preferable to be a respectable and upstanding citizen, both for your own wellbeing as that of the people around you and society as a whole. You can do whatever you want but don't let it consume you, this is the trap that many who reject society fall into. \\n\\n\r\nRejecting society, isolating yourself and indulging in what you enjoy most will not make you better off as you might think at first and Umaru knows this. Over time your greatest pleasures and joys can consume you if there's nothing to balance them out. Umaru's outside persona acts as that counterweight that prevents her himouto way of being from going off the deep end. \\n\\n\r\nUmaru has achieved perfect happiness and balance through the duality of extreme self-improvement and being the best she can possibly be on the one hand and on the other hand unapologetic indulgence in what she truly enjoys. Umaru herself is an allegory for how to lead a good happy life. She's therefore an inspiration and role-model to the viewer. With this I of course don't mean that people should try and emulate her literally. It's the concept she embodies that can be applied in your own life.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a scene in the anime that illustrates this balance of Umaru very well. In this segment Umaru fakes having a fever by playing a trick on the thermometer so she can skip school to stay at home and laze around. Although her plan succeeds and her onii-chan urges her to stay home for the day, the things that would normally amuse her seem different and she can't really enjoy herself. She feels like there's something off and feels guilty. Her himouto-side had gone too far, what she did was a dangerous precedent and could cause harm to herself and the people she cares about. In other words, the balance was disturbed. Umaru quickly realized her mistake and decided to go to school for the rest of the day, symbolizing the restoration of the balance. \\n\\n\r\nThe way the anime visually portrays her two ways of being almost as two different characters can be seen as a way to emphasize the balance, stability and strength that come forth from the duality of her existence. We might ask, why does she keep her two ways of being so separate? Why not show an Umaru that's both type of person at once? One reason is probably to drive down the above mentioned point about balance by showing such a stark contrast in character. Another is to show that keeping some things hidden from society is not necessarily a bad thing. It can even be a trait that points to being well adjusted in society. Umaru knows that her behavior at home could be negatively perceived by outsiders. Even though it doesn't cause negative consequences for her or anybody else. This is the way society can be, generalizations often lead to unjust judgments. Although the general judgment that excessive indulgement in pleasure is harmful is correct, the perception of what is \"excessive\" is highly subjective. It's therefore wise (for Umaru) to hide certain things from public or certain individuals to avoid misunderstandings that could come back to haunt you.\\n\\n\r\nAnother striking impression I got while watching Umaru-chan was the message that improving yourself to become the best possible person you can be is also the best way to (perhaps not even intentionally) be good to others.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show we see Umaru meet and befriend a small number of girls that end up very dear friends to her. Ebina-chan for example is a classmate of Umaru that has come alone from the countryside to go to school in the city. When Ebina-chan moves into her apartment she meets Umaru and her onii-chan who also live in the same apartment-block. They quickly get along and Umaru's presence becomes support for Ebina who knows nobody so far from home. \\n\\n\r\nNext we have Kirie-chan, a social outcast from Umaru's class. Kirie wants to be friends with umaru but can't because of her social anxiety. When Kirie-chan ends up on Umaru's doorstep through circumstances she meets Umaru in himouto-form. She however doesn't recognize Umaru and is led to believe that she met Umaru's sister. Through this meeting they end up becoming friends and from then on Kirie comes by often to hang out with Umaru in her apartment. This helps Kirie-chan to slowly gain some confidence and being friends with Umaru also makes a social outcast like her very happy. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least we have Tachibana Sylphinford (aka TSF). She's an ojou-sama type girl that initially always bothers Umaru at school by competing with her in literally everything. Umaru doesn't mind this though. When Umaru goes outside to compete in a gaming contest in disguise she is surprised to find TSF among the competitors. From then on they run into each other at other times (while umaru maintains her disguise) and Umaru discovers she has much in common with TSF. She also finds out that TSF seems kind of lonely in her hobbies. So Umaru and TSF meeting makes them both enjoy each others company and share their passions together. Slowly Umaru starts to see TSF as her friend and goes out of her way to have fun together.\\n\\n\r\nFrom these examples we see that Umaru is a force for good in these girls' lives without actively trying to be. If Umaru wouldn't have balanced her life (symbolized by her outside form) she would have never met these people and impacted their lives in such a positive way. It's because Umaru also works hard for and on herself outside of her himouto form that she can be good to others. And this also brings good back to Umaru herself. Because while Umaru-chan might be popular because of her seemingly perfect outside-persona, she didn't have any real friends. People that accept both sides of her and not only the seemingly flawless Umaru, are rare in her life. \\n\\n\r\nWhen different aspects of Umaru's secret self get out to her new friends she learns that she isn't rejected by them. Things about herself that she initially hid she can now show to her friends. Although most don't realize (yet) she's the same Umaru as the perfect outside Umaru, she learns that it is okay to open up to her friends about her hobbies and the things she likes. And this is what true friends are: people that care for you and accept you for who you are. Umaru's pursuit of a good and happy life for herself through a balanced life has brought not only life-joy to herself but also to others and even more, it has brought Umaru true friends.\\n\\n\r\nAs this is actually a full review and not merely an analysis, I want to touch upon some other aspects of the show too. As for the experience of watching an episode of Umaru-chan; it feels like a mix of slice of life with comedy. While there are certainly better examples of both genres, Umaru-chan's premise maintains a certain uniqueness that certainly entertains. Also contrary to some people's first impressions, this show is not about pandering to the audience. There's virtually no fanservice here. It's actually quite a wholesome show, both in what's visually shown on screen and the portrayed characters and their relations. \\n\\n\r\nThe walls of text written above may perhaps give the impression that Umaru-chan is a dramatic, deep and plot-heavy show but this is not the case at all. While there is a plot in Umaru-chan it won't be enough for people who are specifically looking for a plot driven show. Himouto! Umaru-chan is best described as lighthearted, fun, charming and occasionally moving.\\n\\n\r\nAlso worth remarking is that there are a few scenes in Umaru-chan that evoke a particularly strong awareness of the world and of being alive in the current moment. I was honestly surprised and taken aback because these scenes seem to come from seemingly nowhere and suddenly hit you. An example of this is when Umaru goes out at night to buy some cola in a convenience store. On her way back when walking along the dark deserted roads she remarks \"It's so silent, like the world is holding its breath.\". Experiencing such moments is rare and evoking them in people is not an easy feat. That Umaru-chan can evoke \"Mono no aware\" emotions is testament to the care and thought that the staff put into this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of this show deserves praise in my opinion. First of all, the ending song \"Hidamari Days\" is just beautiful and emotionally moving. The ending's lyrics in particular. Take these lines for example: \"Soon enough we'll bid childhood farewell, but even when that day comes, we'll always, always be the best of friends.\". I found these lyrics quite touching, especially combined with the music and in the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nUmaru-chan's soundtrack also didn't disappoint and has some great tracks. The OST is composed by Yasuhiro Misawa who has also composed the Yuru Yuri soundtracks. I like Yasuhiro's style of composing a lot. He uses relatively simple compositions that use a limited amount of instruments and have a strong rithm. This gives them a very \"clean\" or pure feel. Most importantly, the tracks evoke the right kind of mood well which is really what counts most in any show. Some tracks are also quite memorable and will get stuck in your head. TSF's character song \"TSF in Nippon\" is also very catchy, I recommend to check it out.\\n\\n\r\nMy final conclusion is that Himouto! Umaru-chan, while nothing groundbreaking, is an enjoyable anime that can teach you some important things if you pay attention and look beneath the surface. Personally, I'm very glad I watched this.

            "content": "In anime, anything can happen. Absolutely anything, you name it. In this case we're not talking about the intense \"this is messed up\" kind of stuff. No, no, we're talking about a split personality or two-faced. Welcome to Himotou! Umaru-chan (My two-faced little sister). Now, heres what I know. You usually get the 'geek/nerd' (otaku) and the popular \"perfect\" people. However, in this case we see a popular, beautiful, perfect girl who is also an otaku. Welcome to Umaru-chan's life, a perfect girl who eats chips and does nothing but watch anime, play games and read manga all day, while having her handy older brotherto do everything for her. The thing is, outside, nobody knows that she's a hardcore otaku, in fact, she keeps it a secret from everyone apart from her brother of course \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nDoma, Umaru (Umaru-chan) - The most perfect girl in every single way. In looks and personality. Whilst Umaru is outside of her home, we see her as the perfect girl she pretends to be. Everyone will stop and admire her stunning appearance as she walks by keeping her otaku self inside. On the outside, we only see Umaru hang out one friend. Well, for the first 4 episodes or so. Her friend is called Ebina, nana, and not even she knows what her friend really is. You might ask yourself, why? why does she want to hide the fact that she's an otaku?. Well, that's because being an otaku is not a good thing to be, I know a few people who thought it was but it really isn't, especially in Japan. You see it a lot of times in an anime where some of the characters deny being an otaku. When we see Umaru in her home, she changes into a chibi looking character with an extremely cute character type. She has huge tantrums at her older brother for simple things like, not buying her potato chips, cola, and in one episode, over manga. \\n\\n\r\nEbina, Nana - Ah yes, another beloved character which you just can not hate one single bit. Ebina is of course Umaru-chans best friend. She's friendly, shy, cute as hell and self-conscious but just a delight to be around. She came from a different part of Japan therefore has a different dialect, she gets very scared of letting it out, and that's another thing that makes her adorable. Surprisingly enough, even though she lives in the same apartment block as Umaru and her brother she has no idea about her secret. \\n\\n\r\nDoma, Taihei - Now, I don't know about you but...I was just begging for Taihei to notice how much Ebina-chan likes him. Even though she didn't say anything. Taihei is Umaru-chans older brother. He had already graduated school and is now working and taking care of his little sister. We get to see a little bit of his school life and friends in some parts of the episodes which I think was an amazing touch. He's a pretty simple guy and laid-back, but I wish he could find some kind of hobby just to make his character a little more interesting. \\n\\n\r\n.:May contain spoilers:.\\n\r\nKirie, Motoba - Last, but not least, we have Kirei. The first person to see Umaru-chan in her otaku chibi form. This character, in most scenes looks like a scary stalker, which she is a little. She is always caught staring at the outside Umaru-chan. But one day she happens to see her inner self when she goes over to her house. Of course Umaru falls into a panic and decides to call herself Umaru-chans little sister. So then, without knowing that this is the real Umaru-chan, Kirie falls in love with this small adorable otaku person. She happens to disliked Ebina-chan a lot as she sees her as a rival because Kirie admires the perfect side of Umaru-chan. She will never know that she has such a strong relationship with her, its a pity. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I think that this is a very enjoyable slice of life anime. They had taken a what could have been relatable character and turned it into something else which was more fun. The comedy is pretty good too, it throws in a few laughs. Although I have to admit, throughout the show, I was becoming rather jealous of Umaru-chan xD I think a lot of people can relate to that x) \\n\\n\r\nThanks for ready. Sorry about the long review C:",

            "content": "As I have seen that there are a lot of really bad reviews of Himouto out there, I decided to write one explaining why I thoroughly enjoyed the series - though I \u201conly\u201d gave it a 7.\r\nApart from all the nonsense and typical anime jokes there were things in the end that I convinced me this is actually a good series! Out of many reasons I liked about it I will pick out two that stuck with me. This review is also for people who already watched Himouto, but if you are unsure about whether you should watch it, I hope I can convince youto do so.\\n\\n\r\nHave your ever read an old Shakespeare comedy? If you haven't, you should. I you have, you will know that disguising as some other person plays a major role throughout these stories. A lord's daughter dresses up as a guy, a lord dresses up as a commoner...\\n\r\nIn Himouto we also have that element: the main character assumes different roles and acts differently in front of various people. Granted, they fail to realise who she really is. Many people may denounce this as a cheap, lazy and above all nonsensical plot device. But hey, Shakespeare got away with it over 400 years ago - the people loved it, it was great fun. So why should an anime that's primarily about providing nonsensical fun not be allowed to do it? I can admit that I really liked it and thought it was pretty cool when I noticed that Shakespeare connection - you can\u2019t beat sounding all educated and smart :D\\n\r\nSecondly, the feels. No, not the ones that make you cry in romance animes if you have a weak spot for that sort of thing. More like the relationship between the characters being shown in a subtle way through small gestures. Most negative reviews go on about how Umaru is this unlikable brat who acts awful towards her brother. I would argue that her extreme spoiledness is just for the sake of comedy (who\u2019d have thought :D). But - you will see her actual personality shining through quite a lot: she really cares about her brother! Notice how she cherishes presents he got for her or how upset she gets when something seems to be wrong with him. This is also the case for the relationships between the other characters. I'm not going to go into detail here but it\u2019s all very well made and will leave a smile on your face while also making you really care about them and their stories.\\n\r\nAt the end of the day it's not a perfect series but one well worth watching if you like comedy and slice of life animes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\ncatchy, perfect opening\\n\r\nboring ending\\n\r\nmusic throughout the episodes fits the story well, sometimes a little bland, some nice themes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\ngreat & cute animation of Chibi Umaruuu~ :D\\n\r\nNothing surprising, outstanding or special but still good\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nNothing new or exciting but very well executed with some nice ideas\\n\r\nComedy is not \u201crolling-on-the-floor-choking-from-laughter-level\u201d (for that, go watch prison school) but it will constantly put a smile on your face and really make you laugh from time to time\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI like! (except for that annoying, blue-haired, noble chick)",

Umaru-chan in a single word I would say it is just,\"adorable.\"However one word just cannot express the uniqueness and colourfulness of this anime.Along with being adorable and cute the anime is comical \r\nperhaps and bit childish but it is tons of fun.\r\n  The main character of the series,16 year old Doma, Umaru comes across as a likeable and relatable character right off the bat.Her cute and adorable character is enchanted when she expresses her childlike characteristics and overall she makes the show more fun to watch.She is relatable in the way that sheis a shut in,otaku (her ideas such as the perfect way to watch a movie with snacks is very relatable) however the twist in her character is that she is multi-talented and a top scorer in her class achieving full marks in every subject.These contradicting qualities of her make her one of the most unique characters in anime.\\n\r\n  There really isn't much main story in the anime but each episode has its own charm and each episode is certain to bring a smile to your face.The comical and cute sences are a pleasure to watch and are a lot of fun.\\n\r\n  Overall this anime os a great way to pass the time with enjoyment and laughter,I do recommend it for those espically interested in the slice of life genre.",

            "content": "Spoiler free\r\nA little tardy to the party with this review, since the hype surrounding it has died significantly in the past year. I tried to avoid this series, since nothing about it looked like it'd be appealing to me, but caved in and made stomached the entire series in a night. In a nutshell, I'd advise to just stay away from it altogether! I didn't hate the show as much as I thought, and at times I actually had fun with it, but I expected to give this a 0, so being slightly better than garbage doesn't warrant a positive recommendation. This is my firstreview and I don't really have a solid paragraph structure, but I felt I had a responsibility to warn people of this abomination and avoid this trap of an anime!\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is probably the sole reason I kept coming back for more punishment; it's just so damn catchy\\n\r\nEvery once in a while I'd have a laugh. \\n\r\nIt was cute for a moment.\\n\r\nClever metaphor, I think, of the ugly appearance representing her inner beauty.\\n\r\nWill make you laugh from time to time\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, outside of the OP, is one of the worst I've ever heard.\\n\r\nThe plot was non-existent, so don't expect any kind of compelling story here.\\n\r\nAfter recycling the same joke over and over again, the series fails spectacularly in recapturing any kind of fun that may have been present in the beginning, making the series sort of drag on.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is a collection of your typical, generic moe tropes with the added bonuses of being boring, one dimension, and generally unlikeable.\\n\r\nUmaru-chan herself, the short version, is just a complete piece of shit!\\n\r\nFor one thing, it's literally impossible to live the lifestyle she live; eating all junk food without getting fat, straight As without ever having to study, being awesome at sports without exercise, etc. \\n\r\nIf being unrealistic wasn't enough, she's also a total degenerate, showcasing arguably the shittiest personality in a human being. She's a manipulative, lazy, self-entitled, selfish, spoiled bitch.\\n\r\nUnrelatable and unlikeable, she's just every weeb's ultimate fantasy of being awesome at literally everything and having the world dote on them.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode made me wish I never started watching this nonsense. After hinting some sort of growth from the protagonist in a few eps prior, the show ends with her reverting to the same personality as the beginning. I probably shouldn't have gotten my hopes up thinking there would be some sort of payoff for sitting through this, but the finale was pretty much a huge slap in the face to its audience and I'm sure I've lost some IQ points by episode 12.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThere are some things to like here, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it to some extent.\\n\r\nIf you want to shut your brain off, like all the way off, then sure why not go ahead and watch it, you might like it too.\\n\r\nHowever, objectively speaking, this is one of the worst shows to ever come out.\\n\r\nPersonally I found some enjoyment in this, but that doesn't mean I'm willing to overlook the sea of flaws that this series is very obviously suffering from.\\n\r\nUltimately, this series is just a huge waste of time.\\n\r\nAvoid this trap!\\n\r\nYou've been warned",

There were times where something could have developed, but instead they would dive the topic for a little bit, drops it, and then goes onto another topic. (Probably explained that weird, but you know what I mean?) A better way to put it is Umaru doesn't seem to grow up. Although, that might be charming to some people. \r\nThe anime seemed kinda rushed which is understandable since it's only 12 episodes (Which isprobably why there isn't that much plot development)\\n\\n\r\nThis type of anime is more for laughs then plot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I actually found this anime quite entertaining.",

But nobody references that she has any illness at all (exceptin one episode where she has a cold)\\n\\n\r\n - EVERYONE looks at Umaru, and it is a little weird and creepy.\\n\\n\r\n - How can only the brother know about Umarus two personalities?\\n\\n\r\n - In the second to last episode, Umarus brother tells the audience about Umaru even though we already know it plus they did the exact same line on the FIRST episode\\n\\n\r\n - In one episode, Umarus brother gets lost and remembers her mom. I don't know why this was an episode cause that part had no effect on the show at all\\n\\n\r\n + Other than that, the episodes were good. \\n\\n\r\n + I really liked how Umaru has some rivals and strangers in her life that she becomes friends with in the end without it being too fast\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art:\\n\\n\r\n + Not much to say really. I like the art style and how they made the animation more of a comedic animation. But that's kind of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music:\\n\\n\r\n + I liked the OP, the ED was good I think. \\n\\n\r\n % The rest of the music set the tone of episodes but there was nothing I would listen to again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\\n\r\n - Ebina was the most one-sided and extremely shy characters I have seen. Everything she does is affected by her shyness. And she doesn't even feel like a real introvert. She was way too extreme about it. But she was cute \\n\\n\r\n + The rest were mostly good. Umaru was nice and cute sometimes but annoying as fuck sometimes. The girl with the blue hair was very over-the-top. The black haired girl was pretty creepy sometimes but I liked that about her cause she apparently didn't have friends before Umaru changed that, which makes her pretty socially incapable. Her brother was nice  \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n + I was actually pretty enjoyed watching this show. Apart from Umaru being annoying and many episodes feeling so long I was very amused.",

Could Umaru's indoor personality be explained by her brother's continued absence and work priorities? \r\n Like many anime, Himouto! tells us just as much by what is unsaid. There's a part in episode 8(the Christmas one) where Umaru notes that all her friends are most likely with their friends and families. A few seconds of silence pass and then the episode sort of moves on.\r\n Yes, it is meant to have us reflect on her brother but there is alsoa lingering, understated question: where are their parents? All we know is that they are rich and associated with some large company. Is Taihei destined to become emotionally and physically absent like them? Will he ever pursue his nascent dream of being a chef?\\n\\n\r\n Thus, this is an anime about emotional exile via work and, in Umaru's case, entertainment. It only in the finale that they are breifly emancipated from their respective addictions. This represents the contradictory nature of Japan- a land of escapism and eternal labor.\\n\\n\r\nOr maybe it's just another moe blob anime idfk.",

            "content": "Himouto! Umaru-chan is the epitome of living a chill life. I'm going to go into detail about why I like this anime. I feel like by watching this show, I've got a better understanding of what Japan's culture has to offer, and it all looks good to me, especially the food and ramen is one of my favorites.\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot is basically about a girl living in Japan who loves lazing around at home, and enjoying all the twenty-first century luxuries most of us in the developed world have. The show shows her home life and all the things you can do, from playing video games,to playing with your hamsters, to watching anime with a cola at your side. Seriously, that one episode with the different versions of herself in her head arguing what snack to eat was hilarious! Each episode can be watched stand-alone and the story will still make sense. Every episode is a mini-adventure through the fun activities Umaru does, which a lot of times is at home, and sometimes outdoors with her friends or shopping with her Onii-san. If you like slice-of-life anime, and still have a kid living inside you, you will probably like this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Umaru when she acts like a himouto is really funny because she's so little and that's fitting cause she acts just like a kid would. When she goes out she has that perfect, studious girl look that I like and she looks pretty when she acts refined like that.\\n\\n\r\nCan I just say that the food in this anime sometimes looks extremely appetizing? Seriously, looking at the close-up of ramen in episode seven with Umaru's descriptive narration over it sounded like a professional foodie and made my mouth water.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nEvery character felt very unique, and I appreciated them all.\\n\\n\r\nI like Umaru a lot. Umaru is excellent at describing the food she eats. She know the perfect combinations of snacks and it's fun to hear what she thinks is best with what. I think she opens a window into what you can do for fun just by staying at home. Even though she puts on a facade when she goes outside, she can still do things she likes, but just in disguise like as UMR when she goes to the arcade. I think it's cool how she has so many different personalities. She's really interesting and creative, because most of the time she wants to have fun and it's fun for me to see that and take notes from her book of how to have fun.\\n\\n\r\nI liked Ebina-chan. Umaru and Ebina are great because they're both really nice people, but Ebina is just so shy, it's funny. She is hesitant to ask for more food, state how much she likes the food she's eating, has a secret crush on Onii-chan. I liked when Ebina broke into her dialect sometimes, like when she was eating that tasty meal in episode two with Umaru and Onii-san. She felt even more personable when we saw the flashbacks of her home life, which was interesting to see because she used to live in such a rural setting. I could relate to her politeness and nice demeanor a lot, I think.\\n\\n\r\nKirie-chan was a little uncomfortable to watch, but that's what was entertaining. I can relate to the awkward character because I can imagine having those uncomfortable situations with strangers and even friends sometimes. I thought it was super funny when she made Komaru her master, even though it was really Umaru. She has an... interesting... relationship with her brother, but even so, I kind of wished it resolved more in the last episode. The comic relief with her hitting him was funny, but I still feel bad for Takeshi. There are some unanswered questions about her home life, but that's what you get with short animes like this. Definitely /not/ a bad character; she was a cute follower and admirer of Umaru, and it's a good quality to want to be attracted to someone who seems perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSylphyn felt overly competitive, but it was understandable because she needs someone to compete against since her family is prestigious and seemingly rich and expect a lot out of her. Syphyn became easier to like because she spontaneously wanted to go to an old-fashioned candy store in episode seven, and did I mention she likes video games? It's fun to see her compete with Umaru in everything because she always plays to win, and that's a good thing, to want victory. Definitely not my favorite character, but still she added more fun to the show, with her emphatic movements, and how expressive she was. Literally, the pupils of her eyes are shaped like stars, she sparkles with all her movements, and she talks a little differently from the rest of the cast, like for example she says \"indeed\" when she agrees with Umaru, which makes her unique.\\n\\n\r\nOnii-chan, or Taihei, was a good character too. I saw some reviewers call him a generic, regular guy, but he's really more than that. Yes, he is a Yes-man, and says yes to Umaru for most things she wants to buy and do, but he's genuinely caring for her too. He thinks critically about Umaru's well-being, like in the last episode taking advantage of her longing to go to the beach, and seeing it as an opportunity because she usually prefers to stay indoors. That's healthy and we as the audience should appreciate that. He's also a skillful cook. I remember one episode he made something healthy for Umaru, and she doesn't usually like greens, but he made it for dinner and she didn't eat much. That night Umaru asked for steak for lunch, and then he mixed in the greens with the steak and it was funny when Umaru noticed what he did when she was at school. How would you feel if your big brother mixed your favorite food, with something you don't like, but it's healthy? It's great that he wants Umaru to eat something better than potato chips in episode seven too, because it's healthier to eat a meal, not snacks. But I digress, Onii-chan is the epitome of a big brother who loves his younger sister unconditionally, and it's cool he has other skills, and also he works so hard! Like when he stayed overtime at work to help his friend Takeshi out, because Takeshi was slow at doing his work. Taihei has so many good qualities and lives out many virtues, and that's what makes him a great older brother to Umaru.\\n\\n\r\nI like that Umaru, Kirie-chan, and Sylphyn all have brothers, and it's touching to see when Syphyn has flashbacks to warm times with her brother. I think sometimes I feel bad for Ebina-chan, that she has no one else she's living with, and she's away from her family to attend school with Umaru, but I'm glad at least that she has her own hobbies like learning to cook, going shopping, and entering contests.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI love when they play that silly flute-like instrumentation over when Umaru's about to chow down on some yummy food, or when they're doing something silly. I like the music that plays when Umaru is with Sylphyn because it fits her personality so well. I like the nostalgic music that plays when they're UMR and Sylphyn are in the candy store. I like the piano music that plays when Taihei is telling Umaru to get ready for school. I think the music throughout the show sets the mood accurately, and just as important it sounds good. Whenever I go back and watch an episode, I can always remember the soundtrack, no outstanding melodies inside the episodes though.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the opening song because it always immerses you into Umaru's universe, which is fun and always a good time. She's a himouto, but still a likable character, especially if you can relate to her, and that's basically what the opening is about.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song is always a refreshing end to each episode, and especially fitting when you think about how it foreshadows the last episode when Umaru and all her friends are at the beach together. We get to see almost the whole cast and it's great to see them enjoying themselves on the beach. I'm glad the anime didn't end celebrating at home because that'd be not as good. Even Kirie has fun, which is nice because she's usually reserved.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really like watching this when I want to take a breather from schoolwork, or I'm just stressed out. This show has a lot of rewatch value because Umaru does all the things I would totally do in my free time, and a lot of times how Umaru feels and acts is relatable for me. It's because of this relatability, fun playing games at home, and enjoyment in eating food that /I/ can find pleasure in taking a break watching this show. It's really refreshing to see a character I can see myself in, and I wouldn't mind being friends with a real life Umaru. I wouldn't mind taking Taihei's role in buying her food and stuff like that. Yeah, she's lazy, but don't we all have those moments sometimes? She really is justified being that way at home because she performs well academically. I guess if you try to put yourself in Taihei's shoes, you wouldn't like to be nice to your bratty, lazy little sister, but that's all you certain people that are like that. I don't think I'd be like that, but I also don't have any younger siblings, so I can't say for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime plays with the nostalgia of being able to come home from high school and play games right away when I come home. Now that I'm older and attending secondary schooling it feels like I don't have as much time availability, but watching this reminds me of my golden age of lazing around, watching tv, playing video games, watching anime... And she got to do even more than I did, like reading manga\u2014she has her own manga collection and follows the shonen magazines!\u2014going out for ramen, going to arcades, and going to internet caf\u00e9s. Yes, she is privileged, but they're all duly deserved. She takes advantage of those privileges, and she's successful in school, so really there's no blaming her. This anime wasn't anything groundbreaking, but it was solid in storytelling and you can watch any one of the episodes as a standalone story which is something really great about it. The relatability really strikes a chord with me, and that's why it really isn't a bad anime either. I've got to say an anime that takes me back to my childhood deserves a good score, so that's what it gets.",

Like you have one storyline, commercial, then it changes gear to a whole new story line. Only in the end did they begin to explore some of the potential, but even then it wasn't much.

            "content": "This is a nice story about the perfect girl. She\u2019s beautiful and cute, and academically successful. While also having a nice personality towards everyone she knows. But when she gets home, she drops the act and shows her true colours.   (The Video Review is Up Here is the Written)\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nHimouto: Umaru-chan is slice of life comedy anime about a girl who  would be perfect on the surface. She has a nice personality, has good grades and is beautiful at the same time. But when she comes home, she is a complete trash monster. Meaning, she just likes to laze around allday, playing video games, looking at anime and manga and eating junk food, especially chips and cola. All doing this while wearing her iconic hamster hoody.\\n\\n\r\nNow although Umaru, is nice to everyone else, there is one person who knows her true personality and that is her brother Taihei. Usually how the story goes is that Umaru is doing something that really annoys Taihei, which forces him to do what Umaru does and so goes many enjoyable moments from the brother-sister duo. There is not really an overarching story throughout the whole show, its more broken down into segments. I\u2019m kind of disappointed in this, because there are moments in the anime, where they try to go through with a more story orientated plot, but by the end of the series, those story plots never really play another part. Like example, why is it only Taihei and Umaru, living together. Why does Umaru, act the way she does at school, compared to how she acts at home, and many more. It annoys me, because at times it would look like they\u2019re trying to progress the story, but they don\u2019t capitalize on it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nUmaru Doma, is our main character of the show. All gentle and nice on the surface, complete trash underneath. Wait a minute, she\u2019s an anime equivalent of me, well maybe not that extreme. Basically she has two personas. In her outdoor mode, she\u2019s a perfect role model student. In her indoor mode, she\u2019s going to be the most annoying little sister to you. Throughout the show, she\u2019ll consistently annoy her brother, and actually be nice whenever her friends are around. There is very little development with her character, as only at times, it\u2019ll look like she\u2019s questioning herself on why she puts on a fa\u00e7ade, but then comes back wanting to keep her identity a secret. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main character of the show is Umaru\u2019s older brother Taihei, who constantly puts up with her shenanigans. She is pretty much a nice guy, he can do pretty much do everything well. But he is a bit of a pushover, due to Umaru\u2019s bratty-ness always getting the best of him. For his development, same goes, he doesn\u2019t really have much development, as he just plays constant victim to Umaru and he\u2019s a bit oblivious too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast, same goes, there is rare development in any of them. But the main reason for that is, this is mostly a sketch show, and it\u2019s a slice of life, so don\u2019t expect too much. But all these characters are very likeable, because they remind us of us sometimes. Even though there isn\u2019t much development at least there is some signs of development, and the fact you can see when the characters start showing some care to the other characters once in a while. Some characters will be annoying to some people, due to the fact, they could remind you of someone you kind of hate.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 6/10, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style is rather light. Nothing is really detailed, and you can clearly see that when you look at some of food Umaru\u2019s eating or some of the games she\u2019s playing. Also there are some scenes that the animation doesn\u2019t match the action. Such as when Umaru\u2019s playing an FPS and she\u2019s just mashing buttons on the controller, but that\u2019s just me nit picking. Obviously one thing very noticeable is when Umaru\u2019s in her chibi mode. Now this not the change in art style, but this is more an actual disguise as no one, but her brother of course seems to recognize her. Of course when she\u2019s in her outdoor mode, she\u2019s all sparkly, representing the perfect girl. The art style and animation is really simple, nothing really stands out, besides Umaru\u2019s chibi mode and one scene, showing us the glory of how to watch a movie.\\n\\n\r\nFor the soundtrack, I\u2019m going to lie, it sounds like \u2018The Sims\u2019 when you\u2019re in build or buy mode. It\u2019s very upbeat and bouncy. Even though, I like the soundtrack, I feel like nothing really stands out. They re-use the same tracks quite often for a lot the scenes, so nothing really stands out for me. The opening is catchy, but not to the point it\u2019s really great. Same with the ending, it\u2019s mellow and slow, but nothing great. However I do like it that they go the voice actors the sing the opening and ending songs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite not having a progressive story, character development and a soundtrack that seems too oddly familiar, I found myself enjoying this show a lot because I can relate to the characters. They are all really likeable, and there are some very nice moments in the anime that\u2019ll leave you laughing or leave you heart warmth. Not once did I feel bored, while watching this show. Every character interaction brings a lot of fun unique dynamics the show and I had blast seeing how they react and interact with each other. It\u2019s also a show that makes you feel good, because it\u2019s really light-hearted and filled with great comedic timings. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story, I give it a 6. There is not really an overarching story and unfortunately, it felt like some stories were cut off early, which never went full circle. But I do love the concept, and how they build the world around the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound, I give them both a 6. The animation and art style is nothing special, it\u2019s really simplified with some pretty cool moments here and there. However I do like the changes in Umaru, because it really sticks out to show her both her sides. The soundtrack, sounds too familiar to be called original and also it doesn\u2019t really stick out, but\u2019s ok. The OP and ED are a little catchy.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, I give them a 6. All the characters don\u2019t really get that much development, if any at all. But I love their interactions with each other, because every moment with these characters are really entertaining. And they are very likeable as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor the my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 9. I love the light hearted nature of this anime and the comedy is good to as well. I like how it makes me feel at home, due to the fact I have characters I can really relate to. Not once was I bored watching this.\\n\\n\r\nFor the overall score, after rounding it up, I give Himouto: Umaru-Chan a 6.5/10. As for the quality of the anime, it\u2019s not really that great, it\u2019s just slightly above average. But by good, is it really entertaining and hits close to home. I recommend this anime for comedy lovers and for those, who think they live the life style of an otaku, you may feel at home as well.\\n",

The storyline is pretty average however - After episode 4-5 the story line starts to feel a bit recycled and even a bit boring at some point. It's still a lot of fun to watch, though. Except for the story there aren't much more negative things to say about himouto. The art is bright and colorful, the music fits and the characters are rich.

But unfortunately, it turned out later becamea limiting cage. Because when he tried to raise the kind of comedy that others, suchas excessive shyness Kirie, slapsticks of Sylphinford, or even delinquency Umaru itself, this anime as a sudden loss of creativity and havenever been able to provide a similar quality. Does not mean that the comedies were not at all effective, but despite the occasional still capable of laughter on several occasions, more often they are just going to go awaywithout leaving any impression. How can this anime to appear creative in one moment and tasted bland at other times? I have no idea.

And the characters are written very well with alot of depth, on par with evangelion in my opinion. Actual character development made this show even better as you can see the characters change from the first episode in how they interact with other characters.

            "content": "Himouto! Umaru-chan comes under the spectrum of anime which has absolutely no storyline,  wasn't that hard to animate, a soundtrack which is one dimensional with an opening theme which you either love or love to hate,  absolutely no character development yet seems to make you happy regardless.\r\nFirstly the soundtrack is basically the opening and the ending themes of which the opening theme managed to irritate me to the point where i didn't even finish listening to it for the first episode and proceeded to skip it for the rest of the series. I do know people who know it by heart , whichfrankly triggers me. The rest of the soundtrack is this trill which plays whenever something \"interesting\" is about to happen (you'll know what i mean if you watch this show)\\n\\n\r\nThe Artstyle of the show can be best explained through a single word -> Consistent. It's nothing great but at least its consistent , but then again you aren't watching this show for the art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is non existent, by the end of the series the characters are as they were when you started watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story is non-continuous with certain elements having some form of continuity over a certain period of time. The Story basically parodies the way japanese people look at otakus as something that isnt societally accepted through Umaru Doma, the titular perfect girl who's good at sports, studies, is pretty outside the house/ at school yet turns into a lazy otaku gamer when she's at home which is represented by her chibi form. The only person privy to this amazing turnaround in personality is her elder brother Taihei who has to deal with the various annoyingly humorous situations which his younger sister manages to get into. It features the standard stable of sidekicks who manage to leave no lasting impression whilst you're watching the show but then again you'll be constantly reminded of them through various gifs of this show which have become so popular (kudos to the Tachibana Sylphynford and Shaquille O Neal shoulder shake gif).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all i would say that if you have a younger sibling, certain elements of this comedy would appeal to you. It's a decent show with extremely repetitive comedic elements which do become stale after a certain point but provide laughs all the same. So watch this show if you have no expectations and just want some laughs.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Well, it failed completely. \r\nIt's so over the top with the cute stuff and basic jokes that the story itself doesn't even exist. Umaru is such an annoying character, I really can't even like her after watching some of the episodes of the anime. Probably suits better the audience between ages of 10 and 15, maybe.\r\nThought the animation was very good though, but not a strong enough reason tomake me watch the whole thing.",

            "content": "Huh, never thought D.W. from the PBS show Arthur would get her own anime.\r\nFrom all my years watching anime and stories in general, I have finally come to a conclusion. It is okay to make characters who are hated, in a way. Where would we be if Femto from Berserk did not elicit strong feelings during the sacrifice? Or a certain dad from Fullmetal Alchemist was actually as nice as he appears? Surely not everyone in a story can be equally liked, and some are downright detestable, which may serves the story well. It makes us root for a particular outcome, that of the Protagonistto achieve victory over the villain, versus apathy to the events going on. In fact,a strong feeling of hate may be more preferable to outright annoyance, from insignificant mascot tagalongs like Kon of Bleach, or for us Westerners, MINIONS. \\n\\n\r\nWhat am I am trying to say is, title character Umaru Doma is one of the most unjustifiably annoying characters I have seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut let us start with things one should know. Umaru is actually a 16 year old girl who switches between the chibi form you see on the cover and her teenage self, the general premise being that she is the perfect straight A+ student, rumored to be wealthy beyond imagination and engage in all sorts of things people like you and I can only begin to imagine, the draw being that in actuality, she just goes home and lazes about, her chibi form being a physical transformation signifying a sudden personality change.\\n\\n\r\nThis could be executed well, but....Umaru is insufferable, especially given the context of her actual age. I would be lenient on Umaru if she was actually 6, but she displays full capacity for thought regardless of form. Her most annoying acts and habits includes....\\n\\n\r\n-Lazing about and contributing nothing.\\n\r\n-Begging her brother Taihei, who is a hardworking salary man, to buy her several items upon getting home, such as her trademark cola, and throwing a temper tantrum when he expresses some reluctance.\\n\r\n-Her brother enables her to the point that he even does her homework at one point, despite holding a job himself to support them both.\\n\r\n-Not being useful when her brother was sick, but instead turning into a sobbing wreck over a minor cold that he had reminiscent of a child than a 16 year old High School student.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Umaru is just a bratty, self absorbed teenager who gets what she wants most of the time from her weak willed brother who doesn't know how to say \"No\". Taihei is the ultimate enabler, and Umaru takes advantage of that.\\n\\n\r\nThe final nail is the clueless nature of every other main character to discern that the Chibi Umaru is actually the grown Umaru, and apathy when they discover what a jerk she is to her brother. Normally, I wouldn't expect friends to weigh in on family dynamics, but having no one say anything in condemnation is aggravating, especially considering people like Ebina are infatuated enough with Taihei that it feels odd that no one has anger, or anything indicating discomfort.\\n\\n\r\nThe most aggravating is that Umaru had many opportunities to grow, and there were hints that she is having second thoughts, but for these 12 episodes, it goes back to status quo.\\n\\n\r\nSo to recapitulate, a main character who throws temper tantrums like a 6 year old while being 16 erstwhile contributing nothing, and it seems to provide a glorification of being a laze about Otaku without any social condemnation, except this time it is an accurate moniker to assign to Umaru, and utterly unrealistic for her to succeed at school given what we are shown, among other things. She did not appear to be a genius, and the whole concept of accomplishing without effort is the stuff of dreams.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the anime seems to be a fantasy asking one to relate to its character. Except I am an adult, and a productive member of society. I left this juvenile mindset a long time ago, and it is because of this juvenile mindset that the main character possesses and acts on with impunity, that I greatly dislike this show.\\n\\n\r\nIt is one think to have a jerk for a main character; it is another for no one, not even the writers, to acknowledge it, or even portray it in a good light. Especially at the behest of someone like Taihei who should have Umaru's interest at heart, but comes off as being whipped under Umaru's heel.\\n\\n\r\nThat is why I do not like Himouto! Umaru-Chan for the most part. Any good attributes of the show like Kirie or Tachibana are greatly overshadowed by Umaru's presence.\\n",
