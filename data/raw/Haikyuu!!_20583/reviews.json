            "content": "To be honest, I'm guilty of being biased and judgemental, and more than once to boot. A few years ago I had seen my friend's collection of Naruto manga. I scoffed and even teased him a bit, having seen what appeared to be ridiculous anime promos on TV aimed at children. Within a year, I had discovered anime and manga myself. I have since apologized. Then, a year ago in the fall FAL league, I found myself incredulous at how popular and highly praised the sequel to Kuroko no Basket was. Subsequently, I stumbled across a volleyball anime with what seemed to be an interestingpremise.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, I believe apologies are in order. I'm sorry, sports anime genre. I'm sorry I looked down on you. I'm sorry I didn't give you a shot sooner. I'm sorry I wrote off Kuroko no Basket and Yowamushi Pedal and the several other of the genre I have since added to my plan to watch list. If you want to give thanks for my change of heart, you need look no further than a wonderful little gem called Haikyuu!!\\n\\n\r\nQuickly becoming one of my favorite anime, Haikyuu!! was the show I looked forward to most each week. It is a well-rounded work that made every Sunday a little better. As today is the day it finished airing, I'm a bit surprised that more people haven't completed it and/or written reviews. Hoping to help others that may not have given Haikyuu!! a chance, here I am now expressing my humble opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from a Shounen Jump manga, the story could be boiled to to pretty typical shounen stereotypes. It contains an underdog, teamwork, perserverance, etc. However, in my opinion, Haikyuu!! integrates these themes incredibly well, and also sets itself apart from your run of the mill Jump product. The protagonists are relatively inexperienced and are far from being the best volleyball players out there. Crazy quick 'level up's don't exist, and you will find no inexplicable victories here. Instead, we receive a well crafted story with good pacing that follows the formation of the Karasuno to their foray into the high school volleyball circuit.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue people typically have with the shounen genre is flat, 2-dimensional characters that have little or poor development. I like to think this problem does not plague Haikyuu!! In fact, I'd say this is a strong point in relation to many other anime/manga. Haikyuu!! mainly focuses upon the exploits of the two main characters and the team as a whole, but does take the occasional detour to explore backstory, relationships, character development, comedic moments, and minor characters. That last item especially separates this show from the rest. A recurring theme throughout this sports anime is, not surprisingly, losing. I was very impressed with Haikyuu!! on how it depicts the emotions and point of view of nearly all minor characters, whether they appear again or not. For me, the level to which they were explored is rare among any story I've come across. On a side note, having not experienced not much from the sports genre, I am no authority on how others deal with losing games. However, subjectively, I think it handles the concept fantastically, and possibly better than the above-mentioned basketball and biking anime. It spends a fair amount of time presenting how the characters react and cope with loss.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as technical aspects go, Haikyuu!! does not disappoint. The artwork is clean and the animation fluid. Production I.G. did a wonderful job putting together a great visual work. In addition, the OST is superb. Personally, the background tracks helped set the scene and kept me emotionally invested throughout intense, comedic, and dramatic scenes. I cannot compliment the audio side of this anime enough with how well it worked. As a bonus, I fell in love with all of the openings and endings. Hopefully, you're as lucky as I was.\\n\\n\r\nI pray you give Haikyuu!! a chance. If you are new to the genre, this might be a gateway to a new horizon for you. If you have enjoyed sports anime before, Haikyuu!! will continue your enjoyment of the genre. Inevitably, this show is and will be compared to Production I.G.'s other sensation, Kuroko no Basket. In the interest of bipartisanship and brevity, I will simply say that the main difference is that Kuroko no Basket relies more on spectacle, whereas Haikyuu!! integrates more realism. Regardless of opinion, I believe that you will really enjoy Haikyuu!!and, quite possibly, like me you will be eagerly awaiting season 2.",

            "content": "Uh oh, I'm about to do something not many have done: bring up problems with Haikyuu! Disclaimer: I do play volleyball, so please understand where I'm coming from. \r\nDon't get me wrong, I liked Haikyuu! and will be watching the second season, but in this review I'm going to talk about what I didn't like because everyone else gushes over it. Remember, I did genuinely like it.\r\nWhen I first found out there was an anime about volleyball (and not only that, it was really popular and well-liked) I kind of got really excited and placed it near the top of my \"Plan to Watch\" list.I'm not quite sure what I expected, but this wasn't it. I had expected something intelligent, engaging, and meaningful, what I got was a typical shounen.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Story: 7[/b]\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the plot. Nothing really special about it. A band of unlikely heroes come together one year to form a volleyball team that just so happens to be really good, they set their goals to be in the Nationals, they go through certain hardships to get there only to come up short when they near their goal. But fear not! There is a second season! The plot was pretty generic sports anime for me. Not much else I can say about it.\\n\\n\r\nHere's where the problems I, personally, have begin. Everything feels dumbed down, like it was made for someone who knows absolutely nothing about volleyball to watch. Now I'm not saying \"You should only watch sports anime if you've played the sport\", on the contrary, in fact. But they shove down explanations of the most basic moves into your throat, even down to the second to last episode. They always try to mask it (by explaining to other people the rules), but they never do a good enough job at it. It should be implied that your viewer is smart enough to be able to pick up on certain things with the sport after watching, rather than having everything explained in crystal-clear clarity. Take [i]Ping Pong the Animation[/i] as an example. They lay everything out to you clearly, but don't tell you specifically what it is you're supposed to see. It's your job to figure it out. That's a smarter show with more subtlety and more respect for the viewer's intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nThere were so many weird volleyball technicalities. I didn't understand if volleyball in Japan was that different, or if Haikyuu just honestly thought nobody watching would know anything about volleyball so they could cheat a little? I tried to look up the rules for Japan, but could only find certain things, nothing decisive. Here are all the little, weird, things happened:\\n\\n\r\nKageyama is supposed to be a genius setter and yet he's never set a back-row attack up until this point? And he's never even attempted to do a jump-float? Those are things we learn to do in club volleyball when you're like 12. And it also seems like he never dumps despite it being an easy strategy to get 2-3 points per match (also, he's tall and can jump high, it'd be even easier for him than most).\\n\\n\r\nThey don't use any conventional terminology when being set. They just say \"set me\". This doesn't tell the setter how fast or where you want it. A Go ball, a Shoot set, and a 4 set are very different sets, but all to the same person. There's never any indication anything changes. They also have a position called an \"Ace\", which I have looked up, but cannot confirm to exist. I know that Japan has \"Wing Spikers\" instead of Outsides and Opposites, so no problems there, but I don't know if Ace actually exists. It seems to just mean their best player?\\n\\n\r\nHow is there always a triple or double block on every hit? Most of the time, you're lucky if you can get a double block on a outside hitter, but they get triple blocks, even on quicks! Even at the Olympic level they don't do that. And when every hitter goes up to hit the ball, they always hit straight down the line. I honestly saw 3-4 cross hits the entire series, no joke. They always hit straight, which leads to them getting blocked. Then when they do get blocked, they don't go \"Hey, next time roll/tip it over the block, put pressure on the back row to get that\", they just say \"[b][i]Hit it harder![/i][/b]\", like that's not how it works. They also never intentionally aim out so the other team accidentally blocks it straight down out of bounds, and they never wipe the ball off the block. There's never any strategy in their hits.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there's almost zero free balls (or \"chance ball!\") in the show. Even if it's a bad first dig, they somehow manage to get a full attack almost every single time. That's just not how it works. And one of the one times the opponent's had to just pass one over, everyone was downright amazed with how smart it was to pass it to the setter. That's not that clever at all. A common strategy to break teams with really good setters is to hit, pass, and block everything in their direction to either force them to have the libero set or to get them out of rotation to compensate for it. It's something almost every team of every skill level does, surely a team that has a chance to go to nationals would know this stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThis is more of a minor detail, but the portrayal of the females in this show was slightly derogatory. I'm not going to go full SJW and preach to you right now, but this stuff was kind of obvious. The females were all strung over the hotshot athletes, the female volleyball team was the weak and helpless team that needed the boys' team's strength to pick them back up after the loss, and all the explaining that got done to help the audience was 80% of the time done to some \"helpless and confused\" girl watching from the sidelines. Sure, the main girl (if you can even call her main) had some strength, but it was just stereotypical, shounen strength, nothing resembling a real personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Characters: 7[/b]\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest with you, I just absolutely couldn't stand Hinata, the MC. He was the stereotypical genuine, happy-go-lucky protagonist. His motivations were extremely one-dimensional and weak. You lose 1 game in Junior High to a good team while you have a shit team so you swear revenge for life? And that's your driving motivation for the rest of the series? To beat him in a 1-on-1? His personality was so bad. Every interaction he had with other people was a \"feel-good\" talk, something to pick another guy back up on his feet, which got really stale after about, hmmm, 2 episodes. This problem existed with lots of other characters as well. Interactions that just started with someone feeling down and ended with them magically being inspired again, after like 2 sentences. Super clich\u00e9, shounen nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nKageyama and Asahi were the only ones who went through any type of development (although Asahi's was condensed within about 4 episodes), which isn't [i]too[/i] big of a problem, if I actually liked any of the other character's personalities. Honestly, the only 2 I liked were Tsukishima (because he has the same kind of \"wtf are these people doing\" attitude I have) and Nishinoya because all liberos are cool.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Art/Animation: 9[/b]\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were definitely great all-around, but I did have some issues with them as well. For one, some character's necks were really long or really weird, which honestly made some characters look like literal dickheads (Oikawa I'm looking at you). Also, there were tons of reused and recycled animations. Because everyone hit line, all they had to do was switch the character who was \"receiving\" the ball and reuse the animation over and over. There was no variety with the hits so they cut corners on animation. I don't know if this was due to limited budget, but it was quite noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I do have to commend them on are the volleyballs themselves. They were well-detailed and looked almost exactly like the ones we use in real life, down to the little tiny ridge details on the ball.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound: 8[/b]\\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints, but I honestly don't think sound matters that much (unless it's awful or amazing).\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Personal Enjoyment: 7[/b]\\n\\n\r\nI genuinely did like this show and I will be watching the second season as it airs. I'm just confused as to why so many people heap praise upon this show. It's a good shounen, absolutely, but it's too much of a shounen. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review and if you have any feedback (positive or negative, I don't mind) feel free to message me.",

            "content": "The most important thing in a team sports is, without a doubt, the team. This holds especially true for volleyball. Having six talented players is all fine, but as long as they aren\u2019t a team and don\u2019t show team spirit, that talent is surely in vain. But what if it\u2019s the other way round; is it a surefire way to win when you have one team where not everyone is talented?\r\nNot really. But the chances are higher when there\u2019s one team, rather than six players.\r\nHaikyuu!!, or High Jump in English, is about Hinata and Kageyama, two players who originally stand at the opposite side ofthe volleyball net \u2013 plus are personality-wise polar opposites too -  and are, due to the fact that they attend the same high school, forced to work together. During that process, they learn the importance of a team and that you don\u2019t lose or win alone. The show eventually does focus on the entire Karasuno volleyball team (and on other teams too), but it\u2019s still obvious who the main characters are. \\n\r\nAs with most sports anime, the plot starts with Hinata and Kageyama meeting (and fighting), then joining the Karasuno volleyball team, and the team battling others all the way to the Inter-Highs. The volleyball aspects are well explained though and nicely weaved into dialogues. We learn about the libero when the libero appears. We learn about Quick As when Kageyama and Hinata perform a Quick A. There is no huge info dump in that manner; the viewer is pretty much spoonfed with information, one term explained at a time. The plot isn\u2019t very original and average at best, but to be fair, Haikyuu is an anime where it\u2019s more about the characters than the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about Haikyuu was the fact that the show doesn\u2019t rely on superpowers, even though it was somewhat unbelievable at some points. There is the fact that Kageyama can exactly pin-point where to toss the ball, for example, or Hinata jumping a felt hundred metres high. But except that, there are no laser beams emerging from the player\u2019s eyes, there is no \u201csuper saiyan\u201d-mode, nothing like that. And the best part is: Even the supporting cast thinks it\u2019s weird. They think it\u2019s weird when Kageyama perfectly tosses the ball to Hinata, who jumps a felt hundred metres high. They laugh when a character names his moves. I simply loved that because most sports anime tend to take those things for granted, which isn\u2019t realistic at all. \\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, Haikyuu lives off its characters. The first eleven episodes are about the main team, Karasuno, which helps the viewer to learn and love the boys one by one, as most are characterized well, have good interactions with each other and their motivations are shown too. Then the opposing teams and characters kick in. There is the \u201dfated rival\u201d Nekoma, who appears in three episodes and then vanishes into thin air with the promise to meet again in the Inter-Highs. There is Tokonami, the loser team, and Dateko, the team that caused the ace Asahi to have a volleyball trauma. But the only opposing team truly worth mentioning is Aoba Johsai which we get a lot to know of, as many of the players were once teammates or upperclassmen of Kageyama, but especially so Oikawa, who can be seen as the antagonist of Haikyuu. He gets such strong characterization and his motivations are laid out so well that it makes him easily one of the best characters in the series. Other characters who develop really well are Karasuno\u2019s Tanaka \u2013 who gets introduced as one of the comic relief characters in the beginning and gets fleshed out properly later on \u2013 as well as Nishinoya, who is introduced as a hot-blooded, loud character, but quickly turns to one of the pillars of the protagonist team. \\n\\n\r\nI wish I could say the same about Hinata, but sadly, that isn\u2019t true. While his motivations do get shown early in the series \u2013 as he is the main character \u2013 he still acts most of the time like a \u201cvolleyball Naruto\u201d; hotblooded, highly friends-focused and especially annoying in matches, when he screams \u201cBring it on!\u201d for the tenth time (even if it does get revealed that it has a reason why he screams that way). As for the other main character Kageyama, he certainly develops from the mean, oppressing attitude which brought him the nickname \u201cKing of the court\u201d (no, that\u2019s definitely not praise), to a person who learns to depend on others and to listen to them for once. I really like Haikyuu\u2019s cast, save one or two characters, and they make the show very good.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, as the studio behind the series is Production I.G, certainly does not disappoint. The scenes look crisp, the matches look fluid, and what I loved especially was, in some parts of the show, when the characters smash the ball \u2013 that was when the animation became a lot like a sketch and that was very impressive in my eyes. There is also a scene which was reminiscent to the Monogatari Series to me in Episode 21; when the vice-captain Sugawara wants to tell Kageyama to \u201cdo his best\u201d, but stops in the middle of the sentence and the plain text \u201cLet\u2019s win\u201d gets shown for two seconds. Sometimes the characters look off-model (especially the ones watching the game), and sometimes scenes are reused over and over again, but overall, it\u2019s certainly a visual feast.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, it always fits to the mood, and varies from electronic to straight up swing over rock; this applies to the opening and ending themes as well. A special mention belongs to the voice cast; there were many familiar and unfamiliar names, and all of them did a great job. All of them suit to their respective characters, but the one that shined the most was Oikawa\u2019s voice actor and my favourite, Namikawa Daisuke, who made Oikawa to the great antagonist that he is.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched Haikyuu on a weekly basis, I was looking forward to every next week, and loved every single episode. When I rewatched it once the show was over, I didn\u2019t enjoy it that much. I thought the events before the Inter-High (which starts in Episode 15) to be average at best. But after the Inter-High started, that was when my enjoyment had a peak, especially so in the last match, Karasuno vs Aoba Johsai. To me, that\u2019s when the series really evolves from the average sports anime to a great one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu\u2019s core theme is the team. It\u2019s about learning to trust each other when you\u2019re in a team, it\u2019s about winning and losing as a team, it\u2019s about overcoming obstacles as a team. For being that team-focused, Haikyuu really spends lots of its time for the viewer to get to know the team, and handles its characters with great care, even though the plot is by no means unique. It has great animation, a fitting sound and a wonderful voice cast. If you are debating whether or not to watch this, then don\u2019t hesitate and start Haikyuu. You won\u2019t regret it.\\n",

            "content": "So if you can tell from my score, I really freaking love this anime.  I have to preface this by saying, I am NOT a sports anime fan. It's one of the last genres I look to because I've disliked/dropped over 90% of the ones I've seen. So I'm incredibly biased.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story in Haikyuu! is what amazes me most possible. \r\nIt's all volleyball, volleyball, volleyball, yet I'm never tired of it (despite not being an avid volleyball fan). The relationships between the players develops in all aspects: the relationships between the players as friends, as teammates, as students in different school years, as acohesive team against other teams. In between is volleyball. At every corner is volleyball. This is literally a volleyball explosion. But you really see the story behind why the characters love it. How the love developed for them. How much of themselves and their past they've put into the game. What torment and triumph they feel from the sport. \\n\\n\r\nLike every other sports anime, Haikyuu! there are out of this world, impossible moves that even pros can't do. BUT I never feel that way. They don't drag it out or make it ridiculously over the top. It happens, then they move on with the game.\\n\\n\r\nIn sports anime, another thing I noticed that can drag a story down is when they try to work in explanations of how certain aspects of the sport works. Haiykuu! manages to work it in flawlessly. My knowledge of volleyball stops at the grade school level (where all we did was rotate, the positions weren't named, and players weren't allowed to even dive or roll). The explanations are short, to the point, and staggered. But now I know all the positions, the rules, the different types of moves, special attacks, formations, etc., without really realizing at the time I was being schooled on the subject.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single sports anime I've seen, I'm guilty of fast forwarding through games or matches or tournaments. Literally every one. I've never done it with Haikyuu! Not even when I rewatched the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is very good, a solid 8, but not the best ever. It really works to highlight the fluidity of movement throughout sports play. It's not over the top or excessive, so it's a bit quiet with how good it is. I think the best indication of how good the art is, is when you're looking at someone on the opposite side of the net, and the player is basically melding into the net, but it doesn't look weird at all. If you watch it, you'll get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nI also really like the character designs. The characters are drawn in the more realistic, life-like style vs. cartoon-like. This really adds to the game play; their muscles tensing, their movements, their presence. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is what gets me. It's really effective. Just like the art, it's not over the top. A certain sound happens and you know something is about to go down, like a cool move. A certain tune plays and you know you're about to see someone who is a worthy opponent. It really highlights the mood. Also the sports sounds, the squeak of shoes on a gym floor, the smack of the ball, even the sound of the ball slicing through the air makes everything more believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very good as well. The tones and nuances fit each character's personality. I can't say any examples without giving things away (because not all characters are introduced at the same time).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nHaiykuu! does a really good job of developing the characters. You know what each character's personality is like. What their role is on the court and on the team. Even the characters that are on the bench, you really feel it and connect with them even if they aren't the ones playing in the main match (i.e. their disappointment at not playing, their desire to be on the court, their feelings of support for their team).  \\n\\n\r\nIf someone does something hilarious or quirky, as the viewer you can easily think to yourself, \"that is SO like so-and-so to do that.\" \\n\\n\r\nYou really get a sense of the character's ability, athletically and emotionally.  their maturity levels (both mentally and sports-wise). Their tendencies and characteristics that make them, THEM.\\n\\n\r\nEven a lot of the teams they face, you can easily fall in love with the opposing players, because they make sure to develop them as well. This also makes matches much more interesting and makes you more emotionally invested in them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI personally love Haikyuu! to beyond the moon and back. I'm going to state it here, that this is the first time ever that I have liked an anime much more than the source manga it's adapted from.  I'm just being honest. If someone had told me to read Haikyuu! the manga, I would have eventually dropped it. I started reading it after I started watching the anime, and I'm only continuing because I'm so emotionally invested in the characters and want MORE!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime really brings the story to life.\\n\\n\r\nPlus the overall humor woven throughout the whole series, is an awesome bonus\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\r\nYeah, 10 out of 10. Again, this coming from someone who is not a sports anime fan. Or maybe I just hadn't been introduced to the right one, ehem, in order to see the light.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cSo long as I am here, you will be the strongest\u201d \u2013 Tobio Kageyama \r\n\u201cHaikyuu!!\u201d is one of the most successful shows in the 2014 season and is consistently well appreciated within the Anime community. Based on that face and that I\u2019m indeed a pretty big fan of the sport Volleyball, I\u2019ve decided to give Haikyuu a chance and I wasn\u2019t disappointed at all, in fact it beat all of my exceptions I had in this Series. \r\nI won\u2019t go any deeper in the synopsis, because I think it\u2019s already covered well enough by MAL. \r\nOverall the story itself is pretty solid and well executed,even though the Series has some rather dragged out episodes, especially at the end, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, in fact it provides more realistic development in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOne issue I\u2019ve already mentioned before is the pacing of the story. Sometimes it\u2019s really fast and a game is settled within about three minutes, when I actually wanted to see more of the match. The last match is dragged out for about four episodes, which wasn\u2019t really my cup of tea either. Other than that, I think the studio did a good job as far as the pacing goes. One thing that really amazed me is how well they executed all of the character and story dynamics in the training episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art is solid, but not really more than a solid 7 I think. I didn\u2019t like the character design at first, but I got used to it, as well as the sometimes a bit off pace Animation. One thing I was irritated at first is, that you can see the other player\u2019s face through the net, which I think they could\u2019ve executed better, but that definitely is moaning on a very high level. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked the Opening and the OST was solid as well, even though there unfortunately weren\u2019t too many memorable ones in there, if there was even one. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest strength of Haikyuu is definitely the characters, as well as their dynamics and interactions. While a Sports-Anime like \u201cKuroko no Basket\u201d rather focuses on the single players and their \u201csuperpowers\u201d, Haikyuu surely set an eye on the characters as a team, which was just perfect and way more realistic in my opinion. While there were definitely were characters, who are memorable as individuals (Kageyama, Nishinoya, Tanaka\u2026), I really enjoyed watching how the team grew together and how they worked together while training and playing. The development was superb as well, especially for an Anime about \"just\" Volleyball. \\n\\n\r\nAs you\u2019ve might already noticed, I enjoyed this show a great deal. While I was incredibly satisfied with the story and especially with the characters and their development, I could forget some of the mistakes Haiykuu made. \\n\\n\r\nIt was certainly not a perfect show by any means, but if you\u2019re into a decent story with a lot of development, light-hearted comedy which even got me several times, and/or you\u2019re enjoying Volleyball or simply Sports a great deal, I would recommend you to give Haikyuu a shot, I\u2019m sure you will love it as much as I do! \\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10)\\n\r\nArt/Animation (7/10)\\n\r\nSound (7.5/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.5/10)\\n",

            "content": "Bring on season 2.\r\nJumping out of the wreckage that is the Summer 2014 anime season, Haikyuu triumphantly spikes its nakama-drenched, bromance-filled volleyballs into the chaotic mess, pummeling its viewership with its unflappable spirit and verve. In a season where anime about intergalactic war (sort of), terrorism (not really), and rebellion (or bad politics or comedy or whatever the hell Akame ga Kill is supposed to be) compete to see who can be the very edgiest, it is with some surprise that I declare to you that an anime about volleyball has turned out to be one of the best anime of the season. \r\nThis showis nothing special on the surface; a hotheaded upstart and his outstandingly talented rival from middle school join their high school volleyball team and work together to help their team win a tournament. The details might be a little different, but the general template for the story has been used countless times in both anime and other media. So what makes this anime so damn enjoyable?\\n\\n\r\nWell, it\u2019s the execution. I\u2019ve long maintained that clich\u00e9s aren\u2019t a bad thing as long as they\u2019re well-executed, and Haikyuu delivers on this front. Characters are tropey, but very believable. The pacing is a bit slow, and the show drags a bit during the first half; however, the intensity picks up in the second half of the anime, when the InterHigh tournament starts. The matches are engaging and exhilarating. The frequent cliffhanger endings will leave you desperately wanting for more. Is it the most original plotline ever? Certainly not. Is it endearing, fun as all hell to watch, and convincing in its emotion? Absolutely.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this show is its characters. Haikyuu has a pretty large and fairly diverse cast, and many of the characters are well developed throughout the course of the show. Again, some of them are a bit tropey \u2013 Hinata is the standard high-strung shounen protagonist, Kageyama is his more serious counterpart and rival, Tanaka is comic relief, etc. \u2013 but they\u2019re all fun to watch and feel very human. Hinata, Kageyama, Sugawara, Daichi, and several others are given backstories and developed into well-rounded personalities, and the chemistry between them is astounding. It\u2019s not just the protagonists, either; several antagonists are developed in conjunction with the main cast, the most notable of which is probably Aoba Josai\u2019s setter, Oikawa, a character that you might actually find yourself rooting for at times because of how well he\u2019s developed. Certain characters could\u2019ve used more screentime, particularly Kiyoko, who we really don\u2019t see or hear much of at all; but with such a large cast this is to be expected, and surprisingly isn\u2019t that much of an issue. \\n\\n\r\nAnother great aspect of this show was its matches. I\u2019ve long complained about the abundance of horrendously slow battle scenes in a lot of shounen, but these matches are almost perfectly-paced. The rallies are dramatic, suspenseful, well-timed, and exciting. All the typical stuff, like the internal monologues and the speeches of teamwork and friendship and whatnot, are well handled and generally do not detract from the momentum and intensity of the on-court action; in fact, they frequently added to it. The matches are surprisingly grounded, though of course many pivotal moments are exaggerated for dramatic effect (Hinata's quicks, in particular). The episode endings are also handled really well. One of my biggest complaints with cliffhangers (I tend to complain a lot when it comes to anime\u2026) is that most of the time they tend to come off as cheap and uninspired by drawing out the episode unnecessarily to withhold vital information that they\u2019ll then give you in the next episode; Haikyuu does a much better job of delivering strong episode endings while still leaving the matches unfinished, and keeps you wanting for more. All in all, these matches are sure to leave you breathlessly entertained. \\n\\n\r\nNow, all that being said, the anime does have some issues. As great as the second half of the anime (when the InterHigh tournament, and consequently the matches, begin in earnest) is, the first half is slow and can test your patience at times. It\u2019s not bad \u2013 some of the episodes, especially the first one, are high quality \u2013 but overall, there is too much exposition, and the monologues dragged more often than not. The humor can also be hit-and-miss; depending on your tolerance for the exaggerated facial expressions and reactions common to anime humor (you know what I\u2019m talking about), it may wear on you. Overall, though, it\u2019s not really a huge deal, and many of you might end up enjoying it, which will only enrich the experience for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation, and direction are excellent, and given that Production I.G. is behind the wheel, this should come as no surprise. The artwork is very detailed and character designs are faithful to the original manga. The animation is fluid and the strength of the direction is evident in the matches. The voice acting is great, and the VAs do a top-notch job of conveying the fire and emotion of the characters without ever sounding too cheesy (okay, maybe a little cheesy, but the good kind of cheesy). The soundtrack is superb \u2013 I actually think that this is one of the best OSTs I\u2019ve heard in a while, and is probably one of the more underrated aspects of this anime. The BGM music in particular really helps make the matches that much more exciting. The music really is one of the biggest reasons I enjoyed this show, and the OST is definitely worth a listen on its own. The OP/EDs are pretty good, too.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was a blast, and being that this is only the second sports anime I\u2019ve ever seen, whenever someone asks me how to get into the sports genre, this is one of the first titles I\u2019ll be recommending. It\u2019s not the deepest or most original anime out there, and it does have a few hiccups, but it embodies so well the themes of teamwork, dedication, perseverance, overcoming the odds, and really everything else about the sports genre that we tend to pass off as hammy or overdone but appeals to most of us deep down. \\n\\n\r\nSo from all of us Haikyuu fans to you, IG, get on that season 2.\\n\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s a phrase that goes \u201cdynamite come in little packages\u201d. The meaning implies that someone who is small can achieve big accomplishments. Shoyo Hinata, the protagonist of the series is a perfect example of this. Standing no more than 6 feet tall but yet has a big heart, Hinata is someone filled with integrity. Witness the extraordinary journey that Hinata undertakes to prove the whole world his worth as a volleyball player. And believe me, it\u2019s worth it especially when it\u2019s someone named the \u201cUltimate Decoy\u201d. \r\nThe anime is based off the manga of the same name written by Haruichi Furudate. What started out asa one-shot transformed into a sports series that captures the very essence of volleyball. As a sport, volleyball tends to be one of the underrated activities when it comes to competition. While this may or may not be true coming from where you are, the sport hardly is ever seen in animation form. Haikyuu!! on the other hand takes concept of volleyball and chronicles it into a series of profound discovery.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sports show, most often or not, it involves competition. But to build from that, we have to start from scratch. Haikyuu!! does that essentially by creating a foundation for the sport and its competitors. While Hinata is the main protagonist, his teammates aren\u2019t left in the shadows. The story focuses them each individually and collectively as a team as they work their way on their journey. While not an easy one, the anime smoothly details their motivation and development. In fact, the story is relatively simple as it takes place in Junior High School, a setting perfect for growth. As a young boy, Hinata develops a fascination for volleyball after witnessing a national championship on TV. From that one single memorable moment leaves a profound memory in his mind. To put it simply, he wants to be like them and perhaps even win a championship himself. Beginning as a club but later capturing the attention of other fans as a resilient team, Hinata is what some people can describe as the hardcore underdog.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s true, the team starts in the beginning not being featured on national news like the one Hinata witnessed on TV. Instead, they work themselves up with training, willpower, and motivation. The teammates that Hinata works with have not only diverse personalities but also skillsets. This offers a decent amount of game-play as no match will feel the same coming from these players. But more importantly is how the team functions in unity. Because really, without teamwork, the game itself would be lost most indefinitely. Luckily, we witness most often the opposite of this as teamwork is skillfully indulged into the show. It creates inspiration, realism, and admiration towards Hinata\u2019s team. At the same time, Haikyuu goes to lengths to show how far they develop. Win, tie, or loss, each game fought takes every ounce of their sweat. By the end of the day, it\u2019s what they learned that matters. Well, we can\u2019t also forget about rivalries of course. In the sports world, there\u2019s always a bit of that that gives the birth to drama and personal pride.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Tobio Kageyama (aka the King of the Court), a first year at Karasuno High School. Playing as setter, he is the opposite of Hinata. A genius on the court with a cold attitude, Kageyama serves as Hinata\u2019s foil. And throughout the series, Hinata tries to desperately earn his respect by defeating him. Perhaps desperate might be the wrong word to use here though as the skill difference between the two is quite far-reaching, at least in the beginning anyways. Yet at the same time, Kageyama lacks something Hinata has and that\u2019s the motivation to work with others as a team. Kageyama is a lone wolf and prefers to do things on his own. That spells out a recipe for disaster when it comes to teamwork. However, the show takes advantage of this concept by building on Kageyama\u2019s weakness and mutates it into growth. It\u2019s not measured by height standards, but by connection as he learns the true value of teamwork. That my friends is something to appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of appreciation, the show also gives the other players a chance for spotlight. Characters such as the captain Daichi Sawamura, vice captain Koshi Sugawara, and ace Asahi Azumane are just a few that makes the presence known. Additionally, certain players get back stories to enhance their credibility in development. The most prominent relationship though is still Hinata and Kageyama. It\u2019s easy to notice them on the court because of their polar opposites. The series cleverly illustrate that through actions with dialogues, body language, and moves on the court. Collectively as well, it establishes the fact that Hinata seeks to earn respect from others by not just winning but also through his abilities. It\u2019s a team that will inspire hope and one the audience can find themselves easily rooting for. Ask yourself this: was there a time when something felt utterly hopeless but still fought until the very end? If you go down, go down swinging. Think Haikyuu!! next time as the prime factor.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s also impressive about this show isn\u2019t just the players or story but rather its style. Unlike certain shows where superhuman moves are adapted as a gimmick, Haikyuu!! retains its realism. There\u2019s no absurd movements that seems utterly impossible to pull off in the real life. Instead, Haikyuu!! dynamically feature moves that can be adapted with fine degree of realism. These include the dives, spikes, serves, passes, and among others that can be seen in a common volleyball game. Only here, Haikyuu!! doesn\u2019t push its buttons to outdo itself by incorporating inhuman moves like jumping 50 feet in the air. No, what you expect is what you will see and that\u2019s a solid foundation of what volleyball really is. It even focuses on the very roles the players are part of such as wing spiker, setter, libero, and outside/weakside/middle hitter.  In retrospect, the show will make you feel like you are also part of the game or even a player yourself because the moves that can be performed. Haikyuu!!\u2019s performance is also more just realism in this way as it fuses together teamwork and realism for a show you won\u2019t forget. \\n\\n\r\nBy all means though, Haikyuu!! is no perfect anime and it suffers from some flaws. The show can feel repetitive with the rivalry that may seem stale between Hinata and Kageyama. Their rivalry becomes less favorable as a plot device and can feel cheesy with their dialogues. Not to mention the fact that the story is predictable, their rivalry isn\u2019t so far off as well. Furthermore, the story can sometime feel a bit slow paced on numerous occasions. And speaking of occasions, there are also some clich\u00e9 factor and generics when it comes to gimmicks. The classic \u2018manager beauty\u2019 and intimidation from rival schools are a part of this. And although it is suitable for this type of show, it\u2019s been done over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is handled by Production IG, a studio that deserves praise for this adaptation. The character designs are smooth and in rhythm with the style of the show. Each of them matches their personalities and none of them stand out as Mr. Fan service just for showing off. Further testament of the strength for its animation is the game-play involved. Whether it\u2019s teamwork or individual play, the camera smoothly captures a fine degree of the players\u2019 movements. Nonetheless, it\u2019s not a surprise for the studio considering its experience with action scenes and noticeable staff involved. It\u2019s pure and solidifies its foundation of realism when it comes to the game. Even comedic scenes are humorous without trying diehard to appeal to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn\u2019t a powerhouse but is decent when it comes to execution. The OST has a well balance of intensity and calm moments. Whether on or off the court, the music retains its credibility to establish Haikyuu!!\u2019s style. Dramatic moments are also captured on screen with the music to make it feel and look real. As the OP and ED song goes, they have likeability with decent pacing. But on character voices, Hinata\u2019s mannerism might take a while to get used to. His squeaky voice can sound childish despite his intentions while his rival has the voice mannerism of an ego-centric. Ultimately though, it can be a mixed bag so better get yourself suited for it. On the other hand, a few noticeable OST will be memorable especially at some of the more significant games.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu!! takes the sport of volleyball and delivers it to the audience in more than just a profound way. It rides this epic journey not just by winning or losing games but with development of the characters. The riveting style the show delivers also expands more than just simple teamwork but how players come together through their experiences. And thanks to its realism, Haikyuu!! represents a superior sports show that people can find relatable. You don\u2019t need to be an athlete or familiar with volleyball to enjoy Haikyuu!! Instead, its rich realm of game-play and powerful animation will be enough to satisfy your needs. By the end of the day, you\u2019ll find yourself smiling and admiring this show like the way Hinata did for his hero.\\n",

            "content": "Teamwork. Talent. Hardwork. Friendship. Rivalry. Motivation. Pressure. Winning. Losing.\r\nThe realm of sports usually involve all of this, and needless to say, it was told brilliantly through Haikyuu. Unlike previous sports anime I've seen, Haikyuu remain grounded and down to Earth, despite the obvious impossibility of such talent in a Japanese high school setting. But hey, if you were ever watching anime for the uber realism of it, you're probably not in the right medium.\r\nThe story of Haikyuu is fairly straightforward but with a small unique feature. A high school volleyball team which was once a strong team is now slowly rebuilding. The team is joinedby 2 1st year students, Hinata Shoyo and Tobio Kageyama, who were originally rivals but now has to work together. As someone coming into a series without any knowledge of its adapted material or volleyball rules in general, I really had no idea what was in store. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, you will get obvious character archetypes and roles. Yes, you will get games that comes down to the last few points. Yes, you will get \"lucky\" plays. Yes, you will get problematic team mates. And finally, yes, you will get tons of bromance (#nohomo). But, that is sports. If you're watching a sports anime, these are all fundamental characteristics inherent to the genre. What truly elevates Haikyuu is creating a team with players that feel very real, despite their extraordinary talent or potential. There is a consistent dynamic relationship between team members, and progressive buildups that really showcase teamwork, hardwork, and all the motivation involved in these characters.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the characters have extremely high potential and ability. Kageyama and Hinata have almost an unlimited amount of potential and talent within them. And no doubt would there be some viewers who found that aspect unrealistic. However, their abilities never become the sole premise of the series. Unlike other sports anime that truly go all out on how supernatural the players have become, Haikyuu is rooted in its focus on the emotions and values that change over time in its lovable team members. Additionally, these players have obvious flaws in their characterization that usually limits their full potential. How can Hinata overcome inherent biases against his height and his lack of training? How does Kageyama finally learn essential values of trust and teamwork? So, while a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required, it shouldn't really take away just how brilliant Haikyuu showcases the challenges and achievements a team and its players can go through.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest aspect of Haikyuu is its careful consideration to just about every aspect of the sport. One of the most memorable scenes in the series was a short compilation of teams and players facing the effects of defeat and loss. In my viewing experience, this was rarely shared in a story, or even, generally speaking, in sports in general. Usually, a team faces loss as a ground for improvement. And that's about it. However, in Haikyuu, you really feel the intensity, the emotions, and truly, the psychological effects of losing. Losing isn't simply a means to an end. The present emotions are real, the loss is final, and the moments will be remembered. \\n\\n\r\nOn a much lighter note, Haikyuu also had comedic moments that felt like comedy relief, but it was incorporated seamless enough that it felt like comedy relief was something these characters would've wanted it as well. Another highlight of the series is the attention it gives to supplementary team members, which again, highlights the dynamic of teamwork. Everyone have a role, even if it's about being a player that can only come once in a game, or a team member that is shadowed by someone with greater talent. \\n\\n\r\nAdded to that, the sense of strategy involved in the beautiful game of volleyball also keeps each game interesting, but not overly analytical. Certain series definitely go way beyond in over analyzing plays that viewers can feel bogged down by how complex the game had gotten. Haikyuu, while strategic in many ways, also raises the important concept that sometimes, thinking too much will slow you down in a game that involves quick judgments and reflexes. In general, I believe the consistent touch of realism involved in an obviously extraordinary setting truly elevate the series forward as a whole. It keeps things relatedable, and you feel like you can truly experience the challenges and achievements the team will go through, even though it's just an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe one potential issue I had with the series, though, is how fast developments can be and the pacing in general. You will literally have players going through epiphanies after epiphanies in a single match. On one hand, it had to be that way due to the limited time given for a series. But on the other hand, sometimes it feels like it becomes so plot-driven, the desire to highlight developments, that it might cheapen the changes the character went through. For myself, I watched the series on a biweekly basis, so each development felt important in its own way and it didn't feel like I was desensitized with emotions. For someone who is marathoning Haikyuu, there will probably be a different opinion of the series. Additionally, the pacing through the beginning of the series after the initial two episodes can feel slow, despite necessary introductions to new members of the team and their ongoing developments.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of things like art, animation, and sound, I felt it was a complete package in terms of presentation. The manga-like art quality keeps the animation stylish, while not limiting it to feel simply like it was just a series of stilled images. Each character have some unique physical quality to them, and the art was simple, but not minimalistic enough to feel cheap. The animation can truly highlight the importance of a strategic or power play, and the music only adds to the overall atmosphere of the series. Perhaps I'm a bit too sensitive to music, but when the piano starts to play in an obvious emotional setting, I couldn't help but feel the same emotions the players go through. There are times where you really want to cheer for the team, and times where you want to comfort them. In general, the music, including the OP/ED seamlessly complement the series.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, I enjoyed immensely the first season of Haikyuu. I really hope a second season is coming, not really because I want them to eventually win a tournament, but just how invested I have become attached to the characters. Haikyuu truly embodies the concept of teamwork, hardwork, and the challenges and accomplishments of being in a sports team. As being one of the few anime, if not the only anime that was about volleyball, I honestly feel lucky to have this anime graced my viewing experience. Haikyuu is obviously not an anime everyone can enjoy. But even from someone who may not necessarily enjoy sports anime, as long as you're open-minded and wants to watch something that showcases character developments and group dynamics, Haikyuu can be a very enjoyable series. I'd even argue that someone might enjoy the series more if they didn't know much about volleyball. It's seriously that good.",

            "content": "I think this anime series had a perfect mix of it all.\r\nStory: (9)\r\nWhen you get past the first episode the real fun begins. The story is simple, but wouldn't most sports-anime be?\r\nThe episodes flow into a beautiful storyline in which the pace never become particular slow.\r\nAs this has been adapted from a manga and it is 25 episodes long against 120+ chapters there is more than enough material to make sure the pace is at its best and I think it is. The series ending is great considering future events in the manga.\r\nThe games keeps ones attention throughout it and there is no supernatural awesomepower that come into the game out of nowhere that is a deciding factor for the game (luckily) and the interaction between the characters is a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9)\\n\r\nThe art is  just as realistic as the story is, which is a great plus. \\n\r\nAn example of how the art is used is the ongoing symbolism between the team's/school's name \"Karasuno\" and being able to fly, and the execution of this is great. It only gets one anticipation to grow. It sometimes gave me goosebumbs, which is the highest score in my rules. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8)\\n\r\nThe cast chosen as voice actor did an excellent job. Hinata's voiceactor had this highpitched (excited) sound to its voice, while Kageyama's voice actor had a voice completely different from Hinata's. It suited them perfectly,. \\n\r\nAs for the music, it build and helps hold the attention during the matches without taking the spotlight, so shortly put, I think the asyncron sound (love that word) - the music, fitted just fine.\\n\r\nThe opening- and ending songs are also worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10)\\n\r\nThey are believeable. \\n\r\nthe characters are not invincible, they have hardships. \\n\r\nThe maincharacters are not the only ones to who get the attention, to get their story told, even the \"bad guys\" do to. We don't simply get to enjoy some games of volleyball but also the struggle the characters have to get to that point. (even if that is common enough in many sports-anime, but I think it is extremely well done in this one)\\n\r\nThe two main characters - Hinata and Kageyama, are as different as day and light. So even if alot of the characters struggle in the series - main- and supporting cast alike, it is not the same problems, and the characters themselves are vastly different. There is both a joker, a king, and a prince among the characters, which one will come to like for their differences (watching the series one will understand what I mean)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9) and overall score 9\\n\r\n- Realism: There is no extra powers or something else like in some sports-anime that gives it a supernatural edge (critic goes to Kuroko no Basket and Prince of Tennis, only a little to Major)\\n\r\n- The interaction between Hinata and Kageyama. If one cannot laugh at this, half of the enjoyment is cut of. also the other characthers is great to watch, althrough there is one characther who irritates me, but this one gets his story told later on in the manga, NOT the anime\\n\r\n- the  pace of the series. the flow is so natural, so I really think it is a serious plus for this series.\\n",

I knew I would like it but not the 'I'm going to marathon the entire thing in one night' type of like. \r\nI don't think there was a single character I didn't love. All of them are very well done. It's like you can grasp their personality straight from the beginning and they're all likable, even if some aren't the nicest.\r\nThis show was very inspiring. It made me want to play a sport and have a team to rely on. Haikyuu is just really encouragingby making you want to get up and do something. It's funny, refreshing, and you will feel those sad feelings when the team is depressed. But they never stay that way for long and before you know it, you're cheering along to another game!",

I was never really planning on writing a review on MAL, but I just feel compelled to share my thoughts on this breathtaking anime.\r\nStory [ 9/10 ]\r\nIt's everything you would expect in a sport anime, and more. It's a narrative about a school that was once successful, but is on its decline. Now the volleyball team has to rise back from it's grave. But what makes the story of Haikyuu!! stand out for me is how you get engrossed in the development of each character; you actually feel for them. Also, there are twist and turns here and there to keep you on yourtoes! \\n\\n\r\nArt [ 9/10 ]\\n\r\nStunning. The characters were drawn beautifully, facial expressions are on-point, and the in-game animation was choreographed perfectly. Each character has their own special feature so there's no confusion in distinguishing who is who. Only minor problem I noticed is that some shots were reused. \\n\\n\r\nSound [ 10/10 ]\\n\r\nI am absolutely in love with the sound of Haikyuu!! The voice actors did an amazing job really portraying the personality of each character. The OPs and EDs fit the anime very well and are enjoyable. The soundtrack, oh man the soundtrack... it compliments and enhances every scene perfectly; it really hit the feels. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter [ 10/10 ]\\n\r\nBy far my favoirte part about Haikyuu!! From the very first episode, you can already feel the amount of personality that is in this anime. You would expect typical stereotypes brewed into all the characters, but no. Every single character has there own unique personality. And although, they are all on the same journey to greatness, each character has there own back story that shaped them into who they are. You really feel for them and get immersed as soon as you start watching. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [ 11/10 ]\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, I extremely enjoyed Haikyuu!! I honestly was not expecting much from it because I thought it was just going to be another spots anime, but man was I wrong. Haikyuu!! is a rollercoaster of emotions that will have you laughing, crying, and cheering throughout the whole ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [ 10/10 ]\\n\r\nTruly a masterpiece... I would recommend Haikyuu!! to anyone, but especially to people who are fans of sports anime or looking to try one.",

            "content": "Haikyuu is a volleyball anime that tells a story of a not-gifted-in-terms-of-height freshmen high school student named Hinata Shoyo, who dreams to become the next \"little giant\" in volleyball. \r\nJust like any other sports anime, it tells a story of hope and dreams but one thing that sets it apart from other sports anime is the realistic nature of it. Without any supernatural moves like in Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu successfully make the characters' development as real as they can. Hinata's super fast reflexes, Tobio's monstrous tosses, and Nishinoya's great saves can be attain in real life with years of practice and dedication to thesport. \\n\\n\r\nWhat amazed me more than the other sports animes I've watched, Haikyuu delivers the message that nothing is impossible with great work and dedication like Hinata's height disadvantage, but nonetheless excels in the sport he truly loved. And the beautiful photo of what a captain really is, Daichi-kun! To never break down, to never lose hope, and to hold the team until the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that makes Haikyuu unique is the perfect display of volleyball as not only a mere sport but a fight that can only win with a connected team. Tobio character brings this message into light as he slowly learns himself to play as a team, not an individual and to trust his teammates in the game. He even had the best rival and the best partner he can ever wishes for, Hinata! \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu has also this special thing about it; that sets them apart and form a big gap among the other sports animes. Its a rarity for a sport animes to concentrate on the extra characters or those characters who are created merely to make the protagonist/s shine even more brightly. They even have a long part of expressing their regrets and their thoughts about losing, which made me cried a lot because I knew that feeling too well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Haikyuu is a emotional ride of tears, laughter, and frustration that you can feel from the characters, whether main character or extra-character. An anime where you can learn a lot and reflect a lot about your life. \\n\\n\r\n\"There must be thousands of guys in this country, whose last season gets cut short. Winning all the preliminaries and going on to the nationals. If all this were a work of fiction, those guys who go to the nationals would be the protagonists, and the rest of us would just be extras. But regardless, we got to play volleyball\" - Hayato Ikejiri",

            "content": "Alright, I'm going to preface this review by saying that this will for the most part be subjective, with only my final comments justifying why I believe Haikyuu is a 10. \r\nStory (10) : In comparison to the other sports anime I've watched ( KnB, Ippo, Prince of Tennis, Eyeshield, Diamond no Ace) Haikyuu does follow some of it's fellow shows in the genre but also manages to add subtle changes to cliche'd scenes. For another thing it's about freaking Volleyball, which before watching I always thought was lame. In sports anime pacing is a huge factor in determining whether it stands out amongothers, how close the win was, the build up to pivotal play etc. Haikyuu is a master in this regard. I remember being on the edge of my seat, literally sweating at three separate times in one ep during the match against Dateko. Without having any flashy superhero-like moves (looking at you KnB) Haikyuu manages to create countless badass moments while still being completely realistic. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9) : The OPs and EDs I felt were pretty good. I have rewatched the show three times (once while it was airing, and then twice afterwards) and I still sometimes like to watch the OP bc it's so good. (This part is subjective, but idk\u2026 it's pretty good) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter's (10) : All of the character's in Haikyuu, including enemy teams are well developed, and you can see the author put a lot of effort into creating the group dynamics of each team. There is a lot of depth as well as character development for every player on the Karasuno team, and if not for all there are definite hints about future development. I found all the character's to be  extremely lovable, relatable, and cool in their own way. When watching you often see the dialogue between char's in the background even when there are plot related conversations in the foreground. This brought a lot of replay value to the show, every time I re-watched it I picked on more of the smaller minute details that before I may a missed. I have seen this used in other anime as well, but with such a lovable cast Haikyuu's group dynamics never cease to make me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nArt/animation (9) : One of the main aspects of Haikyuu that makes it stand out in general as a anime is it's character design. The character's have rather pointed features that make them sometimes resemble lizards, and very interesting shades of colors. There are chars with different colored hair and eyes, like in many animes, but they have a mellow, almost pastel quality to them that is very distinct (look at Oikawa). I really feel in love with the art style, even though some of my friends have different opinions about this. The production company that made Haikyuu is the same as KnB which should be enough to say about the quality of the action scenes. The shots and movement of characters are very fluid, and make volleyball seem extremely badass. But I must admit, after watching the show 3 times I did notice certain moments where the quality faltered. But this was minor and they never skimped on the parts that mattered. \\n\\n\r\nFInal thoughts/ enjoyment (11) : I really enjoyed this show. I would tentatively say it's my favorite show of all time, definitely my favorite sports anime. Now I know a lot of you may be screaming, \"what about Ippo, or KnB\" and now I will address why I believe Haikyuu is better than them, at least in my opinion. FIrst of all I have watched both shows and while they were both great I have never rewatched Knb, and I have never finished Ippo (which says more about me but nonetheless). I think for me character's play a huge role in my desire to rewatch a show or continue it and Haikyuu definitely has some of my favorite characters.Once again the group dynamics of the team in Haikyuu are the most developed, natural, and hilarious I have seen in any sports anime. One of the parts I always never liked about KnB was the heavy focus on the two MCs, and while there were jokes scattered throughout the show they always seemed pretty standard/cliche to the genre. In Haikyuu the humor was so well integrated into the show that it felt like you were really there with the team and knew all of the inside jokes. I am on the shorter side, and always struggled in basketball because of that so I could easily relate and admire Hinata as a protagonist. The bonds the viewer creates to the characters also helps to heighten the joy when you see the team succeed or get over a hurdle, and the despair when they fall short of victory. For these reasons I would give Haikyuu a 10. I know I said this would be objective but I think I may be impossible. Anyways I would would highly suggest anyone, even if they aren't into sports or anime to watch this. \\n\\n\r\n**Extra side note about it's similarities to KnB: \\n\r\nWhile watching I saw many people would comment about how a lot of the characters' in both shows are similar in function to one another, (Kageyama- Kuroko and Taiga- Hinata) and in response I would say both shows do incorporate the idea that alone they are weak but combined they are awesome, but Haikyuu is much more of a niche. Without each other both players would not succeed nor grow half as much over the course of the show. Kuroko and Taiga could easily be on opposite teams and still flourish. For this reason I think Hinata and Kageyama make a much more interesting pair, playing-wise as well as character-wise.",

I ended up making a all nighter just to finish it. The characters are so well developed and alluring that I found myself almost screaming every time they succeeded or crying when they didn't. In contrast with many of the sports anime out there, Haykyuu is real. It shows the reality of training everyday, of victory and defeat. As a former athlete I could relate to all the experiencesmentioned in the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn my humble opinion the art is amazing. The way the movements flow is great, being volleyball a fast paced sport, the animators managed to show that quite well and without losing quality. Can't really say much more. It's that good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound works very well with the animation and the story, complementing the scenes that don't have any talking characters and adding to the dramatic or fanny moments. The openings and endings are catchy specially the first opening and the second ending! :D\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the show, I felt like I was in my competition days again. It's real and it's funny.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nHope that if you read this you'll give it a try.\\n\\n\r\n:D",

            "content": "In these past few years, there have been a lot of sport manga that have been emerging and are being adapted into anime for good reason. They are great, further justice can only be done to these sports manga if a good animation studio pick them up and Haikyuu was one of the very lucky ones to get picked up by a well-known studio \u201cProduction I.G\u201d. Haikyuu as a sports anime is amazing, thrilling and something that gives a blast from the past of my High-School life revolving around sports and science. \r\nHaikyuu is an anime about high school Volleyball. Now, I don\u2019t play volleyballmuch but watching this show makes me want to start playing. There is the passion of loving a sport, there is the sense of rivalry between team-mates and rival teams alike, the passion and encouragement of great teammates surrounding you and helping you get better every step of the way. There are obstacles to overcome your weakness and so on. You can refer to the synopsis if you want details about the shows plot but to be honest, I feel that if you just watch the first 1st episode you will be hooked and would want to go all the way to 25. \\n\\n\r\nAs an entertainment product, if you enjoy sports you will like this show. It has a well-developed story and it progresses nicely with a flow which is just about right. Animation is solid and I would recommend watching it in either 720p/1080p if you can. It\u2019s by no means perfect but it\u2019s good enough to do justice to the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of this show is really good. It fits the mood really nicely and the tone of some of the OST is very relaxing but also sometimes very intimidating and suspenseful. The animation studio does a really nice job in syncing it properly with the mood of the show which is why it\u2019s good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is extremely enjoyable (for me anyways). I would love to give it a 10/10 but the only problem is that it\u2019s not done yet. There is still much of the story left and I would love to see a second season for this show. As a side note, I personally don't understand why people have the concept of Shonen anime being all about power battles. There is more than one way of fighting a battle, it doesn't always have to be about landing punches and kicks. But that's just me... and with that I end this review. \\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 9/10",

            "content": "Short / Honest / Free of spoilers review\r\nI deliver a fast way to get an opinion about this anime!\r\nI'm not really a fan of sport anime, for one reason: its made in very similar structure and its easy to guess whats going to happen in plot. This anime makes no difference, but it has to offer something that i have rarely saw in other anime over all. \r\nWhat is great in most of sport anime? You get introduced to some type of sport and it shows how that sport works in pro world. Who could thought that volleyball is so complex and strategic ? Notme for sure. (unless some rules are made up, i hope not)\\n\\n\r\nSo what is so great about this anime and why should you watch it you may ask? Do you hate cardboard characters (boring, plane, and useless)? Well there are only few of them here and you won't even notice them. Great thing for sport anime which has a lot of characters. So you have pile of different, interesting characters who complete each other in some way. \\n\\n\r\nShow it self is really funny, but it can be sad, serious too if it wants to. You will notice that not only teams fights with each other, but single players will have inner conflicts and personal fights with other team members. Players evolving in the middle of the match, not only after and before games. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if my memory is not wrong, this is the first anime which shows how loosing team feels. (But wait reviewer dude, we saw that 100 times) Well only from protagonist perspective, but what about teams that lost to protagonist? This anime creates a wold and shows more, not only main characters. Dialogs get interrupted by random figures, you get to see what is going on in different places that has nothing to do with characters or plot. It makes this anime to feel alive, like a real place. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end i would recommend this anime for all. Even if you don't like sport anime, I think you could give it a shot. Its not the best thing you could watch, but it still is a fun/interesting way to spend your time.\\n\\n\r\n(I had even more stuff to talk about in this anime, but i wanted to make this review as short as possible, when most of review are like books some one needs to make a flyer. Joke! )",

            "content": "\u201cLa semplicit\u00e0 \u00e8 la suprema sofisticazione\u201d or, in english, \"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\", one of my favorite quotes from Leonardo Da Vinci.\r\n(Hi human! This \u201creview\u201d will cover the 3 seasons WITHOUT spoilers, sorry for my mediocre english)\r\nMy character development:\r\n2 WEEKS AGO: i don\u2019t get how people can write long parragraphs just about one anime, they are so good, i wouldn\u2019t find so much things to say.\r\n1 WEEK AGO: I would love to review this show! I have so much thoughts i want to express!\r\nHi! I have to say, this is my first review here, so if you want you can run away fromit AHAHAHAH. Really i don\u2019t mind if you won\u2019t read aaaall of this because it\u2019s boring, i wrote it especially for me (cathartic purposes). But PLEASE! Give this show a shot. PLEASE!! You won\u2019t regret it (hopefully). PLEASE!!!\\n\\n\r\n-STORY: 9/10 (AND MY OPINION ON THE SPORT GENRE LIMITATIONS)\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to lie to you, its Premise is cliche and not \u201coriginal\u201d. Actually, is the Apotheosis of Simplicity: basically an underdog tale. You all have watched something like this at least once, right? yes and No.\\n\r\nIt may be cliche, but i took some cinematography classes, so i\u2019m a strong believer (like, SUPER STRONG BELIEVER), that is for 90% the EXECUTION what makes a show/movie/whatever worth and great, not its premise. A theorically interesting premise can end up being shit, or vice-versa. So, i want to \u201cexplain\u201d why Haikyuu!!, despite having a cliche premise, not only succeeds, but excels (for me, obv) in its genre and in general too. The universe the story takes place in doesn\u2019t glorify volleyball, nobady is gaining Super Sayian power ups to make things more extraordinary than they need to be and the major climactic payoffs can be something as simple as \u201cone payer learning to block one smash\u201d. This may seem simple but Haikyuu proves itself with HOW it executes these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSport genre: who critices Haikyuu!! for being cliche and predictable, really doesn\u2019t get how HARD to execute is the sport genre. No lying, this might be worst genre to handle for a mangaka, because of hoy difficult it is to maintain it interesting for a long time, and particularly it\u2019s the work of a God regarding Haikyuu!! which is a fucking long-runner, meant to have hundreds of chapters. This genre has a lot of limitations and restrictions that other genres don\u2019t. The characters in Haikyuu can\u2019t travel around the world exploring new and interesting places like other genres do. It\u2019s really hard to draw a lot of volleyball matches and make every match look \u201cunique\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d from another, because the setting (field) is always the same and so are the volleyball possible moves. It must be hard for a mangaka not to be repetitive in drawing a large amount of matches, but matches can\u2019t be eliminated because the genre requires them.\\n\\n\r\nPredictability is not a flaw per se (unless this is a detective story), but it\u2019s better if something is surprising, right? Of course. Unfortunately, in the Sport Genre (long-runner) the predictability simply CAN\u2019T BE TOTALLY AVOIDED because of the genre.\\n\r\nPlease, think about it: if you make a show where the formula of one loss equals elimination, losing means no championship, and without it there is no show. So, it\u2019s near impossible for the protagonist team to lose because as i said before, if they do there is no show. You have to deal with it.\\n\\n\r\n!!!!!IN CONCLUSION!!!!!:\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s very difficult to create a TRUE sense of tension in this genre\u2026 BUT.\\n\r\nBut Haikyuu!! is actually able to provide an amazing feeling during the matches in a way that is utterly brilliant and makes it one of my favorites anime and piece of medium of all time.\\n\r\nHow does it? Haikyuu creates tension by GIVING THE OPPOSITE TEAM A REASON TO ROOT FOR THEM, breaking the cliched \"Protagonist/good \u2013 Antagonist/bad\" theme. Yes, Karasuno is favored team, but opposite teams aren\u2019t portrayed as mean and rude \u201cvillains\u201d bump in the road on the way to the top.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu gives them amazing traits, quirks and a decent development that once everything is reveald makes you question: \u201cWho I REALLY want to win?\u201d\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why Haikyuu stands out, it not only makes you care about the teams Karasuno is playing against, but this attachment creates a new sense of tension that it\u2019s alright and makes you forget about the almost inevitable defeat.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what i\u2019m trying to say is: the unavoidable trait of \u201cnever losing\u201d, nearly impossible to get rid of it, makes the sport genre an incredible difficult genre to create amazing tension in, BUT instead of doing the impossible eliminating this all together, Haikyuu puts this element in the farthest corner of your mind, and doing this means that Haikyuu is able to BREAK THE MOLD OF THE SPORTS GENRE.\\n\\n\r\nTHE RIGHT EXPLOITATION OF A LONG-TERM PLOTTING:\\n\r\nThings are casually shown or mentioned in earlier seasons that show up later and may even evolve into major events. It's a sort of quiet foreshadowing -- you see it as part of the current happenings and don't even realize how significant it will become in 30 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCOMEDY:\\n\r\nHonestly, it\u2019s hilarious. The perfect balance between comedy and \u201cdrama\u201d. The goofy moments never undercut the seriousness or break the tension. It was always a hit and rarely a miss.\\n\\n\r\nFun fact: i was in the bus watching one episode, the none of the characters did something and\u2026 i couldn\u2019t help but laugh HARD, bur REALLY. I usually laugh \u201cin the inside\u201d or i smile at best. It\u2019s so rare i actually LAUGH for fiction, but that time i couldn\u2019t really stop and everyone stared at me like i was crazy. One of the most awkward moment in my life :\u2019(\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTERS: 9.5/10 (My cinematography teacher was right: You DON\u2019T need complexity to be great)\\n\\n\r\n(Super small detail: Haikyuu has 0 (really ZERO) fanservice with sexism and sexualization. The female characters here are traited with RESPECT unlike the 99% of anime in existence where the girls are constantly portrayed with huge boobs that make other girls jealous of them. Strong positive.)\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a really lazy person, REALLY. I never liked sport, doing it or watching it. But THESE CHARACTERS are the reason why now i could accept to play some volleybal \u201cmatches\u201d for fun, instead of avoiding them. The characters, the author, the anime and the producers of it really love volleyball or at least respect it, and it shows a lot.\\n\\n\r\nMany times they accomplished to show and talk about volleyball stuff like roles and moves in a kinda poetic way that truly made me understand deeply the passion for this sport, and how is not the \u201csingle\u201d that matters the most, but the whole team.\\n\r\nAs i explained, the key here is wiritng characters that we GENUINELY CARE ABOUT, to the point where we become as passionate as they are for archieving their objectives.\\n\\n\r\nFinding characters compelling naturally makes us care about whatever they care about. So they are basically using empathy as a narrative tool. That\u2019s why ultimately the stake doesn\u2019t matter, if it\u2019s the fate of the universe or a simple game of volleyball. \\n\r\n\u201cStakes\u201d aren\u2019t proportioned by the magnitude of the \u201cdisaster\u201d, but by the importance of it in THE EYES OF THE CHARACTERS. There are many movies about distruction, but we just are disconnected from all the explosions because the characters don\u2019r care about (or maybe we don\u2019t care about them).\\n\\n\r\nBut WHY did we end up CARING about these characters to begin with?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe because they are endearing to watch (Hinita\u2019s enthusiasm, Kageyama\u2019s smugness\u2026), but this may be very subjective about which types of characters i like or not. So, is there something OBJECTIVE that explains why the majority of the viewers care about them? YES, there\u2019s an objective reason (i will explain it the art/animation section).\\n\\n\r\nJust like many other anime, Haikyuu has a semi-huge cast of secondary characters: the Karasuno players. But unlike most of the others, these characters are not underdeveloped. Actually, Haikyuu might have one of the most well-assorted and brilliantly handled cast of characters. They are not the most complicated or layered ever seen, but this has never been a requirement or a \u201cparameter\u201d to judge the quality of a piece of medium.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is, of course, special in some ways, BUT he is not the one who saves the day nor most talented one (and will never become). Is he good at volleyball or strong? \u2026Ehm. But he is necessary in a way that is masterfully handled by the author, despite him not being objectively \u201cstrong\u201d in a conventional way. But he is necessary for the team, and NOT ONLY HIM.\\n\r\nUsually, teammates are often forgotten or only used as pawns in sport shows, but in Haikyuu NO ONE IS LEFT OUT.\\n\r\nEach temmate in the cast is given a role, a strenght they build upon and grow as people because of, and most important, just like in real sport teams, they are all connected to each other.\\n\\n\r\nEach character is also given a good amount of personal development as well corresponding to the role on the team.\\n\r\nEVERY PLAYER has its own very moment to shine and show his ability, and, most important, every player is necessary for the victory.\\n\r\nAnd this happens not only with the protagonist team, but the ANTAGONIST TEAMS as well (Episodes 16 of S1 and 23/24 of S2 are the peak of it and true masterpieces). Also the \u201cmain\u201d antagonist (Oikawa) is a genuinely well-written character and it shows in the 2 seasons.\\n\r\nAlso, the interactions between the players of the protagonist team feel extremely genuine and realistic, but even better are the interactions between them and the antagonist teams: their personalities reflect in each other and thus creates interesting social situations or funny banters.\\n\r\nHaikyuu always keeps you interested merely because you see two sides of the story. You know the struggle and passion of both the protagonists AND the antagonists. The screentime of them is not given too minimal  to feel uninteresting and not given too much to where it feels overbearing. So, the protagonists success is even more rewarding and exciting when they beat someone with an equal amount of work and passion. This show and manga truly shows the importance of characters in a story. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters of course want to get better at volleyball but on top of that thay are also dealing with adolescence, expectations of each other and of themselves, self-esteem issues, school life and uncertainty of the future. CHARACTERS OF HAIKYUU DON\u2019T MERELY CHANGE, THEY GROW.\\n\r\nWhat is so damn impressive i show Haikyuu manages to give this meticulous traitement to a cast that spend the majority of time playing or talking about volleyball.\\n\r\nSo far Haikyuu has had 60 episodes and all of the characters still feel oddly fresh. That\u2019s because the show knows when to focus on which characters that way that everybody get the time they need to find their place within the narrative.\\n\r\nOf course writing and directing are both strong elements when it comes to crafting characters that we care about, but let\u2019s not forget that ANIME IS A VISUAL MEDIUM. Is there anything in Haikyuu\u2019s visuals that makes us care about the characters even more? YES.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: 11/10  (Very important FOR VALID STORYTELLING REASONS)\\n\\n\r\nWell, the show does a lot of different things with its visuals: the simplistic cartoony moments for comedic purposes, the \u201ci can\u2019t believe this is not an anime film\u201d levels of animation, and there are some visual metaphors too (crows).\\n\\n\r\nBut, what does Haikyuu do visually that is UNIQUE TO IT IN THE VISUAL PRESENTATION?\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER DESIGNS\\n\r\nThe style that they are drawn in really unique, they look different from every other anime which suffer from \u201cSame face Syndrome\u201d. Haikyuu\u2019s designs manage to look very distinct while still looking like anime characters. And\u2026\\n\\n\r\n-EXPRESSIONS (the most important thing)\\n\r\nFacial expressions in animation is one hell of a challenge.\\n\r\nUnlike real faces which have THOUSANDS of different details and lines, anime characters consist of just a few. This could called the \u201cSame Expression Syndrome\u201d. In anime, most of the times it just feels like there has been used templates for each emotion.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is: if you ask a hundred different people to smile, you don\u2019t get five different types of smiles, you get a HUNDRED. Every person looks slightly different when they express an emotion.\\n\r\nAnd Haikyuu has managed to showcase this in the animation. When Haikyuu\u2019s characters express an emotion it doesn\u2019t feel superficial or like it is drawn off of a template, it feels real! Like a REAL person is emoting something, like the expression is UNIQUE TO THEIR CHARACTERS, and that is INCREDIBLY ENDEARING. Distinct and believable facial expressions help selling a character\u2019s emotions (like Hinata\u2019s stare in episode 1).\\n\r\nThe expressions of Haikyuu\u2019s characters speak volumes of who they are and they make us remember them long after the game is over.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing to say, the sound is good and of course it makes the show better, but it\u2019s not an important aspect to me unless it is very good or very bad. Also, the voice acting\u2019s are just fantastic and \u201cgive life\u201d to the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION, ENJOYMENT: 11/10\\n\r\nThis might be the most enjoyable show i\u2019ve seen. And as i clearly explained (hopefully!), Haikyuu is a great show that makes you care about the characters for subjective but also objective reasons, that exploited animation and visual storytelling to present visual metaphors, and that has a \u201ccliche\u201d story with such a masterpiece of execution, despite all the limitation of the sport genre that i mentioned preaviously.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion this is an anime that should not be passed up, it is one of my most memorable shows for creating tension in innovative ways in a genre which i preaviously thought to be impossible, as well as making a diverse team where everyone has a role to play and feels like a genuine sports team. And this is why i recommend this show to literally everyone.\\n\r\nI know nobody will read this fucking long stream of consciousness, but somehow if you decided to watch this show because of my \u201creview\u201d (or whatever reason), feed me back, it\u2019s always a pleasure to share opinions about such a great and important (for me) piece of art.\\n\r\nP.S. I won\u2019t write reviews again, this was terribly exhausting ahahah",

            "content": "I had my reservations going into this one. I was just getting into sports anime at the time, and I came across this one looking for another great one to watch. The only image I saw of it beforehand was Hinata and Kageyama doing their setter and spiker poses in front of an orange and black backdrop. For some reason, my instincts were telling me that I really needed to watch this one, whilst the rest of me was questioning what was so good about volleyball anyway. \r\nI am really glad I have such great instincts, because this anime is a gem.\r\nFirst of all, youdon't need any prior knowledge of volleyball; Takeda-san, faculty advisor for Karasuno's volleyball team, acts as an audience surrogate. He knows basically next to nothing about volleyball when the anime begins, but slowly and surely he starts to learn and we learn alongside him; the positions, the rotations on the court, all the moves that setters, spikers and middle blockers perform. \\n\\n\r\nThe reoccurring theme amongst sports anime is that they push the sports to the side for a while and focus on characterisation. This, I believe, is why a lot of people relate more to sports anime than, say, actual sports. On television, when watching live-action sports, we know next to nothing about the players unless we do some hardcore research. In sports anime, you get acquainted and attached to all sorts of characters as you go on this journey with them.\\n\\n\r\nHere, we have our two focal characters; Hinata Shouyou and Kageyama Tobio, two volleyball fanatics on separate spectrums of ability; Hinata has amazing reflexes and an almost inhuman jumping ability, but his skills as a volleyball player are poor at best, but he aims to be the Ace of the team primarily given to a spiker. He's far removed from his full potential. And then there's Kageyama, a genius player who can basically play all positions with ease, and focuses his overwhelming talent on the setter position, which unifies the team. \\n\\n\r\nThese two are backed up by well-rounded characters on both their team and others, topped off with a coach that uses alcohol analogies to describe things to minors, a shy female manager that evokes the jealousy of those on opposite teams with male managers. Sometimes we only see minor characters for maybe one episode, but every single person that appears on screen has a personality, a back story that helps you connect to them. Characterisation is a strong point in Haikyuu!!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is really smooth, too! There are some parts where I just have to go back and watch it over and over because I am in love with how it looks. Admittedly I can only watch videos in 360p so I don't get to see the art at its best, but even at that quality you can really see the detail and the amount of care that went into every single frame. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is amazing too; especially the opening songs. I don't think I've skipped over them more than about twice, not counting the episodes I clicked on just to skip to my favourite parts. When the music kicks in, usually in a pivotal moment, you're on the edge of your seat waiting with bated breath to see what happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a solid 10/10. I caught up with the manga, so I cannot wait to see my favourite parts get animated in the second season which airs in October. Definitely one of the best sports anime out there!",

            "content": "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS \r\nFirst off, when i started watching this anime, I didn't expect much. Well i expected something but not really that much. I have a fondness for sports anime but i was quite hesitant to start this anime. I mean it's just volleyball, i don't even have the slightest interest in it how can i really relish it. Well, it turns out that i was erroneous. SO so wrong. It seems that i was watching a contender for Anime of the year. This anime is the type of anime to make you want to play the sport no matter how much you suckat it. This anime is the type to make you want to try out for your local team.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story was flawless. It began with Hinata and Kageyama not getting along, and when they finally bonded, then the bigger picture loomed: getting to nationals. The entire way there was filled with good plot. New characters that were introduced were actually well developed and fit into the story (not just randomly thrown in just because). The main characters had character development, the side characters had character development, everyone was getting character development.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is very, very elegant. It doesn't look half-done at all (which was the problem I had with a lot of sports animes) and the characters actually look different, instead of having all the same face but with different hair and eye color. (...) Some have sharp features, some have soft, and they're all built differently so they actually seem like a group of real people. \\n\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely the best part of the show. A good Op and ED is always something i appreciate in shows, but most of the times they come up short and i end up skipping them. That is not the case in Haikyuu, at least not for the ED. A pretty good OP and amazing ED makes this show even more of a bliss to watch. But the best part of the sound department is the OST. It's really good. I don't usually take to much notice to the background music in animes, but sometimes a show has some really outstanding tracks in the OST that just fits perfectly into the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, here's the aspect where Haikyuu!! particularly shines in compared to most other sports anime, or anime in general: its characters. Everyone is realistic and nonuniform. Hinata Shouyou, who would naturally seem like the never give up and naturally gifted character, is actually just a young boy who's really passionate about volleyball but has only subpar abilities (barring speed and jumping). Kageyama Tobio has exceptional characterization in that one would think he was the cold and aloof kind of person, especially with the rumors of being the \"King of the Court\". And yes, he did seem like a jerk in the beginning, but he turned out to just be someone who was merely misunderstood. He wasn't at all kingly. A little bit selfish, yes, but overall just an awkward, socially inept guy who's a genius at volleyball and just as passionate about it as Hinata. And no, he's not quiet and aloof at all. Far from it, actually. Naturally, these two end up meeting as rivals, and eventually they form a duo. It's at the formation of this duo, where Hinata is the \"light\" and Kageyama is the \"shadow,\" where Kageyama's characterization really develops, because you see him actually making an eventual effort to think of someone else (ie. Hinata) instead of himself.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I could talk about these two forever as well as the other amazing characters of Haikyuu, but in general, everyone is basically three dimensional and even the smallest background characters get backstories of some sort. It's hard to hate anyone because there isn't a reason to hate them. They're all just like people; they have their bad sides, but they have their good sides too. There isn't an \"evil\" team, and that's what's so amazing about it. Everyone just really wants to play volleyball, and sometimes, because all the characters are so lovable, it's surprisingly hard to pick who to root for sometimes!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was tremendously great, yet not perfect. Referring to animes such as Kuroko no basket or Free , and many more the plot had a similar feeling to it. In Kuroko no basket they lose and that\u2019s the end of the season, Free same thing, and for Haikyuu it was very predictable that the same concept would be applied in this situation. Now I haven\u2019t read the manga but my guess is for season two the come back and beat the previous school they lost to. But the plot had its positive sides, it had a ton of character development, a team that has great potential but don\u2019t start off too well, and most of all a great pace.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu was one of the year\u2019s best anime and one of the best sport animes of all time. It had a great story and everything more. Very little flaws which is expected because no anime is perfect. Character development was on point! You get to learn about every character and their weakness. No character is overpowered and ruins the show. Overall, I had a great time watching Haikyuu and even though i\u2019m not a big fan of volleyball this had me wanting to play in real life! Great anime, I recommend to anyone starting to watch sport animes.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cI may be small, but I can jump!\u201d - Shouyou Hinata\r\nOh no, Japan has gone and done it again.  I honestly didn't think it was possible to make an equivalent impact as Ping Pong the Animation in terms of intensity and inspiration within a sports anime, but Haikyuu! came awfully damn close.  Debuting in 2014, the same year as Ping Pong, this anime initially gave off the \u201ctypical sports\u201d aura to me, and I actually avoided it.  There's so many out there these days, it can be hard to distinguish yourself, but for relatively rookie director Susumu Mitsunaka, he nailed it.Haikyuu! is an intricately crafted, intense and motivational story about high school students maturing and finding themselves through the medium of volleyball.  The art style is crisp and the characters are endearing, making Haikyuu! that much more enjoyable overall.  I agree that while some could be quick to give it a 10, I will refrain due to some minor issues I had with the series.  On with the review.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story in this anime focuses around Shouyou Hinata and initial rival player, Tobio Kageyama.  The two first meet at Hinata's first and last middle school match, in which he finally convinces enough of his friends to enter a tournament with him.  They are completely overwhelmed by Kageyama's team, but more importantly, Hinata gets a taste of what playing volleyball in a real tournament atmosphere is all about.  He was inspired and motivated to play the sport by watching the success story of Karasuno High School's \u201cLittle Giant\u201d during a spring tournament in Tokyo.  It gave Hinata real hope that someone of his size could eventually prosper in the sport, normally dominated by those of taller stature.  More importantly, Kageyama takes notice of Hinata's spunk and stamina, and the two become overnight rivals as a result.  Hinata wants to grow as a volleyball player and one day surpass Kageyama's skill.  I thought this intro was written very well, and although Hinata's first tournament ended almost as soon as it started, it gave you real insight into his energetic personality.  It also gave the viewers  glimpse of Kageyama's raw skill on the court.  The plot unfolds as the two enter high school, ironically on the same volleyball team, but for very different reasons.  Many teammates have difficulty playing to Kageyama's tempo, and as a result have disowned him, whereas Hinata went to Karasuno to follow in the footsteps of his idol.  The look on their faces when they realized they were now teammates was pure gold.  That whole scene was executed beautifully.  The rest of their volleyball team is broken, but through seeing Hinata and Kageyama's awkward, but unique cohesion, the team begins to form around them in an effort to catapult Karasuno back to their former glory.    \\n\\n\r\nWhere Haikyuu! really stood out to me in terms of story was balancing the wins and the losses.  There are too many anime that take the overpowered approach, where you know the main characters are going to come out on top every time (No Game No Life/Sword Art Online for example).  When the characters end up losing matches, you truly FEEL the heartache they have.  The intensity of each scene leading up to the match point is raw and believable.  Anyone who's played sports competitively can relate to the plethora of emotions you can feel during a match... and just how quickly the tides can change in the race to victory.  From what I understand, this anime was adapted quite well from the manga too, giving great credit to the source material.  The pacing alternates throughout the series, but I can say that although slow, the pacing of the last match in the anime was incredible and needed.  I could actually feel my chest tightening during certain moments of that match, and it left me with a strong outlook on the series' future.  Even the opposing school's players were treated as real characters.  Much like with Ping Pong's Kong and Kaizama, Haikyuu! made it a point to give the viewers a backstory to most of Karasuno's opponents.  Rather than get pissed off when the main characters lost, you kind of gained a sense of respect for the rival schools.  I found myself saying, \u201cAre they gonna go there?  Are they gonna explore the 'villains?\u201d  They definitely went there, and it made the story that much better.\\n\\n\r\nI was so excited when I heard there was a second season of this show as well.  It didn't necessarily end on a cliffhanger, but more so paved a street for the second season to drive down.  It got me pumped up.  There are too many shows out nowadays that forcefully end on cliffhangers in hope of getting enough funding for a second season and end up being mediocre, standalone animes as a result, so I am grateful that Haikyuu! didn't take that approach.  The only areas I could think of for the second season to improve is to add more backstory to the supporting cast and uncover more about Karasuno's former glory days.  Overall, the series does a great job balancing serious moments with a healthy dose of comedy, and I actually found myself laughing on more than a few occasions.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Haikyuu! bring a healthy amount of complexity to the series.  The main characters Hinata and Kageyama play off each other quite well due to their polar opposite personality types.  Hinata is jovial and excited, whereas Kageyama is dry and focused.  Needless to say, he doesn't get along with many people.  The fact that they end up locking in a strange synergistic play style makes their relationship even more dynamic.  It's nice to see their bond grow stronger as the series progresses, as Hinata becomes more serious while Kageyama's arrogance comes down a few pegs and he starts to give teammates compliments.  Hinata's energy makes his such an enjoyable character, and even though the plot isn't focused entirely on him, I feel that the show would be average without him.  His comic relief is refreshing and can come at the most random, but well timed moments.  As previously mentioned, the development of the opposing players that Karasuna faces is short but effective.  It is normally done mid-match, but adds to the emotional aspect of whether or not you want to see them lose.  It's written very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is incorporated well, but many lack significant development.  The other first year players Tsukishima and Yamaguchi are first introduced as friends who challenge Hinata and Kageyama.  Tsukishima is an intelligent but uncooperative individual, who adds random sarcasm throughout the series, but there was literally no effort into exploring his backstory.  I'd like to find out why he is the way he is, but I might have to wait until season two for that.  I almost entirely forgot that Yamaguchi even existed until he reappeared in the final match.  The other members of Karasuno are introduced with small amount of backstory, but aren't really explored again other than for the occasional side comment or joke.  Most notably is the libero, Nishinoya, who ended up being kicked out of the club for reasons that aren't really discussed, other than plot convenience.  I'd also like some character development to emerge from him.  Possibly the largest lack of character depth is from that of Karasuno's captain, Daichi.  He seems so caring and passionate about the game, but it doesn't really go any farther than that.  Oh, and there's the random addition of the teacher and other third year hottie that do almost nothing for the series.  Again, I don't want to come across like I hated the character development, but I just would like some expansion on many of the members of Karasuno in the second season.  I think some of the time spent on action sequences could've been better utilized to go in depth into the character's backstories.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound in Haikyuu! are both fantastic.  I like the character models a lot.  The way the animation will zoom in on their expressions before they execute a powerful volleyball move is excellent and fluid.  Might I add that the action sequences themselves are atmospheric and intense.  Either the director himself played volleyball or had an expert weigh in while writing the script, because even though I've only ever watched a few games myself, I think he was right on the money.  Even the character's voices appear to echo like they're actually in a gymnasium.  I also like how Hinata is drawn.  He's made to look like no other character in the show, with his orange spiky hair.  I mean, what is it with the Japanese and orange/auburn hair colors???  The sound effects used in the games themselves sounded incredibly realistic, and made you feel like you were actually there in person.  Both OPs were alright, and they gave a positive outlook on the show's energy.  The EDs weren't anything special, and I found myself skipping them most of the time.  The rest of soundtrack was uplifting and fast paced.  It gave a strong sense of life to the action sequences during matches.  I really liked the voice actors in Haikyuu! as well.  Kaito Ishikawa (One Punch Man, Zankyou no Terror) delivers again as Kageyama and his hard-toned, sarcastic mannerisms, while Ayumu Murase (Gangsta, Gatchaman Crowds) kills it as Hinata, and it seems like he actually stepped out of his comfort zone for this role.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Haikyuu! is an extremely enjoyable anime.  I definitely never got the vibe that it was overrated in any way.  It lives up to its hype, and I repeat... I do NOT watch sports animes.  (You can check my anime list!)  I would strongly recommend this series to casual anime fans as well as serious critics who are looking for something a little bit different to mix things up.  If I could sum up Haikyuu! in one word, it would be \u201cfun\u201d.  It's jam-packed with emotional and inspirational matches which help to strengthen the bond you have with the characters.  The art is vibrant and the sound is realistic and consuming.  If more attention is given to the Karasuno player's character development, this second season has the ability to skyrocket up my favorites list.  It seems like my opinion of sports animes is starting to change little by little....  Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "To be honest, I'm guilty of being biased and judgemental, and more than once to boot. A few years ago I had seen my friend's collection of Naruto manga. I scoffed and even teased him a bit, having seen what appeared to be ridiculous anime promos on TV aimed at children. Within a year, I had discovered anime and manga myself. I have since apologized. Then, a year ago in the fall FAL league, I found myself incredulous at how popular and highly praised the sequel to Kuroko no Basket was. Subsequently, I stumbled across a volleyball anime with what seemed to be an interestingpremise.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, I believe apologies are in order. I'm sorry, sports anime genre. I'm sorry I looked down on you. I'm sorry I didn't give you a shot sooner. I'm sorry I wrote off Kuroko no Basket and Yowamushi Pedal and the several other of the genre I have since added to my plan to watch list. If you want to give thanks for my change of heart, you need look no further than a wonderful little gem called Haikyuu!!\\n\\n\r\nQuickly becoming one of my favorite anime, Haikyuu!! was the show I looked forward to most each week. It is a well-rounded work that made every Sunday a little better. As today is the day it finished airing, I'm a bit surprised that more people haven't completed it and/or written reviews. Hoping to help others that may not have given Haikyuu!! a chance, here I am now expressing my humble opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from a Shounen Jump manga, the story could be boiled to to pretty typical shounen stereotypes. It contains an underdog, teamwork, perserverance, etc. However, in my opinion, Haikyuu!! integrates these themes incredibly well, and also sets itself apart from your run of the mill Jump product. The protagonists are relatively inexperienced and are far from being the best volleyball players out there. Crazy quick 'level up's don't exist, and you will find no inexplicable victories here. Instead, we receive a well crafted story with good pacing that follows the formation of the Karasuno to their foray into the high school volleyball circuit.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue people typically have with the shounen genre is flat, 2-dimensional characters that have little or poor development. I like to think this problem does not plague Haikyuu!! In fact, I'd say this is a strong point in relation to many other anime/manga. Haikyuu!! mainly focuses upon the exploits of the two main characters and the team as a whole, but does take the occasional detour to explore backstory, relationships, character development, comedic moments, and minor characters. That last item especially separates this show from the rest. A recurring theme throughout this sports anime is, not surprisingly, losing. I was very impressed with Haikyuu!! on how it depicts the emotions and point of view of nearly all minor characters, whether they appear again or not. For me, the level to which they were explored is rare among any story I've come across. On a side note, having not experienced not much from the sports genre, I am no authority on how others deal with losing games. However, subjectively, I think it handles the concept fantastically, and possibly better than the above-mentioned basketball and biking anime. It spends a fair amount of time presenting how the characters react and cope with loss.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as technical aspects go, Haikyuu!! does not disappoint. The artwork is clean and the animation fluid. Production I.G. did a wonderful job putting together a great visual work. In addition, the OST is superb. Personally, the background tracks helped set the scene and kept me emotionally invested throughout intense, comedic, and dramatic scenes. I cannot compliment the audio side of this anime enough with how well it worked. As a bonus, I fell in love with all of the openings and endings. Hopefully, you're as lucky as I was.\\n\\n\r\nI pray you give Haikyuu!! a chance. If you are new to the genre, this might be a gateway to a new horizon for you. If you have enjoyed sports anime before, Haikyuu!! will continue your enjoyment of the genre. Inevitably, this show is and will be compared to Production I.G.'s other sensation, Kuroko no Basket. In the interest of bipartisanship and brevity, I will simply say that the main difference is that Kuroko no Basket relies more on spectacle, whereas Haikyuu!! integrates more realism. Regardless of opinion, I believe that you will really enjoy Haikyuu!!and, quite possibly, like me you will be eagerly awaiting season 2.",

            "content": "Uh oh, I'm about to do something not many have done: bring up problems with Haikyuu! Disclaimer: I do play volleyball, so please understand where I'm coming from. \r\nDon't get me wrong, I liked Haikyuu! and will be watching the second season, but in this review I'm going to talk about what I didn't like because everyone else gushes over it. Remember, I did genuinely like it.\r\nWhen I first found out there was an anime about volleyball (and not only that, it was really popular and well-liked) I kind of got really excited and placed it near the top of my \"Plan to Watch\" list.I'm not quite sure what I expected, but this wasn't it. I had expected something intelligent, engaging, and meaningful, what I got was a typical shounen.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Story: 7[/b]\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the plot. Nothing really special about it. A band of unlikely heroes come together one year to form a volleyball team that just so happens to be really good, they set their goals to be in the Nationals, they go through certain hardships to get there only to come up short when they near their goal. But fear not! There is a second season! The plot was pretty generic sports anime for me. Not much else I can say about it.\\n\\n\r\nHere's where the problems I, personally, have begin. Everything feels dumbed down, like it was made for someone who knows absolutely nothing about volleyball to watch. Now I'm not saying \"You should only watch sports anime if you've played the sport\", on the contrary, in fact. But they shove down explanations of the most basic moves into your throat, even down to the second to last episode. They always try to mask it (by explaining to other people the rules), but they never do a good enough job at it. It should be implied that your viewer is smart enough to be able to pick up on certain things with the sport after watching, rather than having everything explained in crystal-clear clarity. Take [i]Ping Pong the Animation[/i] as an example. They lay everything out to you clearly, but don't tell you specifically what it is you're supposed to see. It's your job to figure it out. That's a smarter show with more subtlety and more respect for the viewer's intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nThere were so many weird volleyball technicalities. I didn't understand if volleyball in Japan was that different, or if Haikyuu just honestly thought nobody watching would know anything about volleyball so they could cheat a little? I tried to look up the rules for Japan, but could only find certain things, nothing decisive. Here are all the little, weird, things happened:\\n\\n\r\nKageyama is supposed to be a genius setter and yet he's never set a back-row attack up until this point? And he's never even attempted to do a jump-float? Those are things we learn to do in club volleyball when you're like 12. And it also seems like he never dumps despite it being an easy strategy to get 2-3 points per match (also, he's tall and can jump high, it'd be even easier for him than most).\\n\\n\r\nThey don't use any conventional terminology when being set. They just say \"set me\". This doesn't tell the setter how fast or where you want it. A Go ball, a Shoot set, and a 4 set are very different sets, but all to the same person. There's never any indication anything changes. They also have a position called an \"Ace\", which I have looked up, but cannot confirm to exist. I know that Japan has \"Wing Spikers\" instead of Outsides and Opposites, so no problems there, but I don't know if Ace actually exists. It seems to just mean their best player?\\n\\n\r\nHow is there always a triple or double block on every hit? Most of the time, you're lucky if you can get a double block on a outside hitter, but they get triple blocks, even on quicks! Even at the Olympic level they don't do that. And when every hitter goes up to hit the ball, they always hit straight down the line. I honestly saw 3-4 cross hits the entire series, no joke. They always hit straight, which leads to them getting blocked. Then when they do get blocked, they don't go \"Hey, next time roll/tip it over the block, put pressure on the back row to get that\", they just say \"[b][i]Hit it harder![/i][/b]\", like that's not how it works. They also never intentionally aim out so the other team accidentally blocks it straight down out of bounds, and they never wipe the ball off the block. There's never any strategy in their hits.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there's almost zero free balls (or \"chance ball!\") in the show. Even if it's a bad first dig, they somehow manage to get a full attack almost every single time. That's just not how it works. And one of the one times the opponent's had to just pass one over, everyone was downright amazed with how smart it was to pass it to the setter. That's not that clever at all. A common strategy to break teams with really good setters is to hit, pass, and block everything in their direction to either force them to have the libero set or to get them out of rotation to compensate for it. It's something almost every team of every skill level does, surely a team that has a chance to go to nationals would know this stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThis is more of a minor detail, but the portrayal of the females in this show was slightly derogatory. I'm not going to go full SJW and preach to you right now, but this stuff was kind of obvious. The females were all strung over the hotshot athletes, the female volleyball team was the weak and helpless team that needed the boys' team's strength to pick them back up after the loss, and all the explaining that got done to help the audience was 80% of the time done to some \"helpless and confused\" girl watching from the sidelines. Sure, the main girl (if you can even call her main) had some strength, but it was just stereotypical, shounen strength, nothing resembling a real personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Characters: 7[/b]\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest with you, I just absolutely couldn't stand Hinata, the MC. He was the stereotypical genuine, happy-go-lucky protagonist. His motivations were extremely one-dimensional and weak. You lose 1 game in Junior High to a good team while you have a shit team so you swear revenge for life? And that's your driving motivation for the rest of the series? To beat him in a 1-on-1? His personality was so bad. Every interaction he had with other people was a \"feel-good\" talk, something to pick another guy back up on his feet, which got really stale after about, hmmm, 2 episodes. This problem existed with lots of other characters as well. Interactions that just started with someone feeling down and ended with them magically being inspired again, after like 2 sentences. Super clich\u00e9, shounen nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nKageyama and Asahi were the only ones who went through any type of development (although Asahi's was condensed within about 4 episodes), which isn't [i]too[/i] big of a problem, if I actually liked any of the other character's personalities. Honestly, the only 2 I liked were Tsukishima (because he has the same kind of \"wtf are these people doing\" attitude I have) and Nishinoya because all liberos are cool.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Art/Animation: 9[/b]\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were definitely great all-around, but I did have some issues with them as well. For one, some character's necks were really long or really weird, which honestly made some characters look like literal dickheads (Oikawa I'm looking at you). Also, there were tons of reused and recycled animations. Because everyone hit line, all they had to do was switch the character who was \"receiving\" the ball and reuse the animation over and over. There was no variety with the hits so they cut corners on animation. I don't know if this was due to limited budget, but it was quite noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I do have to commend them on are the volleyballs themselves. They were well-detailed and looked almost exactly like the ones we use in real life, down to the little tiny ridge details on the ball.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound: 8[/b]\\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints, but I honestly don't think sound matters that much (unless it's awful or amazing).\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Personal Enjoyment: 7[/b]\\n\\n\r\nI genuinely did like this show and I will be watching the second season as it airs. I'm just confused as to why so many people heap praise upon this show. It's a good shounen, absolutely, but it's too much of a shounen. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review and if you have any feedback (positive or negative, I don't mind) feel free to message me.",

            "content": "The most important thing in a team sports is, without a doubt, the team. This holds especially true for volleyball. Having six talented players is all fine, but as long as they aren\u2019t a team and don\u2019t show team spirit, that talent is surely in vain. But what if it\u2019s the other way round; is it a surefire way to win when you have one team where not everyone is talented?\r\nNot really. But the chances are higher when there\u2019s one team, rather than six players.\r\nHaikyuu!!, or High Jump in English, is about Hinata and Kageyama, two players who originally stand at the opposite side ofthe volleyball net \u2013 plus are personality-wise polar opposites too -  and are, due to the fact that they attend the same high school, forced to work together. During that process, they learn the importance of a team and that you don\u2019t lose or win alone. The show eventually does focus on the entire Karasuno volleyball team (and on other teams too), but it\u2019s still obvious who the main characters are. \\n\r\nAs with most sports anime, the plot starts with Hinata and Kageyama meeting (and fighting), then joining the Karasuno volleyball team, and the team battling others all the way to the Inter-Highs. The volleyball aspects are well explained though and nicely weaved into dialogues. We learn about the libero when the libero appears. We learn about Quick As when Kageyama and Hinata perform a Quick A. There is no huge info dump in that manner; the viewer is pretty much spoonfed with information, one term explained at a time. The plot isn\u2019t very original and average at best, but to be fair, Haikyuu is an anime where it\u2019s more about the characters than the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about Haikyuu was the fact that the show doesn\u2019t rely on superpowers, even though it was somewhat unbelievable at some points. There is the fact that Kageyama can exactly pin-point where to toss the ball, for example, or Hinata jumping a felt hundred metres high. But except that, there are no laser beams emerging from the player\u2019s eyes, there is no \u201csuper saiyan\u201d-mode, nothing like that. And the best part is: Even the supporting cast thinks it\u2019s weird. They think it\u2019s weird when Kageyama perfectly tosses the ball to Hinata, who jumps a felt hundred metres high. They laugh when a character names his moves. I simply loved that because most sports anime tend to take those things for granted, which isn\u2019t realistic at all. \\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, Haikyuu lives off its characters. The first eleven episodes are about the main team, Karasuno, which helps the viewer to learn and love the boys one by one, as most are characterized well, have good interactions with each other and their motivations are shown too. Then the opposing teams and characters kick in. There is the \u201dfated rival\u201d Nekoma, who appears in three episodes and then vanishes into thin air with the promise to meet again in the Inter-Highs. There is Tokonami, the loser team, and Dateko, the team that caused the ace Asahi to have a volleyball trauma. But the only opposing team truly worth mentioning is Aoba Johsai which we get a lot to know of, as many of the players were once teammates or upperclassmen of Kageyama, but especially so Oikawa, who can be seen as the antagonist of Haikyuu. He gets such strong characterization and his motivations are laid out so well that it makes him easily one of the best characters in the series. Other characters who develop really well are Karasuno\u2019s Tanaka \u2013 who gets introduced as one of the comic relief characters in the beginning and gets fleshed out properly later on \u2013 as well as Nishinoya, who is introduced as a hot-blooded, loud character, but quickly turns to one of the pillars of the protagonist team. \\n\\n\r\nI wish I could say the same about Hinata, but sadly, that isn\u2019t true. While his motivations do get shown early in the series \u2013 as he is the main character \u2013 he still acts most of the time like a \u201cvolleyball Naruto\u201d; hotblooded, highly friends-focused and especially annoying in matches, when he screams \u201cBring it on!\u201d for the tenth time (even if it does get revealed that it has a reason why he screams that way). As for the other main character Kageyama, he certainly develops from the mean, oppressing attitude which brought him the nickname \u201cKing of the court\u201d (no, that\u2019s definitely not praise), to a person who learns to depend on others and to listen to them for once. I really like Haikyuu\u2019s cast, save one or two characters, and they make the show very good.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, as the studio behind the series is Production I.G, certainly does not disappoint. The scenes look crisp, the matches look fluid, and what I loved especially was, in some parts of the show, when the characters smash the ball \u2013 that was when the animation became a lot like a sketch and that was very impressive in my eyes. There is also a scene which was reminiscent to the Monogatari Series to me in Episode 21; when the vice-captain Sugawara wants to tell Kageyama to \u201cdo his best\u201d, but stops in the middle of the sentence and the plain text \u201cLet\u2019s win\u201d gets shown for two seconds. Sometimes the characters look off-model (especially the ones watching the game), and sometimes scenes are reused over and over again, but overall, it\u2019s certainly a visual feast.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, it always fits to the mood, and varies from electronic to straight up swing over rock; this applies to the opening and ending themes as well. A special mention belongs to the voice cast; there were many familiar and unfamiliar names, and all of them did a great job. All of them suit to their respective characters, but the one that shined the most was Oikawa\u2019s voice actor and my favourite, Namikawa Daisuke, who made Oikawa to the great antagonist that he is.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched Haikyuu on a weekly basis, I was looking forward to every next week, and loved every single episode. When I rewatched it once the show was over, I didn\u2019t enjoy it that much. I thought the events before the Inter-High (which starts in Episode 15) to be average at best. But after the Inter-High started, that was when my enjoyment had a peak, especially so in the last match, Karasuno vs Aoba Johsai. To me, that\u2019s when the series really evolves from the average sports anime to a great one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu\u2019s core theme is the team. It\u2019s about learning to trust each other when you\u2019re in a team, it\u2019s about winning and losing as a team, it\u2019s about overcoming obstacles as a team. For being that team-focused, Haikyuu really spends lots of its time for the viewer to get to know the team, and handles its characters with great care, even though the plot is by no means unique. It has great animation, a fitting sound and a wonderful voice cast. If you are debating whether or not to watch this, then don\u2019t hesitate and start Haikyuu. You won\u2019t regret it.\\n",

            "content": "So if you can tell from my score, I really freaking love this anime.  I have to preface this by saying, I am NOT a sports anime fan. It's one of the last genres I look to because I've disliked/dropped over 90% of the ones I've seen. So I'm incredibly biased.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story in Haikyuu! is what amazes me most possible. \r\nIt's all volleyball, volleyball, volleyball, yet I'm never tired of it (despite not being an avid volleyball fan). The relationships between the players develops in all aspects: the relationships between the players as friends, as teammates, as students in different school years, as acohesive team against other teams. In between is volleyball. At every corner is volleyball. This is literally a volleyball explosion. But you really see the story behind why the characters love it. How the love developed for them. How much of themselves and their past they've put into the game. What torment and triumph they feel from the sport. \\n\\n\r\nLike every other sports anime, Haikyuu! there are out of this world, impossible moves that even pros can't do. BUT I never feel that way. They don't drag it out or make it ridiculously over the top. It happens, then they move on with the game.\\n\\n\r\nIn sports anime, another thing I noticed that can drag a story down is when they try to work in explanations of how certain aspects of the sport works. Haiykuu! manages to work it in flawlessly. My knowledge of volleyball stops at the grade school level (where all we did was rotate, the positions weren't named, and players weren't allowed to even dive or roll). The explanations are short, to the point, and staggered. But now I know all the positions, the rules, the different types of moves, special attacks, formations, etc., without really realizing at the time I was being schooled on the subject.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single sports anime I've seen, I'm guilty of fast forwarding through games or matches or tournaments. Literally every one. I've never done it with Haikyuu! Not even when I rewatched the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is very good, a solid 8, but not the best ever. It really works to highlight the fluidity of movement throughout sports play. It's not over the top or excessive, so it's a bit quiet with how good it is. I think the best indication of how good the art is, is when you're looking at someone on the opposite side of the net, and the player is basically melding into the net, but it doesn't look weird at all. If you watch it, you'll get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nI also really like the character designs. The characters are drawn in the more realistic, life-like style vs. cartoon-like. This really adds to the game play; their muscles tensing, their movements, their presence. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is what gets me. It's really effective. Just like the art, it's not over the top. A certain sound happens and you know something is about to go down, like a cool move. A certain tune plays and you know you're about to see someone who is a worthy opponent. It really highlights the mood. Also the sports sounds, the squeak of shoes on a gym floor, the smack of the ball, even the sound of the ball slicing through the air makes everything more believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very good as well. The tones and nuances fit each character's personality. I can't say any examples without giving things away (because not all characters are introduced at the same time).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nHaiykuu! does a really good job of developing the characters. You know what each character's personality is like. What their role is on the court and on the team. Even the characters that are on the bench, you really feel it and connect with them even if they aren't the ones playing in the main match (i.e. their disappointment at not playing, their desire to be on the court, their feelings of support for their team).  \\n\\n\r\nIf someone does something hilarious or quirky, as the viewer you can easily think to yourself, \"that is SO like so-and-so to do that.\" \\n\\n\r\nYou really get a sense of the character's ability, athletically and emotionally.  their maturity levels (both mentally and sports-wise). Their tendencies and characteristics that make them, THEM.\\n\\n\r\nEven a lot of the teams they face, you can easily fall in love with the opposing players, because they make sure to develop them as well. This also makes matches much more interesting and makes you more emotionally invested in them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI personally love Haikyuu! to beyond the moon and back. I'm going to state it here, that this is the first time ever that I have liked an anime much more than the source manga it's adapted from.  I'm just being honest. If someone had told me to read Haikyuu! the manga, I would have eventually dropped it. I started reading it after I started watching the anime, and I'm only continuing because I'm so emotionally invested in the characters and want MORE!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime really brings the story to life.\\n\\n\r\nPlus the overall humor woven throughout the whole series, is an awesome bonus\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\r\nYeah, 10 out of 10. Again, this coming from someone who is not a sports anime fan. Or maybe I just hadn't been introduced to the right one, ehem, in order to see the light.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cSo long as I am here, you will be the strongest\u201d \u2013 Tobio Kageyama \r\n\u201cHaikyuu!!\u201d is one of the most successful shows in the 2014 season and is consistently well appreciated within the Anime community. Based on that face and that I\u2019m indeed a pretty big fan of the sport Volleyball, I\u2019ve decided to give Haikyuu a chance and I wasn\u2019t disappointed at all, in fact it beat all of my exceptions I had in this Series. \r\nI won\u2019t go any deeper in the synopsis, because I think it\u2019s already covered well enough by MAL. \r\nOverall the story itself is pretty solid and well executed,even though the Series has some rather dragged out episodes, especially at the end, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, in fact it provides more realistic development in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOne issue I\u2019ve already mentioned before is the pacing of the story. Sometimes it\u2019s really fast and a game is settled within about three minutes, when I actually wanted to see more of the match. The last match is dragged out for about four episodes, which wasn\u2019t really my cup of tea either. Other than that, I think the studio did a good job as far as the pacing goes. One thing that really amazed me is how well they executed all of the character and story dynamics in the training episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art is solid, but not really more than a solid 7 I think. I didn\u2019t like the character design at first, but I got used to it, as well as the sometimes a bit off pace Animation. One thing I was irritated at first is, that you can see the other player\u2019s face through the net, which I think they could\u2019ve executed better, but that definitely is moaning on a very high level. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked the Opening and the OST was solid as well, even though there unfortunately weren\u2019t too many memorable ones in there, if there was even one. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest strength of Haikyuu is definitely the characters, as well as their dynamics and interactions. While a Sports-Anime like \u201cKuroko no Basket\u201d rather focuses on the single players and their \u201csuperpowers\u201d, Haikyuu surely set an eye on the characters as a team, which was just perfect and way more realistic in my opinion. While there were definitely were characters, who are memorable as individuals (Kageyama, Nishinoya, Tanaka\u2026), I really enjoyed watching how the team grew together and how they worked together while training and playing. The development was superb as well, especially for an Anime about \"just\" Volleyball. \\n\\n\r\nAs you\u2019ve might already noticed, I enjoyed this show a great deal. While I was incredibly satisfied with the story and especially with the characters and their development, I could forget some of the mistakes Haiykuu made. \\n\\n\r\nIt was certainly not a perfect show by any means, but if you\u2019re into a decent story with a lot of development, light-hearted comedy which even got me several times, and/or you\u2019re enjoying Volleyball or simply Sports a great deal, I would recommend you to give Haikyuu a shot, I\u2019m sure you will love it as much as I do! \\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10)\\n\r\nArt/Animation (7/10)\\n\r\nSound (7.5/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.5/10)\\n",

            "content": "Bring on season 2.\r\nJumping out of the wreckage that is the Summer 2014 anime season, Haikyuu triumphantly spikes its nakama-drenched, bromance-filled volleyballs into the chaotic mess, pummeling its viewership with its unflappable spirit and verve. In a season where anime about intergalactic war (sort of), terrorism (not really), and rebellion (or bad politics or comedy or whatever the hell Akame ga Kill is supposed to be) compete to see who can be the very edgiest, it is with some surprise that I declare to you that an anime about volleyball has turned out to be one of the best anime of the season. \r\nThis showis nothing special on the surface; a hotheaded upstart and his outstandingly talented rival from middle school join their high school volleyball team and work together to help their team win a tournament. The details might be a little different, but the general template for the story has been used countless times in both anime and other media. So what makes this anime so damn enjoyable?\\n\\n\r\nWell, it\u2019s the execution. I\u2019ve long maintained that clich\u00e9s aren\u2019t a bad thing as long as they\u2019re well-executed, and Haikyuu delivers on this front. Characters are tropey, but very believable. The pacing is a bit slow, and the show drags a bit during the first half; however, the intensity picks up in the second half of the anime, when the InterHigh tournament starts. The matches are engaging and exhilarating. The frequent cliffhanger endings will leave you desperately wanting for more. Is it the most original plotline ever? Certainly not. Is it endearing, fun as all hell to watch, and convincing in its emotion? Absolutely.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this show is its characters. Haikyuu has a pretty large and fairly diverse cast, and many of the characters are well developed throughout the course of the show. Again, some of them are a bit tropey \u2013 Hinata is the standard high-strung shounen protagonist, Kageyama is his more serious counterpart and rival, Tanaka is comic relief, etc. \u2013 but they\u2019re all fun to watch and feel very human. Hinata, Kageyama, Sugawara, Daichi, and several others are given backstories and developed into well-rounded personalities, and the chemistry between them is astounding. It\u2019s not just the protagonists, either; several antagonists are developed in conjunction with the main cast, the most notable of which is probably Aoba Josai\u2019s setter, Oikawa, a character that you might actually find yourself rooting for at times because of how well he\u2019s developed. Certain characters could\u2019ve used more screentime, particularly Kiyoko, who we really don\u2019t see or hear much of at all; but with such a large cast this is to be expected, and surprisingly isn\u2019t that much of an issue. \\n\\n\r\nAnother great aspect of this show was its matches. I\u2019ve long complained about the abundance of horrendously slow battle scenes in a lot of shounen, but these matches are almost perfectly-paced. The rallies are dramatic, suspenseful, well-timed, and exciting. All the typical stuff, like the internal monologues and the speeches of teamwork and friendship and whatnot, are well handled and generally do not detract from the momentum and intensity of the on-court action; in fact, they frequently added to it. The matches are surprisingly grounded, though of course many pivotal moments are exaggerated for dramatic effect (Hinata's quicks, in particular). The episode endings are also handled really well. One of my biggest complaints with cliffhangers (I tend to complain a lot when it comes to anime\u2026) is that most of the time they tend to come off as cheap and uninspired by drawing out the episode unnecessarily to withhold vital information that they\u2019ll then give you in the next episode; Haikyuu does a much better job of delivering strong episode endings while still leaving the matches unfinished, and keeps you wanting for more. All in all, these matches are sure to leave you breathlessly entertained. \\n\\n\r\nNow, all that being said, the anime does have some issues. As great as the second half of the anime (when the InterHigh tournament, and consequently the matches, begin in earnest) is, the first half is slow and can test your patience at times. It\u2019s not bad \u2013 some of the episodes, especially the first one, are high quality \u2013 but overall, there is too much exposition, and the monologues dragged more often than not. The humor can also be hit-and-miss; depending on your tolerance for the exaggerated facial expressions and reactions common to anime humor (you know what I\u2019m talking about), it may wear on you. Overall, though, it\u2019s not really a huge deal, and many of you might end up enjoying it, which will only enrich the experience for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation, and direction are excellent, and given that Production I.G. is behind the wheel, this should come as no surprise. The artwork is very detailed and character designs are faithful to the original manga. The animation is fluid and the strength of the direction is evident in the matches. The voice acting is great, and the VAs do a top-notch job of conveying the fire and emotion of the characters without ever sounding too cheesy (okay, maybe a little cheesy, but the good kind of cheesy). The soundtrack is superb \u2013 I actually think that this is one of the best OSTs I\u2019ve heard in a while, and is probably one of the more underrated aspects of this anime. The BGM music in particular really helps make the matches that much more exciting. The music really is one of the biggest reasons I enjoyed this show, and the OST is definitely worth a listen on its own. The OP/EDs are pretty good, too.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was a blast, and being that this is only the second sports anime I\u2019ve ever seen, whenever someone asks me how to get into the sports genre, this is one of the first titles I\u2019ll be recommending. It\u2019s not the deepest or most original anime out there, and it does have a few hiccups, but it embodies so well the themes of teamwork, dedication, perseverance, overcoming the odds, and really everything else about the sports genre that we tend to pass off as hammy or overdone but appeals to most of us deep down. \\n\\n\r\nSo from all of us Haikyuu fans to you, IG, get on that season 2.\\n\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s a phrase that goes \u201cdynamite come in little packages\u201d. The meaning implies that someone who is small can achieve big accomplishments. Shoyo Hinata, the protagonist of the series is a perfect example of this. Standing no more than 6 feet tall but yet has a big heart, Hinata is someone filled with integrity. Witness the extraordinary journey that Hinata undertakes to prove the whole world his worth as a volleyball player. And believe me, it\u2019s worth it especially when it\u2019s someone named the \u201cUltimate Decoy\u201d. \r\nThe anime is based off the manga of the same name written by Haruichi Furudate. What started out asa one-shot transformed into a sports series that captures the very essence of volleyball. As a sport, volleyball tends to be one of the underrated activities when it comes to competition. While this may or may not be true coming from where you are, the sport hardly is ever seen in animation form. Haikyuu!! on the other hand takes concept of volleyball and chronicles it into a series of profound discovery.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sports show, most often or not, it involves competition. But to build from that, we have to start from scratch. Haikyuu!! does that essentially by creating a foundation for the sport and its competitors. While Hinata is the main protagonist, his teammates aren\u2019t left in the shadows. The story focuses them each individually and collectively as a team as they work their way on their journey. While not an easy one, the anime smoothly details their motivation and development. In fact, the story is relatively simple as it takes place in Junior High School, a setting perfect for growth. As a young boy, Hinata develops a fascination for volleyball after witnessing a national championship on TV. From that one single memorable moment leaves a profound memory in his mind. To put it simply, he wants to be like them and perhaps even win a championship himself. Beginning as a club but later capturing the attention of other fans as a resilient team, Hinata is what some people can describe as the hardcore underdog.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s true, the team starts in the beginning not being featured on national news like the one Hinata witnessed on TV. Instead, they work themselves up with training, willpower, and motivation. The teammates that Hinata works with have not only diverse personalities but also skillsets. This offers a decent amount of game-play as no match will feel the same coming from these players. But more importantly is how the team functions in unity. Because really, without teamwork, the game itself would be lost most indefinitely. Luckily, we witness most often the opposite of this as teamwork is skillfully indulged into the show. It creates inspiration, realism, and admiration towards Hinata\u2019s team. At the same time, Haikyuu goes to lengths to show how far they develop. Win, tie, or loss, each game fought takes every ounce of their sweat. By the end of the day, it\u2019s what they learned that matters. Well, we can\u2019t also forget about rivalries of course. In the sports world, there\u2019s always a bit of that that gives the birth to drama and personal pride.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Tobio Kageyama (aka the King of the Court), a first year at Karasuno High School. Playing as setter, he is the opposite of Hinata. A genius on the court with a cold attitude, Kageyama serves as Hinata\u2019s foil. And throughout the series, Hinata tries to desperately earn his respect by defeating him. Perhaps desperate might be the wrong word to use here though as the skill difference between the two is quite far-reaching, at least in the beginning anyways. Yet at the same time, Kageyama lacks something Hinata has and that\u2019s the motivation to work with others as a team. Kageyama is a lone wolf and prefers to do things on his own. That spells out a recipe for disaster when it comes to teamwork. However, the show takes advantage of this concept by building on Kageyama\u2019s weakness and mutates it into growth. It\u2019s not measured by height standards, but by connection as he learns the true value of teamwork. That my friends is something to appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of appreciation, the show also gives the other players a chance for spotlight. Characters such as the captain Daichi Sawamura, vice captain Koshi Sugawara, and ace Asahi Azumane are just a few that makes the presence known. Additionally, certain players get back stories to enhance their credibility in development. The most prominent relationship though is still Hinata and Kageyama. It\u2019s easy to notice them on the court because of their polar opposites. The series cleverly illustrate that through actions with dialogues, body language, and moves on the court. Collectively as well, it establishes the fact that Hinata seeks to earn respect from others by not just winning but also through his abilities. It\u2019s a team that will inspire hope and one the audience can find themselves easily rooting for. Ask yourself this: was there a time when something felt utterly hopeless but still fought until the very end? If you go down, go down swinging. Think Haikyuu!! next time as the prime factor.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s also impressive about this show isn\u2019t just the players or story but rather its style. Unlike certain shows where superhuman moves are adapted as a gimmick, Haikyuu!! retains its realism. There\u2019s no absurd movements that seems utterly impossible to pull off in the real life. Instead, Haikyuu!! dynamically feature moves that can be adapted with fine degree of realism. These include the dives, spikes, serves, passes, and among others that can be seen in a common volleyball game. Only here, Haikyuu!! doesn\u2019t push its buttons to outdo itself by incorporating inhuman moves like jumping 50 feet in the air. No, what you expect is what you will see and that\u2019s a solid foundation of what volleyball really is. It even focuses on the very roles the players are part of such as wing spiker, setter, libero, and outside/weakside/middle hitter.  In retrospect, the show will make you feel like you are also part of the game or even a player yourself because the moves that can be performed. Haikyuu!!\u2019s performance is also more just realism in this way as it fuses together teamwork and realism for a show you won\u2019t forget. \\n\\n\r\nBy all means though, Haikyuu!! is no perfect anime and it suffers from some flaws. The show can feel repetitive with the rivalry that may seem stale between Hinata and Kageyama. Their rivalry becomes less favorable as a plot device and can feel cheesy with their dialogues. Not to mention the fact that the story is predictable, their rivalry isn\u2019t so far off as well. Furthermore, the story can sometime feel a bit slow paced on numerous occasions. And speaking of occasions, there are also some clich\u00e9 factor and generics when it comes to gimmicks. The classic \u2018manager beauty\u2019 and intimidation from rival schools are a part of this. And although it is suitable for this type of show, it\u2019s been done over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is handled by Production IG, a studio that deserves praise for this adaptation. The character designs are smooth and in rhythm with the style of the show. Each of them matches their personalities and none of them stand out as Mr. Fan service just for showing off. Further testament of the strength for its animation is the game-play involved. Whether it\u2019s teamwork or individual play, the camera smoothly captures a fine degree of the players\u2019 movements. Nonetheless, it\u2019s not a surprise for the studio considering its experience with action scenes and noticeable staff involved. It\u2019s pure and solidifies its foundation of realism when it comes to the game. Even comedic scenes are humorous without trying diehard to appeal to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn\u2019t a powerhouse but is decent when it comes to execution. The OST has a well balance of intensity and calm moments. Whether on or off the court, the music retains its credibility to establish Haikyuu!!\u2019s style. Dramatic moments are also captured on screen with the music to make it feel and look real. As the OP and ED song goes, they have likeability with decent pacing. But on character voices, Hinata\u2019s mannerism might take a while to get used to. His squeaky voice can sound childish despite his intentions while his rival has the voice mannerism of an ego-centric. Ultimately though, it can be a mixed bag so better get yourself suited for it. On the other hand, a few noticeable OST will be memorable especially at some of the more significant games.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu!! takes the sport of volleyball and delivers it to the audience in more than just a profound way. It rides this epic journey not just by winning or losing games but with development of the characters. The riveting style the show delivers also expands more than just simple teamwork but how players come together through their experiences. And thanks to its realism, Haikyuu!! represents a superior sports show that people can find relatable. You don\u2019t need to be an athlete or familiar with volleyball to enjoy Haikyuu!! Instead, its rich realm of game-play and powerful animation will be enough to satisfy your needs. By the end of the day, you\u2019ll find yourself smiling and admiring this show like the way Hinata did for his hero.\\n",

            "content": "Teamwork. Talent. Hardwork. Friendship. Rivalry. Motivation. Pressure. Winning. Losing.\r\nThe realm of sports usually involve all of this, and needless to say, it was told brilliantly through Haikyuu. Unlike previous sports anime I've seen, Haikyuu remain grounded and down to Earth, despite the obvious impossibility of such talent in a Japanese high school setting. But hey, if you were ever watching anime for the uber realism of it, you're probably not in the right medium.\r\nThe story of Haikyuu is fairly straightforward but with a small unique feature. A high school volleyball team which was once a strong team is now slowly rebuilding. The team is joinedby 2 1st year students, Hinata Shoyo and Tobio Kageyama, who were originally rivals but now has to work together. As someone coming into a series without any knowledge of its adapted material or volleyball rules in general, I really had no idea what was in store. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, you will get obvious character archetypes and roles. Yes, you will get games that comes down to the last few points. Yes, you will get \"lucky\" plays. Yes, you will get problematic team mates. And finally, yes, you will get tons of bromance (#nohomo). But, that is sports. If you're watching a sports anime, these are all fundamental characteristics inherent to the genre. What truly elevates Haikyuu is creating a team with players that feel very real, despite their extraordinary talent or potential. There is a consistent dynamic relationship between team members, and progressive buildups that really showcase teamwork, hardwork, and all the motivation involved in these characters.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the characters have extremely high potential and ability. Kageyama and Hinata have almost an unlimited amount of potential and talent within them. And no doubt would there be some viewers who found that aspect unrealistic. However, their abilities never become the sole premise of the series. Unlike other sports anime that truly go all out on how supernatural the players have become, Haikyuu is rooted in its focus on the emotions and values that change over time in its lovable team members. Additionally, these players have obvious flaws in their characterization that usually limits their full potential. How can Hinata overcome inherent biases against his height and his lack of training? How does Kageyama finally learn essential values of trust and teamwork? So, while a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required, it shouldn't really take away just how brilliant Haikyuu showcases the challenges and achievements a team and its players can go through.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest aspect of Haikyuu is its careful consideration to just about every aspect of the sport. One of the most memorable scenes in the series was a short compilation of teams and players facing the effects of defeat and loss. In my viewing experience, this was rarely shared in a story, or even, generally speaking, in sports in general. Usually, a team faces loss as a ground for improvement. And that's about it. However, in Haikyuu, you really feel the intensity, the emotions, and truly, the psychological effects of losing. Losing isn't simply a means to an end. The present emotions are real, the loss is final, and the moments will be remembered. \\n\\n\r\nOn a much lighter note, Haikyuu also had comedic moments that felt like comedy relief, but it was incorporated seamless enough that it felt like comedy relief was something these characters would've wanted it as well. Another highlight of the series is the attention it gives to supplementary team members, which again, highlights the dynamic of teamwork. Everyone have a role, even if it's about being a player that can only come once in a game, or a team member that is shadowed by someone with greater talent. \\n\\n\r\nAdded to that, the sense of strategy involved in the beautiful game of volleyball also keeps each game interesting, but not overly analytical. Certain series definitely go way beyond in over analyzing plays that viewers can feel bogged down by how complex the game had gotten. Haikyuu, while strategic in many ways, also raises the important concept that sometimes, thinking too much will slow you down in a game that involves quick judgments and reflexes. In general, I believe the consistent touch of realism involved in an obviously extraordinary setting truly elevate the series forward as a whole. It keeps things relatedable, and you feel like you can truly experience the challenges and achievements the team will go through, even though it's just an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe one potential issue I had with the series, though, is how fast developments can be and the pacing in general. You will literally have players going through epiphanies after epiphanies in a single match. On one hand, it had to be that way due to the limited time given for a series. But on the other hand, sometimes it feels like it becomes so plot-driven, the desire to highlight developments, that it might cheapen the changes the character went through. For myself, I watched the series on a biweekly basis, so each development felt important in its own way and it didn't feel like I was desensitized with emotions. For someone who is marathoning Haikyuu, there will probably be a different opinion of the series. Additionally, the pacing through the beginning of the series after the initial two episodes can feel slow, despite necessary introductions to new members of the team and their ongoing developments.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of things like art, animation, and sound, I felt it was a complete package in terms of presentation. The manga-like art quality keeps the animation stylish, while not limiting it to feel simply like it was just a series of stilled images. Each character have some unique physical quality to them, and the art was simple, but not minimalistic enough to feel cheap. The animation can truly highlight the importance of a strategic or power play, and the music only adds to the overall atmosphere of the series. Perhaps I'm a bit too sensitive to music, but when the piano starts to play in an obvious emotional setting, I couldn't help but feel the same emotions the players go through. There are times where you really want to cheer for the team, and times where you want to comfort them. In general, the music, including the OP/ED seamlessly complement the series.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, I enjoyed immensely the first season of Haikyuu. I really hope a second season is coming, not really because I want them to eventually win a tournament, but just how invested I have become attached to the characters. Haikyuu truly embodies the concept of teamwork, hardwork, and the challenges and accomplishments of being in a sports team. As being one of the few anime, if not the only anime that was about volleyball, I honestly feel lucky to have this anime graced my viewing experience. Haikyuu is obviously not an anime everyone can enjoy. But even from someone who may not necessarily enjoy sports anime, as long as you're open-minded and wants to watch something that showcases character developments and group dynamics, Haikyuu can be a very enjoyable series. I'd even argue that someone might enjoy the series more if they didn't know much about volleyball. It's seriously that good.",

            "content": "I think this anime series had a perfect mix of it all.\r\nStory: (9)\r\nWhen you get past the first episode the real fun begins. The story is simple, but wouldn't most sports-anime be?\r\nThe episodes flow into a beautiful storyline in which the pace never become particular slow.\r\nAs this has been adapted from a manga and it is 25 episodes long against 120+ chapters there is more than enough material to make sure the pace is at its best and I think it is. The series ending is great considering future events in the manga.\r\nThe games keeps ones attention throughout it and there is no supernatural awesomepower that come into the game out of nowhere that is a deciding factor for the game (luckily) and the interaction between the characters is a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9)\\n\r\nThe art is  just as realistic as the story is, which is a great plus. \\n\r\nAn example of how the art is used is the ongoing symbolism between the team's/school's name \"Karasuno\" and being able to fly, and the execution of this is great. It only gets one anticipation to grow. It sometimes gave me goosebumbs, which is the highest score in my rules. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8)\\n\r\nThe cast chosen as voice actor did an excellent job. Hinata's voiceactor had this highpitched (excited) sound to its voice, while Kageyama's voice actor had a voice completely different from Hinata's. It suited them perfectly,. \\n\r\nAs for the music, it build and helps hold the attention during the matches without taking the spotlight, so shortly put, I think the asyncron sound (love that word) - the music, fitted just fine.\\n\r\nThe opening- and ending songs are also worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10)\\n\r\nThey are believeable. \\n\r\nthe characters are not invincible, they have hardships. \\n\r\nThe maincharacters are not the only ones to who get the attention, to get their story told, even the \"bad guys\" do to. We don't simply get to enjoy some games of volleyball but also the struggle the characters have to get to that point. (even if that is common enough in many sports-anime, but I think it is extremely well done in this one)\\n\r\nThe two main characters - Hinata and Kageyama, are as different as day and light. So even if alot of the characters struggle in the series - main- and supporting cast alike, it is not the same problems, and the characters themselves are vastly different. There is both a joker, a king, and a prince among the characters, which one will come to like for their differences (watching the series one will understand what I mean)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9) and overall score 9\\n\r\n- Realism: There is no extra powers or something else like in some sports-anime that gives it a supernatural edge (critic goes to Kuroko no Basket and Prince of Tennis, only a little to Major)\\n\r\n- The interaction between Hinata and Kageyama. If one cannot laugh at this, half of the enjoyment is cut of. also the other characthers is great to watch, althrough there is one characther who irritates me, but this one gets his story told later on in the manga, NOT the anime\\n\r\n- the  pace of the series. the flow is so natural, so I really think it is a serious plus for this series.\\n",

It's like you can grasp their personality straight from the beginning and they're all likable, even if some aren't the nicest.\r\nThis show was very inspiring. It made me want to play a sport and have a team to rely on. Haikyuu is just really encouragingby making you want to get up and do something. It's funny, refreshing, and you will feel those sad feelings when the team is depressed. But they never stay that way for long and before you know it, you're cheering along to another game!",

            "content": "Wow... I was never really planning on writing a review on MAL, but I just feel compelled to share my thoughts on this breathtaking anime.\r\nStory [ 9/10 ]\r\nIt's everything you would expect in a sport anime, and more. It's a narrative about a school that was once successful, but is on its decline. Now the volleyball team has to rise back from it's grave. But what makes the story of Haikyuu!! stand out for me is how you get engrossed in the development of each character; you actually feel for them. Also, there are twist and turns here and there to keep you on yourtoes! \\n\\n\r\nArt [ 9/10 ]\\n\r\nStunning. The characters were drawn beautifully, facial expressions are on-point, and the in-game animation was choreographed perfectly. Each character has their own special feature so there's no confusion in distinguishing who is who. Only minor problem I noticed is that some shots were reused. \\n\\n\r\nSound [ 10/10 ]\\n\r\nI am absolutely in love with the sound of Haikyuu!! The voice actors did an amazing job really portraying the personality of each character. The OPs and EDs fit the anime very well and are enjoyable. The soundtrack, oh man the soundtrack... it compliments and enhances every scene perfectly; it really hit the feels. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter [ 10/10 ]\\n\r\nBy far my favoirte part about Haikyuu!! From the very first episode, you can already feel the amount of personality that is in this anime. You would expect typical stereotypes brewed into all the characters, but no. Every single character has there own unique personality. And although, they are all on the same journey to greatness, each character has there own back story that shaped them into who they are. You really feel for them and get immersed as soon as you start watching. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [ 11/10 ]\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, I extremely enjoyed Haikyuu!! I honestly was not expecting much from it because I thought it was just going to be another spots anime, but man was I wrong. Haikyuu!! is a rollercoaster of emotions that will have you laughing, crying, and cheering throughout the whole ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [ 10/10 ]\\n\r\nTruly a masterpiece... I would recommend Haikyuu!! to anyone, but especially to people who are fans of sports anime or looking to try one.",

            "content": "Haikyuu is a volleyball anime that tells a story of a not-gifted-in-terms-of-height freshmen high school student named Hinata Shoyo, who dreams to become the next \"little giant\" in volleyball. \r\nJust like any other sports anime, it tells a story of hope and dreams but one thing that sets it apart from other sports anime is the realistic nature of it. Without any supernatural moves like in Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu successfully make the characters' development as real as they can. Hinata's super fast reflexes, Tobio's monstrous tosses, and Nishinoya's great saves can be attain in real life with years of practice and dedication to thesport. \\n\\n\r\nWhat amazed me more than the other sports animes I've watched, Haikyuu delivers the message that nothing is impossible with great work and dedication like Hinata's height disadvantage, but nonetheless excels in the sport he truly loved. And the beautiful photo of what a captain really is, Daichi-kun! To never break down, to never lose hope, and to hold the team until the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that makes Haikyuu unique is the perfect display of volleyball as not only a mere sport but a fight that can only win with a connected team. Tobio character brings this message into light as he slowly learns himself to play as a team, not an individual and to trust his teammates in the game. He even had the best rival and the best partner he can ever wishes for, Hinata! \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu has also this special thing about it; that sets them apart and form a big gap among the other sports animes. Its a rarity for a sport animes to concentrate on the extra characters or those characters who are created merely to make the protagonist/s shine even more brightly. They even have a long part of expressing their regrets and their thoughts about losing, which made me cried a lot because I knew that feeling too well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Haikyuu is a emotional ride of tears, laughter, and frustration that you can feel from the characters, whether main character or extra-character. An anime where you can learn a lot and reflect a lot about your life. \\n\\n\r\n\"There must be thousands of guys in this country, whose last season gets cut short. Winning all the preliminaries and going on to the nationals. If all this were a work of fiction, those guys who go to the nationals would be the protagonists, and the rest of us would just be extras. But regardless, we got to play volleyball\" - Hayato Ikejiri",

            "content": "Alright, I'm going to preface this review by saying that this will for the most part be subjective, with only my final comments justifying why I believe Haikyuu is a 10. \r\nStory (10) : In comparison to the other sports anime I've watched ( KnB, Ippo, Prince of Tennis, Eyeshield, Diamond no Ace) Haikyuu does follow some of it's fellow shows in the genre but also manages to add subtle changes to cliche'd scenes. For another thing it's about freaking Volleyball, which before watching I always thought was lame. In sports anime pacing is a huge factor in determining whether it stands out amongothers, how close the win was, the build up to pivotal play etc. Haikyuu is a master in this regard. I remember being on the edge of my seat, literally sweating at three separate times in one ep during the match against Dateko. Without having any flashy superhero-like moves (looking at you KnB) Haikyuu manages to create countless badass moments while still being completely realistic. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9) : The OPs and EDs I felt were pretty good. I have rewatched the show three times (once while it was airing, and then twice afterwards) and I still sometimes like to watch the OP bc it's so good. (This part is subjective, but idk\u2026 it's pretty good) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter's (10) : All of the character's in Haikyuu, including enemy teams are well developed, and you can see the author put a lot of effort into creating the group dynamics of each team. There is a lot of depth as well as character development for every player on the Karasuno team, and if not for all there are definite hints about future development. I found all the character's to be  extremely lovable, relatable, and cool in their own way. When watching you often see the dialogue between char's in the background even when there are plot related conversations in the foreground. This brought a lot of replay value to the show, every time I re-watched it I picked on more of the smaller minute details that before I may a missed. I have seen this used in other anime as well, but with such a lovable cast Haikyuu's group dynamics never cease to make me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nArt/animation (9) : One of the main aspects of Haikyuu that makes it stand out in general as a anime is it's character design. The character's have rather pointed features that make them sometimes resemble lizards, and very interesting shades of colors. There are chars with different colored hair and eyes, like in many animes, but they have a mellow, almost pastel quality to them that is very distinct (look at Oikawa). I really feel in love with the art style, even though some of my friends have different opinions about this. The production company that made Haikyuu is the same as KnB which should be enough to say about the quality of the action scenes. The shots and movement of characters are very fluid, and make volleyball seem extremely badass. But I must admit, after watching the show 3 times I did notice certain moments where the quality faltered. But this was minor and they never skimped on the parts that mattered. \\n\\n\r\nFInal thoughts/ enjoyment (11) : I really enjoyed this show. I would tentatively say it's my favorite show of all time, definitely my favorite sports anime. Now I know a lot of you may be screaming, \"what about Ippo, or KnB\" and now I will address why I believe Haikyuu is better than them, at least in my opinion. FIrst of all I have watched both shows and while they were both great I have never rewatched Knb, and I have never finished Ippo (which says more about me but nonetheless). I think for me character's play a huge role in my desire to rewatch a show or continue it and Haikyuu definitely has some of my favorite characters.Once again the group dynamics of the team in Haikyuu are the most developed, natural, and hilarious I have seen in any sports anime. One of the parts I always never liked about KnB was the heavy focus on the two MCs, and while there were jokes scattered throughout the show they always seemed pretty standard/cliche to the genre. In Haikyuu the humor was so well integrated into the show that it felt like you were really there with the team and knew all of the inside jokes. I am on the shorter side, and always struggled in basketball because of that so I could easily relate and admire Hinata as a protagonist. The bonds the viewer creates to the characters also helps to heighten the joy when you see the team succeed or get over a hurdle, and the despair when they fall short of victory. For these reasons I would give Haikyuu a 10. I know I said this would be objective but I think I may be impossible. Anyways I would would highly suggest anyone, even if they aren't into sports or anime to watch this. \\n\\n\r\n**Extra side note about it's similarities to KnB: \\n\r\nWhile watching I saw many people would comment about how a lot of the characters' in both shows are similar in function to one another, (Kageyama- Kuroko and Taiga- Hinata) and in response I would say both shows do incorporate the idea that alone they are weak but combined they are awesome, but Haikyuu is much more of a niche. Without each other both players would not succeed nor grow half as much over the course of the show. Kuroko and Taiga could easily be on opposite teams and still flourish. For this reason I think Hinata and Kageyama make a much more interesting pair, playing-wise as well as character-wise.",

I ended up making a all nighter just to finish it. The characters are so well developed and alluring that I found myself almost screaming every time they succeeded or crying when they didn't. In contrast with many of the sports anime out there, Haykyuu is real. It shows the reality of training everyday, of victory and defeat. As a former athlete I could relate to all the experiencesmentioned in the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn my humble opinion the art is amazing. The way the movements flow is great, being volleyball a fast paced sport, the animators managed to show that quite well and without losing quality. Can't really say much more. It's that good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound works very well with the animation and the story, complementing the scenes that don't have any talking characters and adding to the dramatic or fanny moments. The openings and endings are catchy specially the first opening and the second ending! :D\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the show, I felt like I was in my competition days again. It's real and it's funny.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nHope that if you read this you'll give it a try.\\n\\n\r\n:D",

            "content": "In these past few years, there have been a lot of sport manga that have been emerging and are being adapted into anime for good reason. They are great, further justice can only be done to these sports manga if a good animation studio pick them up and Haikyuu was one of the very lucky ones to get picked up by a well-known studio \u201cProduction I.G\u201d. Haikyuu as a sports anime is amazing, thrilling and something that gives a blast from the past of my High-School life revolving around sports and science. \r\nHaikyuu is an anime about high school Volleyball. Now, I don\u2019t play volleyballmuch but watching this show makes me want to start playing. There is the passion of loving a sport, there is the sense of rivalry between team-mates and rival teams alike, the passion and encouragement of great teammates surrounding you and helping you get better every step of the way. There are obstacles to overcome your weakness and so on. You can refer to the synopsis if you want details about the shows plot but to be honest, I feel that if you just watch the first 1st episode you will be hooked and would want to go all the way to 25. \\n\\n\r\nAs an entertainment product, if you enjoy sports you will like this show. It has a well-developed story and it progresses nicely with a flow which is just about right. Animation is solid and I would recommend watching it in either 720p/1080p if you can. It\u2019s by no means perfect but it\u2019s good enough to do justice to the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of this show is really good. It fits the mood really nicely and the tone of some of the OST is very relaxing but also sometimes very intimidating and suspenseful. The animation studio does a really nice job in syncing it properly with the mood of the show which is why it\u2019s good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is extremely enjoyable (for me anyways). I would love to give it a 10/10 but the only problem is that it\u2019s not done yet. There is still much of the story left and I would love to see a second season for this show. As a side note, I personally don't understand why people have the concept of Shonen anime being all about power battles. There is more than one way of fighting a battle, it doesn't always have to be about landing punches and kicks. But that's just me... and with that I end this review. \\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 9/10",

            "content": "Short / Honest / Free of spoilers review\r\nI deliver a fast way to get an opinion about this anime!\r\nI'm not really a fan of sport anime, for one reason: its made in very similar structure and its easy to guess whats going to happen in plot. This anime makes no difference, but it has to offer something that i have rarely saw in other anime over all. \r\nWhat is great in most of sport anime? You get introduced to some type of sport and it shows how that sport works in pro world. Who could thought that volleyball is so complex and strategic ? Notme for sure. (unless some rules are made up, i hope not)\\n\\n\r\nSo what is so great about this anime and why should you watch it you may ask? Do you hate cardboard characters (boring, plane, and useless)? Well there are only few of them here and you won't even notice them. Great thing for sport anime which has a lot of characters. So you have pile of different, interesting characters who complete each other in some way. \\n\\n\r\nShow it self is really funny, but it can be sad, serious too if it wants to. You will notice that not only teams fights with each other, but single players will have inner conflicts and personal fights with other team members. Players evolving in the middle of the match, not only after and before games. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if my memory is not wrong, this is the first anime which shows how loosing team feels. (But wait reviewer dude, we saw that 100 times) Well only from protagonist perspective, but what about teams that lost to protagonist? This anime creates a wold and shows more, not only main characters. Dialogs get interrupted by random figures, you get to see what is going on in different places that has nothing to do with characters or plot. It makes this anime to feel alive, like a real place. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end i would recommend this anime for all. Even if you don't like sport anime, I think you could give it a shot. Its not the best thing you could watch, but it still is a fun/interesting way to spend your time.\\n\\n\r\n(I had even more stuff to talk about in this anime, but i wanted to make this review as short as possible, when most of review are like books some one needs to make a flyer. Joke! )",

I have so much thoughts i want to express!\r\nHi! I have to say, this is my first review here, so if you want you can run away fromit AHAHAHAH. Really i don\u2019t mind if you won\u2019t read aaaall of this because it\u2019s boring, i wrote it especially for me (cathartic purposes). But PLEASE! Give this show a shot. PLEASE!! You won\u2019t regret it (hopefully). PLEASE!!!\\n\\n\r\n-STORY: 9/10 (AND MY OPINION ON THE SPORT GENRE LIMITATIONS)\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to lie to you, its Premise is cliche and not \u201coriginal\u201d. Actually, is the Apotheosis of Simplicity: basically an underdog tale. You all have watched something like this at least once, right? yes and No.\\n\r\nIt may be cliche, but i took some cinematography classes, so i\u2019m a strong believer (like, SUPER STRONG BELIEVER), that is for 90% the EXECUTION what makes a show/movie/whatever worth and great, not its premise. A theorically interesting premise can end up being shit, or vice-versa. So, i want to \u201cexplain\u201d why Haikyuu!!, despite having a cliche premise, not only succeeds, but excels (for me, obv) in its genre and in general too. The universe the story takes place in doesn\u2019t glorify volleyball, nobady is gaining Super Sayian power ups to make things more extraordinary than they need to be and the major climactic payoffs can be something as simple as \u201cone payer learning to block one smash\u201d. This may seem simple but Haikyuu proves itself with HOW it executes these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSport genre: who critices Haikyuu!! for being cliche and predictable, really doesn\u2019t get how HARD to execute is the sport genre. No lying, this might be worst genre to handle for a mangaka, because of hoy difficult it is to maintain it interesting for a long time, and particularly it\u2019s the work of a God regarding Haikyuu!! which is a fucking long-runner, meant to have hundreds of chapters. This genre has a lot of limitations and restrictions that other genres don\u2019t. The characters in Haikyuu can\u2019t travel around the world exploring new and interesting places like other genres do. It\u2019s really hard to draw a lot of volleyball matches and make every match look \u201cunique\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d from another, because the setting (field) is always the same and so are the volleyball possible moves. It must be hard for a mangaka not to be repetitive in drawing a large amount of matches, but matches can\u2019t be eliminated because the genre requires them.\\n\\n\r\nPredictability is not a flaw per se (unless this is a detective story), but it\u2019s better if something is surprising, right? Of course. Unfortunately, in the Sport Genre (long-runner) the predictability simply CAN\u2019T BE TOTALLY AVOIDED because of the genre.\\n\r\nPlease, think about it: if you make a show where the formula of one loss equals elimination, losing means no championship, and without it there is no show. So, it\u2019s near impossible for the protagonist team to lose because as i said before, if they do there is no show. You have to deal with it.\\n\\n\r\n!!!!!IN CONCLUSION!!!!!:\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s very difficult to create a TRUE sense of tension in this genre\u2026 BUT.\\n\r\nBut Haikyuu!! is actually able to provide an amazing feeling during the matches in a way that is utterly brilliant and makes it one of my favorites anime and piece of medium of all time.\\n\r\nHow does it? Haikyuu creates tension by GIVING THE OPPOSITE TEAM A REASON TO ROOT FOR THEM, breaking the cliched \"Protagonist/good \u2013 Antagonist/bad\" theme. Yes, Karasuno is favored team, but opposite teams aren\u2019t portrayed as mean and rude \u201cvillains\u201d bump in the road on the way to the top.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu gives them amazing traits, quirks and a decent development that once everything is reveald makes you question: \u201cWho I REALLY want to win?\u201d\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why Haikyuu stands out, it not only makes you care about the teams Karasuno is playing against, but this attachment creates a new sense of tension that it\u2019s alright and makes you forget about the almost inevitable defeat.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what i\u2019m trying to say is: the unavoidable trait of \u201cnever losing\u201d, nearly impossible to get rid of it, makes the sport genre an incredible difficult genre to create amazing tension in, BUT instead of doing the impossible eliminating this all together, Haikyuu puts this element in the farthest corner of your mind, and doing this means that Haikyuu is able to BREAK THE MOLD OF THE SPORTS GENRE.\\n\\n\r\nTHE RIGHT EXPLOITATION OF A LONG-TERM PLOTTING:\\n\r\nThings are casually shown or mentioned in earlier seasons that show up later and may even evolve into major events. It's a sort of quiet foreshadowing -- you see it as part of the current happenings and don't even realize how significant it will become in 30 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCOMEDY:\\n\r\nHonestly, it\u2019s hilarious. The perfect balance between comedy and \u201cdrama\u201d. The goofy moments never undercut the seriousness or break the tension. It was always a hit and rarely a miss.\\n\\n\r\nFun fact: i was in the bus watching one episode, the none of the characters did something and\u2026 i couldn\u2019t help but laugh HARD, bur REALLY. I usually laugh \u201cin the inside\u201d or i smile at best. It\u2019s so rare i actually LAUGH for fiction, but that time i couldn\u2019t really stop and everyone stared at me like i was crazy. One of the most awkward moment in my life :\u2019(\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTERS: 9.5/10 (My cinematography teacher was right: You DON\u2019T need complexity to be great)\\n\\n\r\n(Super small detail: Haikyuu has 0 (really ZERO) fanservice with sexism and sexualization. The female characters here are traited with RESPECT unlike the 99% of anime in existence where the girls are constantly portrayed with huge boobs that make other girls jealous of them. Strong positive.)\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a really lazy person, REALLY. I never liked sport, doing it or watching it. But THESE CHARACTERS are the reason why now i could accept to play some volleybal \u201cmatches\u201d for fun, instead of avoiding them. The characters, the author, the anime and the producers of it really love volleyball or at least respect it, and it shows a lot.\\n\\n\r\nMany times they accomplished to show and talk about volleyball stuff like roles and moves in a kinda poetic way that truly made me understand deeply the passion for this sport, and how is not the \u201csingle\u201d that matters the most, but the whole team.\\n\r\nAs i explained, the key here is wiritng characters that we GENUINELY CARE ABOUT, to the point where we become as passionate as they are for archieving their objectives.\\n\\n\r\nFinding characters compelling naturally makes us care about whatever they care about. So they are basically using empathy as a narrative tool. That\u2019s why ultimately the stake doesn\u2019t matter, if it\u2019s the fate of the universe or a simple game of volleyball. \\n\r\n\u201cStakes\u201d aren\u2019t proportioned by the magnitude of the \u201cdisaster\u201d, but by the importance of it in THE EYES OF THE CHARACTERS. There are many movies about distruction, but we just are disconnected from all the explosions because the characters don\u2019r care about (or maybe we don\u2019t care about them).\\n\\n\r\nBut WHY did we end up CARING about these characters to begin with?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe because they are endearing to watch (Hinita\u2019s enthusiasm, Kageyama\u2019s smugness\u2026), but this may be very subjective about which types of characters i like or not. So, is there something OBJECTIVE that explains why the majority of the viewers care about them? YES, there\u2019s an objective reason (i will explain it the art/animation section).\\n\\n\r\nJust like many other anime, Haikyuu has a semi-huge cast of secondary characters: the Karasuno players. But unlike most of the others, these characters are not underdeveloped. Actually, Haikyuu might have one of the most well-assorted and brilliantly handled cast of characters. They are not the most complicated or layered ever seen, but this has never been a requirement or a \u201cparameter\u201d to judge the quality of a piece of medium.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is, of course, special in some ways, BUT he is not the one who saves the day nor most talented one (and will never become). Is he good at volleyball or strong? \u2026Ehm. But he is necessary in a way that is masterfully handled by the author, despite him not being objectively \u201cstrong\u201d in a conventional way. But he is necessary for the team, and NOT ONLY HIM.\\n\r\nUsually, teammates are often forgotten or only used as pawns in sport shows, but in Haikyuu NO ONE IS LEFT OUT.\\n\r\nEach temmate in the cast is given a role, a strenght they build upon and grow as people because of, and most important, just like in real sport teams, they are all connected to each other.\\n\\n\r\nEach character is also given a good amount of personal development as well corresponding to the role on the team.\\n\r\nEVERY PLAYER has its own very moment to shine and show his ability, and, most important, every player is necessary for the victory.\\n\r\nAnd this happens not only with the protagonist team, but the ANTAGONIST TEAMS as well (Episodes 16 of S1 and 23/24 of S2 are the peak of it and true masterpieces). Also the \u201cmain\u201d antagonist (Oikawa) is a genuinely well-written character and it shows in the 2 seasons.\\n\r\nAlso, the interactions between the players of the protagonist team feel extremely genuine and realistic, but even better are the interactions between them and the antagonist teams: their personalities reflect in each other and thus creates interesting social situations or funny banters.\\n\r\nHaikyuu always keeps you interested merely because you see two sides of the story. You know the struggle and passion of both the protagonists AND the antagonists. The screentime of them is not given too minimal  to feel uninteresting and not given too much to where it feels overbearing. So, the protagonists success is even more rewarding and exciting when they beat someone with an equal amount of work and passion. This show and manga truly shows the importance of characters in a story. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters of course want to get better at volleyball but on top of that thay are also dealing with adolescence, expectations of each other and of themselves, self-esteem issues, school life and uncertainty of the future. CHARACTERS OF HAIKYUU DON\u2019T MERELY CHANGE, THEY GROW.\\n\r\nWhat is so damn impressive i show Haikyuu manages to give this meticulous traitement to a cast that spend the majority of time playing or talking about volleyball.\\n\r\nSo far Haikyuu has had 60 episodes and all of the characters still feel oddly fresh. That\u2019s because the show knows when to focus on which characters that way that everybody get the time they need to find their place within the narrative.\\n\r\nOf course writing and directing are both strong elements when it comes to crafting characters that we care about, but let\u2019s not forget that ANIME IS A VISUAL MEDIUM. Is there anything in Haikyuu\u2019s visuals that makes us care about the characters even more? YES.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: 11/10  (Very important FOR VALID STORYTELLING REASONS)\\n\\n\r\nWell, the show does a lot of different things with its visuals: the simplistic cartoony moments for comedic purposes, the \u201ci can\u2019t believe this is not an anime film\u201d levels of animation, and there are some visual metaphors too (crows).\\n\\n\r\nBut, what does Haikyuu do visually that is UNIQUE TO IT IN THE VISUAL PRESENTATION?\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER DESIGNS\\n\r\nThe style that they are drawn in really unique, they look different from every other anime which suffer from \u201cSame face Syndrome\u201d. Haikyuu\u2019s designs manage to look very distinct while still looking like anime characters. And\u2026\\n\\n\r\n-EXPRESSIONS (the most important thing)\\n\r\nFacial expressions in animation is one hell of a challenge.\\n\r\nUnlike real faces which have THOUSANDS of different details and lines, anime characters consist of just a few. This could called the \u201cSame Expression Syndrome\u201d. In anime, most of the times it just feels like there has been used templates for each emotion.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is: if you ask a hundred different people to smile, you don\u2019t get five different types of smiles, you get a HUNDRED. Every person looks slightly different when they express an emotion.\\n\r\nAnd Haikyuu has managed to showcase this in the animation. When Haikyuu\u2019s characters express an emotion it doesn\u2019t feel superficial or like it is drawn off of a template, it feels real! Like a REAL person is emoting something, like the expression is UNIQUE TO THEIR CHARACTERS, and that is INCREDIBLY ENDEARING. Distinct and believable facial expressions help selling a character\u2019s emotions (like Hinata\u2019s stare in episode 1).\\n\r\nThe expressions of Haikyuu\u2019s characters speak volumes of who they are and they make us remember them long after the game is over.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing to say, the sound is good and of course it makes the show better, but it\u2019s not an important aspect to me unless it is very good or very bad. Also, the voice acting\u2019s are just fantastic and \u201cgive life\u201d to the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION, ENJOYMENT: 11/10\\n\r\nThis might be the most enjoyable show i\u2019ve seen. And as i clearly explained (hopefully!), Haikyuu is a great show that makes you care about the characters for subjective but also objective reasons, that exploited animation and visual storytelling to present visual metaphors, and that has a \u201ccliche\u201d story with such a masterpiece of execution, despite all the limitation of the sport genre that i mentioned preaviously.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion this is an anime that should not be passed up, it is one of my most memorable shows for creating tension in innovative ways in a genre which i preaviously thought to be impossible, as well as making a diverse team where everyone has a role to play and feels like a genuine sports team. And this is why i recommend this show to literally everyone.\\n\r\nI know nobody will read this fucking long stream of consciousness, but somehow if you decided to watch this show because of my \u201creview\u201d (or whatever reason), feed me back, it\u2019s always a pleasure to share opinions about such a great and important (for me) piece of art.\\n\r\nP.S. I won\u2019t write reviews again, this was terribly exhausting ahahah",

            "content": "I had my reservations going into this one. I was just getting into sports anime at the time, and I came across this one looking for another great one to watch. The only image I saw of it beforehand was Hinata and Kageyama doing their setter and spiker poses in front of an orange and black backdrop. For some reason, my instincts were telling me that I really needed to watch this one, whilst the rest of me was questioning what was so good about volleyball anyway. \r\nI am really glad I have such great instincts, because this anime is a gem.\r\nFirst of all, youdon't need any prior knowledge of volleyball; Takeda-san, faculty advisor for Karasuno's volleyball team, acts as an audience surrogate. He knows basically next to nothing about volleyball when the anime begins, but slowly and surely he starts to learn and we learn alongside him; the positions, the rotations on the court, all the moves that setters, spikers and middle blockers perform. \\n\\n\r\nThe reoccurring theme amongst sports anime is that they push the sports to the side for a while and focus on characterisation. This, I believe, is why a lot of people relate more to sports anime than, say, actual sports. On television, when watching live-action sports, we know next to nothing about the players unless we do some hardcore research. In sports anime, you get acquainted and attached to all sorts of characters as you go on this journey with them.\\n\\n\r\nHere, we have our two focal characters; Hinata Shouyou and Kageyama Tobio, two volleyball fanatics on separate spectrums of ability; Hinata has amazing reflexes and an almost inhuman jumping ability, but his skills as a volleyball player are poor at best, but he aims to be the Ace of the team primarily given to a spiker. He's far removed from his full potential. And then there's Kageyama, a genius player who can basically play all positions with ease, and focuses his overwhelming talent on the setter position, which unifies the team. \\n\\n\r\nThese two are backed up by well-rounded characters on both their team and others, topped off with a coach that uses alcohol analogies to describe things to minors, a shy female manager that evokes the jealousy of those on opposite teams with male managers. Sometimes we only see minor characters for maybe one episode, but every single person that appears on screen has a personality, a back story that helps you connect to them. Characterisation is a strong point in Haikyuu!!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is really smooth, too! There are some parts where I just have to go back and watch it over and over because I am in love with how it looks. Admittedly I can only watch videos in 360p so I don't get to see the art at its best, but even at that quality you can really see the detail and the amount of care that went into every single frame. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is amazing too; especially the opening songs. I don't think I've skipped over them more than about twice, not counting the episodes I clicked on just to skip to my favourite parts. When the music kicks in, usually in a pivotal moment, you're on the edge of your seat waiting with bated breath to see what happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a solid 10/10. I caught up with the manga, so I cannot wait to see my favourite parts get animated in the second season which airs in October. Definitely one of the best sports anime out there!",

            "content": "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS \r\nFirst off, when i started watching this anime, I didn't expect much. Well i expected something but not really that much. I have a fondness for sports anime but i was quite hesitant to start this anime. I mean it's just volleyball, i don't even have the slightest interest in it how can i really relish it. Well, it turns out that i was erroneous. SO so wrong. It seems that i was watching a contender for Anime of the year. This anime is the type of anime to make you want to play the sport no matter how much you suckat it. This anime is the type to make you want to try out for your local team.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story was flawless. It began with Hinata and Kageyama not getting along, and when they finally bonded, then the bigger picture loomed: getting to nationals. The entire way there was filled with good plot. New characters that were introduced were actually well developed and fit into the story (not just randomly thrown in just because). The main characters had character development, the side characters had character development, everyone was getting character development.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is very, very elegant. It doesn't look half-done at all (which was the problem I had with a lot of sports animes) and the characters actually look different, instead of having all the same face but with different hair and eye color. (...) Some have sharp features, some have soft, and they're all built differently so they actually seem like a group of real people. \\n\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely the best part of the show. A good Op and ED is always something i appreciate in shows, but most of the times they come up short and i end up skipping them. That is not the case in Haikyuu, at least not for the ED. A pretty good OP and amazing ED makes this show even more of a bliss to watch. But the best part of the sound department is the OST. It's really good. I don't usually take to much notice to the background music in animes, but sometimes a show has some really outstanding tracks in the OST that just fits perfectly into the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, here's the aspect where Haikyuu!! particularly shines in compared to most other sports anime, or anime in general: its characters. Everyone is realistic and nonuniform. Hinata Shouyou, who would naturally seem like the never give up and naturally gifted character, is actually just a young boy who's really passionate about volleyball but has only subpar abilities (barring speed and jumping). Kageyama Tobio has exceptional characterization in that one would think he was the cold and aloof kind of person, especially with the rumors of being the \"King of the Court\". And yes, he did seem like a jerk in the beginning, but he turned out to just be someone who was merely misunderstood. He wasn't at all kingly. A little bit selfish, yes, but overall just an awkward, socially inept guy who's a genius at volleyball and just as passionate about it as Hinata. And no, he's not quiet and aloof at all. Far from it, actually. Naturally, these two end up meeting as rivals, and eventually they form a duo. It's at the formation of this duo, where Hinata is the \"light\" and Kageyama is the \"shadow,\" where Kageyama's characterization really develops, because you see him actually making an eventual effort to think of someone else (ie. Hinata) instead of himself.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I could talk about these two forever as well as the other amazing characters of Haikyuu, but in general, everyone is basically three dimensional and even the smallest background characters get backstories of some sort. It's hard to hate anyone because there isn't a reason to hate them. They're all just like people; they have their bad sides, but they have their good sides too. There isn't an \"evil\" team, and that's what's so amazing about it. Everyone just really wants to play volleyball, and sometimes, because all the characters are so lovable, it's surprisingly hard to pick who to root for sometimes!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was tremendously great, yet not perfect. Referring to animes such as Kuroko no basket or Free , and many more the plot had a similar feeling to it. In Kuroko no basket they lose and that\u2019s the end of the season, Free same thing, and for Haikyuu it was very predictable that the same concept would be applied in this situation. Now I haven\u2019t read the manga but my guess is for season two the come back and beat the previous school they lost to. But the plot had its positive sides, it had a ton of character development, a team that has great potential but don\u2019t start off too well, and most of all a great pace.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu was one of the year\u2019s best anime and one of the best sport animes of all time. It had a great story and everything more. Very little flaws which is expected because no anime is perfect. Character development was on point! You get to learn about every character and their weakness. No character is overpowered and ruins the show. Overall, I had a great time watching Haikyuu and even though i\u2019m not a big fan of volleyball this had me wanting to play in real life! Great anime, I recommend to anyone starting to watch sport animes.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cI may be small, but I can jump!\u201d - Shouyou Hinata\r\nOh no, Japan has gone and done it again.  I honestly didn't think it was possible to make an equivalent impact as Ping Pong the Animation in terms of intensity and inspiration within a sports anime, but Haikyuu! came awfully damn close.  Debuting in 2014, the same year as Ping Pong, this anime initially gave off the \u201ctypical sports\u201d aura to me, and I actually avoided it.  There's so many out there these days, it can be hard to distinguish yourself, but for relatively rookie director Susumu Mitsunaka, he nailed it.Haikyuu! is an intricately crafted, intense and motivational story about high school students maturing and finding themselves through the medium of volleyball.  The art style is crisp and the characters are endearing, making Haikyuu! that much more enjoyable overall.  I agree that while some could be quick to give it a 10, I will refrain due to some minor issues I had with the series.  On with the review.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story in this anime focuses around Shouyou Hinata and initial rival player, Tobio Kageyama.  The two first meet at Hinata's first and last middle school match, in which he finally convinces enough of his friends to enter a tournament with him.  They are completely overwhelmed by Kageyama's team, but more importantly, Hinata gets a taste of what playing volleyball in a real tournament atmosphere is all about.  He was inspired and motivated to play the sport by watching the success story of Karasuno High School's \u201cLittle Giant\u201d during a spring tournament in Tokyo.  It gave Hinata real hope that someone of his size could eventually prosper in the sport, normally dominated by those of taller stature.  More importantly, Kageyama takes notice of Hinata's spunk and stamina, and the two become overnight rivals as a result.  Hinata wants to grow as a volleyball player and one day surpass Kageyama's skill.  I thought this intro was written very well, and although Hinata's first tournament ended almost as soon as it started, it gave you real insight into his energetic personality.  It also gave the viewers  glimpse of Kageyama's raw skill on the court.  The plot unfolds as the two enter high school, ironically on the same volleyball team, but for very different reasons.  Many teammates have difficulty playing to Kageyama's tempo, and as a result have disowned him, whereas Hinata went to Karasuno to follow in the footsteps of his idol.  The look on their faces when they realized they were now teammates was pure gold.  That whole scene was executed beautifully.  The rest of their volleyball team is broken, but through seeing Hinata and Kageyama's awkward, but unique cohesion, the team begins to form around them in an effort to catapult Karasuno back to their former glory.    \\n\\n\r\nWhere Haikyuu! really stood out to me in terms of story was balancing the wins and the losses.  There are too many anime that take the overpowered approach, where you know the main characters are going to come out on top every time (No Game No Life/Sword Art Online for example).  When the characters end up losing matches, you truly FEEL the heartache they have.  The intensity of each scene leading up to the match point is raw and believable.  Anyone who's played sports competitively can relate to the plethora of emotions you can feel during a match... and just how quickly the tides can change in the race to victory.  From what I understand, this anime was adapted quite well from the manga too, giving great credit to the source material.  The pacing alternates throughout the series, but I can say that although slow, the pacing of the last match in the anime was incredible and needed.  I could actually feel my chest tightening during certain moments of that match, and it left me with a strong outlook on the series' future.  Even the opposing school's players were treated as real characters.  Much like with Ping Pong's Kong and Kaizama, Haikyuu! made it a point to give the viewers a backstory to most of Karasuno's opponents.  Rather than get pissed off when the main characters lost, you kind of gained a sense of respect for the rival schools.  I found myself saying, \u201cAre they gonna go there?  Are they gonna explore the 'villains?\u201d  They definitely went there, and it made the story that much better.\\n\\n\r\nI was so excited when I heard there was a second season of this show as well.  It didn't necessarily end on a cliffhanger, but more so paved a street for the second season to drive down.  It got me pumped up.  There are too many shows out nowadays that forcefully end on cliffhangers in hope of getting enough funding for a second season and end up being mediocre, standalone animes as a result, so I am grateful that Haikyuu! didn't take that approach.  The only areas I could think of for the second season to improve is to add more backstory to the supporting cast and uncover more about Karasuno's former glory days.  Overall, the series does a great job balancing serious moments with a healthy dose of comedy, and I actually found myself laughing on more than a few occasions.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Haikyuu! bring a healthy amount of complexity to the series.  The main characters Hinata and Kageyama play off each other quite well due to their polar opposite personality types.  Hinata is jovial and excited, whereas Kageyama is dry and focused.  Needless to say, he doesn't get along with many people.  The fact that they end up locking in a strange synergistic play style makes their relationship even more dynamic.  It's nice to see their bond grow stronger as the series progresses, as Hinata becomes more serious while Kageyama's arrogance comes down a few pegs and he starts to give teammates compliments.  Hinata's energy makes his such an enjoyable character, and even though the plot isn't focused entirely on him, I feel that the show would be average without him.  His comic relief is refreshing and can come at the most random, but well timed moments.  As previously mentioned, the development of the opposing players that Karasuna faces is short but effective.  It is normally done mid-match, but adds to the emotional aspect of whether or not you want to see them lose.  It's written very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is incorporated well, but many lack significant development.  The other first year players Tsukishima and Yamaguchi are first introduced as friends who challenge Hinata and Kageyama.  Tsukishima is an intelligent but uncooperative individual, who adds random sarcasm throughout the series, but there was literally no effort into exploring his backstory.  I'd like to find out why he is the way he is, but I might have to wait until season two for that.  I almost entirely forgot that Yamaguchi even existed until he reappeared in the final match.  The other members of Karasuno are introduced with small amount of backstory, but aren't really explored again other than for the occasional side comment or joke.  Most notably is the libero, Nishinoya, who ended up being kicked out of the club for reasons that aren't really discussed, other than plot convenience.  I'd also like some character development to emerge from him.  Possibly the largest lack of character depth is from that of Karasuno's captain, Daichi.  He seems so caring and passionate about the game, but it doesn't really go any farther than that.  Oh, and there's the random addition of the teacher and other third year hottie that do almost nothing for the series.  Again, I don't want to come across like I hated the character development, but I just would like some expansion on many of the members of Karasuno in the second season.  I think some of the time spent on action sequences could've been better utilized to go in depth into the character's backstories.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound in Haikyuu! are both fantastic.  I like the character models a lot.  The way the animation will zoom in on their expressions before they execute a powerful volleyball move is excellent and fluid.  Might I add that the action sequences themselves are atmospheric and intense.  Either the director himself played volleyball or had an expert weigh in while writing the script, because even though I've only ever watched a few games myself, I think he was right on the money.  Even the character's voices appear to echo like they're actually in a gymnasium.  I also like how Hinata is drawn.  He's made to look like no other character in the show, with his orange spiky hair.  I mean, what is it with the Japanese and orange/auburn hair colors???  The sound effects used in the games themselves sounded incredibly realistic, and made you feel like you were actually there in person.  Both OPs were alright, and they gave a positive outlook on the show's energy.  The EDs weren't anything special, and I found myself skipping them most of the time.  The rest of soundtrack was uplifting and fast paced.  It gave a strong sense of life to the action sequences during matches.  I really liked the voice actors in Haikyuu! as well.  Kaito Ishikawa (One Punch Man, Zankyou no Terror) delivers again as Kageyama and his hard-toned, sarcastic mannerisms, while Ayumu Murase (Gangsta, Gatchaman Crowds) kills it as Hinata, and it seems like he actually stepped out of his comfort zone for this role.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Haikyuu! is an extremely enjoyable anime.  I definitely never got the vibe that it was overrated in any way.  It lives up to its hype, and I repeat... I do NOT watch sports animes.  (You can check my anime list!)  I would strongly recommend this series to casual anime fans as well as serious critics who are looking for something a little bit different to mix things up.  If I could sum up Haikyuu! in one word, it would be \u201cfun\u201d.  It's jam-packed with emotional and inspirational matches which help to strengthen the bond you have with the characters.  The art is vibrant and the sound is realistic and consuming.  If more attention is given to the Karasuno player's character development, this second season has the ability to skyrocket up my favorites list.  It seems like my opinion of sports animes is starting to change little by little....  Thanks for reading!",

The animation has an high quality, the sounds are absolutely amazing. Even the openings and the edings are great. Only a words for to describe this anime; Absolutely Perfect. Only a thing is very negative in all this. The fandom is very suck. Some of the people in the fandom bothered so much the other fans. Like, \"Oh your ship sucks!\" \"My ship is more canon than yours!\"etc..  they don't love the real official series but only fant art or dounjinshi. we don't tell them of don't loving the fan art or doujinshi 'cause we love it too, but they should appreciate more the official stuff or/and don't bother other fans with hatred and resentment.\\n\r\nHaikyuu!! really feels different for us that we don't even care of that kind of fandom anymore. we wanna really do watch the sport anime for the story and characters development and 'cause we love so much this sport. \\n\r\nwe can't wait to watch the fourth season!",

            "content": "Haikyuu manages to strike a happy medium between the conventional shonen sports anime and something more realistic, which leaves out the hyperbolic special techniques of manga like Eyeshield 21 or overt melodrama. It is, above all else, solid and and a competent piece of work. \r\nAs with most sports animes, the plot isn't particularly unusual or exciting - the genre is limited to a pretty standard formula of introduction, practice matches, training, a tournament arc, and repeating the process. The characters are also largely drawn from the typical mould - a cool, highly talented loner, a solid and experienced captain, a kind senpai with wisdomto balance out his lack of talent, an enthusiastic and slightly delinquent-ish enforcer - but they manage to be fleshed out and distinguished beyond their stereotypes. The protagonist, Shoyo Hinata, is arguably the least interesting character, being that there's nothing beneath his earnest and naive volleyball-loving surface, but the rest of the cast makes up for him in spades.\\n\\n\r\nKageyama (\"King\") is highly talented and aloof, and in another anime this would be the end of our insight into him, but Haikyuu gives him the familiar neuroses of a high-strung perfectionist who couldn't accomodate his team and wound up alone, and also gives him a satisfying arc by showing him learning to step outside his shell and grow as a person. Another conventional feature of sports anime - a player's position being in some way a metaphor for their personality - is used throughout Haikyuu in a far more interesting way than we'd usually get. As the aggressive and antisocial type, Kageyama would usually be a spiker, but as the setter, he needs to be able to provide service to his teammates in a way that brings out everyone's full potential - to do his job well, he needs to actually communicate and get to know them. \\n\\n\r\nThe most magnetic of the side characters in this season, Oikawa, is a former senpai of Kageyama's, and a thoroughly unpleasant, smug, cocky, and psychologically insightful guy, who uses his ability to read people to vicious effect in games. But despite all those seemingly-villainous attributes, he too is a setter, and in his masterful ability to connect with his team, he demonstrates a maturity which makes him more complicated than you might assume. That ability to provide a surprising dimension to seemingly-flat characters is present throughout Haikyuu, which finds a way to make everyone feel a little real. \\n\\n\r\nTanaka might be a bit of a delinquent, but he's also comically elated by being called senpai, and his superficial (but hilarious) idiocy hides mature resolve and a surprising amount of wisdom. Karasuno's team advisor Takeda might be a volleyball amateur, but he shows both wisdom and adorable ingenuity and perseverance in making sure they get the best practice matches. Unlike the drama resulting misunderstandings and standoffish idiocy in a lot of other media aimed at Haikyuu's demographic, the characters in Haikyuu talk to each other and communicate constructively to reach a shared understanding and help the team. \\n\\n\r\nAside from its characters, Haikyuu's other main strength is its keen sense of development - where you might initially think \"Why doesn't he just spike it like THIS?\" of Shoyo's early stumbles in matches, later training and innovation on his part (and others) show an evolution in techniques and strategy which makes volleyball seem genuinely interesting - and I say that as someone with no interest in it. The key to a good narrative is following premises to their logical conclusions, and when it comes to character development, Haikyuu demonstrates growth and change on the part on almost everyone in response to their changing circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nRather than flaws, what keeps Haikyuu from being a masterpiece are its limitations - the limitations of conventional shonen sports anime and a focus on the sport itself which doesn't allow for the concerns of real life to intrude on it. One of the things that struck me as surprising near the end of the season was the third-years conferring with a guidance counsellor about whether they should keep going with club activities or focus on their exam - this shouldn't have been a surprise at all, as it makes perfect sense, but Haikyuu is so laser-focused on the sport that you gain no understanding of what lives Shoyo, Kageyama, Daichi, Tanaka, Oikawa, or the other characters lead when away from the court and the gym. The fact that it's able to make them engaging (for the most part) despite this is impressive, but given the grounded realism of Haikyuu - its lack of overly flashy techniques and the relatively subdued nature of its characters, who all (besides maybe Shoyo) seem like people you might've known in school - some details of the world outside volleyball would have helped make it even more real and immersive. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, as it stands, Haikyuu is a well-put-together anime with a strong grasp of traditional narrative techniques and solid characterisation and development, as well as excellent animation and an attractive art style. It's a good advertisement for the value of the medium, and that's more than enough.",

Together they make a unique attack called \"irrelevant fast attack\", that is only them who can manage that attack. The attack became even more powerful in season 2. Where Hinata and Kageyama had a fight, because Hinata wants to also be able to play by himself. And yeah, probably they both trained hard as hell, and they made an even stronger bond than they had before. \r\nI love this anime man. Otakus.

            "content": "\"Teamwork makes the dream work.\"\r\n-Anonymous\r\nFirst of all, let me come out and say that I have never played volleyball in my entire life, and prior to watching haikyuu, I had just about no knowledge concerning volleyball, or haikyuu the manga.\r\nI first came to know it because for every episode of Chihayafuru (another sports anime that isn't a major game), comments kept telling me that Chihayafuru was a good competitor against Haikyuu, and being a Chihayafuru fan myself, I was interested.\r\nThe overall theme of Haikyuu is volleyball, but there is little to no leading female characters in the whole anime. The main focus team consists ofmale, and I was a little skeptic that the infamous sport for women was played by men, and was a little worried that some feminist viewers might take this the wrong way.\\n\r\nWhile holding this skepticism, I started watching Haikyuu.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nAnd what a great choice it was.\\n\r\nA sports anime tends to follow the general trend of genius transfer-team problems and reconciliation-infinite wins. Although this increasingly mild out throughout the years, the general structure of any sports anime, or sports tv show, for that matter, follows this trend. And, Haikyuu was, arguably, also a follower of this combination.\\n\r\nBut?\\n\r\nOne word that sums up Haikyuu would be \"climax\". Every episode, every minute, every second of this anime feels like the climax and keeps the viewers on the edges of the seats at all times. Every second, the anime builds up to the result of this move, and shows the result of that move. Every other second, the anime makes the viewers ask, \"What happened?\" \"What'll Hinata/Kageyama do now?\" \"What was that?\" \"What will happen?\"\\n\r\nBesides the thrill of watching haikyuu, there is the theme that I could not like more that the anime holds almost religiously, which is the fact that VOLLEYBALL CANNOT BE PLAYED ALONE.\\n\r\nOn the surface, it is a \"duh\" idea. Volleyball needs at least two spikers, a libero and a setter. Volleyball has to be at least played by two people.\\n\r\nBut this is what makes this anime awesome.\\n\r\nAlthough this has disappeared over the years, sports anime tend to show an overly talented main character who takes care of everything, or the op main character in layman's term. In fact, this is a trend that is not just in sports anime but in all kinds of anime in general. Now, before we see an anime, we almost have to make an assumption that the main character is going to solve the problem.\\n\r\nThis is NEVER shown in Haikyuu.\\n\r\nSure, we have two \"centers\" of the story, Hinata and Kageyama, and they provide a mild solution to the problem, but the show still does not make these two solve every problem they encounter. Haikyuu respects the other characters and lets other players shine as well. In fact, the show makes it so that if the two main characters try to solve everything on their own, problems arise and they ultimately fail.\\n\r\nI could not like this cliche-breaker more.\\n\r\nThe only small problem this had was simple.\\n\r\nThis is not the end.\\n\r\nI was...for the lack of better term, teased to my nth degree and left hanging.\\n\r\nHowever, I say it is a small problem because I can almost forgive it. I have enjoyed the show as it was when it aired, and could not ask for a better time management. In fact, if this anime rushed and finished the whole thing before I could understand what was going on, I would have given this a 1/10. So, I did not mind the lack of an ending, but i still want the sequel.\\n\r\nAs for the actual volleyball itself, as I said, I never liked or watched volleyball and knew close to nothing about the rules of volleyball, and yet I still liked it. The anime guided the viewers nicely through the terminologies that non-volleyball viewers would know, and made sure that everyone knew what was going on.\\n\r\nFor this, I give 10 out of 10 for story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nFreakin' SPYAIR.\\n\r\nFor those who don't know who these guys are, go to google and type Samurai Heart, buy mp3 and play the shit out of it.\\n\r\nThe other songs were nice too, including the second part's ending, which was a nice head-chiller after getting hyped from the awesomeness of the actual episode.\\n\r\nThe first ending was beautiful as well, but not as good as the second ending. The opening for the second was not as great as the first either, so overall I give 9 for OP/ED.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice actors, I could not ask for a better voice actor for Kageyama and Nishinoya, and I was quite surprised that an anime with a voice staff this big could get such a fitting voice for each character.\\n\r\nProblem is Hinata.\\n\r\nI personally had no problem with Hinata's voice, but I could understand when people say that his voice was annoying, as I felt that way at the start as well. He is not bad at pronunciation or anything, but he is...well, you have to hear it to understand it. I gave 8 for voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the OST was quite splendid. As this was a sports anime, it was critically important for the OST to do its job and keep the viewers' hype from chilling. And, cutting out the boring lead-in, the OST did its job. The only problem i had was the fact that there was no song I wanted to keep it for myself, and for that I give 9 for OST.\\n\\n\r\n(9+8+9)/3=8.67 or just 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThere is not a single side character in this anime. Everyone plays  a part, or at least, everyone who got longer than 30 seconds of airtime got a part.\\n\r\nWe have Nishinoya, the libero of Karasuno team, playing the \"cool guy\" role. We have Daichi, the captain, playing the strict but kind captain. We have Tsukishima, the blocker, playing the harsh but actually nice guy. We have Kenma, who literally just appeared in 3 episodes, influencing the whole Karasuno team in more than one way.\\n\r\nThe development for the main characters is also a job well done. Kageyama goes from the self-centered setter to a team-rounded setter, and Hinata goes from the spike-obsessed volleyball otaku to...well, actually he's still spike-obsessed volleyball otaku in the end, but we see a lot of change in Hinata as well, as he was only the physically sharp chibi at the start, but ended up being the greatest bait.\\n\\n\r\nBut as our parents, grandparents and everyone who is smarter than us once said, nothing in our world is ever perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe animation studio in charge of this was the infamous Production IG, known for its high-quality motions and bizarre artstyle that needs people to get used to.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there still was the bizarre artstyle in haikyuu, yet the high-quality motion was gone from existence.\\n\r\n....Yeah, I know.\\n\r\nI would rather have the people see the actual anime and judge for themselves, but if I am to list some problems,\\n\r\n1. There are waaaay too much still pictures.\\n\r\n2. As IG repetitively proved to us, their artstyle needs some getting-used-to.\\n\r\n3. They reuse the same animation for receiving and spiking way too much that it makes me cringe.\\n\r\n4. When the characters are talking, although they must have been exhausted from running and jumping all over the place, there is not a drop of sweat on their face.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the animation had some quality points too. The animation for receiving and spiking, although it was used way too much, was superb, and the movements of all the characters, at least during the game, was very fluent.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I give art 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nBut I still liked it a lot.\\n\r\nI found myself regulating my breath from the feeling of my heart exploding over and over again, and kept my eyes glued on the monitor for the entire time I watched the show. I loved the development of all the characters and I never skipped through out of boredom.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThank you, Haikyuu, for a great adventure.\\n\r\nI could not recommend this more, but I suggest to wait until the bd version comes out, because I am expecting a better animation in the bd. Still, if you can't wait for the bd for certain reasons, I suggest you watch this the next chance you get.\\n\r\nThen, until next time, happy anime-ing, and may the anime be with you.",

            "content": "OMG! I loved Haikyuu sooo much!! AMAZING is the only way to describe this anime!  I had watched Kuroko no Basket before this anime, and loved that too, so I decided to watch Haikyuu... Going into the anime I didn't know what to expect from an anime about volleyball, but wow was I impressed! Really impressed.\r\nStory: It's a story about a volleyball team in a high school, Karasuno, and their journey into winning a championship (I think?). Obviously, they have their struggles and obstacles that they have to overcome in order to win. The main 2 characters, Shouyo Hinata and Tobio Kageyama are freshmenat Karasuno, and have a middle-school rivalry, so they try to surpass eachother ('s different and work as teammates). The volleyball matches were simply amazing, and fun to watch, but that wasn't all. Haikyuu!! wasn't 100% about volleyball, but it also incorporated the develop of friendship, teamwork, and lots and LOTS of really funny comedy! Karasuno, FIGHT! \u2665\u2665\u2665\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for the anime was magnificent as well! Colorful! Like I always say, I don't really know how to grade art. Most anime have same, good art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I really liked the first opening, I don't really like the second one though. During the volleyball matches, there were little music because there was a lot of dialogue, but whenever there was some sort of soundtrack playing, it did elevate the intensity of the game. I didn't really get to pay attention to the music though, because the volleyball matches took up all my attention! Everytime the volleyball was hit and a BAM sound was made, my heart skips a beat. Loved it!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Best part of the anime, and maybe my favorite cast of characters in anime alongside other anime like Kuroko no Basket, and Clannad. All the characters, on both the team of Karasuno and all the other volleyball teams, are unique in their own way. The characters are so funny, and fun to watch. I loved every single one, although I wish there were some meaningful female characters too... But nonetheless, seriously maybe most favorite characters in 1 series is Haikyuu!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyable: I enjoyed it so much, I never knew that volleyball could be so fun to watch! I could drag on and on about how awesome this anime is, but since it's boring to just read reviews, I'll stop. But if you are even a little bit of a sports anime fan, or even want to see an anime that is superb, then watch Haikyuu!! It's Amazing!!",

Yes Kuroko's Basketball is really good but there are too many elements that just seem unrealistic. Haikyuu on the other hand is more down to earth and seems to be as close to reality as possible. The anime is more serious than its other counterparts and concentrates less on the ecchi/harem themes, which is a great thing.\r\nI just love the story, the soundtracks, the characters and the pacing of the anime is quitegood too.  The artwork is more than adequate as well. To people planning on watching this- you won't be disappointed!!",

            "content": "Two of my biggest interests are sports and anime. Ironically enough I had never watched a sports anime. One day I stumbled upon Haikyuu in a Top 20 anime series of 2014 and I decided to give it a try. I was instantly hooked and still am ( watching season 2). Let's begin with my review\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIt's a narrative you've probably heard before, an underdog tale of a volleyball team who had experience success in the past, but now its ona decline. I liked the story although at times it did seem like it would slow down and speed up, I still enjoyed it nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally really liked the animation and character designs. The characters did remind me a lot of Durarara, but I liked the animation style. Although some characters did look similar I thought it had a good variety and did not have problems distinguishing the main characters. The in-game animation was very good as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI think outstanding it's a good word to describe what I think of the soundtrack. Both OP's are very good and for the most part flow well with the opening animation. The same could be said for the ED's. The soundtrack complimented scenes perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nGood variety of characters that gel well. Many characters compliment each other nicely. Kageyama has good development throughout the series. Hinata on the other hand not so much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI am one of those fans that jumps and screams every match. Haikyuu had me screaming and cheering as if I was cheering on my favorite team. Which of course is one of them now. I was reluctant to try a sports anime, I honestly didn't think it would be any good and I wouldn't like. Man I was wrong. I loved the ride that was Haikyuu!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: 8.5/10 round up to 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI could have done without so many flashbacks, I also would have like more character exposition. Another issue I had was Hinata's friend's that we see in the first episode, but we never hear from again and are given no explanation in the anime. At least that I could remember. The same could be said with Hinata's family. Who we occasionally see. Overall I loved Haikyuu! It kept me hooked every episode. You can't help but root for Hinata and the Karasuno volleyball team. Even if you don't like voleyball or sports in general; give Haikyuu a chance. You won't regret it.\\n",

Some of the people in the fandom (especially the fellow hardcore slash shippers) of those mainstream anime bothered me so much. Like, \"Oh your ship sucks!\" \"My ship is more canon than yours!\".\r\nHaikyuu!! really feels different for me that I don't even care of that kind of fandom anymore. I am aslash shipper myself, but this is the first time I really do watch the sport anime not just for the slash hints, I genuinely watch it for the story and characters development.\\n\\n\r\nI can't wait to watch the second season!",

            "content": "Overall Thoughts: B+ \r\nHaikyuu\u2019s core theme is the team. It\u2019s about learning to trust each other when you\u2019re in a team, it\u2019s about winning and losing as a team, it\u2019s about overcoming obstacles as a team. For being that team-focused, Haikyuu really spends lots of its time for the viewer to get to know the team, and handles its characters with great care, even though the plot is by no means unique. It has great animation, a fitting sound and a wonderful voice cast. If you are debating whether or not to watch this, then don\u2019t hesitate and start Haikyuu. You won\u2019t regret it.\r\nStory: B-\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story is fairly generic for a sports anime, and doesn\u2019t really deviate at all from the Common Sports Anime Plot. The first half of the show is spent gathering up all of the team members, who weren\u2019t playing for one reason or another but were extremely skilled. Then they had to go and get a former player to be they\u2019re coach, who refuses initially but after watching them play caves in for the chance to coach this special team. It follows Kuroko\u2019s same basic storyline (and be extension, Eyeshield 21\u2019s plot) almost to a T, with there being two major tournaments left before the third-years/Seniors graduate. The Fall Tournament is built up to be the big one, their last chance, and they manage to have an impressive showing, but as they should, they end up losing in the semi-finals to a more cohesive team that they aren\u2019t able to overcome yet. However, after losing and having their confidence shaken a little, the team rallies and prepares for one last run at Nationals in the Spring Tournament. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest divergent from the stereotypical Sports Anime plot, is that the first episode actually ends with the Goofy and Energetic Underdog finding out he\u2019s actually going to be on the same team as the Serious, Short-Tempered Genius Rival character. And that was a brilliant subversion of Sports Anime tropes that set up the amazing character interactions and development that made this anime great and worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was pure gold in this series, and since at least half the cast had that sort of goofy, light-hearted attitude and tone to them, it made the story flow nicer and really made the entire situation seem a little more realistic. These guys weren\u2019t just solely obsessed with being the best at volleyball, they also were just out to have a good time.  With this sort of light-hearted tone to the entire series, it made the entire thing a bundle of laughs and one of the funnier anime I\u2019ve watched in 2014. Everyone gets in on the jokes as well, which was great to see and made almost every member of the team extremely likable. \\n\\n\r\nAnother point about the story that I really liked was that unlike a lot of other sports anime, there were no \u201cSuperpower\u201d elements in it, which was awesome! Everything was extremely realistic in how they portrayed everyone\u2019s abilities (unlike in something like Kuroko, where there are players who can make every shot from anywhere on the court and ridiculous stuff like that). It made the show more believable, and actually helped you relate to the characters more because there was no disconnect of you thinking, \u201cThere\u2019s no way someone could actually do that,\u201d which was really cool to see.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: A- \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest strength of Haikyuu!! is its extremely relatable, realistic, and lovable cast. This is where Haikyuu!! thrives, since the main team, Karasuno, has some of the best cast chemistry and interactions that I\u2019ve seen in a long time. It really made this show stand out from other sports anime because of just how likable almost every single member of the team was, and it made it highly entertaining to just sit and watch the team member\u2019s interact with each other. \\n\\n\r\nThere are seriously about 9 members of the main team that get serious development and screen-time, that helps endear them to the audience and causes you to become attached to the team and really makes you root for them.  This is in stark contrast to some of the other major sports anime, like Kuroko\u2019s where on your main team there are only about 2-3 players that really get fleshed out well, and then the best characters are the antagonist, or on the other teams that our Protagonist are playing against. It was cool to see that the majority of the focus was on the team we\u2019ll be with the most.\\n\\n\r\nThey did a good job of not info-dumping all of the team members on you at once.  Each major player on the team was given one or two episodes for you to get to know them before moving on to introducing the next character, which helped give everyone they\u2019re moments to shine and for you to fall in love with them. There\u2019s not much more you can ask from an anime in terms of number of likable characters, character development, and character relationships, so this gets an extremely high grade.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't get perfect marks though, because while there were many likable and the entire cast was written extremely well, I'm not sure if there's an All-Time great character in the cast of Haikyuu!! The cast as a whole is able to stand tall with other great casts in anime, but there's no individual member of the cast that ever stands out and is instantly makes the audience gravitate towards them. The closest character to reaching this pinnacle in my opinion is Tanaka, who is one of the best comic relief characters I've seen in a while, but I'm not sure if he quite reaches the ranks of \"Best Ever\". This could be a testament to the fact that every character in the story is given equal attention by the author, and I'd love to see more authors take this more ensemble cast approach, but for me, there has to be at least one All-Timer in the show to get bumped up to a perfect score in the Character department.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: A \\n\r\nThe animation was excellent throughout this show. Production I.G. did a great job with this show, proving once again that they are currently  the masters of Sports Anime. The scenes look crisp and the characters' movements always appear fluid.The animation does a great job of ratcheting up the intensity in certain scenes and they do a great job of showcasing the sport. Some of my favorite shots in the series are when players are hitting the ball, and it switches to a 1st PoV. Those are really cool to look at. This anime is a visual feast and absolutely phenomenal to look at.\\n\\n\r\nI take off a point from the grade because the character designs are a little odd at first and take some getting used to and because of this weird thing were they have character\u2019s faces being visible through the nets and the net\u2019s line disappear during these shots. Making it awkward to look at whenever this occurs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: B- \\n\r\nThe soundtrack fit the mood of what was happening on screen which is great, but I never felt the urge to go look up any particular track. That's a must for me to push the Sound of an anime to above anything but \"good\" is that the soundtrack can't just compliment what's happening onscreen, but it also has to add an element that would otherwise not be there if that track weren't playing then. For me, Haikyuu's OST never made me think that once. The two openings were very catchy and got you in the mood for the episodes, but I felt like both endings were kind of \"bleh\".\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was superb, and it was cool to hear some new voices and relatively new VA\u2019s in this series in major roles . Particular shout-out to Hisoka, for doing a great job with Oikawa!\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: B+ \\n\\n\r\nI had a ton of fun with this show. It made me laugh several times just about every episode and I was completely engaged with pretty much every match the played in. This anime was just a blast to watch and kept me thoroughly entertained throughout all 25 episodes, never seeming a beat during my marathon of the series. I\u2019ll definitely be waiting in anticipation for a Season 2, which can\u2019t come soon enough. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're interested in more content from me, check out my Youtube channel: Cafe Anime.

            "content": "Haikyuu, for me, had been one of those animes, the ones where they weren't very hyped, but just a little. Enough to get you to watch it, and there will be plenty of doubts, being someone who is an action more so of a sports fan, I had belittled this anime too much. \r\n   I had not expected much from a sports anime, in fact this was going to be my first ever. But I never realized how genuine and fun an anime could be. I felt as if it took the classic slice of life, but added a newfeature to it, the simplest thing ever, a volleyball club. Haikyuu was intense enough for me to thoroughly enjoy this anime, it made me laugh when I honestly didn't think it would. Hell even the emotions that went through this anime. Not giving out specifics, but it had made me feel what they felt, and I've never felt that way with an anime. \\n\\n\r\n   I'm not sure honestly what Haikyuu did, but it wasn't your average sports anime. This is the only one I've seen but I could already tell, this anime was unique. They made sports exciting and fun, you felt the emotions from a win or a loss and how much effort they put into it. It put action into a different perspective, through volleyball. When they spike it, when they set it, when they save it, it all became exciting, the concept of \"Just an anime about a boys volleyball club,\" was thwarted easily in my mind. \\n\\n\r\n   Now I'm not sure if any other sports anime were this good, but I sure as hell enjoyed Haikyuu, for making it exciting, for putting the momentum and the feeling into it. Hageyama's scary accuracy, Hinata's god speed, their first ever match, I had felt like I was part of the crowd every match and I was thoroughly enjoying this. You can feel the excitement, relate to the disappointment, understand their training and hard work, and notice their pain. No other anime has done this to me like how Haikyuu did, maybe it was because it was something very relate able. But whatever the reason was, Haikyuu for now, is my favorite \"slice of life,\" anime.  \\n\\n\r\nP.S, mind you I was writing this at 10:36 am, not sleeping the previous day, I am literally wobbling as I type this. Saying this, this is the one review where I am not hyped and ecstatic about. Haikyuu is still amazing though ^",

But when i first saw this anime i was supper skeptical, and i always thought that sport anime's where going to be super cliche and weird. But after just watching one episode I was hooked; the passion and emotions that are shown when they play is absolutely amazing. I also love how the characters interact with one another, and i can relate to the way they act around each other being that i also play high school basketball. This anime is nothing short but amazing. And majorprops to the creator's artwork and the studios performance in being able to animate this show. AMAMZING!",

There's no doubt. \r\nHaikyuu!! excels at two things: making it's characters feel like people, and showcasing surprisingly intense matches of volley ball. It's just dramatic enough for you to care about the players, but it's melodrama is kept in check by having them actually have to try, and train, and sweat, and run themselves raw trying to get better, but then actually getting better. They neither consistently fail nor perpetually win, as is the case in so many sports shows. Theirvictories are in scale to their efforts, and you can't be sure (in most cases) how far they're going to make it the next time they try, which makes for some very intense matches. Even the practice meets had me watching in full attention, and the actual competitive matches are nothing short of exciting. \\n\r\nNot to mention: it's got jokes.",

            "content": "Let's play some volleyball, huh?\r\nHaha! I'm still doing a Tommy Wiseau impersonation what can you do about that? Anyway, cut the crap. Production IG, the creator of Kuroko no Basket comes up with a volleyball anime, Haikyuu. \r\nSTORY (9):\r\nThe story follows Shoyo Hinata, a junior high student, who was inspired by a national championship match, to pick up a sport on volleyball. Although his height is short, he is determined to succeed in being a championship's star player, nicknamed \"Small Giant\". So, he formed a volleyball team with members and they trained hard. However, Hinata's team was defeated by \"King of the Court\" Tobio Kageyama,and so Hinata vows to defeat him.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of volleyball sounds fun and interesting.The story actually took the time to develop the characters. Like for example at first Hinata was on rivalry terms with Kageyama, however as the series progress Kageyama worked well with Hinata. I did love the way how this anime develop the relationship between teammates even though they are on different sides. \\n\\n\r\nART (10):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is in good shape. It sometimes create a lot of tension by the drawings.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme was addictive and opening theme was alright.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9):\\n\\n\r\nHinata is hyper-active and determined. I did like his determination\\n\\n\r\nTobio Kageyama was just like me. I prefer doing things alone but when I see the need to work in a team, I tried to open up with my teammates. Kageyama really had good friends who trust him and cared for him, especially Hinata and Daichi Sawamura.\\n\\n\r\nKoushi Sugawara has a great personality by supporting his teammates even doing hi-5 with his teammates. I really laughed a lot when he hi-5 with them. Like Hit, Ouch... \\n\\n\r\nDaichi Sawamura thinks well on his feet as a captain and he really treats the team as his good friends. \\n\\n\r\nKei Tsukishima was also an interesting character because of his charisma.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the character that I have a problem with is Shimizu Kiyoko. Although she is a senior volleyball player, she barely shows any emotion. She puts on this sour look on her face. Her voice actress was Kaori Nazuka who voiced the main character from an anime that we will not speak of again. Kaori Nazuka has voiced characters that are bland and forgettable and she never improved as a voice actress. Maybe she improved a lot when she voiced some characters that are memorable from other anime, I wouldn't know.\\n\\n\r\nI also wished that some characters might stand out but for the most part I enjoyed them.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (9):\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It had great visuals, interesting concepts, well-developed characters and lessons learned from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many ways in developing your strengths.\\n\r\nUphold your integrity.\\n\r\nUnderstand and trust one another in the team.\\n\r\nNo matter how tough things get, we can succeed.\\n\r\nBeing a champion in volleyball is nothing.\\n\r\nDefeat is a learning journey to success.\\n\r\nNobody is infallible.\\n\\n\r\nA true hero is a person who emerges successful from defeats. \\n\\n\r\nThese are the quotes that I came up with. Therefore, if you're into volleyball or sports, do give this one a watch and tell me what do you think about it. I wish I would share more about this anime but I am saving my thoughts for the remaining anime.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 9 out of 10.",

They all have very complex relationships with one another, watching them grow together, withpersonal problems and as a whole team is really the best part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Honestly, when watching this show, I used to postpone watching episodes for when I was sad because it would always cheer me up. To say I enjoyed this show is an understatement.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is a lovely simple story filled with complex characters and relationships. If sports animes are your thing and you enjoy becoming emotionally attached to characters, I definitely recommend it",

            "content": "How do you make a show about volleyball interesting? I'll tell you how! Throw in a bunch of amazing characters, an exciting story and a kickass soundtrack. \"Haikyuu!!\" really is an amazing show that you shouldn't miss out on! From start to finish I was glued to the screen, and not one time did I feel that it got boring or was slow. Each episode ends in a way that makes you want to watch the next one, and the next one, and the next one and all of a sudden it's 4 in the morning. \r\nI don't think I've enjoyed a sports anime asmuch as I enjoyed \"Haikyuu!!\" and the great thing about it is that you don't even have to like volleyball to enjoy it, because what makes the show so great in my opinion is the characters. They're really likeable and fun in their own ways. Their interactions with eachother feels pretty natural and sometimes their clashing personalities lead to some really funny moments. There's also a lot of character development, and it's awesome to see as the show progresses how they become more mature as both individuals, but also as a team. You're really rooting for them, and want to them to succeed which makes the show even more exciting. The soundtrack is also awesome and the sound when the ball is being spiked is so satisfying (it's like you're on the court!). \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is amazing. It teaches you the importance of teamwork and friendship as well as being just pure hype! Follow my advice, even if you're not interested in sports, and go watch \"Haikyuu!!\". You won't regret it!\\n\\n\r\nWell, I'm off to watch season 2 now! Thanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "Haikyuu is full of moments where you can easily predict what is going to happen. Obviously at first I thought, \"Damn, this is an aggressive anime, but its so predictable!\" It turns out that was one of the many things I loved about it. Oh, and just so you know, I also play Volleyball, so theres that.\r\nStory: It was similar to KnB, so it wasn't exactly original. The competition, the passive aggression, and well, the fact that everyone wanted to win was all similar to KnB. That doesn't mean that it wasn't good, in fact, it may have been predictable, but there were times wherethe characters can surprise you more than the story can... The fact that it was considered a shounen anime, made me kinda sad. I mean, I'm a girl, and and I freaking enjoyed the hell out of it. It can make you cry at times, it can make you jump out of your seats shouting, at others.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The art was really interesting. I liked it, but again, it was similar to the artist of KnB. It took me a while to get used to KnB, but now that I have gotten used to it, this was even more enjoyable! Also, the music was simple, and it barely distracted you from the actual anime. You would notice it in the background, but it would mostly just add suspense and tension to the watcher as well. The sounds used for the net, balls, sound effects in general, were really good. I felt like I was actually at the tournaments, and like there was actually a crowd around me shouting for their team to win. It felt amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development wasn't as deep as I expected it to be, but it was definitely enough. I fell in love instantly with Hinata. I have to admit that Kageyama took a little more time, but hey, you need a character to change throughout the story. Karasugawa was full of some of the best characters in the story. The scary, and yet kind captain, the nice and calm co-captain, the one guy who acts like a total maniac (Tanaka), and the two main characters that are supported by everyone around them. This anime is indeed an anime that needs its supporting characters. Without them, the story would not be the way it was. Oh, did I mention that each character has some sort of \"Ability\"? ;)\\n\r\nLet me also talk about the voice actors. This show has the best of the best... Kinda... It is definitely casted with a bunch of my favorite voice actors. Okamoto Nobuhiko as Yuu was my favorite because that man is a god who can voice act like no one else. The two main characters were absolutely fit for the roll, and all the supporting characters were just... AMAZING!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved it. What more could I say? You have to watch it to enjoy it first hand. I am a girl who found this show amazing. Also, if you play volleyball, this will definitely make you want to play again no matter the cost.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This show is meant for anyone. It has a story that will bring tears to your eyes. (Tearing up just thinking about it...) And the characters are freaking amazing. Give this a try if you haven't already, and even at times where you think, \"BORING\" Keep going. Maybe you will find a character you want to keep following behind~\\n\\n",

This is one of the most teeth-crushing, nailbiting anime I have ever (yes! Ever!) seen. The battles with our two main characters badass Kagayama and adorable Hinata were so exciting. Not only outstanding openings,art and characters the whole complex gave a nice, warm feeling. I gave the story a 9. The story is about Hinatawho wants to become just like \"the little giant\" but never had the chance to gain experience and kageyama, the OP volleyballer who sucks at making friends. Together they join a volleyball team when they attend highschool but the relationship between them is not that okay. Art style [9 ]because, seriously, it's beautifull. Very unique and i have to say that I love the wreckles beneath their eyes. [9] for sound because the openings and endings cannot become even more catchier. The characters are outstanding and unique because of their own behaviour and design. Not only kageyama but also the rest of the volleyballers. As I said at the beginning I've never underestimated an anime genre before so this was a suprise. A [10]. And overall [10]. If you are new to anime this is DEFINITLY A TRY-OUT!~ And if you're already known with the sports genre then WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??",

            "content": "I don't know what it is, but I've always been a huge fan of sports anime. It's just been my thing. I think through my own experiences with sports and through randomly finding and falling in love with Eyeshield 21, it's just found a place in my heart. That being said, I've read most of the classics and thoroughly enjoyed them, but I don't think any shounen sports anime have been crafted to the perfection that is Haikyuu!!\r\nNow, I won't leave you hanging there. I have good reason to think this. Obviously there are great examples out there of Sports Anime doing really new andinnovative things, but I'm not judging Haikyuu!! based off of its innovativeness. In that regard, it's probably the weakest part. The story is the usual underdog with one very particular skill he excels at and using hard work to cover the pure physical and mental gap between himself and the best players. That's the usual, and is basically the calling card for shounen sports. The real strength of this show is the amazing work put into not only the art but the soundtrack too.\\n\\n\r\nProduction IG made this into the most gorgeous sports anime I've seen, and it does so much with so little. Every fluid motion, every adversity, every moment of teamwork and camaraderie all is animated to perfection. The whole art style matches the sport flawlessly, and the constant motion of the teams setting and spiking is a sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nThen you go ahead and mix in the wonderful soundtrack, and it just sets itself apart from its competition. Every bit is perfect. It matches the mood and the feelings of the characters. It moves you and makes you not only enjoy the whole experience, but gives you added depth to the characters. Music is an incredible thing, and when done properly it is so much more than just background noise. Haikyuu!! is a perfect example of this.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the story itself is the usual shounen approach of the main character and team working hard and moving forward together. It takes it's own path and isn't too predictable, but you'll see the usual shounen cliches. The characters are another bright part of the series because of their, well, character. There isn't a dull or unimportant one among them. I think the supporting cast is really what can make or break a series, and so having a stellar group just cements this show at the top.\\n\\n\r\nEven not considering all of these aspects, the show is just fun. You get pumped up and excited for the players. You root for them. You want to see them overcome the walls in front of them. You want to see this team fight its way to the top.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah. Through my many many experiences with sports anime and manga, I haven't experienced a perfect thrill ride like Haikyuu!! ever before. I can't wait for the upcoming season and seeing what is in store for my Karasuno Crows.",

            "content": "I have never really watched a sport anime unless Free! counts, but that's fanservice. And Haikyuu!! is something inspiring :)\r\nStory: 9/10 - A story about an unexpected tiny player named Hinata starts high school and joins the volleyball team. With memories of his past failure at a tournament in junior high, a twist of fate happens. When a certain rival from his past also joins the same volleyball team, Kageyama and Hinata are forced to work together has a team!\r\nAnd I just scratched the surface of this anime. There's so much more after that. Character development, a strong structure for a story, and just hilariousmoments. Maybe it's because I'm unsure how a \"great/original\" sport anime is suppose to work, but this anime is definitely great. Original? Not sure, but hell, it's inspired me to watch more sport animes!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 - I'm very pleased with the styling. It's unique. It's rare to find an original art style these days, and when you find one it's either not pleasing, or in this case, wonderful! The scenery is pretty typical, but good. But what makes this art even better are the game scenes when someone is about to spike and it goes into slow-motion. It really adds to the suspense!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 - Ranging from the two OPs, to the two EDs, and all the way to the OSTs, this anime has killer music. The openings really get you pumped to watch the anime and the endings are relaxing, but you still get an exciting feel from them. Last but not least, the OSTs are so pretty in the best situations. Overall a very great soundtrack :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 - Oh my gosh. The characters really do range. Some are shy, loud, irritated, hilarious, etc. There's always a development of a few characters by zooming back into the past. And it's very interesting to watch! There's a character for everyone to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nI gave it 10 because honestly this anime made me laugh and get so happy so many times because of all the characters!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - I laughed, I freaked out, I almost teared up, and I have enjoyed an anime series for the past two seasons. This will keep you pumped even after you've finished it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 - This is more than likely going to get a second season in the near future. And it is well deserved. Please give this a shot, even if you don't like sport animes, this one changed my mind ^__^",

            "content": "This anime hits the top spot. Not only in sports anime, but in all anime. Overall, it is an immensely enjoyable anime with characters that you can't get enough of, action that drives you to the next episode, and music that fits the bill.\r\nThe story as a whole is well orchestrated, by the second to last episode I was almost in tears and before that I was cheering as though I was in the stands. This story makes you feel for the characters. Gives you an in depth view into even minor characters making you appreciate each character even more. You get a callous andstraight forward Kageyama and pair him up with the bubbly, never-give-up Hinata and you get something stinking amazing. I felt pride for Hinata as he soared in the air...pretty high for a shrimp. The other characters are equally amazing in their own respects; hilarious, kind, wise, and about every other good descriptive word under the sun. They are all so driven for their goals that it's hard not to cheer when they succeed and feel for them when they don't.\\n\r\nThe intro and ending songs all fit the story perfectly. Just listen and you'll find yourself listening the whole way through instead of skipping to the beginning of the story or going to the next episode. The music within describes the mood of the story and blends so well that you barely notice it at times. That is a sign of well chosen music that it can become one with the story and make it more supurb. \\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed every second of the anime (even the little breaks with them hitting the ball). I waited for weeks to pass before starting watching again just so I could watch episode after episode. I can't wait for the second season (there better be one) and can't wait to sit back and enjoy the fun that Haikyuu! brings. \\n\r\nSee you at the Spring Tournament.",

            "content": "Haikyuu review\r\nA great anime... Is what I'd like to say; but having garnered sufficient experience of the actual sport, as well as an understanding of sports psychology, its premise was not as good as it advertised itself. \r\n-\r\nthat \"haikyuu!! Secando season\" has never left me since hearing it.\r\nI'm so late in watching this and to be honest, this ismy first time properly dipping into this pool known as sports anime (my \"first\" first time was inazuma eleven, which wasn't a sports anime as much as it wasn't a shounen hero anime -it ended up being some weird crossover where football/soccer was to save the worldetc)\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nFrom what I've watched, anyone (myself included) can see that the creator has a clear understanding of the sport. Heck, they probably played the sport themselves in the past; but, my main two issues with this anime is the way they progressed with the story thereon:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Every time I expect a technique to be used, the entire team somehow end up acting out in such an amateur manner; it's like it was a game where you have to constantly do the same thing until you've gotten enough XP and can now unlock a new move -and then the team you're controlling decides to rinse out that new move because it's some strange super move.\\n\r\n\u2022then there was issue of how the sorry progressed, it was inevitable for them to have a big defeat because the build-up had made it growingly obvious (particularly because the characters had been made to emphasise their hopes and aspirations.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, don't get me wrong, the journey is always the best part of the story -and it couldn't be any truer in these circumstances. It's not a lie when I say the characters have been given such a life of their own that the anime allows us to explore the immediate story from each of their perspectives and gave us the dynamics where we're having to see the characters come to be a team... For this we see the general groundwork needed for a team to play together, and analysing it, these were:\\n\r\nForming- the anime opened with two rivals of sorts having to Jon the same due to them attending the same school, which causes arguments to ensue,\\n\r\nStorming- as we'd have it, there's a tension between the two as they get on each others nerves,\\n\r\nNorming- but they get through this, and after a number of or rices the team comes together\\n\r\nPerforming- and, well yeah, this component is rather more organic in comparison those mentioned priorly since they're now participating in matches etc.\\n\\n\r\nSo moving back onto the sport of the anime, I hated the fact that the MC was made to have these extraordinary abilities which were as far from unnatural, but I guess it's appropriate since it is, at it's core, an anime of the shonen genre... But that doesn't give reason to enjoy it, and anyone else that has fallen to the curse of what a sports anime's sport comprises of will also twitch in annoyance having seen the MC's capabilities like, \"are you for real?!\" cue the jackie chan confused meme... \"How are you lapping the court so fast, that ain't possible?!\"\\n\r\nIn other cases, there wear times where blocks hade taken place that didn't seem to be humanely conceivable... There is a level of unpredictability in volleyball that no player, no matter how good, can visualise; yet somehow, there were teams with such rhythm you'd be thinking that nobody would do that in real life -much like a game of football, there is a need to maintain the postion you're in because in normal cases, your vulnerabilities are what they monopolise (this is true to both football and volleyball. E.g. Me being short had meant that I was more of libero (defensive player) in volleyball, and in lesser height orientated position in football... I played winger as standard and even then I was at a disadvantage. So the point of having a position in team sports has been pretty ambiguous in some part and they really should identify the mechanic is of volleyball before rushing to put three players as a block when three players make up 50% of the on-court team\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nBut hey, it's all good 'cause it's an anime\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nSo, let's get down to the nitty, gritty of this anime\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6 (fair)\\n\r\nIt follows a typical storyline of underdogs wanting to reclaim a title that has been taken from them, of them wanting to become the best... I've no issues with that, many shonens are built on that premise, so its what they do with the story that fleshes it out and leaves a mark on us; for that reason I felt that it was a letdown in this aspect because in this regard the story was becoming more and more obvious.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not to say it bombed, the anime made up for this in the emotions the characters conveyed and in this aspect I felt drawn to the anime due to its realism -the wanting to be on a team, the want above and beyond with that team and for that team, the emptiness of being left out, the dreams and aspirations now being a far cry... All of which I now know all too well having been released from a team of my own recently.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all this, the reason why I gave this a \"fair\" rating is really just down to it having a poorer story than what I had expected -and this is without taking my enjoyment into consideration and only considering the foundation of the story and how they had gone about building on its foundation.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 (outstanding)\\n\r\nCan I just say, the artwork on this anime is mesmerising, why is it that shonen-style anime that is not expressed as an action anime has action scenes so much more better than it's action shounen counterpart I.e. Shokugeki no souma, haikyuu!! etc.\\n\r\nMy reason for saying this is because the black outlines that frequents characters in anime were so crisp and the colour palate gave the characters an amazing definition; furthermore, at those high energy moments where adrenaline is clearly coursing their veins the switch from those crisp lines to the inky speed outlines was instantaneous and allowed is to follow the speed of those epic heats\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 (very good)\\n\r\nWhat more can I say, it really did seem as though they're playing volleyball... The sound of the serves, the spikes, the ball hitting the floor. That, along with the accompanying OSTs, had orchestrated this sound that sucked me in and kept me engaged with the match -even wen what had transpired didn't truly reflect an actual game of volleyball. The fatigued breath, the push to secure a point; sometimes it felt that time had slowed down so as to hear a twitch of muscles reacting to the stalemate of the rallies.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 (great)\\n\r\nTypical of anime, your main cast have iconic/unique hairstyles whilst your salads are a bit bland, that ain't a problem; however, it was sad to see a number of characters (probably from the previous year's team) bring cast aside and not giving them as much of a role now that the MCs have taken the stage -in any other case, that'd be fine but considering the setting of the story the previous should have had better or more influential roles since they've had the time to build a level of rapport amongst the senior members. That being said, they fleshed out the characters we do know, fairly quickly, we grasped an idea of each the characters... This was in due part to having those forming and storming stages which gave us valuable insight towards the mechanics of volleyball all the while building on the character personalities through volleyball.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (great)\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier how the story was fairly pedestrian but the emotions and goals were what had really had made this story what it is - and to that end, it is no lie. This emotions and desire of the characters resonated with me, their will in pursuing volleyball felt no different to my pursuit in football, the dream being so close, yet so far; the loss suffered by that team translated to the emptiness of being released... Perhaps of I had watched this earlier I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much but watching it now made all the difference.\\n\r\nBut my enjoyment isn't solely down to the empathy created by this show so the reason why it isn't a 10 (outstanding) is because, in my humble opinion, this show really didn't do much to feel inclusive; what do I mean by that, well... There's a bunch of terminology in volleyball which the anime seemingly expects you to know, and unless Japanese viewers know everything about volleyball, it does nothing to help them. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, all in all, this anime is well worth the watch... \\n\r\nBearing in mind you come prepared with all the volleyball lingo needed.\\n\r\nI'll probably won't be back for a season two review since the first seasons is the make or break for any series.\\n\\n\r\nBye Bye",

            "content": "Haikyuu is a good choice for you if you're looking for a sportsy shounen but a terrible one if you're expecting the shounenisms to be milder than in other shounens.\r\nI'd like to start by noting that I've once dropped Haikyuu because at the time, I didn't want to watch a series about really determined kids wanting to win fights, but I eventually got in the mood for the exact thing I have dropped it for and Haikyuu sprung to mind, because I have had dropped it at the time, I could've acknowledged it was right for its target audience and I even respected the amountof character focus I have had noticed since very early and how it explained where the characters are at and why they are determined, which is a good thing to see, especially in a shounen, which the drive to move forward is frequently blinding ambition, of the fact that there's no reason for it to be there.\\n\\n\r\nHowever while early it has a lot of character focus it has one thing that kills most shounens for me, a thing that is known in my circles as a slow start. By this we mean that a shounen will focus on building up the future events of a story to give you incentive to care later on and for the story to have depth, but in the process the main focus you're probably watching the series for, frequently the action, is never really at full strength. Haikyuu has a particularly dense slow start, where almost all the volleyball matches are almost exclusively predictable and lacking tension because of the way you know and expect and are exactly right to expect the characters to go in their character arcs. Which also killed a lot of my immersion of the series. And while the character focus is there and is definitely intense, sometimes it's so intense that the series feels melodramatic to the point it forgets that this is highschool volleyball and the characters feeling like they have overlydramatic reactions to the things happening, which could simply be solved if all the characters were only a bit more reserved. \\n\\n\r\nArguably based on your standards for the action to character focus ratio, the slow start ends after 3 to 4 hours into the series, when the inner and outer conflicts are solved, Haikyuu starts putting more focus into the game itself.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want you to misunderstand me, despite the fact that the series will occasionally get ridiculously melodramatic, it still does a good job with presenting each character's mentality and inner struggle, juggling between multiple characters, even if like all characters get like two personallity traits and some sort of personal conflict, which might not seem like much, but I appreciate it since there's plenty of characters in the story and it's hard to make them overly complex when you have to ping pong between them. And while the volleyball doesn't really get any shine early due to the way the story and the character focus has been done, it always has good visuals and after the setup is done it finally focuses on giving immersive matches and interesting facets of the sport, through the strong foundation it has had layed out.\\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna get a bit deeper into both.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the character focus starts on two characters, which are basically the main protagonists and focuses on them for a really long time early on. Spoilers for the first episode in this paragraph, skip it if you'd rather not know the type of character arcs the characters will go through. These protagonists are Hinata, who is a determined kid who plays to win and has no real team to back him up & the other is Kageyama, who is a determined kid who plays to win and has no real team to back him up. Although the backgrounds are similar, they are polar opposites in circumstances and personality. Hinata grew up and developed a passion for volleyball but never had someone who would play with him or a volleyball club in his elementary school, so he is forced to play and train with whoever he can find. Eventually he manages to scrounge up a team of people who he had befriended and some first years who probably didn't know any better. While Kageyama is a person who plays at a school that has always performed well in volleyball and has really high skill acknowledged by everyone else in his team, but due to his overbearing attitude towards them and his oblivious arrogance, his team doesn't follow him. What drives Hinata is being acknowledged as a player despite his shortcomings and being in the spotlight, while Kageyama is selfdriven by his desire to win solely for personal satisfaction without particularly looking for acknowledgement. Eventually these two characters end up together in a team, where they learn the errors of their ways and develop both as a person and as a player, which I can't go more in depth because spoilers. Eventually the story takes time to focus and introduce other characters, but they're basically the two characters with the most depth since they had the most focus and most of the others are developed in a similar way with significantly less time put into them than the two mains.\\n\\n\r\nEventually after every character gets through their hurdles and personal conflicts the sports bit finally starts getting exciting and immersive, since now there's tension in the matches since there's no immediate conflict that the characters will have to and will obviously get over. The character progression doesn't dissapear, but it goes past the presentation stage and the series finally puts effort into putting up exciting matchups and situations. It will finally start displaying the exciting facets of the sport and use the already built relationships and characters to give us an understanding of how, why and what they can do in the match. It does often feel realistic although it obviously has the overlytalented bunch of players to keep things exciting, but it's nothing that would spring into your eyes as absolutely unrealistic. If you're interested in sports anime, you have to go through a shounen slow start to get where you want to get, so know that your reward for getting through this is sports in anime, so I advice you to be aware of what you enjoy from sports anime beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let me not completely forget to mention what exactly is melodramatic about this show. The overlyinvolved attitude of most people. The series needs to realize that it is displaying highschool volleyball, of people playing it as a hobby and not planning to pursue the sport probably in the future. Yet it has these really overlyemotional moments or overlydramatic where characters scream, cry or fall into deep states of depression over it, to the point where the series made sure to point out that every single team that lost, is not a protagonist, but yet, they all suffer the same when they lose. No, that's wrong. Nobody suffers the same. There's different levels of involvement. But then again, it's a shounen. You expect the series to have each of its moment become dramatic or humorous by the end of the day. Sometimes it overplays how realistically people would be involved into this hobby and it gets ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThis is pretty much all I have to say about the events in the series. Visually the series is a bit too colorful for my liking but it does put a lot of effort into its visuals and I appreciate the fact that not every character has \"yo look at my hair it's fancy so tha means I'm important\" hair in it. They're still there but, they're not prevalent and there are characters that are not as distinguishable, which makes it feel more realistic. As I've said, it puts plenty of detail into its animation, which is a good thing to see, with some interesting shots which aren't taking the easy route. Sound wise it isn't as impressive, not having a whole lot that is noteworthy, but I've enjoyed the detail put into how the supporters in the stands cheer on for the players and how they react at certain things. That's pretty much the only thing noteworthy there. Didn't see anything that should bother anyone in this department.\\n\\n\r\nSo, before you decide, keep in mind, run this again through your mind: This is a shounen with a slow start that has overlydramatic moments, but overall does decently focus on each character and it has a slow start that rewards with some interesting volleyball matches. If you strive for a sports shounen, it's good. If you don't know what to expect from such an anime, I've explained above, but otherwise it's exactly what you'd  generallyexpect besides the intense character focus. If what I said about the series doesn't interest you, I advice deciding against watching this.",

            "content": "When I started to watch Haikyuu!! I never thought I would enjoy it to that extent as I actually did. I've always liked volleyball the most out of all the sports revolving around teamwork; so basically,  I expected  Haikyuu!! to be a rather nice shounen sports anime with a lot of bromance. It turned out to be one, but it exceeded my expectations. \r\nThe story of Haikyuu!! is pretty simple: two old rivals, Hinata and Kageyama, happen to attend to the same school and join the same volleyball club after encountering each other in middleschool in a volleyball match. The rather untalented Hinata,still having the wish to beat his rival in a match, and Kageyama, an incredible gifted player, do not get a long very well in the beginning. However, it turns out they complete each other extremely well, so they'll have to work out as a duo to add to their team. \\n\r\nThe story focuses, of course, on these two characters, as well as on the Karasuno volleyball club, which has been rather unlucky and didn't win a lot of their latest matches. So, now with our over powered duo, they'll win every match right? Wrong, and that is something I think you should give this anime credit for: it's not as predictable as other sports anime, they do not win every match just because they have Hinata and Kageyama now; they'll always have to find a way to beat their formidable opponents, and it's never easy and not based on using sole will power. As the story continues, they get better, so they decide to enter a tournament, which they of course want to win. \\n\r\nThe story itself isn't the main focus on Haikyuu!!, as you can see by the fact it isn't very unique, even among sport animes. It rather focuses on the interactions and relationships between characters, and it does that amazingly well. The matches are incredibly fun to watch, I even found myself cheering for both teams, and it manages to create a very intense atmosphere. While the story itself wouldn't be too engaging on it's own, Haikyuu!! manages to suck you in with a lot of full-scale volleyball action and great characters. The downside is, as unpredictable the matches can be, you still get very easily what they are going for; it's training \u2013 tournament \u2013 wanting to win \u2013 facing old enemies and all that kinda stuff. It doesn't make it bad, you just wish they might have tried something more creative here. There is also a lot of inner monologue and pep talk, which is extremely cheesy from time to time, but it's not terrible or anything. \\n\r\nAs I already mentioned, the characters in Haikyuu!! are great. Everyone is pretty unique in their own way, and they're all extremely fun to watch on screen. The two main characters, Hinata and Kageyama, couldn't be any more different from another, so it's really entertaining to watch them get along. Both do show typical traits of shounen protagonists, however, they're still portrayed in a realistic way, so you won't mind it that much. The supporting characters are great as well. As already mentioned, everyone is unique, and their relationship with one another is very well established. I might say they all fit in some kind of stereotype, like the hot-headed guy or the always positive guy, but the show manages to show different traits of the characters. The \u201eantagonists\u201c, meaning the players of the opposing teams, are all just as great as the one from Karasuno. Everyone is very cool, has their own traits and is pretty likeable. While they're reduced to one character trait for most of the time, it's still played off really believable. \\n\r\nSometimes I wished however, they would give certain characters a bit more focus, not just one introduction episode. It's not like they're left forgotten afterward, but I always wanted to see some more of them. Another thing that really annoyed me, while it might be a nitpick, is the reaction you always get to see from the opposing players or watchers when Hinata and Kageyama do their quick attack. I get it, it's awesome. It's just the fact it always takes so long until the match continues and I'm in general not a fan when a show tries that hard to tell you something is awesome. But as I said, probably just a nitpick, it doesn't ruin anything for me. \\n\r\nI have to say, I can't say much about the animation itself, except for that it's incredibly good. It's really fast, smooth and fluent, it really makes the show very pleasing to watch. The volleyball action comes across amazing, and that's what counts great time for a sports anime. The art-style is also very good, the characters do look pretty realistic while still showing some unique features. \\n\r\nThe music however, I have to say, wasn't that outstanding. Frankly, I don't even remember one really god track in the OST. I'm sure they added to the mood, but they didn't do that much on their own. The OP and ED are all nice to listen to and are pretty catchy tunes, but also not something that memorable. The voice acting was always on point though, the actors really brought up the feeling they are in a real match. It's not something I always comment on, but the sound effects in Haikyuu!! are extremly good as well, they do make everything feel more real, might it just be the volleyball hitting the ground. \\n\r\nAs mentioned above, Haikyuu!! was really enjoyable. The matches and the characters are just so good, I really couldn't stop watching after one episode. It gets pretty cheesy from time to time, but it never felt like it was too much and would ruin anything. The comedy is also good, especially Hinata and Kageyama get into some funny situations. \\n\r\nOverall, Haikyuu!! is a great anime. It has some flaws, but they're not as bad as the good stuff is good. If you're looking for some easy-to-watch sports anime, with great characters and a lot of amazingly animated matches, go for that one.",

            "content": "Watching this series brought me back to the days when I played volleyball for my high school, but as can imagine coming from someone who is writing anime reviews I rode the bench for all it was worth. But enough with the self deprecating humor, despite not being a starter I still managed to have fun and teach the younger members of the team what I knew and provide some laughs. I still had an impact on my team which is the main theme of this anime and the sport it focuses on in general. This series was successful due to its large amount ofcharacter depth, realistic and suspenseful matches, and a healthy dose of humor.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with not the most original premise as two rivals are forced to work together after choosing to attend the same high school. The main focus of story are, Hinata a short but athletically sound goober, and Kageyama, the skilled but conceited setter. The two clashing due to their differences sets up some of the funnier moments of the series, but as the two learn to work together is where the series offers some of its best moments. Unlike other sports it is impossible for one player in volleyball to truly dominate the game without having strong support from their teammates, and the two protagonists play out this theme as the two need each other to unlock their true potential on the court and unleash their awe inspiring attacks. \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative for the first half of the series is based on the team improving and introduces most of the main players and characters, while offering insight into how the game is played. For those not familiar with the sport, Sensei's character asks most of the mechanical questions so they can be cleared up for newbies. As the characters are introduced you can see how they are  perfectly tailored to offer their own unique role to the team and series, and that even without the input of some of the more minor characters, Karasuno would not be able to play at a high level. It is satisfying to see the pieces slowly come together as they recruit old members and new ones. Some of the characters also have some surprisingly deep emotional baggage, which made their comeback all the more satisfying but I also felt that sometimes their was just a bit too much flair of drama as we learn more about some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe series really hits its stride once it reaches the second half and they start playing for real in the March Madness style tournament, I loved how it jumped straight into single elimination format as it greatly added to the intensity and suspenseful of the matches. The matches themselves are very well done we see both the protagonist and their foes adapt and play their hearts out playing the game they love, and it makes for some truly great volleyball to watch. The music of the series adds to the intensity of the matches, adding to the suspense during a big play or playing more somberly as the characters reflect struggle to cope with being called on or possibly letting down the team they love so much and have to face the prospect of not playing volleyball, their greatest passion. The matches are highlighted by not only by action, but also by the smart play by both teams. Sometimes the matches feel akin to a chess match as every action taken by the players is well thought out executed. For example a player will attempt to break another team's best passer in order to lower another team's morale, and use this lull to gain momentum.I thought the ending was executed beautifully as well and tied into the theme of the series of how your teammates are always there for you no matter what and as long as you have the will and the passion to fight the game never ends.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect of the series is how fleshed out the players on the other side of the net are, it is unusual to see opposing players developed so much. However it pays off for the most part as it makes the matches that more intense by having them face \"Real\" players rather than nameless and \"evil\" players. Many times you are given insight into the other side of the court and you see how these players are similar to our protagonists, they love the sport and have worked harder than anyone to get to the position they are in, and it sometimes it feels that the opponents have a more legitimate claim to victory than the heroes. None of the opponents are completely unlikable, and we see them work together and stress teamwork as they cleverly try to outmatch the Ravens, and we see their struggle right until their bitter end.  It could also be argued that this is the series' greatest weakness, as it takes away time from the heroes of the story and their team, and in fact many members of opposing teams are fleshed out much more than character's on the protagonist own team. Some of the opposing team members are more like palette swaps off the Karasuno team, which could explain why they are so likable and its fun to see them interact with their counterparts on the heroes' team, as the characters they are based off of are the one's that are fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this series is top notch, which is to be expected by Production IG. Their are also some nice visual effects in the series, as often the character's fears will come to life on the court through the use of imagery, or it will help boost the humorous scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a fun series that is able to provide some funny laughs through the interactions of its wacky characters and the snide remarks they make, sometimes to break the tension during the more suspenseful parts of the matches. It features some great development for most of its characters especially Kageyama, but some characters feel left out. The value of teamwork is extremely important in volleyball, which is something that Haikyu!! manages to nail perfectly while providing some action packed, mostly realistic, and suspenseful matches. It does all this while maintaining a strong sense of humor throughout, and its easy for me to say that Haikyu!! stands head and shoulders over its competition. \\n",

However the anime excels with its character development and suspenseful way of depicting the volleyball matches they take part in.\r\nHaikyuu! manages to connect its audience emotionally with its characters,  which is the strongest point of the anime. The personalities of the characters themselves are nothing particularly new for the genre, however this didn't make them boring. Haikyuu! managed to create depth to their characters through compelling back stories. This extends even to the rival volleyball teams they face throughout the anime.\r\nHaikyuu! retains tension andsuspense through the volleyball matches themselves, which is an important aspect of any sports anime. The anime is full of action, as the majority of the episodes have a volleyball match taking place. However, what makes Haikyuu! stand out is its ability to make the viewer identify with all of the characters involved with the match. They do it so well that more than once I found myself rooting for the rival volleyball teams to score a point!\\n\\n\r\nCheck out Haikyuu! if you are looking for a great action packed sports anime. Know that it is a sports anime at its core, and the plot is typical fare: win the matches. However, the characters are very emotionally charged and their interactions are great,  the art is done well, and the anime is extremely enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "I just want to start this by saying i have never seen a sports anime before, this is my first step into the genre, and i've heard this show has a lot going for it, it isn't reliant on fan service like others, it has a rich story and unique characters, and it has a killer art style. Sadly i would say only 2 of those things are true, the killer art style and it not being reliant on fan service. \r\nNo Spoilers.I gave the story a 3/10\r\nIt's nothing special at all, nothing surprising happens, and its very predictable. The story begins with Hinata watchinga clip of \"the little giant\" his inspiration playing a game of volleyball. And thus the ball gets rolling for the team to begin forming and goes obvious places.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I gave the art an 8/10 its actually pretty damn good, some of the scenes were amazing and full of energy. It also had a good mix of styles, swapping fluidly from hyper detailed, to simple and charming.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 Good sound design, and okay openings and endings. From every shoe squeak on the shiny wooden floor to the cheers from the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10, nothing special at all, the characters are generic, they don't go anywhere new or shocking. They fit their mould PERFECTLY, and never overstep their marks. If you have even dipped your toe into anime, you have seen these characters before, in some other anime show or movie. They just have different names.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10 Mediocre. It was fine ... i guess, which sucks because some episodes are actually very good, interesting with new characters showing up. Like team Nekoma with Kenma. Who arguably have more character and growth than the main characters and team. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Haikyuu!! is a 5/10 its Mediocre. And it sucks to say it. It had some genuine moments and episodes i thoroughly enjoyed, but for every episode i liked there was one that dragged and delivered bland character after bland character. And forced predictable outcomes that any anime watcher can spot from a mile away. Its even more sad that i found myself saying \"why can't that team be the team we are following instead of Karasuno, they are so much more interesting and dynamic\". (Karasuno being the main team)\\n\\n\r\nI think you will know if you will like the show from episode 1. Which is good, if episode 1 doesn't click, i say drop it and move on. If it does, stick it through, you will probably enjoy it a lot.\\n",

            "content": "Right after the boom of Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu came out to satiate everyone\u2019s need for more. I must say it exceeded my expectations. As we know, it\u2019s a difficult process to create a sports anime that is fun for the audience even on the actual matches, which most of the times, if not handled carefully, can make the story a lot dull.\r\nStory, as said, was a great work of balance. The games\u2019 clever strategies and excess of movement is something i hadn\u2019t seen in a while. Something to add is that they\u2019re all real, no game move was created out of nowhere, only actualvolleyball players\u2019 strategies or an adaptation of them. The matches are also variable, i don\u2019t think there was any speciality repeated on each adversary the main team had to play with (besides on purpose). Always keeping up with new changes, my enjoyment was bigger as it progressed.\\n\r\nSurprised me when i noticed that there was gonna be no romance or personal dramas at all, in a bad and good way. I\u2019m a fan of mixed genres, specially on the relationships area, but Haikyuu managed to be way better without it. The focus on only volleyball was a great way to envolve the friendship and rivalries between the players. \\n\\n\r\nArt. Definitely one of the best i\u2019ve seen in a sports anime! The thin lines and drawing style characteristic of Production IG was the perfect match for all the rush and movement of the characters. And actually also nicely used to complement the strategies visuals.\\n\\n\r\nSounds. Both openings\u2019 and endings\u2019 vocals and melodies were outstanding. None of them failed me, visuals and songs being related to give us the best experience possible. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters. All of them were technically and emotionally developed as matches progressed, both individually and as a team. Specially the friendship between the main two, who had their own obstacles with each other, was growing with every game and teamwork.\\n\\n\r\nOverall and Enjoyment are definitely a 10 for me. My only problem was the slow progression of the relationship between Hinata and Kageyama. I\u2019d have enjoyed it way more if they didn\u2019t insist on making them rivals for more than 10 episodes.",

It was just too freaking good man.\r\nThe way all characters and their abilities are developed throught the 3 seasons were something which i hadnt seen for a long time since i started. Gave me the old one piece vibes kinda....like not old old....the middle old ones...its hard to describe but this is one anime that got me back to watching animesafter i thought i grew out of that phase only to discover that...well....i have to find something diff giving me the feels since i finished watching...but i think it wont take too long if i keep searching.",

The character development through matches and practices show that it takes time and effort to master a skill. The accuracy of the sport is spot on. Also it is realistic. It is not realistic to become the best team after suddenly creating a team. Karasuno faces many obstacles and over come most of them but can't over come others. The comedy is also fantastic where they will have funny clips to relieve a tense situation or just for fun. The show also introduces a very interesting character. Hinata Shouyo isn't tall orskilled but through is extreme jumping and speed capabilities, he teams up with his rival Kageyama the genius setter. The show also sets up many rivalries between the teams to show that in a competitive atmosphere, a team will have many rivals.",

Haikyuu!! was a sport anime that had me cheering as teams of differing skills faced off against each other. Intensity rose with each increasing scores, and the sight of victory always had me hooked to watch the next episode.\r\nIn the courts of hot-blooded matches between foes alike, a journey to greater heights was set between aspiring players. To start off, as a person who doesn't live around sport, the explanations of the volleyball rules were easy to comprehend.While I'm not entirely sure how accurate they were, it was simple enough to keep up with the story and that's great. The relationships between each characters were really dynamic, with the simple comedies or even the so-called student to senpai bonds which were always a treat to watch. That relationship proved to be crucial in their development through interactions, especially when coping, strengthening or depending on each other to achieve victory. Many Shonens suffered from minimal focus with the side characters but this anime placed a responsible role for everyone. Because pretty much all of them had some significance, there were no hassle relating to the characters. Seeing them getting back up from failures and improving the team's synergy made it all the more inspiring. There were also the interlinking connections between members of the other teams, introducing to backstories. These made the characters more complex than what it seemed from their outside demeanor.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about outside appearances, the visuals of the main cast matched the boys' personalities. Like other Shonens out there, the art and animation quality was pretty average but no doubt it does fit the anime well. They did go one step further on a lot of the dialogue scenes by adding in small bits of comedy, such as the extra body movements or exaggerative expressions. Having this every once in a while eased up some tension so it's a good addition to have in a sport anime. It also made everything seemed more alive and energetic, which is pretty much what the characters have going on. Of course the quality was higher when it came to the important parts, and the animators did an awesome job in showing off the amazing physical abilities of these volleyball players. For the sounds, the use of upbeat music through training montages displayed the hope going through the characters, wanting to always be greater than yesterday. Morale-boosting soundtracks before matches achieved the pumped up atmosphere that created excitement. Accomplishing immersion with gym sound effects like shoes squeaking on the floor or ball getting hit felt like you were there in the court with them. Basically, they contained energy and action which is what a volleyball anime needs.\\n\\n\r\nFor Haikyuu!! to succeed in getting a guy like me, who have no relationship with sport whatsoever, to enjoy the anime says a lot about how well the story was written. I'm probably just a random person in the crowd but do I love being in the competitive setting with the teams down below? Oh yeah, I definitely do! And that's all the reason I need to stuck with it, watching the players soar over the net with their teammates and persevering in order to feel the joy of winning.",

He strives to go to the Nationals and win. It's a pretty simple plot, but there's so much more to it.\r\nAt first, I didn't expect much, but Haikyuu really surprised me.

            "content": "Anime: Haikyuu!\r\nEpisodes: 60 (3 seasons)\r\nGenre: Comedy, Drama, School, Shounen, Sports\r\n*Will try not to give any spoilers even though it won't effect it as anyone who'll start watching it will know whats going to happen in the end.*\r\nHaikyuu! Its one of the first anime I watched when I started my journey of becoming a weeb. A friend recommended it to me and told me he gave it a 10/10 rating(which is quite a shock because he doesn't like much stuff and is a blogger).\r\nThe main plot of the anime is quite simple. Hinata shouyo fell in love with volleyball when he saw the game of thefamous player known as \"The Little Giant\". He was called the little giant because of his short height and how he would destroy all the teams in front of him. Now starts the journey of Hinata to surpass the little giant because of the similarity they have in heights. But in order to do so he needs to overcome alot of hurdles, one of which was to cooperate with his sworn rival, Kageyama Tobio, who is now his team mate. After becoming friends with Tobio, he now has to find plays and tricks to compensate for his lack of height but due to his athleticism, stamina and passion he might be just able to do it.\\n\\n\r\nAll the three seasons were amazing. Even though it had a typical shounen MC who likes to create hype, the show itself perfectly balances on every supporting- no, even the extra charectors. Every charector had a back story which was delivered in a way that it wont clash with the main plot or be called a filler. To be honest, the second season was my favourite as it showed how much they changed after their major loss in the first season. They practiced hard, tried new things, synchronised which each other and destroyed other teams together. The charector developments in this show were amazing aswell as it not only focused on the main charectors. Heck, the favourite charector for almost every viewer is a supporting charector, Kei Tsukishima(or as i like to call him, Chestor of linkin park).\\n\\n\r\nThe charector designs were perfect. The voice acting brought the emotions out so well that for a moment I actually felt that I was sitting in the crowd cheering for them. Probably one of the best voice acting shows I have ever seen. It had a nice touch of comedy to it aswell. The adrenaline rush you would feel once the background music kicks in when all the players are jumping around is something, I can't describe it and you'll only know once you watch it. The art style and the animation were top-notch that would easily grab the attention of anyone, as expected of PRODUCTION I.G, who also made Attack on Titan, Kuroko no Basuke, Kimi ni Todoke, Psycopass and some other great shows. \\n\\n\r\nThough there might be some cons but in my opinion, the pros cut them out easily so I didnt even saw them. If you guys did saw something worth mentioning then do tell me.\\n\\n\r\nIf it comes to sports anime, Haikyuu! takes the cake very easily. Its not your typical sports anime which shows how overpowered highschool kids are(*cough*kuroko no basuke*cough*), its take on realism is something that makes it one of the top shows out there. Though the show it self is incomplete due to the lack of resources from the manga it still gives us quite a good ending. The manga has enough chapters now to create a full a season and we just might get a season 4 in the coming year or two because I really want to see Nekoma and Fukurodani(two great teams made up of supporting charectors) go head to head in the nationals.\\n\\n\r\nIt never fails to amaze me. I have watched it 3 times now and I have never been bored by it. Its the only shounen show thats in my top 10 list(yes, I have watched dbz and naruto).\\n\\n\r\nThe seasons are as follows.\\n\r\nSeason 1: 25 episodes\\n\r\nSeason 2: 25 episodes\\n\r\nSeason 3: 10 episodes\\n\\n\r\nFor me the ratings go as:\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 9/10\\n\r\nCharectors/Charector development: 10/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art style: 10/10\\n\r\nMusic(op, ed and background sound tracks) 9/10\\n\r\nOverall rating: 9/10",

The Story isn't rushed, so it developed well. (I already check the manga before writing this review)\r\nIf you are in a club at school or any places, you will always found that one person who is up above everyone else when doing club activity. Someone who always lookeddown his/ her teammate. Someone who eventually will be all alone because everyone just couldn't stand his/her personality. You will found this situation when you watch this anime. Accepting or be accepted, that is human nature. Kageyama, in this anime, he has an outstanding ability as a volleyball player, but no one could keep up with his way of playing. Kageyama become an Isolated person, but when he enter high school, he meet new teammate, new team where he can express himself. The story of this anime is unique, it's hard to find this kind of story nowadays.\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nAs expected from production I.G, they animate Haikyuu to the fullest. The expression of each character of haikyuu throughout the anime fits the situation, not only that, each volley match scene also animated carefully.\\n\r\nproduction I.G always do a really great job animating sports manga for me.\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nBoth Openings and Endings are really good, the VA of each character, is carefully picked. as for the background music, and the rest, all is good and easy to listen.\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nOne more character who isn't fully developed, i don't want to ruin the experience for those who wanna watch this anime, just watch it and you will find out.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime, and can't wait for the second season.\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is masterpiece, must watch, but this is just my opinion, feel free to analyze this anime yourself.",

            "content": "Due to my distinctive taste when it comes to sports anime, I am very hard to please. However, Haikyuu!! totally exceeded my expectations. After having been in my Plan To Watch section for a the past few weeks, I decided I would give the anime a try, and did not regret it. \r\nTo start, Haikyuu!! is a very original and unique story that focuses mainly on the relationship between former enemies (now teammates) Hinata and Kageyama. Kageyama and Hinata are very reluctant at first to work together, but they learn to push aside past experiences in order to become stronger together, and restore the Kurasunovolleyball team to its former glory. \\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between the teammates are hilarious, and the relationship between Hinata and Kageyama is very comical. Every main character in Haikyuu!! has a unique personality and charisma that separates each one from the rest. The Kurasuno team is composed of members that are completely different, but all have the same goal; to improve. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development is very noticeable throughout the story. At the beginning, each character has a unique set of skills and flaws that change throughout the episodes. By working as a team, Kageyama and Hinata (as well as the rest of the Kurasuno team) both evolve and grow to become better players. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike in Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu!! is more realistic in terms of skills. In KnB, characters have certain perks and can achieve \"Zone\" but in Haikyuu!! there are no special moves, and all motions/plays is based on realistic volleyball. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is smooth considering the fact that it is a sports anime. It is fluid, but not excessive or over the top. I also am happy that when a team is on the court, the player's faces on the opposite side are not obscured by the net. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound really accentuates the volleyball in the anime, and the sounds are very vivid and precise. Wether it be the squeaking of shoes on the court, the thud of a ball landing on the court, or the sound of the audience, they all add realistic features that make it seem as if you are on the court with them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime a lot. It includes elements of humour and was a very engaging anime. I would certainly recommend this anime to anyone who is interested in the sports or comedy genre.",

            "content": "*Spoiler free review*\r\nHaikyuu!! is a story about volleyball, it's a sports shounen, do not expect any deep metaphors for the meaning of life and existence, but you can expect a very well paced and action packed story filled with terrific characters.\r\nStory - 8\r\nHaikyuu!! is a shounen about sports, and as stated above this normally does not call for anything complex, it is a basic story of a small group of misfits banding together to take on unfavourable odds, the pacing however is terrific and will have you on the edge of your seat for certain moments and feeling some intense emotions at others (though thisis by shounen standards so don't expect the need for a tissue box). So while the story is pretty basic and nothing new, it is well realized, it throws in some curve-balls to keep you on your toes and wondering what will happen next and it possesses a terrific pace with slowly building anticipation to tension filled climaxes. These more than make up for the traditional story in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nI really don't care that much about art unless it looks brilliant or horrible, in this case the aesthetics for Haikyuu!! do their job very well and are appealing to the eyes. There was also no problems telling people apart despite the fast pace of the scenes and the limited view of the court you receive is well used and you will always see the action from a good angle.\\n\r\n(My favourite artistic touch was the addition of the sort of tunnel vision filters around the side of the screen during certain scenes)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the soundtrack of this anime, the OP's and ED's were very god (although I believe the first OP should have been used for the latter half of the series as it is much more intense). The background music is also very good for both the intense moments and when the character's are dealing with heavier emotions. No complaints other than the soundtrack not being outstanding. (My favourite track was the first OP; Imagination by SPYAIR, just a great song to get you hyped)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\\n\r\nOne of the shows strongest qualities is it's characters, they really spill out in every scene you see them in and all of their actions reflect it, also each character feels like a character and not just some random stereotype thrown in for the fun of it (i.e. goof balls can actually play and will cheer the team up and less skilled characters aren't oblivious to their situation). Every scene a character is in will scream the character's personality and even the main antagonists feel like realistic characters instead of things put there to stop the main character's progress. (My favourite character is Kei Tsukishima, a tall blonde dude that couldn't seem to care less about volleyball but is still surprisingly good)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's enjoyment is likely to be susceptible to changing greatly based on the eyes of the beholder. I came into this anime wanting to have a good time, but if you want this anime to be painful I do not think it impossible to only focus on it's negative points, but if you are watching for enjoyment you should probably have an enjoyable time even if you are not a fan of the sports genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.2\\n\r\nSummary - A pleasant sports anime that you will enjoy thoroughly if looking for an entertaining time, but may not be your cup of tea if you need complex plot lines and story lines with nothing less then the entire world on the line.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: After watching a national championship match on TV, Hinata Shouyou (Murase, Ayumu) gains a fascination for volleyball and aspires to become like the \u201cSmall Giant,\u201d one of the championship players who shared his short stature yet performed outstandingly on the court. He starts his own volleyball club at his middle school however hardly anyone joins and he loses his first and only tournament game to Kageyama Tobio (Ishikawa, Kaito) \u2013 also known as the \u201cKing of the Court\u201d. Determined to follow his dream of playing volleyball, he decides to enroll in Karasuno High School and jointheir volleyball club however he finds out that Kageyama has joined as well and that they must become teammates despite their past confrontation.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu!! has a large cast and so because it would be impossible to go over each and every character in appropriate detail, even on just the main team, I will speak about the main two characters and thereafter paint in broad strokes in regards to the rest of the highly interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main characters and the first character we are introduced to, Hinata, can be characterized as determined and eccentric especially when it comes to volleyball. He offers us a newcomer\u2019s perspective to both the Karasuno team as well as the sport in general and has a decent amount of character development over the course of the series though less than a few other characters such as Kageyama in my opinion. His quirkiness and upbeat attitude as well as his interactions with the team generate a good percentage of the shows comedy and so if you enjoy the character then that element of the show may be amplified however by no means does it solely rely on Hinata.\\n\\n\r\nThe second main character, Kageyama, starts off in a very different place than Hinata. Though he is equally driven to win (like everyone in the show) he is selfish in his play-style and harbors regrets from his past team because of his actions and outlook and thus seeks to change and improve himself when he enrolls at Karasuno. These themes, of improvement and change, are major character traits of Kageyama and overall he comes off as the more dramatic of the two main characters though both they both have their fair share of dramatic moments and comedic gags so they are hardly one dimensional. The relationship between him and Hinata make up a large amount of screen time outside of practice sessions and games and so they are the main characters in that sense however once the games start their roles are somewhat lessened at times to make room for other members of the team and the opponents as well.\\n\\n\r\nTo speak firstly about the Karasuno team \u2013 they are all enjoyable and each come with their own ambitions and back-stories. The third years want to enjoy their last season of playing the sport, the second years want to improve the declining team and foster successful first years, and the first years just want to play the game. The chemistry between each of the team members is great and feels very natural \u2013 each character interacting with another differently due to their relationships and motivations. Each character is given plenty of time to shine within the course of the game and I found them just as enjoyable if not more so than the main duo of characters. Though volleyball only fields 6 players at a time, the vast majority of the players are enjoyable whether they play or not.\\n\\n\r\nI think Haikyuu! deserves additional praise for how it handles the other teams and opponents of Karasuno. While the school may be in a slump as far as it\u2019s record is concerned, it has a good deal of history that is explored between itself and the other schools and this manifests as tension in the games as the players match up. The show explores the enemy players in a concise and effective way that gives you the long and the short of what they are bringing into the game and how their unique approaches differ from those of Karasuno. I found the opposing teams to be just as interesting as the main team and its hard not to end up rooting for both at times.\\n\\n\r\nMy only microscopic qualm is that the only often recurring female character, Kiyoko, has barely any lines and seems to be solely present for comedic purposes and to look good which I suppose is fine however in a show where every character seems to have some level of intrigue and internal complexity \u2013 her lack of dialogue and action causes her to stick out to me.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Haikyuu!! does an excellent job portraying many different sides of both the game and the players \u2013 the tone that \u2018everyone deserves to win\u2019 is well executed and one of the most enjoyable aspects of the show. While the number of characters is large, it is not so large as some shows and keeps its cast concise enough that you are able to watch each individual character without feeling lost.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was actually the reason I myself initially picked up the show \u2013 Production I.G brought their all this time around and the art and animation were fantastic. The action sequences were both fluid and sometimes stylistic and really gave a sense of power to the players without seeming unrealistic in their portrayal. The shots and angles used were dynamic and there was never a time throughout the course of the show where I felt an approach had been overused or tired.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are mostly reserved with a few exceptions such as Nishinoya and maybe Kenma and fit well within the aesthetic of the show. The comedic faces and character designs lent themselves extremely well to the comical parts of the show and were often of more import and more impactful than the jokes or gags themselves.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to highlight one facet of the story it would be its pacing. Its starts off a little slow so that it can ease us into the introduction to the game and the team(s) however at no point did I feel the story dragged during this phase nor was I bored with the content. Whats more, the pacing perpetually gets better and better as once the show frees itself of its explanations and down-time moments the practice games and eventually the tournament games take prevalence and each game is given a proper amount of breathing room within the course of the show without feeling drawn out or too short.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself primarily focuses first on an introduction of the volleyball club at Karasuno High and subsequently the explanation of the game, which it does seamlessly while telling the story \u2013 instead of taking the viewer aside and explaining the finer points of the game in an overt manner, they are addressed inadvertently as both Hinata and Kageyama learn to refine certain techniques and whatever explanations are given feel natural to the story rather than aimed aggressively at an uninformed audience. I want to stress the fact that because these explanations are given that anyone wanting to watch this show requires no previous knowledge or even interest an volleyball \u2013 I myself was in that position before starting and after finishing found that the show was able to show the game being played in an incredibly interesting way \u2013 no more than a few points are scored the same way within the course of any one game and the strategy of each team playing constantly evolves as the match progresses. The show does an amazing job in making each point feel unpredictable and in this way it avoids cliches and tired conventions.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, because the show has so many characters who each exhibit a great deal of detail, there is a decent amount of character development all around with some players receiving slightly more than others and new dramas and tensions surfacing and resolving all the while \u2013 many a character is done justice in this way and it feels like each player gets the focus they deserve. The show may focus a lot of its attention on the game of volleyball however that is where these character traits and differences manifest themselves and so the games become doubly interesting because of this. Your investment is heightened because each point means more than just a point within the game \u2013 it is equates to the moral of the players, their progress or setbacks in the attainment of their personal goals, and for some players, their legacy.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nI felt the music was good throughout the show however found that the music improved noticeably in the second half \u2013 no longer just matching and supporting the scenes, but amplifying them. Some of the key moments and turning points benefit immensely from the exceptional soundtrack and you are really able to feel the drama and tension of the moment because of its presence. I think this category is another place the show succeeds excessively if only not as monstrously as it does in the others.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nFor the first time in a long while I have almost nothing but good things to say about a show and whatever small critiques and qualms I might have vanish beneath the overwhelming positive aspects of the show previously cited. For a show that doesn\u2019t necessarily have a premise with wide appeal it does a fantastic job of being engaging on multiple levels and works well despite its potential niche appeal outside the umbrella of the sports genre.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nI gave Haikyuu!! a 9 because not only did it far exceed my meager expectations but it did so without going blow for blow with its pros and cons \u2013 almost everything about the show was approached and executed in stellar fashion and there was very little I would have wanted changed. I can say nothing more about a show that has so many successes and I believe that if I had, beforehand, an interest in either sports or volleyball like some viewers, that this show could easily be a 10.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve stated previously, the show does not require any previous knowledge of the game or even sports and so I would recommend it with equal intensity to both sports/volleyball fans and others alike. Honestly I think it is a great show for everyone because it asks so little of its viewers in terms of interests and presents its characters and concepts pretty plainly. There\u2019s a fair share of both drama and comedy amongst both during and between the games and each are carried out at a level that I can safely recommend the show to seekers of both.",

It has a good team work (more than others sports-animes), all the characters are really explored (comparing, for example, to KnB which are more \"individual\"). It works really well in group and focus on secondary characters too. Also, I do think chemistry between Kageyama and Hinata (The two main characters?) work pretty well.\r\nThe plot is not a big deal. You know, this is a anime about sports after all. And recently we have a lot of this stuff (Kuroko no Basket, Free! Diamond no Ace, etc). I just think theycould run from cliche in the season finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening is really nice! (I liked more than the second) I enjoyed the both endings.

            "content": "Is Haikyuu!! a volleyball version of KnB? Yeah, pretty much. Does it mean it's bad? No, not really. \r\n\tIn my honest opinion, sports genre in anime, especially shounen related, has gone way too stale over the past few years. They're all driving the same formula, and, while it is fun and games, it's also extremely predictable and at times flat out boring and unwatchable. Unfortunately, Haikyuu!! suffers from same problems most of these sports anime do - it takes every play in the book and drives it home without stopping. The one spin, though, is that the initial \"rivals\" become teammates, but that's about it.You'll probably see me comparing this anime to a few others during this review, but I think that it's best to do that since they're so similar. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe story of Haikyuu!! follows Hinata and Tobio as they battle their way through the pains of high school volleyball. If this anime fails anywhere, it's probably here - as I said, it's a complete and all-through textbook drive of cliches and predictability. Think KnB, think DnA, think Eyeshield - it's exactly that. A group of people gathers with one unified goal, they have some kind of a special talent(s), but they quickly learn those talents aren't enough so they have to keep training harder to beat their \"rivals\". You'd think that's a spoiler, but it seems that it's pretty much given in today's sport genre in anime. The story follows the code and it never lets it go, drilling it to max until the very end. Short version? Extremely disappointing. The lack of progress is not as obvious, since there are quite a few matches through the game, but you quickly learn that the story is nothing special. By the time you reach episode 10, you'll know how this anime will end and lead off into the second season. I'll give credit that matches are exciting, but that's far less of a credit to the story than it is to the animation. Other than that, nothing really to talk about.\\n\\n\r\n\tProduction department, as with any anime, had its ups and downs. Outside of volleyball part, animation is just terrible. Stiff movement, or rather no movement at all, is just painful to watch after some really exciting sequences during the matches. Speaking of matches, for the most part they're animated quite well. \"Special moves\" have their punch, action is fast and fluid, and ... well, as I said, it is really like volleyball version of KnB. Literally - albeit a tad bit more realistic. I did like the color pallet since it was quite bright, and facial expressions, may it be comedy or something else, were done rather well. On the sound department, there are a few noticeable songs that will be repeated to hell throughout the anime, but they're quite well done so you won't mind them as much. There will be some voices that will annoy you, but even that for the most part is good. \\n\\n\r\n\tCharacters are the best part of this anime - but, to be honest, they always are. In order for a sport anime to succeed, it needs to have good characters - and Haikyuu!! delivers there. Fun and outgoing, over-thinker and loner, kind giant, loud-mouth kid-looking guy, cute girl manager, surface-calm, beneath-demon kind of a guy ... you get it. Outside of maybe our two MC's, characters, for the most part, remain exactly the same, but they're fun to watch. They deliver some flat out funny moments, and with them on-board it doesn't feel like much of a pain to sit through this anime. Honestly, though, you've seen these characters all before. The only saving grace is that they are executed well and that's it. Nothing original or outside the norm.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs much as I've complained about Haikyuu!!, I did enjoy the anime. It has exciting matches, funny characters and fluid animation. It succeeds where any popular sports anime succeeds and fails where any popular sports anime succeeds. For instance, matches are more exciting than Diamond no Ace's, special moves are not as exciting as in KnB or Eyeshield, animation is more fluid than in Eyeshield, characters are better than in KnB, etc., so they kind of balance themselves out. \\n\\n\r\n\tOverall - I do recommend it, even if you're not a sports fan. It's an easy watch and, unless you watched either one of the anime I've mentioned before and flat-out hated it, I don't see a reason why you won't enjoy this anime as well.",

            "content": "Haikyuu: \"The Sports Anime\" The Anime: Volleyball Edition\r\nI often hear people say, \"I don't even like sports and even I loved this!\" about this genre. I have the opposite problem in that despite the fact I am a gigantic sports fan IRL, sports anime is not something that has resonated with me for whatever reason. However, given the high MAL scores and endless 10/10 reviews for all things Haikyuu, I thought it was fair to give the genre another shot. \r\nWell, did Haikyuu ignite my interest in sport anime? The short answer? No. But that doesn't mean it was bad. While Haikyuu executed everything itset out to really well, the problem is it set its sights too low. It was more than comfortable being just another formulaic sport anime. If you've seen any amount of sport anime, you've seen most of what Haikyuu has to offer up already. \\n\\n\r\nYou have the plucky but passionate underdog main character. The rival turned teammate. The guy with too much confidence. The guy with too little confidence. The \"interesting\" group of first-years. The slow-motion action and reaction shots. The natural talent that doesn't really love the sport. The list goes on and on. It's a sports anime trope gold mine.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so now that we've established how \"been-there, done-that\" the sports portion of the show feels, what about the rest Haikyuu? And to that I ask, the rest of Haikyuu? Unlike, say Cross Game, there is almost nothing going on that is not somehow volleyball-related. It basically puts all its eggs in the \"I really hope you care about these volleyball players' high school volleyball careers\" basket. \\n\\n\r\nAnd therein lies the problem. Before anything else, they are volleyball players, not human beings. It should be reversed. Even these so-called \"human moments\" that come up frequently, they all revolve around volleyball. A sports anime should make me care about them as people first, otherwise why should I care about this group more than any of their opponents? By virtue of more screentime?\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone is still reading they might ask, why give this a 7? This review sounds more like a 3. Well, I mentioned it briefly, but even though I find most of the show ridden with cliches, I still think it was executed exceptionally well. The matches do a fabulous job at building hype for each and every semi-important moment. It's clear a great deal of thought and planning went into making every match as gripping as possible. The sound department really nailed it here in particular. Not just the OP/EDs but the OST interspersed throughout each episode gave the show a sense of real suspense. And of course, the voice acting was on-point throughout. I don't have one specific seiyuu to shout-out, but they were all at least above-average. And the characters, well they weren't the deepest group, but they were at time entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, for a show that did so many things well, Haikyuu left me wishing it could have been a bit more ambitious. I can see why people like it. The matches are surprisingly intense, the music is great, some of the characters are quite colorful (if not a bit one-dimensional), and there are plenty of anime boys for the younger female demographic to crush on, but I can't help but wonder what could've been if they had just reached a bit higher. I'm not saying you have to re-invent the wheel, but at least attempt to improve on it.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

'Of course I won't like it,' I told myself, 'It's literally about sports!' Yet, I couldn't find that more wrong. I wouldn't say Haikyuu is my favorite anime, but I can say it was one of my favorites. \r\nThis anime really gets me all riled up just watching it. Whenever there's an official match between Karasuno and another team, I find myself on the edge of my seat. Whenever they score a point, (mentally) I scream just as loud as they are(which is pretty loud).\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't your usual story. It doesn't tell you that your dream will magically come true if you 'believe' in it. No. In fact, every single team that fights Karasuno is given just enough screen time to show that they want to win just as much as Karasuno. Really, the theme here is not that dreams come true, but rather you need to get your hands dirty to make them come true.",

When i hear the name of Production Ig studio i know with no doubt that the animation and music are goint to be as excellent as always and this anime is a total proof. The story, if you ask me, is mainstream because it shows us the classic high school team that plays a sport, volley in this case, but you have to know for sure that is not a problem at all because it is so well structured and there is no flaw neither on character development nor on the story. Finally, there is a major belief betweenthe fans that they enjoyed so much the anime that they could not wait for the next season.  \\n\\n\r\nPm Because i have not observed volleball matches before this anime and this is my first contact with volley i dont know for sure if there are some volleyball mistakes and exaggerations, so i cant comment them. But i believe there arent.\\n\r\nAfter all, we watch anime not a real volleyball match.",

            "content": "Even though Haikyuu!! is some typical sports anime, it's enjoyable, espeicially when it's about volleyball which is a bit different compared to other ball sports like soccer or basketball that are getting pretty boring now. An example is that in volleyball, the whole team is needed to complete eachother, like pieces in a puzzle, otherwise you wont get any further without the missing/next piece. Anyhow, you somehow feel like your part of the team and really cheer for them. Haikyuu!! really shows and explain alot of stuff too, so you don't really need to know alot about volleyball before watching the show. They've also donea nice job on relating to reality because when I compare some of their situations to my experiences I really know how they are feeling, so you can say that it is a kind of slice-of-life anime but in a different way..\\n\\n\r\nWell viewing the anime from my own perpective, I've always had a little intrest in volleyball since I was thirteen but never took the initiative to do somehting about it, but after watching the show, I really feel that I want to start training volleyball even if I'm a little older now, but it's better to late than never. It gives yo the kind of courage and motivates you, that's just what happened to me, however as I stated before, I was already intrested in volleyball so this might not apply to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice and the animation has good quality, yet to be honest at first I wasn't so used to the character design itself because it's quite different in a way compared to others that I've seen, but I got used to it after watching some episodes so it's no big deal.. However, the sound isn't really something so special, and the songs aren't the best but it doesn't really effect the anime at all, but it would be nice sometimes to sing/hum good anime songs to get some flashbacks on them and get intrested in watching some major moments from the anime just randomly on youtube or somthing similiar. \\n\\n\r\nThe final thing I want to state are the characters. Every character has their own speacilty and are all included equally in the story even though there are main characters. You maybe won't fully see it in the first season but there's also a second season that continues to show that with the other characters. And obviously, in all animes, the characters are always one of the most important things in making an anime sucessfull.",

            "content": "Haikyuu!! is the starting point of my serve towards the court of sports anime. (Volleyball reference NAILED... or not.)\r\nBeing someone who plays volleyball myself, I instantly made a connection with the characters and the story of the anime. \r\nWatching more of it, my passion towards volleyball boosted much higher, like Hinata's extraordinary jump as he spikes the ball.\r\nOkay, I really need to stop making lame references and actually get into reviewing this terrific series.\r\n1. Story [10/10]\r\nUtterly, and completely. This was the first sports anime series that I have ever watched, but its story already impressed me since the first episode. \r\nThere is an element ofreality in the story. I was really impressed with the knowledge it has. It really gave me a lot of volleyball skills which can easily be applied to real life games. (Although, of course, I'm nowhere near the characters' volleyball skills... oh well.)\\n\\n\r\nIt is a story of evolution, a story of improvement and pushing the characters to their highest points. The excitement is aptly sustained throughout the series (makes you go all \"Gwahh!!\" and \"Aah!!!\" when you finish watching an episode... please ignore my try-so-hard puns *you'll get it when you watch the series*). \\n\\n\r\nThere are unpredictable twists at times as well, making you ponder about it for a long time. At times, it will also make you stiffen as you stare at the screen with your jaw dropped, wondering what in the world just happened. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up: you will be awed by the story. That's all.\\n\\n\r\n2. Art [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nWow, the animation is impressive. It clearly illustrates the spikes, the jumps, the beautiful serves that (the cutie) Kageyama, as well as other (cuties) characters' skills. What I especially liked is that the art is very realistic - it makes you think that this is not just an anime series, but a real footage, of real people playing. \\n\\n\r\n3. Sound [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nSPYAIR gave this series the best opening ever, and the directors of this anime series chose the best opening ever. \"Imagination\" will boost your excitement to the highest - I really did jump up and down whenever the song played. The ending was cute as well - it was upbeat, but it still had a certain depth that waited to be explored. (YURERU KAGEROUUU--- okay, I should stop.)\\n\\n\r\nJust a little spoiler for those who haven't watched this series yet... Haikyuu!! Second Season's opening will also be a song by SPYAIR. So WATCH. It. xD\\n\\n\r\n4. Character [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nWow. Just... wow. Haikyuu!! definitely blew me away at this area. To be honest, I... kind of expected typical -dere stereotypes shoved into the characters, but no. The personalities are varied and extremely appealing. From the seemingly tough Kageyama to the ever-energetic Hinata, you can clearly see the different auras each character radiates. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the characters all go through the same journey together, but with different perceptions based on their characteristics. All of them, however, will make you smile as they slowly, but surely, step onto the porch of maturity and spread their wings wide on the sky of life... all sweating and laughing after the hard work they have gone through. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, did I mention that Kageyama is a cutie?\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, a truly enjoyable series is something that will make me watch all of it, not just out of the feeling of accomplishment. And Haikyuu really achieved this. \\n\\n\r\nThe humor, mingled with deep moral lessons, shaped me into who I am now. I laughed, I cried, I thought, all because of this series. \\n\\n\r\nEven if it has a hundred seasons, I will watch it all... because I know, with every episode, it will change who I am right now.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore,\\n\\n\r\nIt is a solid, sparkling 9/10.\\n\\n\r\n(Anybody up for Haikyuu!! Second Season? I'm gnawing onto every single episode right now haha xD)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I loved watching Kageyama's character development! NOT TO MENTION THE CHARACTER'S THEMSELVES! I loved ALL OF THEM!!! I love how they interact as one big family, and that's one of the things that get's me hooked. The characters and plot. And the plot. It was suuupppeerr intense and I LOVED it! GAH I LOVE EVERYTHING NOW MY TUMBLR IS FILLED WITH HAIKYUU!! Also the art! It may not seem much but you could seethey spent a lot of time getting in the hair, ball, eye, and clothe details. They really did well, ESPECIALLY when this anime contains a lot of movement. AND IT WAS SUPER FUNNY! Like half of the anime was them messing around, and even when they were in a serious situation, they still managed to squeeze in humor to lighten up the mood. \\n\\n\r\nlittle spoiler up ahead\\n\\n\r\nWas heartbroken at the end though. I cried A LOT when Kags and Hinata started fighting. It messed me up. BUT OVERALL IT WAS A DEFINITE AND ABSOLUTE 10! IT LEFT SUCH A BIG IMPRINT ON ME AND I'M EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF REWATCHING THE ENTIRE SEASON AND SEASON 2! DEEEFINEETLEY RECOMMEND IT!!!\\n",

There weren't any traumatic events that spanned 25 episodes. It balanced heavy volleyball matches with slice of life perfectly. Since volleyball is a team sport, there wasn't really any way around not having plenty of scenes where the protagonists aren\u2019t in it- so it was nice of the writer to make ALL of the characters of the team so incredibly like-able, as well as their opponents. Haikyu was able to make their duo the veryobvious protagonists without making everyone else bland and filler-like. The heart break and the cloud 9 feels... you felt it, over and over. The strong bonds in Haikyu made sense and felt very real. There was a lot of strategy and thought behind every game so it was always interesting to see how the players overcame genuine obstacles. The pacing was excellent. You never felt cheated: the development of character was through blood, sweat, and experience! The metaphors, the imagery, the music, the alternating slow motion and fast cuts- it was beautiful. And probably most importantly, Haikyu was super funny. They were all big goofs with giant hearts. I probably sound like Haikyu\u2019s wingwoman but watch it and freaking fall in love!",

            "content": "Review written on the 5th of March 2016.\r\nWhat does it mean to be the best?\r\nDoes it mean being able to overpower anyone and anything in your path by yourself?\r\nOr does it mean being able to share your power and ability with those whom you call allies?\r\nHaikyuu sets out to try and answer these questions.\r\n-Plot and Characters-\r\nThe plot follows a volleyball team that has to find a way to work together in unison to defeat any and all opponents.\r\nOur first main character Shouyo Hinata is a happy-go-lucky energetic boy who dreams big and wants to become his teams ace. As far as that goes he ispretty basic, he is in essence a protagonist onto whom the viewer should be able to project and he does a good job of letting you do just that. When he is happy you are happy, when he is anxious you are anxious and so on. However, his character evolves beyond just someone to project onto when he is put together with our other main character.\\n\\n\r\nThat character being Tobio \u201cKing of the Court\u201d Kageyama. He is the rival character for this particular anime. He has more natural talent than Hinata (Hinata has him beat in the athletics department, though) and is easily able to beat his junior high team during the first episode of the series. Even so he is not without his flaws; he is selfish and arrogant both traits which earned him the nickname of King of the Court.\\n\r\nThe anime sets these two up to be complementary with Hinata having the brawn and Kageyama having the brains, so to speak. Over the course of the anime they both learn to trust and bring out the best in each other.  And it\u2019s this relationship between not only Hinata and Kageyama but between all of the members of Karasuno High\u2019s volleyball team that is the most interesting thing in the anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound and Animation-\\n\\n\r\nWhere sound desing is concered the anime makes you feel like you are there in the court with the players and the spectators. All of the foley sounds authentic and satisfying.\\n\r\nThe overall score works well together with the scenes to build atmosphere though no one song in particular stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nWhere animation is concerned Haikyuu shines. Being a sports anime there is a lot of motion and it generally tries to show as much of it as possible. You have your occasional slow-mo scene or scene where it skips out on some of the movement during a particular serve but what is there is definitely well done. There is also a bit of CG used during the anime which is very well integrated into the rest of the animation to make it almost unnoticeable.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nMost important of all, is this anime enjoyable?\\n\r\nIf you like sports anime, volleyball or stories of friendship and teamwork with a slight touch of drama then definitely. It\u2019s more down to earth than most other shows out there, which in my opinion, makes it more more enjoyable then the heaps of battle shounen  which have the same themes of friendship and camaraderie.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flipside, if \u201cshounen\u201d tropes annoy you then you may want to stay clear of this anime. It doesn\u2019t contain many of these tropes and even throws plot armor out the window, something which many shounen shows are afraid to do, but even so it does contain some tropes which might be enough to turn people away.\\n\r\nAnd so after scoring all of these categories then taking the scores throwing them over to my spiker and having them get blocked by an iron wall I give this anime the respectable score of 8/10.\\n",

            "content": "One of the biggest mistakes you can make before watching this is think you won't be into it because you don't know volleyball or aren't into that. Don't make that mistake. This anime has one of the best character crew I've seen. All the characters are somewhat relatable and while there are stereotypical characters, they do a pretty good job keeping them unique. Most anime's have the flaw of recycling the same exact characters over and over. No doubt you will still see that here and you will still get a sense that it is an anime because of their interactions... but this is morelike a sports flick.\\n\\n\r\nMy brother and I are both 27 and 25 respectively. We both teared up in the first episode and there are plenty of other episodes in the first season where we straight up cried. This anime is very moving and while the story itself SEEMS lacking, the characters and their passion drives the entire series. And yeah when you're reading this that sounds kind of lame... but it really is the only way to describe this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is SO beautiful. TBH I think it's the soundtrack that contributes a lot to the scenes where you cry (and they aren't because they are sad scenes). Haikyuu is a masterpiece and just watching the main character will give you motivation. Just watching him will give you inspiration. And all of what they talk about in the anime translates to real life competitive sports everywhere. Like common sense on defense or attacking, spacing, or stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\nI felt at first it would be hard to actually feel excited in matches of anime. There was no way, I thought, they can replicate what happens in real competitive volleyball games. But they did make it exciting... more than in real life. And that's saying a lot.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Produced by the famous ' Production I.G' which produced Kuroko no Basket and being the next sports anime produced by the studio, Haikyuu!! came out with much hype and lived up to it in its own way.\r\nAs a sports anime Haikyuu!! is both similar and different compared to Kuroko no Basket while the differences outweigh the similarities. I feel Kuroko no Basket stressed more on competition and its spirit while Haikyuu!! has a slight flavor of slice of life anime.\r\nNow starting with the review of Haikyuu!!\r\nThe story of Haikyuu!! is not much different from standard sports anime revolving around clubs in school but rather thepresentation of characters is somewhat different. The story revolves mostly around Karasuno volleyball club which was strong previously but recently has been in crisis. Some new members join the club who excel in some skills. Now, the new volleyball club is trying to make it to the nationals. Though the story mainly revolves around Karasuno appropriate time log is also given to their rivals.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation regarding the series is quite satisfying and apt for this kind of storyline. The characters were good looking and reflected their behavior.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and the endings were good. Especially the background music was really well done which helps get into the anime many times. It was smooth and fast.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization in the series was somewhat different compared to other sports anime.It is little bit wide ranged and comprehensive. Each character is given importance and sometimes the side characters feel more important than main ones .The main ones being Kageyama who is a genius setter of Karasuno and had a bad attitude in the past and is trying to change it. The other one is Hinata who is a spiker, has awesome reflexes and can jump high. He is straight forward and has no intellect. The other characters are also well driven and unique.\\n\\n\r\nThe series carries quite some energy along with it and at many times goes along with a formula. There by depends whether you enjoy some energy along with a slight flavor of slice of life and comedy.",

            "content": "First off, when i started watching this anime, I didn't expect much. Well i expect something but not really that much. I love sports anime but i was quite hesitant to start this anime. I mean it's just volleyball, i don't even have the slightest interest in it how can i really enjoy it. Well, it turns out that i was wrong. SO so wrong. It seems that i was watching a contender for Anime of the year.\r\nFirstly, the story was really great. The build up to the main event was done really well and it felt like you're cheering for your favorite team inreal life. I also love how they're just not about spirits and friendships to win a game. They have to work hard with tactical and individual strength to go through and even with that, they STILL struggle to go through. Also, one of the high point for me, is how they show the reactions of both sides when the match ended. It's not just a little \"ah, dang it\" moments from the opponents. They actually show as if they were also the main characters. To put it simply, Karasuno(the main team) is not the only team with clever tactics, spirits and emotions. There was some quite cheesy moments in the beginning of this anime but it's not really a big deal.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was also done well in this anime. One of the high point of the art aspect is how they portray the characters' expressions and emotions throughout the series. You can feel the anger, joy and intimidation from the characters. It was also used well to portray some epic moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was used really well in this series to fit in each scene especially in the matches and during the build up to the main event. It doesn't felt out of place. Especially the cheers during matches. Goddamn it's really good.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters was so likeable and loveable. I also like to point on how Kageyama's character development was done really well. Not just the main characters, but the characters on other teams was done really well as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I really enjoy this anime and i'l be damned and pissed if there's no 2nd season. I really recommend it especially to anyone who loves sports anime. It really is a gem.\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "I had this anime recommended to me by many people, most of whom has already finished the series so were fully aware of the storyline. When I first started it, I could tell I would love it, the storyline is typical of sports anime as Hinata (the main character) sees volleyball on the TV and aspires to be as good as the professional players.\r\nIt has pretty much every sports anime trope I can think of, the apathetic black haired character who is amazing at sports, the character with a strange hair colour, the busty attractive sports manager, the sports obsessed protagonist yet Haikyuu!! still sitsat the top of my favourite animes. The character diversity in Haikyuu!! is actually one of the best bits about it, being a lot of teams there are also a lot of characters and lots of diversity, this show is absolutely hilarious due to this and also serious at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I didn't like at all was the animation, I simply think the style is bad and do not like it at all, however that is probably me being irrational and picky, the animation itself it really well done and I love the way it switches at some points in important matches.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very well done with lots of diversity of voices which is a real problem in some animes however I did think that Hinata sounded slightly too childlike.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who asks as the good points totally overrule the not-so-good. I enjoyed this anime a lot and it has a lighter touch than most sports anime.",

            "content": "Whenever I read or watch Haikyuu I usually smile, not because it has some funny moments but because it is done right. sure it doesn\u2019t have the strongest start and it can take some time to mature but with it\u2019s current state it can easily rival sport giants in anime/manga history like Hajime no Ippo. Production I.G is on roll and they are no strangers to adapting sport manga. with Kuroko no Baske anime series getting closer to it\u2019s end they started another sport anime already and once again they did a great job.\r\nHaikyuu does not lack in having clich\u00e9, but it doesn\u2019t rely onthem forever. The story isn\u2019t something complex. It\u2019s about a volleyball fan trying his best to be the best with what he has even with his shortcomings. the presentation is also good and there is a good amount of detail in the story but i enjoyed the good variety of quality characters the most in Haikyuu. I usually get to like one or two character from each series and don\u2019t care about the rest but with Haikyuu i can\u2019t decide which one I like the most.The confident yet not arrogant Oikawa,(as oppose to Kuroko no Baske, all the opponents are arrogant) the refreshing yet wise setter Sugawara, the manly and trustworthy Noya(he is technically the best player of the team after Kageyama at least) etc\u2026speaking of Sugawara he is not even the main setter of the team yet he is not just some useless background character. of course like many other stories you shouldn\u2019t expect much from female characters although the story does try to include them and the most useful ones only got mentioned/showed once or maybe twice (female group that trained Hinata) but other than that\u2026well\u2026it\u2019s just a sweet waste of time at best to me. (although it\u2019s better than having unbelievable female characters acting like males or doing things that they normally won\u2019t just for the sake of having a female character included). Although there is a chance we get to see the female team of Karasuno more because of some foreshadowing in the manga (appearance of the queen). It would be fun to see the male team cheering their female team in a serious match. also guess what...i didn't even mention main characters, that's how strong supporting characters are here.\\n\\n\r\nThe adaptation is done very well. The team did pay a good amount of attention to lots of details and added things of their own to make it even better (special cheering for whenever Oikawa is doing a serve just to show how epic he is). character designs are true to the manga (even those weird smiley faces) and you don\u2019t see a sudden drop in quality in most of episodes at least and thankfully they don\u2019t resort to just showing \u201cshots\u201d of things happening in matches and they show the whole thing (for example they could just show one guy doing a serve and then cut and show someone with receiving pose with some sound effect suggesting he got it, sadly things like that are done because of budget issues, here there was no need for it much thankfully). The voice acting is also good although i expected a different voice for Oikawa at first but i also like Daisuke Namikawa and he pulled it off again.. Some voice actings give extra characteristics to a character and if done right it can level up things a bit (watch Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun and concentrate on voice acting you will 100% understand. There is nothing challenging there and yet some voice acting made the whole thing more interesting). in Haikyuu that is also the case to some extent at least.\\n\\n\r\nAll an all Haikyuu has a bright future if the Mangaka keep up his good work. to me Seijou\u2019s match was the peak of the story so I don\u2019t expect him to have lots of those moments again if he could have another one ever (I could read/watch that match 10 times over and won\u2019t get tired at all, and I did) but the story hasn't even reached it's heavy parts yet and some strong characters are yet to make their official debut. (they got only mentioned. we probably get to see them after they get into national level.)\\n\\n",

            "content": "To be honest, at first I didn't think much of the series after watching only 5 episodes of it. Now this is by far, the best sports anime I've watched (excluding Free! and Kuroko no Baskue who are also great sports anime). The story centers around Hinata who gains a sudden love of volleyball after seeing a national championship match on TV featuring one of the \"Little Giant\".  He makes a team in middle school but is beaten by the championship favorite team, and on that team is the \"King of the court\" Tobio Kageyama. Hinata vows to eventually surpass Kageyama and defeat him.Come to find out, the same person he vowed to surpass becomes one of his teammates.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime has a lot of great character development, funny moments, thrilling volleyball matches and a great plot line. I am happy that it has gotten 3 seasons and I hope that season 3 will be as good as the other 2 seasons before it.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, so I never watch sports anime before and wanted to watch a different genre anime. So I want to try between Haikyuu!! and Kuroko no Basket. So I read some people's review and decided to watch Haikyuu!! instead of Kuroko no basket.\r\nFirst of all, I have no idea about volleyball. I only watch soccer and don't really like volleyball cause it hurts my hand when I play it. So before I watch Haikyuu!! I didn't know that it will be one of my favorite anime of all time lol.\r\n[ No spoilers don't worry ]\r\nSo don't judge, but I watched Haikyuu season 1 - season3, 3 times in 2 months... First of all I'm the type of person who watch a movie and will gonna watch it again tomorrow. But three times is rare for me. So I watch 25 + 25 + 10 and the x 3 = so I watch 180 episodes in 2 months.. yeah don't judge I said.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to review season 1 - 3 okay.\\n\\n\r\n[ STORY ] 10\\n\r\nFor season 1, it's probably my least favourite. Season 2 and 3 were better. But it doesn't mean season 1 is bad, it's still good. It's just after watching it 3 times, there's some things that botters me in season 1. Is where the part in every game, Ukai, Shimada or  I don't know it's just there's always someone who explain what is happening in the game, I mean if they didn't explain we probably won't understand what's going on, it's just.. it's too long and you're getting excited watching the game and then there's a LONG pause where someone was explaining. Season 2 and 3 also have it but less than season 1, they more focus on the game. Other than that I LOVE IT. The funny and enjoyment from the game is equal, I really like it.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 is my favorite, since there's so many training camps. We really need more training camp in season 4 lol. And there's so many game in season 2, so you'll get to see new character, and their skills. It's just I really love this season, especially the funny moments in the training camp probably my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3, I have so many feeling when I watched it, I didn't read the manga because I don't want to ruin the pounding in my heart when the opponent is in the lead, so I don't want to know any spoiler, cause I enjoy watching the anime better. So yeah I literally scream like I was watching a real game when Karasuno got a point lol. This season was really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 4, it's not release yet, BUT I read the manga A BIT, because I don't want spoiler. It's gonna be FUKURODANI VS NEKOMA in the start of the season. Hell yeah!!!! SO EXCITED for this season. I', cheering for Nekoma all the way! Sorry Akaashi Bokuto, but Nekoma still my number one.\\n\\n\r\n[ ART ] 10\\n\r\nI LOVE IT. But for me I like the anime better than the manga. I'm talking about the art okay, especially the jersey of every team is really good. I meant Shutoku from Kuroko no Basket they look like just got out from jail lol, no hate I love KNB too, it's that their orange jersey is weird lol.\\n\\n\r\n[ SOUND ]  9\\n\r\nI give it a 9, since all their op is not my favorite but it's good. Although I'm giving a 10 for Haikyuu!! OVA 1 ending \"Hoshi wo Tsukamaete\" I LOVE IT SO MUCH, it's got the Nekoma vibes lol. For the op ed season 1-3 all of them are good, but my favorite is definitely OP 3.\\n\r\nFor the soundtracks, oh God it's really good. Especially \"Oikawa Tooru\".\\n\r\nAnd I love all their cheer song honestly, it got stuck in my head. \"Go go let's go let's go Date Tech\"\\n\\n\r\n[ CHARACTER ]  10\\n\r\nWHERE DO I EVEN START. Okay I love all the characters honestly, I love of the opponent and everytime they lost I just starting to feel sorry for them. If you watch Haikyuu!! I know you feel the same way, don't lie :p And the fact that most of the characters have a dorky side I just love it. It's not good if they always serious and stuff, they should also have their funny side.\\n\\n\r\nHinata Shouyou\\n\r\nTypical main character of a sport anime lol. I mean his hair kinda look like the guy from Ookiku Furikabutte and he's short like Kuroko from Kuroko no Basket. And had a tall partner who is really good at sport. ALSO cannot play by himself, he's in the regular because of his tall skilled partner lol. Well he's not my favorite character but I like him.\\n\\n\r\nKageyama Tobio\\n\r\nOKAY. He really look like Haruka Nanase and Hibari Kyouya don't you think, tho he is cute as hell. And the fact he's a dork tho makes him interesting, since he was a selfish player and he tried so hard to play as a team with his team mates and tried to smile even tho his smile is creepy lol. My top 5 definitely.\\n\\n\r\nOikawa Tooru\\n\r\nEvery girl dream? you can say that. I mean he's a dork and always teasing Iwaizumi but a God at volleyball when he's being serious. Oh wait, hmm he reminds me of someone? Kise? yeah lol but I like Oikawa better in my opinion. And he's always teasing Kageyama that he doesn't want to teach him, it's really cute.\\n\\n\r\nKozume Kenma\\n\r\nThis guy. Is cute af okay! He looks so innocence like you just want to hug him. And he's the heart of Nekoma, he's precious to his team mates. And I like the fact that he dyed his hair because Yamamoto told him he look like sadako lmao, actually it's because he doesn't want to stand out, but he really does look like her when he play his game in the corner.\\n\\n\r\nKuroo Tetsurou\\n\r\nMy favorite of all. I don't why I just beginning to love him even more every time I watch. And he has a dorky side with Bokuto. Oh man training camp was the best! And you can tell he really cares for his childhood friend aka Kenma. I love their friendship, although I like Oikawa Iwaizumi more, and no I was talking about their friendship not yaoi lol.\\n\\n\r\nSOOOO I have a long list if I want to review all the character since I love all of them lol, but this will do.\\n\\n\r\n[ ENJOYMENT ]  10\\n\r\nI really enjoy all the game they've been, and I need more opponent vs opponent, like Seijo vs Date Tech. MORE PLEASE, it's not I hate Karasuno, I love them it's just really excited watching other teams.\\n\r\nBut we have to be patience since this year ( season 4 ) starts with Nekoma vs Fukurodani. OH MAN! Can't wait.\\n\\n\r\n[ OVERALL ] 10\\n\r\nGOOD. No very very very good. I recommend if you want to watch a sport anime, this one is the best of all in my opinion, since I also watched Kuroko no Basket, they look alike but it doesn't makes sense that they have powers and stuff? Eagle eye? Emperor eye? Zone? Like what the hell, well Haikyuu!! is normal, they don't have weird power and such, they really realistic that's one of the reason I love it. And the funny moments is equal with the serious moments in the game. They like to tease the opponent in the game instead of sweats everywhere. Um no hate for Kuroko no Basket, honestly I like it, it's just if I want to review it between Haikyuu, Haikyuu definitely better than KNB.\\n\r\nSo yeah I recommend watching Haikyuu!! and don't forget to watch the OVA too, and there's different scenes you can watch in the 2 movies. Since you cannot see it in the normal season, you have to watch the movie also.",

            "content": "Well, that unexpectedly grew on me.  I am not fond of standard shounen sports anime, which is usually short on real character development and long on ridiculous over-the-top action, and that's not my thing.  But eh, I was in a mood for more sports because I just finished \"Baby Steps\", which was great, Haikyuu was highly rated, and I decided to check it out.  So when this started out with Shouyou Hinata, a tiny, loud shrimp of a guy showing off his Napoleon complex, I yawned. Of course he wanted to really play Volleyball, but he's short, and naturally he doesn't wantto lower himself to actually learn to play on the girls' team; ah sexism.  He doesn't so much want to play volleyball as he wants to be the Ace who spikes.  And then he goes to a tournament with a team he's cobbled together from schoolmates who couldn't say no to him, and promptly starts a rivalry with Kageyama Tobio, whom he just met at the tournament. And then he's surprised his team gets its ass kicked in the first round.  I'm still yawning.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the end of Hinata's middle school sports career.  When next we see him, he's at his new high school, which has an actual volleyball team, and Hinata is chuffed  But guess who else is there?  Right, Kageyama, and the rivalry is promptly renewed.  I should probably say that this rivalry is pretty much solely driven by Hinata; Kageyama really doesn't get what he is on about, he just doesn't want to take his shit.  Which leads to conflict with the new team whose captain quickly has enough of the incessant bickering and kicks the two out.\\n\\n\r\nStory:  simple enough -- a loser team with a more illustrious past, who doesn't even have a coach, and whose supervising teacher has no clue about volleyball, with various characters who have issues, comes together to form a real team and start winning tournaments.  If you've seen it once you've seen it a hundred times; it's shounen sports anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  overall pleasing with distinct character design for those that matter.  Hinata was super cute, and Kageyama's facial expressions were choice.  A couple of things bothered me:  necks too long, especially for Oikawa from Aoba Johsei, and really rough hatches for shadows under the chin onto the neck, which really stood out. The animation, as usual from Production I.G. was good, though some corners were cut (considering the cost of anime, I tend to be forgiving of that.  The only real problem were the walk cycles.  What the heck is it that almost no studio does those well?  It's probably another cost cutting measure, but people do not walk with such short steps, especially not athletes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Very good, especially as regards the music.  I kept myself from forwarding through OP and ED for the first half of the show and just about had the lyrics down when they swapped them out for inferior ones.  Voice talent is good, with a couple of standouts -- Ishikawa Kaito as Kageyama and Namikawa Daisuke as Oikawa Tooru.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: After \"Baby Steps\" the character development here is minuscule, but instead of just one character whom we get to know in great detail, here we find out a little about nearly everyone on the team plus a couple from each rival school team, so that's a whole lot of character development, even though it's mostly sports-related and therefore rather thin.  Kageyama experiences the most growth, but Hinata falls a little short (ha ha).  I really enjoyed the addition of another short and enthusiastic one, Ninomiya the libero; he and Hinata together were fun to watch.  The two women who play any role at all -- the beautiful, cold manager (who's shy but competent) and the captain of the girls' volleyball team don't get much play, but at least they're not annoying. In fact the show is blessedly free of annoying female characters, only at tournaments do we get the screaming fans (Oikawa's) and the dumb adoring ones who need to be tutored on volleyball.  No fan service, no romance, just some mild humour about certain team members who feel honoured to be pointedly ignored by the manager.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  way more than I expected.  I basically binge-watched my way through this in no time flat and the only thing that's keeping from from seguing straight into the sequel is that I want to stretch the enjoyment out.  While everything is kind of clich\u00e9, it's exceptionally well executed clich\u00e9.  There are a lot of annoying things that stand out -- by their absence.  No supernatural abilities, and while I wouldn't call this realistic volleyball it's a reasonable facsimile thereof.  I gotta find out whether Japanese volleyball is significantly different from what I used to play in high school (some decades ago), because a lot of this seemed unusual to me, including their rotations, lack of detailed communication with the setter, and the kind of stuff a genius setter should have known but Kageyama was ignorant of; like dumps.  But I didn't care.  The pacing was near perfect; it would build up slowly to a crescendo and then slow down, build up again, and so on.  The matches weren't too long.  The banter, which often annoys me in shounen, was actually pretty funny.  Hinata's rivalry with Kageyama, which had seemed so stupid and artificial, transformed itself magically into instant bromance in one shining moment when Hinata caught Kageyama's \"reckless\" toss. I knew people would be shipping those two like there is no tomorrow; it was perfection, and the gift kept on giving; the trust those two had was remarkable; they were becoming real friends right under our eyes. There were also existing real friendships here, and people encouraging each other when it mattered.  Where so often melodrama is created with stupid misunderstandings, there was none of that here, not anymore (there was clearly much of that in the past).  Yup, I loved it.",

            "content": "MY VIEWPOINT IS THAT OF AN ANIME FAN WHO PLAYED VARSITY VOLLEYBALL\r\nIf you've seen my profile and and my ratings, you can tell I love this anime and I consider it a favorite for a reason!!!! So I'm not just making baseless theories\r\nStory: As an athlete and VOLLEYBALL player, I personally level with the story. A below average spiker who, for a good while, only learned about volleyball through TV, school, and solo practices. He meets a spiker with a superiority complex and together they make the perfect pair that becomes a vital part of Karasuno. Just like Hinata, I was a below average middlewhom had to rely on leg power and a tall vertical alone. I also had to work alongside a setter who had a discrepant superiority complex AND self-esteem issues. Eventually, we learned an approach together that was vital for our team. The story was so similar to my time as a volleyball player that it was scary. For the most part, the story was believable and the obstacles the team faced were all things real players would experience. (don't have to believe it if you don't want to, but it's the truth). The only aspect about it that I found not realistic was the mutated quick that Kageyama does for Hinata. Besides all the explanations they give, the move IS impossible. Another aspect I found unbelievable was the idea of Hinata spiking for so long without even seeing the ball. That's also 90% unlikely and can lead to injury.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for the most part was chill. Nothing spectacular, but not bad, and I felt as though the games were animated well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound wasn't bad and wasn't distracting which I liked. I loved Haikyuu's 2nd theme \"Ah Yeah!\" and if I were to hear the other openings/endings again after all these years, I would quickly realize it was Haikyuu.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were what truly won me over. Each member had a story with a difficult struggle that either I myself or other real volleyball players I know have experienced. The drive of Karasuno was very contagious and always made me want to hit the court after each episode. Watching the games was like watching an actual volleyball match on ESPN and it felt better since I actually knew the players struggles and accomplishments.\\n\\n\r\nI think it goes without saying that I enjoyed every second of this anime.

            "content": "This review is only for the first season!!\r\nI've never written a review before, but with my overall scoring for Haikyuu!!, I feel as if I need to explain myself.  One of my favorite anime is Kuroko no Basket (all three seasons). Watching KnB before Haikyuu!! directly impacted my overall rating. Without further ado, here are my scores for each section.\r\nStory- 6\r\nHaikyuu!! is, from my knowledge, the typical sports anime when it comes to the story and how it unfolds. It starts with main character #1 and quickly introduces main character #2. The first main character is usually the one who has raw talent andwants to be the greatest, while the second character is already in possession of insane talent with an arsenal of polished skills. The way Haikyuu!! unfolds is just way too similar to KnB for me to be okay with it. It's as if every character in Haikyuu!! is just a counterpart to someone in KnB, and that slightly upsets me and shows me how little thought actually went into making this anime. I do have to say, the games are always exhilarating and fun to watch!\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nEver since I began watching anime, art has been the main drawing point to me. If an anime doesn't look good, I can't watch it, that's just how it is. Haikyuu!! looks very clean with a simple style. Most scenes are very soft to the eye and some just purely depict the feel of the moment which is awesome and deserves praise.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 6\\n\r\nI've never really based an anime off of sound, but thinking about it now, there are no songs or opening themes that come right to head when I think of Haikyuu!!. Though not bad, nothing really sticks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8\\n\r\nThough I feel as if every character has a certain relation to characters from KnB, each character still has clear development and advancement. Characters who are involved in the main story line continue to grow in fascinating ways that draw the viewer in more and more. Haikyuu!! creates a bond between viewer and character, so you really feel what they feel. Some of the scenes almost moved me to tears just because I felt what they did.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\\n\r\nVery few anime actually cause me to jump out of my seat and hit the verge of tears, but Haikyuu!! is one. Right when the credits begin to roll, I'm begging for the next episode to see what happens next. The only reason I wasn't compelled to give a 10 is because there is no reason a single game should take 3-4 episodes. I understand you have to fit small details in and everything, but 4 episodes is just stretching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 7\\n\r\nIf I hadn't watched KnB before Haikyuu!!, there is a high chance I would have given a 9 or even a 10. It really upsets me that the stories unfold so similarly and the characters are easily comparable to each other. Even with that thought, Haikyuu!! still completely drew me in, and made me enjoy and long for every minute of every game.",

            "content": "Imagine there was this beast of a sportsman, he'd easily rip through teams, one by one, no help and he was an ace at every sport you can think of. Now think of this, can you name a person you know who can do that in real life? No? I thought so. When it comes to sports, teamwork and dedication is key and Haikyuu!! presents that fact perfectly.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nAt the beginning of this anime, I wasn't really into it. Maybe it was cause I'm not a really big fan of volleyball or maybe cause I didn't really like the rival idea (despite the fact thatthere's a rival in almost every sports anime.) However I just wasn't enjoying it. I dropped it for a few months then I finally returned to give it another shot. I was surprised, was this the same anime I was watching and dropped months ago? Cause to me it was much more different. Anyways, back to the story.\\n\\n\r\nIt's your typical sports story, two rivals who try their best to outplay each other but are forced by the team captain to work alongside each other. The team then strive to win some sort of championship. We see the team's strong sense of camaraderie develop as each episodes passes and soon we begin to feel attached to it. However with this anime, each match felt intense, it felt as if there was no guarantee that the team would win, it kept me wanting more. I want go into too much detail into the story however I'll just tell you this:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has changed my view on volleyball.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was very pleasing to look at. There were some scenes where the main character, Hinata, jumps to slam the ball past the net and the way the studio handles those moments are just very beautiful in my opinion. You could feel the energy and power he's putting into that spike!\\n\\n\r\n Sound: 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the openings to this anime, the second opening being my favorite one. The soundtrack in this anime is also very... what's the word.. dutiable for this type of anime. An intense and upbeat style for intense moments and slow and calming music for sad moments. This anime soundtrack has music for almost every feeling the human can experience (except the naughty ones, stop drooling you perv.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nCliche characters with a twist. I know I'm contradicting myself but hear me out! The characters in Haikyuu behave how you expect to behave like however as the anime progresses, we begin to see them develop and break free and really change into their own little unique character. The cast of Haikyuu are really a fun and wacky bunch to watch, the way they interact with each other (Hinata and Kageyama especially) leaves a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was a fun ride, at the start I was turned off however the more I watched, the more I began to see how good this anime actually is. I recommend it to any sports fan out there, if you're looking to laugh, cry and laugh some more, this anime is for you.",

            "content": "After re-watching this show multiple times, I think it's prime time for a review. :3\r\n-Story-\r\n8/10\r\nHaikyuu has a pretty solid story-line, but dare I say I got a tad bored nearing the end of the show? Probably because I am not a fan of slow, and dragged out episodes, and each one was only the length of half of a game. I think it was supposed to bring more suspense, but I just wanted to see who would win the matches, to be completely honest. \r\nOverall, a pretty inspiring story of fallen heroes and their determination to come to the top! The plot wasn't exactly deepor complex, but I think it is a pretty good story-line for a sports anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, the art threw me off a bit at the start of the show. For some reason, every time I saw a side profile of a character, I kind of cringed at the awkwardness of the anatomy. But, as I continued watching it, it grew on me. I definitely like it now, but I warn people who have watched anime with a very realistic influences, art style-wise. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening was my favorite in the series. It really got me pumped for the series action. I don't download a ton of openings on my phone, but I did for this one. I didn't mind the second opening, or both endings, although, I don't think they met the mark that the first one set for the whole series\\n\\n\r\nNote that this is not an anime that I would recommend purely for the soundtrack. Honestly, I wasn't really paying attention to the background music.\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nI jumped into the show thinking that Hinata would be the main character, and we would only focus on his ambitions and goals. True, we did see it, but we also got a glimpse of other characters.\\n\\n\r\nI was also happy to see major character development for Kageyama! I thought that we would only see Hinata either meeting or exceeding Kageyama's skill, but instead they worked together and both improved tremendously.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite characters would probably have to be Suga and Tanaka. Suga is the perfect team mate, standing up for others and being strong on the court. Tanaka is just a silly, funny character that gave comedic relief but he's a cool dude :)\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nTen out of ten, would watch again (and I did! several times!) Haikyuu!! is a very funny, entertaining anime that I enjoyed a lot. As I said, I got a wee bit bored at the end, but the enjoyment throughout was pretty high. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this show, also great for people that haven't really watched a ton of anime. I have also read some of the manga (still reading), and so far, prefer the anime, but that's just a personal choice. \\n\\n\r\nGreat show!\\n\\n\\n",

I love the fact that it's actually realistic. I can see something like this happening in real life. I REALLY love how they didn't make them win every match. That's what made it even more real. I don't really have much to say about the story. The concept is very good. It's not very slow and it's not too fast.\r\nArt:\r\n8/10\r\nI actually really like the animation. I think it's super good. I like the facial expressions thatall of the characters made. They were funny. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nSub voices were good. The opening and endings were good as well. Not much to say about the sound. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nWhere to start with the characters. Let's start with the two main characters. They work very well together. Their personalities mesh together nicely. I know some people found Hinata (main character) kind of annoying, but I don't think so. He acted well for his age. His motivation made the anime even better. Personally, I think the characters is what makes Haikyuu so good. You can't help but love everyone. The humor is not over the top. It's just right. I found myself laughing so much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nIt's such a lighthearted anime. If you're looking to watch something that will make you laugh as well as cheer with joy.

            "content": "Haikyuu is fun. Really fun. \r\nAnd intense. \r\nThe matches are intense, the type that makes you cheer for them like if they were real. The characters are pretty realistic to me, they all have their weakness and flaws, which makes everything better. The main character isn't a super good athlete and this, for me, is special. You can see in the episodes his effort to be a better player, but he didn't become invincible or anything. He keeps not being able to do what a common player does, but you can see him growing with all the other characters. \r\nThe characters... This is the firstanime in the history of my life that I Iike ALL the characters. All of them! All of the personalities, the physical appearances, the voices, the histories... All of this makes me love them in a incredible way.\\n\\n\r\nI never thought that in my life I would enjoy an anime based in a sport. Never! I don't enjoy sports, except soccer because it's a tradition in my country, but I never stopped for watch another sport like basketball or swimming. But who would say that me, who is a complete noob in any kind of sport, would fall in love for something like Haikyuu, that only talks about volleyball? I'm in disbelief until now. Because I'm in love with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI discovered Haikyuu on tumblr (like all the others animes that I watch), when I was looking for Naruto blogs. At first, it didn't seem appealing to me. Like \"what is this? A bunch of guys together doing weird things\", because I didn't notice that they was playing volley. But then, a lot of gifs popped out in my face and I found the characters cute. Yes, I started to watch Haikyuu because I thought the characters cute. But when I started, a whole new world opened to me. I started to understand volleyball and I never thought this would happen (I had volley on high school but did never understand anything and I always ended with a ball in the face, almost like Hinata). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it worth to watch. It's a really good anime! It have a different interesting art and a amazing history. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Another re-review.\r\nTL;DR:\r\n+Great animation\r\n+Great soundtrack\r\n+Great characters\r\n-Typical ending\r\n-Lacks thrill with it's sports genre\r\nHaikyuu!! is a volleyball anime and volleyball was never my thing at all. However, the anime did it's best to make me like this anime despite not liking the sports volleyball.\r\nBefore I start, this isn't an anime where there are superpowers like the Zone, Emperor eye, tennis ball that has flames on it - no. It's sticks to reality (That's a neutral statement. Not bias towards the unrealistic moments of other sports anime).\r\nNow, this isn't the sports anime where one character starts off weak - no. The team starts weak but the main character isn't.\\n\\n\r\nOne guy named Hinata loves volleyball and dreams to be the ace of one team (Ends up being a decoy). During his middle school, he had a volleyball club but, it had no members at all. He had a rival named Tobio Kageyama a.k.a. the King of the court. He's called the king because of his selfishness and bossy attitude towards his teammates. When they were high-school, both rivals are now teammates. This is where their journey begins.\\n\\n\r\nNow, coming from a KnB fanboy and comparing this to KnB, this anime takes so much time on character development which is best for non-sports anime viewers. For me though, I felt like this anime's pacing was too slow and the thrill only kicks in by the time where they joined the tournament which was around the second half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you know the ending of KnB's first season, it's similar to this one which is nothing special really.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the show is similar to Kuroko no Basket. Well, they have the same studio anyways. I do feel like they did a great job with the fluidity of the animation when they play volleyball. Though, the coloring is just typical.\\n\\n\r\nAnother highlight of the show is it's soundtrack. It's really light for a sports anime (Most sports anime would rather have a rock theme) but despite that, it really fits. The first opening and it's second opening theme is also great.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, they're all enjoyable and unlike other sports anime, there are no villains. It takes away all the cliche.\\n\\n\r\nShouyo Hinata is a cheerful guy. He is great in volleyball but lacks experience as a team. Despite that, he continues to experience and develop throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nTobio on the other hand is much serious. He does have experience as a team but majority of his experience is negative. When he joined Karasuno, he has developed and changed a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the show but I guess what this show lacks is the thrills in each games but the best thing about this show is at least the characters were great.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8.6/10",

There were so many times I wanted to scream and cheer them on as they played volleyball. In slow smotion....the sound with the perfect animated movements of the players....they jump....hit the ball.... will they makea point or not? INTENSE! Thats the word for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI really have to say that Haikyuu!! is my favorite sports anime, and yes I already watched Eyeshield 21, Major, Slam Dunk, Cross Game, KnB, Diamond no Ace.... If there would be a new animation for Slam Dunk on the level of Haikyuu, then Slam Dunk would be my n#1. But for now its Haikyuu!!, it\u00b4s not just exciting to watch, there also many comedy scenes to watch out for, the characters are so endearing and unique. It is a typical shonen sports anime, but probably the best out there til this point.\\n\\n",

Maybe to some people, but I really, really love this anime. The story isn't just about volleyball, which makes me happy. Although, 90% of the story IS about volleyball, the other 10% is either some friendship problems, dark past or something along those lines. I really enjoy the art, I don't know about you, but it somehow suits this type of anime.\r\nThe voice acting is very good. Especially with Hinata. His little happy noises, and even when he spikes the ball, they really suit Hinata'scharacter. All of the characters are loveable in some way. You cannot dislike a character for an exceptionally long time. Either it's a backstory or just something that they do in a match, there is always that little something that you will fall in love with. Character development is also something that caught my attention. Especially Kageyama's character development. \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoy this anime and await each episode with excitement. As I am also reading the manga, I can't wait for a certain chapter to get animated. I do recommend this anime to everyone! It's such a nice, easygoing anime with tons of feels. :)",

            "content": "Haikyuu!! is one of those animes that will make you want to become as powerful as the main characters in the anime. As soon as you've seen how powerfully they smack the ball you want to do the same thing. However, later on you notice that they're powerful as individuals but not as a team. This is what I love in this anime, all that tension and action keeps you away from what's really happening behind the scenes. These series is focused on a gradual, slow but sure improvement in their team's teamwork. To be honest, the first season focuses on the character building andmaking you want to watch the 2nd season, 3rd season, 4th season and so on... So there's tons of action; trust me, this is one of these anime shows that will make you forget to breath when you watch it. You should treat it as an introduction to the series rather than a full-out anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\nIf you think that you can expect the unexpected... Well, this anime will show you that you can't. Them unexpected twists will make your mind blow up. The idea of gathering all these people (who are completely different from each other) and making them play as a team is just beautiful; and they do it with style! Oh, I'd forget - there is a lot of ACTION, ACTION and ACTION.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is quite eye-friendly, the designers have done a great job with making the characters' faces always visible in such environment. Also, it feels great when everything slows down and that one particular second focuses on one character, it's beautiful when a spiker hits the ball... And these tosses - bellissima, buena, przepi\u0119kne!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\r\nNothing special, the music is not a very important component of this anime and I wasn't really paying attention to it, but I guess it's... Fine?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nThe first season focuses on the character creation and it does it really well. Everyone is given some time to let the watcher get known with every single character. Some of the characters show anger and the show sometimes takes a half of an episode to let us know what this particular character really feels. Also, there is tons of time spent on building the relationships between the characters, it feels great when Kageyama tosses the ball to Hinata... And he smashes it so hard that the opponents piss themselves! BEAUTIFUL!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI've never considered playing volleyball in my life, I was scared of it. This 25 episodes will help you build your confidence for sure. Everytime Hinata failes at spiking the ball he screams \"Again!\", \"Again!\" and \"AGAIN!\" to finally succeed. It also shows you that you should never give up as in the end, there's no loser. The loser is the one who gave up and the one who won was the one who understood its mistakes and improved... And that's beautiful about this anime. Oh, I'd forget again - THERE IS 1000000 GIGATONS OF ACTION.\\n\\n\r\nLet me know if this review was helpful or not in the comment section on my profile, if there's a way to improve - tell me about it ;). P.S. You can tell me that it's perfect and I'm a very modest person too.",

            "content": "Oh I am waiting for dislikes and hate comments on my profile. I can hear them flooding!\r\nNow, Haikyuu!! isn't exactly a bad or a terrible anime. My overall score of it is 9 because it did give me the enjoyment I wanted and did not expected to have from sport anime as I am not a fan of such anime. HQ is good show, despite the fact that I have dropped it I still have to give it the fair rating and this rating is that I have enjoyed that anime and I hope one day I will have time and motivation to actually finishthe whole series and second season. I am writing this review without finishing it because of the fact that this anime is sadly predictable one you get a good hang of it and despite my never finishing it. Maybe once I will finish it I will give this anime another review or just update this one but it all honesty (and sadly) I doubt there will be any difference before I finished it and after. I might love it, I might hate it, I might have th same opinion as it is now. Who knows? I can't look into the future.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, without further a do, here is the; Story:\\n\r\nHQ is an anime about a sport (that I never been fan of, still not big fan of and in future I will never like it) which is volleyball.( In all honest I hate this sport and I am very bad at it too. But I digress.) The overall plot line loops around our main protagonist Hinata, Shouyou who, after watching a volleyball ace nicknamed \"Little Giant\" in action, became inspired to become as big as the \"Little Giant\". Despite his small height, Hinata is surprisingly good at it (sadly not good enough as a Capitan) and after joining (and reviving) volleyball club that was suppose to shut down at his middle school, went with his team to tournament, only to be squashed by the opposite team and their \"King of the court\", Tobio Kageyama. After their first and last match, Hinata promised Kageyama that one day he will be the \"King of the court\" and will beat him down. After graduating from his middle school, Hinata got into Karasuno Highschool to where fore mentioned \"Little giant\" used to attend, to make his dreams come true. However things become complicated as he finds out that his rival, The \"King of the court\" himself, also attended the school and now is his teammate. The story itself seems like any typical sport anime etc etc, and it can either can with Hinata indeed becoming someone like a Little giant or him failing but still becoming someone amazing and maybe even better than Little giant. Sadly that is about it with the story itself as it is very simple and easy to follow plot.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals/sound track: \\n\r\nThe art style has this special place in my heart. It isn't amazing, it isn't outstanding but it isn't plain. Animes that have amazing animation do catch my eye easily as good animation will give you a lot and I mean a lot of eyes that will watch. Not everyone will pay attention to the animation itself and some people may even dislike the style because of its unique look. The style is a bit weird in my opinion but the way how its used (for example the shading, animation etc) really made me give this one a high rank. The sceneries are average and could've been better but they are sure not just \"basic\" or just flat-out boring. The soundtrack however, this one is the kicker. I said this twice now and I will say it again; the Soundtrack is amazing. The openings are always very good as well as the endings. Sadly compared to the first opening, second opening wasn't as \"exciting\" and didn't make me pumped for the episode as much as the first one did. The soundtrack is very nice to listen to but for some people this can be hit or miss, really depends on what you like. Overall, I love the style and the soundtrack, its a shame that the second op wasn't as good at first one. And about the endings, well, I didn't really gave them a good score as I think they are just \"ok.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nOhohohoh! This is the part where I will be able to grab lemons and throw them onto life. The characters are amazing. I love every single one of them (or at least the ones I've seen so far) and the way how they are presented is great! Our main characters, Hinata and Kageyama (Bakeyama), spend a lot of their time with same people at the very beginning, but as the series goes on, more and more characters are shown and their personalities get revealed quickly. When we meat some characters from opposite teams, we see them at the right times and it doesn't feel as if they are pushed there just because they must show their faces. The character interactions, especially between the mains, is good and realistic (at least for an anime). The characters themselves have interesting designs but at times they look either ridiculous or just plain. But if characters have amazing personalities that are shown from the very first episode then there is no need to complain, at least not as much.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nAlthough I didn't finish the anime, I have given it the fairest score I could've ever given it. In all honest, I love this anime. The animation, the characters, and the soundtrack are something that I honestly love. I wouldn't put it as high as Kyoukai no Kanata as I haven't finished it and it sadly didn't hit as high as I wish it did. But the anime itself is amazing. If you don't like sport animes, I would recommend this for you at this one is greater than any other I've seen so far. Overall, I would say \"WATCH IT\". Give this anime a good try and if you don't like it its ok. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helped a least a little.\\n\\n\r\nThis is IKira-n\\n\r\nSigning out.",

            "content": "In Fall 2016, I was quite new to watching anime, and I was more into shonen intense magic battles kind of stuff, like Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul and Fullmetal Alchemist. So when someone told me to watch an anime called Haikyuu, which was about sport, my exact words were:\r\n\"Yeah..I'm just not interested in sports anime, at all\"\r\nI could not have been more wrong. \r\nHaikyuu managed to make me love sports anime in just a single episode. I had no idea an anime about volleyball (which I had had absolutely no interest in or knowledge about previously) could be something I could love. In justthe first episode, Haikyuu!! manages to reel you in. It doesn't waste any time and starts straight off with a match, to tell the viewer what the show was going to be like and what was going to be involved. \\n\\n\r\nIt clearly shows the different personalities of the characters and (spoiler for the first episode only) when Hinata and his team lose the match against the other school, you legitimately felt sad because they'd managed to evenly spread the action and the backstory so by the end you knew exactly what the match meant to Hinata. It wasn't like other anime, which would have started off with the backstory and then gone on to the match, or told everything through exposition.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the rest of the show. After both Hinata and Kageyama join Karasuno, there's suddenly a wave of new characters. However, you don't feel overwhelmed at all. You feel as the characters would have - meeting new people is a part of going to a new school. They manage to spread the development of the characters evenly, so nothing feels crammed or rushed.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially in later seasons, you quickly start to like and care about new characters. Haikyuu does what many other shows don't, which is managing to put back stories and developments of characters in the middle of matches. It's basically a huge constant tournament arc. The reason I love this show so much (and the reason I rated it so highly) is because it manages to keep you interested in the games and makes you love the characters without you even noticing that they're doing it. Haikyuu is no masterpiece, and if you're expecting something with really deep meaning then it's probably not the show for you. However, it does what it wants to do: it entertains you. You enjoy watching it, and that's exactly what entertainment should be.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show to anyone who likes sports anime, and to people who haven't seen any sports anime because it will not let you down.",

            "content": "Uh oh, I'm about to do something not many have done: bring up problems with Haikyuu! Disclaimer: I do play volleyball, so please understand where I'm coming from. \r\nDon't get me wrong, I liked Haikyuu! and will be watching the second season, but in this review I'm going to talk about what I didn't like because everyone else gushes over it. Remember, I did genuinely like it.\r\nWhen I first found out there was an anime about volleyball (and not only that, it was really popular and well-liked) I kind of got really excited and placed it near the top of my \"Plan to Watch\" list.I'm not quite sure what I expected, but this wasn't it. I had expected something intelligent, engaging, and meaningful, what I got was a typical shounen.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Story: 7[/b]\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the plot. Nothing really special about it. A band of unlikely heroes come together one year to form a volleyball team that just so happens to be really good, they set their goals to be in the Nationals, they go through certain hardships to get there only to come up short when they near their goal. But fear not! There is a second season! The plot was pretty generic sports anime for me. Not much else I can say about it.\\n\\n\r\nHere's where the problems I, personally, have begin. Everything feels dumbed down, like it was made for someone who knows absolutely nothing about volleyball to watch. Now I'm not saying \"You should only watch sports anime if you've played the sport\", on the contrary, in fact. But they shove down explanations of the most basic moves into your throat, even down to the second to last episode. They always try to mask it (by explaining to other people the rules), but they never do a good enough job at it. It should be implied that your viewer is smart enough to be able to pick up on certain things with the sport after watching, rather than having everything explained in crystal-clear clarity. Take [i]Ping Pong the Animation[/i] as an example. They lay everything out to you clearly, but don't tell you specifically what it is you're supposed to see. It's your job to figure it out. That's a smarter show with more subtlety and more respect for the viewer's intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nThere were so many weird volleyball technicalities. I didn't understand if volleyball in Japan was that different, or if Haikyuu just honestly thought nobody watching would know anything about volleyball so they could cheat a little? I tried to look up the rules for Japan, but could only find certain things, nothing decisive. Here are all the little, weird, things happened:\\n\\n\r\nKageyama is supposed to be a genius setter and yet he's never set a back-row attack up until this point? And he's never even attempted to do a jump-float? Those are things we learn to do in club volleyball when you're like 12. And it also seems like he never dumps despite it being an easy strategy to get 2-3 points per match (also, he's tall and can jump high, it'd be even easier for him than most).\\n\\n\r\nThey don't use any conventional terminology when being set. They just say \"set me\". This doesn't tell the setter how fast or where you want it. A Go ball, a Shoot set, and a 4 set are very different sets, but all to the same person. There's never any indication anything changes. They also have a position called an \"Ace\", which I have looked up, but cannot confirm to exist. I know that Japan has \"Wing Spikers\" instead of Outsides and Opposites, so no problems there, but I don't know if Ace actually exists. It seems to just mean their best player?\\n\\n\r\nHow is there always a triple or double block on every hit? Most of the time, you're lucky if you can get a double block on a outside hitter, but they get triple blocks, even on quicks! Even at the Olympic level they don't do that. And when every hitter goes up to hit the ball, they always hit straight down the line. I honestly saw 3-4 cross hits the entire series, no joke. They always hit straight, which leads to them getting blocked. Then when they do get blocked, they don't go \"Hey, next time roll/tip it over the block, put pressure on the back row to get that\", they just say \"[b][i]Hit it harder![/i][/b]\", like that's not how it works. They also never intentionally aim out so the other team accidentally blocks it straight down out of bounds, and they never wipe the ball off the block. There's never any strategy in their hits.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there's almost zero free balls (or \"chance ball!\") in the show. Even if it's a bad first dig, they somehow manage to get a full attack almost every single time. That's just not how it works. And one of the one times the opponent's had to just pass one over, everyone was downright amazed with how smart it was to pass it to the setter. That's not that clever at all. A common strategy to break teams with really good setters is to hit, pass, and block everything in their direction to either force them to have the libero set or to get them out of rotation to compensate for it. It's something almost every team of every skill level does, surely a team that has a chance to go to nationals would know this stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThis is more of a minor detail, but the portrayal of the females in this show was slightly derogatory. I'm not going to go full SJW and preach to you right now, but this stuff was kind of obvious. The females were all strung over the hotshot athletes, the female volleyball team was the weak and helpless team that needed the boys' team's strength to pick them back up after the loss, and all the explaining that got done to help the audience was 80% of the time done to some \"helpless and confused\" girl watching from the sidelines. Sure, the main girl (if you can even call her main) had some strength, but it was just stereotypical, shounen strength, nothing resembling a real personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Characters: 7[/b]\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest with you, I just absolutely couldn't stand Hinata, the MC. He was the stereotypical genuine, happy-go-lucky protagonist. His motivations were extremely one-dimensional and weak. You lose 1 game in Junior High to a good team while you have a shit team so you swear revenge for life? And that's your driving motivation for the rest of the series? To beat him in a 1-on-1? His personality was so bad. Every interaction he had with other people was a \"feel-good\" talk, something to pick another guy back up on his feet, which got really stale after about, hmmm, 2 episodes. This problem existed with lots of other characters as well. Interactions that just started with someone feeling down and ended with them magically being inspired again, after like 2 sentences. Super clich\u00e9, shounen nonsense.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Art/Animation: 9[/b]\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were definitely great all-around, but I did have some issues with them as well. For one, some character's necks were really long or really weird, which honestly made some characters look like literal dickheads (Oikawa I'm looking at you). Also, there were tons of reused and recycled animations. Because everyone hit line, all they had to do was switch the character who was \"receiving\" the ball and reuse the animation over and over. There was no variety with the hits so they cut corners on animation. I don't know if this was due to limited budget, but it was quite noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I do have to commend them on are the volleyballs themselves. They were well-detailed and looked almost exactly like the ones we use in real life, down to the little tiny ridge details on the ball.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound: 8[/b]\\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints, but I honestly don't think sound matters that much (unless it's awful or amazing).\\n\\n\\n\r\n[b]Personal Enjoyment: 7[/b]\\n\\n\r\nI genuinely did like this show and I will be watching the second season as it airs. I'm just confused as to why so many people heap praise upon this show. It's a good shounen, absolutely, but it's too much of a shounen. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review and if you have any feedback (positive or negative, I don't mind) feel free to message me.",

            "content": "Few other anime could compete with Haikyuu!! for how invested I was during it's run. It really is an inspirational and touching story. \r\nGetting into specifics, one of my biggest pet peeves is when any given character (mostly main) doesn't develop at all over the course of the anime, TV show, whatever. However, each and every member of the Karasuno team improved in some way during Haikyuu!!, and not just in ability, but in character as well. Watching them learn is really amazing and a mark of great storytelling. \r\nSpeaking of the story, it's a classic underdog tale. The way it's told is incredibly well-doneand uplifting. If you're on the search for an anime with a great story as opposed to an anime with flashy scenes and little substance, Haikyuu!! is for you.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say that the scenes in Haikyuu!! aren't amazing in their own right, because watching these guys play is one of the greatest rushes you could possibly have. The way their matches are animated is beautiful, and it's highlighted by the brilliant teamwork and narration we get from the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not only an anime that'll grip you, but the quality of it is outstanding as well. For some reason, I've become entranced by competition-based anime. Mostly sports anime, and for good reason. Anime like Yuri!!! On Ice, Free!, Food Wars!, and Haikyuu!! deserve the praise they get because simply watching them will make you feel incredible. \\n\\n\r\nBottom line, I would definitely check out this anime if you're even slightly interested. It's worth it. On to the second season!",

            "content": "I am a very picky and impatient anime viewer so it is extremely rare for me to complete any series without skipping any episodes, but I have watched and re-watched Haikyuu! and can say with certainty that I have have yet to find any shounen/action/sports anime series as addicting as Haikyuu! If you are looking for some fast-paced, entertaining anime series under 30 episodes, then I highly recommend checking out Haikyuu! \r\nToo many shounen anime series suffer from one or more of the following pitfalls: 1) After 50+ episodes the plot drags and the series becomes too boring to continue watching; 2) Action scenes becomerepetitive; or 3) Too much dialogue and time is spent on world building. However, much to my wonder and amazement Haikyuu! does not suffer from any these anime maladies. Rather, Haikyuu is filled with hilarious and loveable characters, entertaining action scenes, and heartwarming/inspiring moments. \\n\\n\r\nI did not think I could ever be so captivated by a sports anime, but I am completely in love with Haikyuu! This anime made me venture into the sports genre and I've watched almost all of the other popular sports anime like Prince of Tennis, Kuroko no Basket, etc. but have not found myself attached to any of the other series. I'm not sure I can accurately describe what makes Haikyuu! such an addicting and entertaining series, but one thing the anime does with marvelous perfection is to introduce unique characters who undergo developments that are not cheesy/melodramatic and who possess hilarious/awesome traits that make the viewers fall in love with each and every one of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI breezed through the first two seasons, re-watched all episodes for like the 5th time, and am eagerly awaiting for the third season. I've actually had to resort to reading the manga but much to my despair found out much too late that the manga is an ongoing series. I ABSOLUTELY HATE waiting for episodes/chapters to be released so I have given up keeping up with the manga until I know that the series has been completed.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if you want a more in-depth review of Haikyuu! go check some of the other reviews left by other MAL users. However, I really do not think you need to hesitate any longer before starting Haikyuu! I promise you, this will be an enjoyable ride. :D",

Maybe that's partly due to my tendency for rolled ankles, flat feet and chronic health induced low stamina, but maybe it's because I truly dislike the atmosphere put off by such an insanely competitive industry. Regardless of all misgivings, I eventually decided to give this show, Haikyu, a shot. Still not entirely sure why, but that's beside the point - perhaps I'd just scrolled past it one too many times.\r\nAnd goodness, was I surprised. Blown away. Overwhelmed by what ajourney it turned out to be. It is honestly, what you could call a masterpiece for its respective genres. Here I am adding to the rave reviews, but they're all deserved.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so dynamic, it's addictive, the development and the trials they go through - such as dealing with things like loss, is all spectacular. From day one you'll find yourself laughing due to their quirks and rooting for them whenever they face their individual challenges. Just as much time is spent on actual training as it is on the games, and it is never boring. Over the course of the 3 seasons, essentially everyone recieves some kind of back story and fully fleshed out personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is brilliant - truly a style I haven't seen anywhere else, and it totally suits it (I mean, just look at some of Hinata's crazy expressions!) I loved all the designs. They weren't 'unrealistic' like so many other animes, but they were unique and each character easily identifiable. The animation is beautiful, and the sound track is great.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if you're still here reading, I highly recommend you start watching this instant. You won't be able to stop xD",

Granted the improvement in animation might be part of it but this anime makes you want to rewatch and alot more again and again and here is why. \r\nStory: The anime begins more or less as most sports anime does but due to it being something completely knew it also gives us a story we almost couldnt expect. That the little player is going to play with the big boys is probably something one canlook upon as something expected of these types of anime i mean its not the first time its been done but the way they do it is on a completely new version if one might call it that. While some other anime have similarities this sticks to what it wants to show and that is a team of old rise up again and take back the highest branch that they belong to. \\n\\n\r\nArt wise this anime has something rarely seen in anime i feel. Its hard to explain since im not good with explaining these kinds of things but as a character shots his decisive shot or does a great plays the creator of this anime has made the animation look none other than awesome. Its like if you feel its something out of this world but its just a well shot spike or something like it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Im going to get someone who doesnt like this but for me the soundtrack of this anime is priceless i want to love it more and more and listen to it all day long since it gives such a good feeling through your entire body as you listen to it. It gives me the chills when the music fuses with the actions of whats happening in the anime and it makes me want to listen to it awaiting the next time that soundtrack will be played in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well made in my opinion though i do see similarities with the kuroko no basket ones i do see the great original parts of how each character feels like its their own person. The main character isnt verysmart but they make him become an idiot that you want to like not that kind of idiot that you ask god why they even made him the main character. And the rivals are something unique i honestly found myself liking many of the rivals as much or more than i liked the main ones. \\n\\n\r\nThere isnt much i didnt like with this anime honestly which is why im not really going to nitpick to try and find something. \\n\\n\r\neventhough this is not a old anime i have rewatched it twice after the first time i watched it i love listening to the music and sometimes i just want to see that one moment that i always remember from it. I hope those who read this will too because this is a great piece of work in the sports anime section. So while i was going to give this a 9/10 as i started writing this more i decided to give this a 10/10 because it just deserves it in so many ways. \\n\\n",

He gets to play his first match in his last year of middle school, but his team got absolutely smashed by the opposing team. That team had Kageyama Tobio, a volleyball prodigy that's kind of a jerk. Hinata wishes to surpass him in the future, but only to find out that they were in the same high school playing as teammates ratherthan rivals. \\n\\n\r\nMy opinion: The story is very cliche and has a very textbook kind of narrative that every sports anime has. Practicing, then playing matches, reflecting on the things done wrong, and back to practicing. My main problem with the story was how the matches were kind of tedious and it was like watching Dragon Ball Z and how their fights lasted for so long. Of course that's a stretch, but it does certainly feel like the volleyball matches were a little too long. Mind you, the story isn't bad. Not at all. It's just very mediocre. Haikyuu's strong point is not it's story and that's just fine. It's generic, but it's done really well.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing. Beautifully choreographed and very unique. The faces are very distinct and they don't all look copy and pasted into different templates. How the artists managed to draw volleyballs is beyond me (its harder to draw then it looks). The animation feels very smooth and crisp. It's very bright and you can feel the energy. What I like about it most though is how it can really make up for the matches that seem to last forever. The animation makes you feel excited and keeps you interested no matter how boring some parts of the story get.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has a very mixed variety, which I love. There's a lot of energetic songs that make you just want to jump up and dance, but there's also some sad pieces that are quite heart wrenching. It's great, but some are forgettable. I found out about Haikyuu a few years ago because SPYAIR, a band I love, released their music video on the opening they sang for the first season. I did not want to watch Haikyuu because of the annoying fans in the comment section that were mainly talking about Haikyuu rather than the amazing song that SPYAIR sang for it. I should've picked it up faster, but the anger got to me. Anyways, SPYAIR is an awesome band and if you liked the opening they did for the show, please check out more of their content.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nFor this, I'll just talk about the main characters and my favorite side characters.\\n\\n\r\nHinata Shouyou- This guy is just really lovable and adorable. Unlike another energetic brightly colored protagonist I know, he's not as annoying as I thought he would be. He has determination, which makes up for his lack of skill and intellect. He's a character I thoroughly enjoy because he has flaws and he compensates for them, but they still shine through. He doesn't let people underestimate him and I'm glad that a protagonist exists where they actually want to make friends with people. It seems like the trend nowadays are brooding characters that aren't very social...\\n\\n\r\nTobio Kageyama- I freaking love this guy, no matter how annoying he is. He's so bossy and arrogant that it makes you want to punch him in the face, but when he actually fails, it makes you feel really bad for him. All he really wants, like anybody else in competitive sports, is to win. He's a sensitive and childish twat, but he's quite endearing. I love they dynamic chemistry Hinata and him have because he gets frustrated really easily and seeing him yell at Hinata just brings laughter to me every time. \\n\\n\r\nNishinoya Yuu- This guy is my guardian angel. He is the definition of SUPPORTING character, like he's literally supportive. He's fun, he's loyal, and he's fast. He kind of reminds me of Sonic. He and Tanaka are absolutely hilarious together, especially when they become masochists once they see Kiyoko in their sights. I love how he tries to name volleyball techniques like he's making up some Naruto jutsu. It's adorable.  \\n\\n\r\nTsukishima Kei- This guy. THIS GUY. He reminds me so much of me because we both would try to rile people up just for the laughs. He may seem pretty generic, but I think there's some more to his character than we think. I like to think that he's a class 1 kuudere. (Give some bromance to your friend Yamaguchi man. I feel so bad because Yamaguchi's best friend is this asshole.)\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are cool, but some of the other teams seem to have the same personality types as them. I like these four just because they all seem pretty unique to me, but that's only because the two of them are the main characters. Of course they have to be distinct.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nAll though there are some flaws, I immensely enjoyed it. I wouldn't consider re watching it though. I'm also not gonna try to read the manga because I want to be surprised for the seasons to come after, no matter how much my friends have already spoiled me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime an 8.8/10 but I'll bump it up to 9 just because.\\n\r\nI like this show. I wasn't expecting to like it because most sports anime tend to let me down since they usually end up to be more fan-servicey than it is about the sport. This was great though. You can tell that all of the interactions were genuine and that all of the guys are there to play volleyball and win. To close it off, here's my favorite quote from Haikyuu!!\\n\\n\r\n\"The last ones standing are the victors. Only the strongest. If you want to be the last one standing become strong.\" -Kageyama Tobio\\n\\n\r\nThanks for stating the obvious Kageyama.\\n\\n",

However I finally felt like it was time to give it a shot. I had high expectations and I was not disappointed. In fact, I was blown away at how fantastic this show is.\r\nI generally have a bad habit of getting most of the way through a series and really enjoying it, then never finishing. For the first time in a very long while, I was able to sit down and actually finish aseason that has more than 12 episodes. This show had me at the edge of my seat watching, and at quite a few points I actually reacted to the situations by laughing or cheering out loud. I almost never do that!\\n\r\nThis show just has something about it that makes you really care about the characters and want to see them succeed. I limited myself to two episodes per night and it was extremely hard to pull myself away each time.\\n\r\nThe creator of this show put so much work into giving each character unique goals and backstories, even the rival teams! At no point did I see a character and think they were bland. You really want to cheer for everyone!\\n\r\nEven though I knew nothing about volleyball before watching, I feel like I understand the workings of the game now. They did a very good job of explaining positions and moves without making it feel like an info dump. Thanks to this show I actually went out and bought a volleyball and I'm going to try and learn to play properly.\\n\r\nI'm really looking forward to getting into season two, I have no doubts that it'll keep me just as fired up as this one!",

Ill talk about the categories and review them as I see fit, however heres the way my grading scale works\r\n1-4: Not good/horrible\r\n5-7: Ehh/Okay Probably wont watch again\r\n8-9: Good/ Will most likely watch again\r\n10: Enjoyed greatly/ Will definitely watch again.\r\nNow that I have the gist of my grading scales down onto the review.\r\nStory: 10 So what is there to say about Haikyuu that hasn't been said. Its a sports anime about volleyball. Im sure there's been some good sports anime's as well as bad ones. In terms of this anime it goes beyond your \"Typical\" sports anime'sand really develops the story and the struggles of the characters well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 Im not art critic by any means. However I can say that Haikyuu has nice artwork. The colors can be nice and vibrant. Nothing is out of place from what ive seen, also I would say that its all well done especially when it would come to having to draw someone behind a net. They did a good job on that, and Haikyuu is overall nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 I love music in anime's and visual novels overall. Music can really set the tone for the story. Whether its hyping someone up or providing a sad piece to draw out emotion. The emotion in Haikyuu is more on the side of hyping you up. I loved the opening for this show. The second one in particular. The voice acting is done good as well. Its done in such a way that it flows and doesn't distract from the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s): 10 Considering this is an anime about a high school volleyball team, it would make sense that it would have high school sports athletes. I found that the characters were quite likable, and even the characters on the other team(s) had some personalities that were unique. The character development overall was well paced in my opinion. You feel happy with their accomplishments, you feel sad with their struggles. For a 25 episode anime they were able to pace the characters well and really develop them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 for me however it comes down to your personal preference. I tend to be well rounded in my like for anime. For example I like a mix of things from sports, to action, to romance etc. I feel that even if you dont play volleyball personally you will find enjoyment in the show. I think that all the things from the music to character design/development was incorporated well. I saw this for the first time early 2015/late 2014 when the first season was finished. I just now finished re-watching it. Even though I knew what would happen and the outcomes, I couldnt help but feel like I was experiencing it for the first time again. In my opinion this anime is definitely worth a watch, and maybe a re-watch if thats your thing. Overall I give the anime a 10/10 and highly recommend it.",

            "content": "\u201cDoes losing prove that you are weak? Isn't losing difficult for all of you? A challenge where, after ending up on your hands and knees, you must see if you can stand up again?.\" \u2013 Ittetsu Takeda (Haikyuu!!)\r\nSome of those who have already written about Haikyuu!! have mainly categorized it as a bloody good show with a high level of realism and great characters. It is true; however, it is not just about the sport itself, the much needed team spirit or the willing heart you need in order to succeed in the court. There is a decent feeling of longing and beyond that, theanime awakes a silent slice-of-life lesson during its first season; a lesson \u2013 or a topic - which modern society tends to avoid and overlook: it is all about failure.\\n\\n\r\nBut to put it plainly, Haikyuu!! \u2013 based on the same titled manga written and illustrated by Haruichi Furudate; directed by Susumu Mitsunaka - is a direct, straightforward and heartfelt piece of work; and the story, while easy enough to grasp, stretch far beyond the typical homilies of being true to oneself, or asserting that everyone is special \u2013 which is (ironically) already a given fact. In truth, the series does rather honor and celebrate individuality; only if you are truly individual \u2013 thus, being able to work on your own and yet understand others mind and knowing how to make use of their strength - you complete a team. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime opens with Shouyou Hinata, a young enthusiastic boy, who falls in love with volleyball after seeing a small athlete \u2013 nicknamed the small giant - seemingly fly during a national championship match on TV. He then decides to form a volleyball club at his school; but due to the lack of team members, he has to practise with members of the basketball and the girls\u2019 volleyball team. However, after a while, he is able to gather enough people for the tournament where his first match is up against one of the tournament favourites: a school lead by a talented, yet tyrannical ace setter named Tobio Kageyama; dubbed as the king of the court and the second main character of the show.\\n\\n\r\nHinata and his team, nevertheless, fight hard but eventually loose and his defeat appears much more bitter because of the arrogant \u2013 at times refusing - attitude Kageyama showed not only towards him but also towards the game itself and his own teammates. But still, Hinata does not give up his dreams and later he goes to Karasuno High in hopes of being in an actual volleyball team in order to defeat Kageyama. In Karasuno High though, he encounters Kageyama \u2013 who is practising by himself \u2013 and they end up being in the same team.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, the topic seems to be rather easy to understand and follow: it is a sport anime. Nonetheless, things are (and might become) a bit more complex if you truly watch this series as it is. It is not just about winning the game, being the last one in the court while others had left long ago. In one hand, it is about the team as a whole; on the other hand \u2013 when we narrow it down \u2013 it is about the individual on its own, thinking about questions such as: How do I interact with the team? What decisions need to be made during a game? What can I do as a setter/libro/\u2026 to serve and support the team? Fortunately, we witness many questions - and answers of course - as these ones throughout the show. It is such a pleasure to see how they come and work together as a team and how they keep pushing each other to raise the bar higher \\n\\n\r\nThere is no light without a shadow \u2013 and ironically that is the moment when the series shines out most. In the past, we barely have seen anime or films facing the pain and bitterness of failure. Is it bad to fail? Or\u2026 Why do we fail? Showing the effects of losing is a common thing in sports anime; however, it has rarely been done with such depth as it is in Haikyuu!!. Most other anime (and films) tend to only focus on those who lost to the protagonists. With that being the case, we unfortunately tend to ignore or even avoid the losers since we have been convinced that the only thing that matters is winning. \\n\\n\r\nIs it bad to fail? It happens every now and then to everyone; and we look then for a light at the end of a tunnel which appears to be a hope rather than reality. In the anime, many of the players fail and have failed; even Tooru Oikawa, claimed to be the great king in the court, failed. Sometimes, however, it is the failure that becomes the solid foundation on which a dream can become reality. That is why AND because of this, Haikyuu!! is also without a doubt a charming little slice-of-life show even if we tend to overlook such themes and topics. \\n\\n\r\nHaving mentioned Tooru Oikawa, this leads us to the players of Haikyuu!!. It is a pleasure of watching so many players - in roles big and small \u2013 who are so well-developed and individual; and each of them has a specific set of skills, flaws, fears \u2013 and even dreams. With Tobio Kageyama and Shouyou Hinata as main characters, it is also great to see that the show gives the other players a chance for spotlight. Instead of giving us the usual, faceless supporting characters, Haikyuu!! does the opposite. The most notable ones might be the following: vice-captain Koushi Sugawara, ace Asahi Azumane; captain of Nekoma high, Tetsurou Kuroo and Kenma Kozume; and captain of Aoba Jousai High Tooru Oikawa and Hajime Iwaizumi. Above all, it appears needless to say that there is a lot of character development to be found in this series.\\n\\n\r\nAmong all these character, Koushi Sugawara deserves a special mention. He is a third year student at Karasuno High School as well as being the setter in the Boys' Volleyball Club. However, since Kageyama joined the team, Sugawara is not Karasunos official setter anymore. Now, what is most wonderful about him is the fact that he does not dream of giving up on playing in general - although he was replaced by a younger player. As such, he encourages himself and all of his teammates not to give up; with the latter, he acts as a pillar of support for them. He is the much needed and appreciated glue that holds the team together (and in check at times).\\n\\n\r\nLonging is another, rather decent aspect of the anime and yet, many of the characters embodies this so beautifully. All of us know the feeling of longing; and while we are alive it seems as we can never give up longing. And at times, longing is hard to put into words \u2013 that is why, the anime makes such a fantastic and extraordinary use of symbols: the raven that rises into the air and flies away; the view from the summit whenever Hinata or someone else jumps. \\n\\n\r\nFurther, it may not be a surprise that Haikyuu!! has some great comedy in it, and it usually happens when you hardly expect it. This is truly one of the backbones \u2013 involving some hilarious \u201cover-the-top\u201d expression that generously pepper the show. \\n\\n\r\nAnother strength of the series is its realistic style. There is no absurd or supernatural movement throughout the show. Instead, all dives, spikes, serves, passes, \u2026 can be seen in a common volleyball game. Besides being excellently edited, the matches are fast, suspenseful, exciting and even dramatic - Realism at its finest. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design obviously shines through the most because of Production IG\u2019s high quality presentation. When you see Hinata speed up, the body tones are incredibly beautiful as you see the muscles tense up. (Based on Haruichi Furudates manga) Production IG manages to capture a pleasing sports character design as well as making sure the characters are not too overly muscular, unlike other sport anime. As a result, it is a pleasure seeing Haruichi\u2019s vision come to life.\\n\\n\r\nOne mark of good animation is when the viewer can tell from a characters body languages alone what they are actually thinking in a certain moment. For instance, there is a shot on the team manager, Kiyoko Shimizu, tensing up as she watches the game which tells us something is about to happen that goes by very quickly. Consequently, the viewer does the same \u2013 he or she tenses up.\\n\\n\r\nA rather decent, yet well balanced and beautiful soundtrack delivers all the emotions it has to. Nothing seemed misplaced in the anime where dramatic moments are also captured on screen with the proper music to make it feel and look real. After all, the soundtrack is worth listening on its own. On the other side, the voice cast deserve praise for their solid performance; it is their work and effort that helped the characters coming to life. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening (especially the first one) sets Haikyuu!! apart from most other sport anime since there is only one shot \u2013 involving the small giant - in a proper volleyball game; the rest focuses only on their training in the gym whereas other anime focuses on big games in the series. In fact, the first half of the first minute is a slow build up before anything happens. Then the angle of the camera changes rapidly; well-timed short shots from different angels can be seen which does not simply introduce the cast; it also shows each characters strength in the court such as the intensity of Ry\u016bnosuke Tanaka or Kei Tsukishimas blocking abilities. \\n\\n\r\nOnce the show has ended, we might realize what the series is all about. Yes, mainly it is about sport - volleyball \u2013 but there so many other things as well. It is also about the passion and the love for doing what you are doing; it is about overcoming your fear and proving that you are ready for the game; and - even though the anime does waste no time in mentioning it - that each of us is a talented and special individual. \\n\\n\r\nIs this not what makes a show so realistic? Or would we not care if it was not? An anime about sport that gives us an astonishing point of view about success and failure. It is absolutely inevitable to fail. Failure means a stripping away of the inessential \u2013 stop pretending and start doing what you want to do; you might fail, yes. But this proves that you have tried, that you have lived. And as Ittetsu Takeda stated at the end of his speech: you have only failed/lost \u201cIf you stay on your hands and knees (that proves that you are weak)\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI (a person who mainly watches anime but does not make them) consider the anime as one of the best I have ever seen in my life. Haikyuu!! is such an inspiring and motivating anime and at the end of season 1 I felt nothing but gratitude for the joy that the creators were able to give me: watching them thriving on negativity that has crossed their way, seeing the seemingly eternal beauty of passion and the power to believe - even when all turn away. And if I were to offer some criticism, it would be either the hope not turning the anime into a show filled with supernatural powers and abilities rather than being realistic; and giving some of the supporting cast a little bit more screentime as well as showing a new side of longing. But the season 2 is already at hand\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\n(\u201cFailure means a stripping away of the inessential\u201d \u2013 by J.K. Rowling; Harvard Commencement Speech, 2008)\\n",

Hinata with the dream to win, be as good as him idol and even better. He don't want to lose.\r\nThat's simple - \"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\"\r\nAs he said - until ball is in game, you didn't lose. \r\nThis anime is best motivation to do something what youwant so much. It giving the power, the power when everything is possible. \\n\\n\r\n\"It's true that I'm not very tall. However!

            "content": "Warning this Review may Contain Spoilers.\r\nSo I better review this before I forget what happens and then have to re-watch it to review but to be honest I probably wouldn't mind it. So basic background to this anime, it's about male volleyball with manly screams XD We follow the story of the Karasuno Volleyball team who have a couple of interesting first-years joining their team known as Hinata and Kageyama, enemies turned team-mates pretty much.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story, let's see we have a solid story pretty much where you follow the team training and battling again other Volleyball teams in the area. I'm quite glad that thisdidn't turn out to be one of them anime when they just win every match using their technique, it shows much more than that. The idea of attack vs defence, learning the techniques of the opposite team and using that against them. At first your probably thinking it's your typical sports anime, but the enjoyment level is quite high here, not as I expected XD\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThere is no such thing as a perfect animation, but here most of the facial expressions were well presented which added to the enjoyment of the show. When we got to further out side shots there were a couple of things that could be noticed however these are just minor and didn't really effect any other elements in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nNow with sound, the voice-acting was quite good, they managed to make the character personalities fit quite well. For Example, the excitable Hinata clearly had a voice that fitted how the audience viewed him well and same with Kageyama and his personality. The music, let's see the openings had that excitable feel to them, that just made you want to watch more and the ending were nice and light, perfect thing to end an episode. The insert tracks were well placed as well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFinally we have the characters, let's start with this long list of characters to analyse. So Haikyuu has many characters but I will be focusing on the Karasuno team plus a couple of others. The two mains, two very contrasting personalities of two former-rivals coming together to be like one superteam these two are Kageyama and Hinata, I have mentioned them earlier in the review. These two characters are kind of what you would expect, a jumpy one and a calmer one two very contrasting characters which really helps towards the story.Then we have the 3rd years, Azumane, Sawamura and Suguwara, now these 3 you really warm towards nearer the end of the anime as well as all the way through. They are in their final year and you really do find yourself growing towards them, especially when you get to know what they have been through. The 2nd years we have Tanaka and Nishinoya, two very excitable people, who kind of big the whole package when in battle, yeah volleyball XD. Finally to finish the main lot we have Tsukishima and Yamaguchi, these were the other two first years that joined. But to find more about them if you watch it XD This is the main Karasuno team, each have different strengths which in the end brings everything together, the characters in this anime really did make the story great.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT AND OVERALL\\n\r\nSo overall I really enjoyed this series and can't wait for the next series to come out.\\n\\n\r\n(Note: My original review for this series is on my anime-planet or on my blog if you wanted it however it isn't much different)\\n\\n\r\n-AngelBeatsYui-",

It's not only animated beautifully and uniquely, but also wonderfully done: in terms of plot, character development, and balance (such as its ups and downs: motivation, devastation, winning, losing, etc). \r\nNot only this is my favorite sports anime (currently, and probably will stay as so), it's also one of my favorite anime overall. I'm not only excited, but thrilled for the sequel to come out! \r\nAfter finishing this anime, I immediately went onto reading the manga (starting from where the anime left off--at chapter 71).

            "content": "Can't help comparing this anime to Slamdunk, with less wacky antics, less or even 0 romance angles and drama. I loved how good and funny SD was, but Haikyuu is an improved version on a different sport.  This show focused more on team game aspect, developing their techniques, competitive spirit, team and individual goals.  I've been reading the manga,  so for me season 1 is a simple yet cool set up for the next season/s.  I guarantee it'll be more interesting and intense.\r\nIf Slamdunk have sakuragi and rukawa, haikyuu got the dynamic duo of hinata and kageyama.  Two rookies withopposite personalities, Hinata -this naruto look alike isn't a complete idiot about volleyball, but needs more improvement in terms of skills. Its mainly due to circumstances, he never experienced being part of a descent team and play competitive games during his junior days. He lacks the height for spiker position but blessed with natural jumping ability.  While Kageyama, was known as the \"king\" because of his pin-point setting accuracy, However his junior team struggled because he wasn't a team player (a douche). He worked out his attitude problem along with his new team.  Thanks to Hinata, someone who can follow his sets with eyes closed lol!  What i also like here is how they share the spotlight with the other characters, including coaches and even the reserves. I can't wait for tsukishima (the blocker) shines for the next season and for the graduating players to taste the sweet victory. Karasuno HS volleyball team \"The Blackhawks\" will fight their way back to its old glorious days during the little giant era, whose identity is still a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nVolleyball has tendency to display repetitive sequences for non-player viewers.  Haikyuu's animation avoided that and highlighted scenes that makes a volleyball match exciting like the rallies, dives, spikes, players quickly movin and jumping around the court etc.. captured by good camera angles or movements and with the sound effects during spikes, ball bounces or hitting the net or floor, ref. whistles and shoe squeaking all of making the scenes more realistic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterizations are consistent when you watch each one of them on and off the court, its easy to distinguish their personalities which may change as they grow in the story. I also enjoy how funny the guys are, its your typical varsity players goofing around even when the game is serious. My review covers mostly on season 1 only. Season 2 is on going and i heard its grinding right now as expected. BTW i don't think this anime is goin' KNB way. ^^",

            "content": "As a guy who\u2019s never played volleyball in his life I always thought it was a much slower and less interesting sport than others. I was really, really wrong.\r\nThe Short Version:\r\n(+)A critical point for any sports anime, the matches are really intense and they draw you in.\r\n(+)The anime doesn\u2019t focus solely on the main character, instead focusing on the entire team.\r\n(+)Kinda helps the entire anime that the animation is really good (Apart from some parts in the matches).\r\n(-)Can\u2019t remember any of the soundtrack.\r\nThe Story (7/10): The story is pretty basic, because there\u2019s really only two options when it comes to sports anime, either the protagonistis really horrible at everything then they find a sport they\u2019re passionate about and, as the kids say, \u201cget gud\u201d, or it\u2019s about someone whose got unbelievable talent that they don\u2019t even know about, then they randomly join a team and turn out to be the \u201cone in a million\u201d that that team needs. Haikyuu!! (Yes there must be !!!!) I feel falls into the first category.\\n\\n\r\nOnce you get past the first episode and the MC gets into the volleyball squad the show very much turns into the run of the mill high school sports show, the only real reason they give for the team turning so hard is because, \u201cIt\u2019s the third years last chance.\u201d And that part of the show I rolled my eyes at, however. I didn\u2019t hate the show, because most of the matches in this show actually have some sort of meaning to them, and even when a character isn\u2019t growing in terms of talent or development, the matches are still entertaining as hell to watch, I go the same vibe from a bunch of high school kids playing with their balls that I did from Hajime no Ippo, an anime about adults beating the shit out of each other.\\n\\n\r\nTo speak about the ending briefly, couldn\u2019t have asked for a better ending to a long sports anime, it had an intense matches that I was so into I was breaking into a cold sweat, such a bittersweet down fall that for a moment I felt like my life had just imploded on itself, and such a remarkable set up for a second season. (Which is just as good imo)\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (7/10): The characters of this show are varying to say the least, everyone on the main team has their own personality and motive on why they\u2019re playing I can\u2019t really find fault in any of them, apart from the fact that I wish one of the side characters was a bit more involved in the show, apart from that nothing to complain about on the character side.\\n\\n\r\nShouyou Hinata: A very small, very quick spiker and one of the characters with a larger presence (Almost like a Little Giant\u2026..).\\n\\n\r\nTobio Kageyama: A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in tossing and the most punchable character early on.\\n\\n\r\nMAL only has these two as main characters and that\u2019s why I mentioned them here, you could however argue that the entire team is the main character, but moving back to these two. If you\u2019ve seen another little sports anime called Kuroko no Basket, these two will seem a lot like Kuroko and Taiga, you can\u2019t really have one without the other, because they bounce off of each other so well.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (9/10) & (5/10): The art is done by Production I.G, that\u2019s all I really need to say. If you\u2019ve seen anything done by those guys in recent years then yeah, you not what to expect in terms of quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound however was entirely forgettable for me, me being the type of guy that if the soundtrack doesn\u2019t grab me by my neck and demand my attention then if probably went straight past me. As did this soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of this anime?\\n\\n\r\nHurry the fuck up and licence it so I can buy the blu-ray.\\n\\n\r\nWould you recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYep, doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve never watched a sports anime, this is a great jumping off point, even if you\u2019re a veteran sports anime watcher you should watch this, you\u2019re in for a good time.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

I decided to give it a shot because I was seeing plenty of posts of it on Tumblr and I liked the art. \r\nSports anime are always about training hard, winning matches, and entering the Nationals, and Haikyuu!! isn't any different in that respect, but the execution of the story was well done. Compared to the manga the anime follows all the important plots and subplots, but tweaks the funny filler scenes to make it even funnier, so it doesn't feel like you'rewatching exactly what you just read and keeps you interested. \\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to relate to the characters. Whether it's the insecure yet confident and determined duo, Hinata and Kageyama, the fiercely loyal and rowdy duo Tanaka and Nishinoya, or the reliable and constant captain Daichi, it's impossible to not have at least one favorite character in this cast, if not all. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters (even the minor characters, who are not to be confused with supporting) are constantly growing. To be sure, there are a few genius players in Haikyuu!!, but that doesn't mean they have learned everything there is to learn. Victory doesn't come so easily in a sport that equally relies on the strength of each and every member on the court, even when there is a prodigy in their midst. \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu!!-motivational, emotional, amusing, endearing, and amazing. Make sure to watch it!",

            "content": "(This review encompasses season one up to season three.)\r\nSince Production I.G. created this and it was categorized under sports and shounen genres, I honestly thought it will just be another version of Kuroko no Basuke. But goodness, I was SO wrong. Yes there are famous and often cliched tropes such as the power of friendship, but even so, it, unexpectedly, surpassed Kuroko no Basuke. I had been a fan of Kuroko no Basuke for so long I even read the manga. So saying that Haikyuu is better than Kuroko no Basuke was something I never thought I'd say. \r\nThe plot is just very simple --there's a Boys Volleyball Club in Karasuno High School whose goal is to go to nationals. Along the way, they'll strengthen their bonds as a team, learn new techniques, improve themselves and meet various people along the way, may they be a friend or a rival. Does the story sounds familiar? Well, it's a generic plot in an anime categorized under the shounen and sports genre. I bet you can think of a lot of anime that has a similar story. \\n\\n\r\nSo what makes Haikyuu different? I'll be frank, nothing. Wait, don't go yet. I'll explain. Imagine an anime under the shounen and sports genre. Next, remember the reasons why you like that anime. Done? Well, my declaration is bold and may be rude but with utmost confidence, I proclaim that Haikyuu can do it better. Of course we have our own opinions and preferences but I believe a lot of people will agree with my statement. One of the possible reasons why I audaciously stated that is because of the way the volleyball matches were animated. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is top-notch. Production I.G. did a spectacular job. They showed all of the memorable scenes in the volleyball matches in various camera angles. They offered omnipresent views and it was so awesome. It made me appreciate and love the anime even more. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the soundtrack was, unfortunately, forgettable for me, it didn't affect my over-all enjoyment. I skipped all of the openings and endings since none of them caught my interest. However, the background sounds during a match and during flashbacks are notable. I really appreciated them and it added an even more flavor on the scenes. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching Haikyuu. The characters are so relatable and hilarious at the same time. There are a lot of times that I laughed out loud. There are also a lot of times when I felt like my heart would stop because of the intense rally or the slight uncertainty that they wouldn't win. And, since I'm already emotional to begin with, when there were dramatic or overwhelmingly gleeful scenes, I couldn't help but cry together with the characters. They immediately grew into me that whatever they feel, I feel it too. \\n\\n\r\nTheir character development was commendable as well. The creator made sure to not leave some stones unturned and the main and/or supporting characters each has a turn under the spotlight. It made me understand the opponents of the protagonist's team which I believe was the creator's goal. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, watching Haikyuu from season one up to season three was truly enjoyable. If you're okay with the cliched shounen tropes and sports is interesting in your opinion, then I recommend this to you. This anime is perfect to ease your nerves after a dramatic anime/movie/show and/or after watching Kuroko no Basuke or other sports-related anime. A must watch! \\n\\n\r\nI rate Haikyuu 10 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nP.S.: I'll be reading the manga next. I can't wait to know what'll happen next to Shoyo and the others. :)",

            "content": "Rate an 8\r\nEnglish Dubbed\r\nSad but happy with this anime. While the plot wasn't exactly original *cough cough Big Windup! cough cough* at least it was entertaining. \r\nIntroduction had a nice touch, referencing character mind set by providing a mini background story. Even with setting/ characters changing in one episode. Without this information view point i don't think the audience would appreciate the struggle the main characters had. Thus depriving an emotional connect.\r\nAs for opening/closing credits they did a great job. I get shows can be lengthy in episodes but they shouldn't be the same thing over and over. Otherwise people will be skipping threw themunless the songs are catchy. Each element you can think of from song choice to art work was changed at some point. Heck depending on what episode you watched you received an occasion small Easter egg of additional content. If that wasn't wonderful each episode had previews to the ones that followed. I understand that isn't an original concept but here me out. Recall me referencing change ups to prevent routine consistency. Let's just say while the same recap information is there from one episode to the following in change over. Art provides somewhat additional content by change in words and perspective in some cases.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter background was fully explanatory. Each reason you could think of for a character's feeling on a matter was explained and referenced back to on occasion. So, not only could one get in the mind of all characters including main but one could be reminded in case they forgot.\\n\\n\r\nPlot while not original did instill great teamwork strategies even if they were not as hands on like Big Windup!. Thus presented useful tools for daily progression in a positive fashion.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion i am at peace with despite feeling slightly disappointed. Yes, it could have easy taken the route one would have wanted it to but not only would that be some what unrealistic given the plot; but cliche as well. I also liked how they made it clear that there was a follow up season.\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect i didn't like was episode coverage length. I understand with games each simple action has a long impact. And the longer the game the longer the time will feel but why does the audience need to suffer?",

            "content": "I've already started the second season of Haikyuu!! so I guess that's evidence of how good it is. Although I did hesitate before deciding to dive for some more of Hinata and Kageyama deadly combos. Overall, they did a lot very well but it felt a little cheesy (I know its an anime for a younger audience).\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe set up was great. The characters made the story a lot more better than it was on first impression. I originally gave this a 8 then as I was writing I realised it was the characters that left a strong impression, not the story itself. But that'snot a bad thing!\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was awesome and very in sync with the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nI really like how the two main characters eventually become to be great team mates in their mission to be great at volleyball. The side characters all had unique motivations and were well fleshed out through their colourful personalities. The Karasuno team is truly a great bunch of guys to watch from a TV screen. Although the conflicts they were struggling with felt too... cheesy I guess. I get it, they want to play volleyball, they want to be good, they forget they are part of the team but as the season went on, I cared less and less. Hopefully in season 2 we can focus on other things besides how to be a good team.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nAfter watching 1st season of Kuroko No Basket I'm gonna make comparisons and unfortunately, it may have tainted my view of this show. They are different in so many ways but KB gave more enjoyment and hype factor. Whereas Haikyuu never reached that level of intensity that made me want to watch another episode straight away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nYo!! This is a good show but some personal factors dropped the final scores for me. There are many reasons to give this a higher score but I think its a matter of taste in this case.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cBecause people don\u2019t have wings, they look for ways to fly.\u201d \r\nSummary (TL;DR version):\r\nHaikyuu is a great sports anime with a potent dose of heart intertwined with excellent tension and stakes applied to the matches. Its core strength is how it manages to develop nearly all of the teammates and hardly leaves any behind. It isn\u2019t perfect as it is a tad slow at the beginning and some emotional moments among teammates I feel weren\u2019t earned; these problems were rectified as the episode count got higher. From a technical perspective, the music and animation provide some great mood and atmosphere when needed. Haikyuu also hasintense matches that can leave many audiences on the edge of their seats. Any fan of sports anime should definitely watch this but even ones who usually aren\u2019t should also give it a try. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n+ Great character development and manages to juggle many characters well\\n\\n\r\n+ Excellent animation and sound that enhances the themes and situations\\n\\n\r\n+ Enjoyable and can create a good atmosphere for almost any scene\\n\\n\r\n+ Very intense matches that have high stakes and it helps take matches seriously\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n- Pretty slow at the beginning and some scenes feel like unnecessary padding\\n\\n\r\n- Some attempts at emotional moments in the beginning don\u2019t really work well \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nLike many others in it\u2019s genre, Haikyuu is much less of a story or plot driven anime and more about the characters progression and growth. A good example of this is our two main leads, Kageyama and Hinata. What was interesting right out of the gate was these two reluctant partnership. Now this sort of dynamic isn\u2019t exactly new to anime as many have done this in the past with varying success. But where this one succeeded was that both Kageyama and Hinata filled a need the other had. \\n\\n\r\nKageyama is the character that easily got the most development. He slowly matured and become a team player rather than an individual one. I especially loved how he became a better setter not necessarily by becoming more skilled. He did it from learning how to communicate with his teammates and utilize Hinata in a way to make him much more effective and strong. Speaking of, Hinata certainly isn\u2019t a slouch and also grew considerably, learning to work with Kageyama and taking all the sets his old teammates never would. \\n\\n\r\nYou could also say this in general about the rest of the cast too. The seniors, while experienced and steady, need younger teammates to help revive the team back to former glory. I thought the two best seniors this season were Sugawara and Asahi. Sugawara had a dilemma of being replaced by younger and stronger talent while Asahi was dealing with unresolved feelings from a match long ago. Both of these problems and how the characters overcame them made Sugawara and Asahi standouts, even amongst our two main leads.  \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu manages to juggle many characters at once and give them development while not feeling too crowded. They are using the sport itself as justification for cramming in characterization for everyone, and did so well. \\n\\n\r\nNow this anime wasn\u2019t perfect and did have some problems from the start. \\n\\n\r\nOne problem I did have with this anime was that its pacing is a bit inconsistent, especially in the first few episodes. Aside from introducing Hinata and Kageyama, it didn\u2019t really do much of a service for the anime itself. The events that were happening weren\u2019t really interesting at first because they were predictable and just padding to get them (Kageyama and Hinata) into the actual team itself. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I had was some of these \u201cfeel-good\u201d moments at the start. These were attempts at emotional moments in which teammates bonded or resolved some kind of internal conflict. I am not saying there shouldn\u2019t be ANY bonding or moments between teammates. Quite the contrary actually as that element later on in the show gave the matches and practices more emotional weight and character depth. But I didn\u2019t feel it was necessary at the beginning 5-ish episodes. The anime didn\u2019t give much context or enough scenes to justify them being there so early on.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite those issues, Haikyuu\u2019s strengths stand out far more than its weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu not only succeeds in giving even small characters development, it especially excels by going above and beyond in this department. My personal favourite episode of the series is \u201cWinners and Losers.\u201d This episode is the strongest because it excellently conveys the fist pumping adrenaline of victory as well as the soul crushing sorrow of losing, given frustratingly easy-to-fix circumstances like not practicing enough. And it also shows that even if you do practice, sometimes all the hard work in the world will not assure victory. \\n\\n\r\nSo how did it present these harsh realities? By having the characters in a tournament where losing meant possibly never being able to share the same court together in high school. This not only brought ample tension and stakes but also consequences that resonated within every single person on the court. \u201cWinners and Losers\u201d was particularly emotionally charged, showing that for many players (not just our protagonists but side characters and opponents as well), volleyball means so much more to them than just a club to kill time in. Episodes like these really helped me get immersed in Haikyuu and kept me invested in matches.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, the thrilling matches are definitely a major strength in this anime thanks to well developed characters and the technical aspects. The technicality shines bright not only visually but also in the music/sound. The animation and art direction does this anime plenty of favours by consistently being excellent and having proper fluidity of movement that emulates actual volleyball players. This helps give a consistent feel to Haikyuu. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, it perfectly matches and enhances the mood the anime tries to convey at any given time. Whether that is heartbreaking loss on tracks like \u201cLosers\u201d, critical turning points or mounting anticipation/excitement on \u201cChimu no Jiriki\u201d or pure thrill and electrifying euphoria of inching closer to victory on songs like \u201cAbove\u201d. The voice actors also give great and passionate performances overall.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that this anime ended on a very powerful note. No spoilers, but the way the ending was handled emotionally was very impactful and the last match itself had amazing buildup and tension. It definitely lent itself well for a deserved second season. \\n\\n\r\nI think any fan of sports anime or even ones looking to dabble their feet in the water should definitely watch Haikyuu. It has plenty of strengths in its characters, has good drama and high stakes that really makes you get behind this team. I definitely give it a recommendation!\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\u201d",

            "content": "I'm a big sports fan. I live and breath hockey, I watch an ample amount of American football, and my TV is always tuned to some sort of sports show.  Even with this, Volleyball is a foreign sport to me. I get into it when the Olympics come around, but that's only every four years. I understand the basics well enough to enjoy it without feeling totally lost, but my knowledge is limited. \"Haykyuu!!\" does a wonderful job of bridging the gap for viewers who either love volleyball, want to love volleyball, or just want an entertaining sport-based series.  \r\n\t The meat ofthis series comes from it's characters and the sport itself, which is where it both thrives and fails. The characters are diverse and quirky, but there are far too many of them for all of them to get adequate screen time. Those that do get ample time are varied and easy to relate to, with even the \"enemy\" teams having likable characters, but every team, including the series main focus team \"Karasuno\" has characters that are mentioned and seen so seldom or not even at all. The characters that are focused on are well rounded and easy to become attached to, but don't expect to find out a great deal about most of the minor characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\n          Season one goes to great lengths to teach viewers new to volleyball how the sport works. I found myself actively interested in understanding how volleyball as a sport works, which goes to show how well done the matches are, more so than the story. The matches have a way of ramping up the tension and hype that surrounds each point. Characters are always thinking about their next move, their opponents next move. You get thrown for a loop when someone does something you don't expect. All these moments are elevated by the ever talented Yuki Hayhashi, whose OST for this series is phenomenal, helping drive home the elation of victory, as well as the agony of defeat. The teams are evenly matched too, eliminating any sense of predictability a series like this can easily fall victim to. The characters also develop as players, and as people throughout these matches.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n       Even with the matches being as engrossing as they are, they lose steam when attention is shifted mid match to something else. Too often the action of the game takes a backseat to commentary from either coaches or onlookers. Some explanation is fine, but cutting away multiple times per episode to two guys in the stands for the purpose of either critiquing or praising players can become rather tiresome considering how often it actually happens.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\t At the end of the day, it's the matches and the characters that make this series what it is, and both of those aspects are worth giving this series a shot. Chances are if you don't already have a fleeting interest in this series, you may not enjoy it, but those who have even a passing interest in volleyball should give this one a go.",

As the show goeson, you feel a bond with each character. Ive rewatched this show about two times now. I really recommend it!

            "content": "Teamwork. Friendship. Motivation. An undying strength. The spirit to take flight.\r\nSuch things characterize the great sports anime named Haikyuu!!. I haven\u2019t seen many sports anime, but even so, I can\u2019t imagine that more than a few rival this one in terms of\u2026 well, everything.\r\nI watch anime for many different reasons. Obviously the first is entertainment, or should I clarify, an ineffable empowerment you receive in your soul while watching anything anime. As per Anime\u2019s First Law (see my profile), every anime is entertaining to some degree. But very few anime touch your heartstrings and play a soothing melody. I name those gems such as Mahoutsukaino Yome, Clannad, and One Piece. These shows genuinely make you feel warm and good inside. They make you believe, or want to believe all the more, in the meaning of humanity. The good that we can do, for ourselves and for each other. The pure contact of the human soul. That underneath the black and corrupt contamination rotting this world, something akin to a scintillating light yet sparkles.\\n\\n\r\nUpon initially starting Haikyuu!!, I wasn\u2019t too intrigued. Maybe it was my lack of interest in volleyball. But once certain teams were encountered, once the blood really got pumping, it was one glorious ride. The further I progressed through the story, the more I grew to love the characters and their idiosyncrasies, the superb direction during games, the SOUNDTRACK by Yuuki Hayashi. Unlike your typical shounen, the journey for Karasuno isn\u2019t one of continuous triumph. They lose. They shed tears. And still they trust in each other\u2019s individual strengths because all they want, really, is to continue playing on that court. Winning is important, of course, but in comparison with the pure resonance of just being on the court, it just\u2026 isn\u2019t as important. Rather, winning is the means by which the crows can continue to fly.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a sports anime, most of the plot is dedicated to games. This should be obvious. The shounen battle here is defeating the other team (and eventually going to nationals), and interlaced throughout is the soulfelt desire to grow stronger, wipe away the tears, and continue to train and work together and ultimately seek that beautiful venue called the court. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a king or a giant; for the team as a whole, all that doesn\u2019t matter.\\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t finished Kuroko no Basket or many other well-known sports anime so this may be naive of me to say this: but I don\u2019t think many, if any, other sports anime can match Haikyuu\u2019s use of camera angles, shots, and overall animation to depict the tension and exhilaration of sport. Compared to swordplay, yeah, sports doesn\u2019t sound too exciting -- but after watching this pearl, I am now firmly more interested in volleyball and sports in general. Coupled with the music, which is divine and so good that it alone was enough to make me continue watching (but of course there was everything else), the battle is real.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, Production I.G strikes again with its solid clarity. According to a poll given to Japanese people, Haikyuu!! was voted one of the best-animated anime. So watch it, especially if you\u2019re a stud for good art. Anime is a visual medium, after all.\\n\\n\r\nIf an anime remains in your mind, rather than being lodged away in your memory -- that is, if you think about a particular show every so often, if you\u2019re reminded of it in daily life, if you entrust to heart certain lessons and messages -- then it is worth watching. It is a jewel.\\n\\n\r\nIf an anime changes your outlook on life in some way -- if you now appreciate something more, or look at life with more clarity and/or joy, or what have you -- then it is worth watching. It is gold.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu!! did both of these for me. I now appreciate the deep cooperative feel of sport and the invigoration it brings even more than I have before. I now long for that interpersonal connection so intrinsic to sport. I now more firmly trust in the strength of bonds and the power of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is, after all, one of the most recurring, and the most beautiful, themes in anime.",

            "content": "When Haikyuu came out three years ago, I watched one episode, thought it was pretty good, but then got into other animes and never came back to it until now.  The only reason I started it back up, is because I noticed how high every season is ranked on MAL and above Kuroko No Basket, which I loved.  It was a mistake to put this on the back burner, because it's just as good as KNB, if not better.  \r\nThe story, which I only give a 7, is not anything new.  It's the exact same story that every sports anime everdoes.  A plucky upstart (or in this case, two plucky upstarts) join a team that's on the decline and lift it back into contention as they aim to win some kind of tournament.  The only real difference with Haikyuu is that instead of choosing either the flawed genius as a protagonist, or the unskilled idiot savant with some killer super move as a protagonist, is that they chose both types in Kageyama (genius) and Hinata (Idiot savant).  \\n\\n\r\nIt's not the plot that makes Haikyuu a classic.  It's the characters, the humor and the way they put together the matches in such dramatic fashion.  The characters are absolutely fantastic.  Hinata and Kageyama very much have the Naruto and Sasuke relationship going on, but it's vastly better, and both characters are more likable.  What makes Haikyuu stand out even more, is that they surround the MCs with very strong personalities like Tanaka and Nishinoya.  The supporting characters are not just bland individuals there to push along the story for Hinata and Kageyama, they are important members and remain important throughout the series.   \\n\\n\r\nThe other most important aspect that makes Haikyuu great is the comedy.  The comedy is not just funny, it's side-splitting hilarious.  There wasn't a single episode (up until the last one) where I wasn't dying laughing from some punchline or gag.  Alternatively, I also found myself focused intently on the outcome of each match and every moment.  \\n\\n\r\nThe relationships and interactions between the characters, the humorous moments, the awesome cast, and suspenseful matches make Haikyuu a must watch.  I regret I didn't do so sooner.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 10",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review was written after watching the first three seasons of 'Haikyuu!!' and will review the show as a whole so far and not just the first season. This review will still remain spoiler-free as per the guidelines set out by MAL. Individually, I gave each of the first three seasons of 'Haikyuu!!' a rating of 10/10.\r\nStory: 9\r\nWhen is a show about sports ever not about the underdogs? Yes, the story is typical but some key differences make it stand out. It's a story about rivals but not quite. It focuses on one volleyball team but also goes in-depth into the victories and strugglesof their opponents. Overall, the show remains consistent and realistic in its telling of its story, leaving my eyes glued to the screen and genuinely questioning what the outcome of each match will be. I'm afraid to say anything more without going into spoiler territory so I'll leave it at that. While the story is very good, this show's other aspects are what make this the best sports anime I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nEditing: 10\\n\r\nThis show is a comedy and a sports anime so there's a number of ways to judge the editing. When looking at comedic timing, action, and pacing, this series passes all of those categories with flying colors. In narratives, it's said by Walter Murch that emotion is the most important factor when considering where to cut. This series is a great example of editing according to emotion. Whether it be for comedy, suspense, or intensity, each cut feels seamless and scenes play out effortlessly. Sound editing is spectacular as well but I'll speak more about that later. \\n\\n\r\nCinematography: 10\\n\r\nThere are way too many memorable shots in this series to count. 'Haikyuu!!' has some of the best cinematography I've seen from an anime series, period. What makes the cinematography in this series so great is how unique each shot is. This series explores and uses every aspect of cinematography such as perspective, camera movement, and framing to its full potential. Such mastery and innovation is something I haven't seen from a sports anime, let alone an anime series in general. I often find myself re-watching scenes from the series just because of how well-done the cinematography is for 'Haikyuu!!'. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 10\\n\r\nThe art and animation of this series is outstanding. Every character's face is drawn exceptionally well and with great detail, revealing the raw emotion that sports and competition tend to bring out. The animation, especially when it comes to action and motion, balances realism with exaggeration well, taking advantage of the creative control animation allows while still remaining grounded. Though, there are a few scenes where the animation leans towards a more poetic and metaphoric feel. While they may seem overt compared to the overall balanced reality the show portrays, it's a nice change of pace and works well in intensifying the emotion of each respective scene. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nWhere do I even begin with the sound of this show? The sound of a hand tightening into a fist in a silent gymnasium. The sound of the air that surrounds a player who has just been blocked. The yell of a player who has just regained his confidence. The sound of a spiked volleyball bringing an abrupt end to the soundtrack, leaving just the noise of the ball bouncing off the floor. I have to admit, sound is something that I often overlook. We're so accustomed to good sound design and mixing that it's easy to take it for granted. 'Haikyuu!!' manages to have great sound design, mixing, and editing, but on top of that, uses sound creatively in order to add and create meaning alongside its spectacular visuals. Not to be forgotten, the voice acting in this series is phenomenal as well. While I can stare in awe of the show's amazing animation and cinematography all day long, it's the show's use of sound that causes me to feel the emotion of the scene and leave me with goosebumps on a consistent basis. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nIt's been awhile since I've come across such a memorable and fun cast of characters. Even though the series has a lot of characters, every character has a unique and distinct personality, making the story easy to follow. Even though some characters might not get a lot of screen time, their personalities and/or backstory is intelligently highlighted, leaving their presence feeling fleshed-out and real. Despite this, I have a few gripes with this category when it comes to 'Haikyuu!!'. One character in particular feels a bit inconsistent as the series progresses. Also, while the series generally does a good job of having characters feel unique and different, I feel like with some characters this is completely lost. But overall, I enjoy watching how all of these characters interact with each other and how they develop over time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI think something that makes this show special is how balanced and unbiased it tends to be at times. Just as we jump with joy when the protagonist wins, we feel the pang of defeat of their opponents. Often, in stories regarding sports, the opponents of the protagonist is portrayed as a villain. But in reality, those opponents are not much different from the protagonist and are just working towards the same goal. Sports do not represent a match of good versus evil. It is a game of preparation, skill, determination, effort, and a little bit of luck. 'Haikyuu!!' gives us a hilarious sports story with a diverse cast of characters and numerous fantastic moments, ultimately reminding us that we are all the same in our pursuits of success.",

Imagine being a Hinata san who can play and struggle for something to do since childhood. it's perfect\r\nI think the story is packed well although like most sports anime in general that tells the desire of a person or a team to win, but that makes the story plot to be interesting is how comedy given is very funny and impressed not forced, in every game the audience made curious will the final story. And in every game the development of the individual possessedof his character was interesting and eagerly awaited. And that is what touches in my heart. especially when the scene where team members give support to someone to be more confident and it makes him succeed it is the most memorable thing this season. (I'm talking about azumane san). then what makes this anime so great is the incredible background music that makes me able to watch and feel very proud of what's going on in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall value 9 for this anime is worth it.

The art of this anime is beyond amazing and the angles of each action shot blew me away. With each angle for a spike, toss or serve they really show how high the ball can fly or how high a player can jump. Each match will keep you on the edge of your seat.\r\nGetting in depth with Haikyuu, you can't help but fall in love with every single one of the characters. Each of them is so full of personality and you mighthave a hard time choosing your top favorite! What I like about this is, it really reels you into the Volleyball world they explain the positions and the rules of volleyball without making it sound like a boring \"How-To\" Guide. \\n\r\nThe songs incorporated into this anime is amazing I find myself making a playlist of every song (opening, ending, instrumentals) because they some are soothing and some really get you pumped. I find that this is the only anime where I really enjoy every openings and endings so far.\\n\r\nI would go beyond 100% and recommend this anime!",

            "content": "Haikyuu like most sports anime is based around one underwhelming athlete and his friends, who through hard work and determination build individually and as a team. Don't let the rating make you think I didn't enjoy this, however quite the opposite I liked it. The flaw though involves all sports series not just this one. And it is exactly as I stated above, there is no variety aside from the sport itself. The fastest and easiest comparison is with kuroko no basket. Yes, yes they are different sports but take a second to compare character likeness, skill, and interactions. For the most part they arethe same, so your overall enjoyment of the show, or any sports anime at that will depend on your personal interest in the sport. Now my review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, is written well enough. There are no real twist and turns in the plot, almost every event can be seen a mile away. You don't enter a single game with out having a gut feeling who is going to win. There isn't anything deep going on, the only underlying message is to never give up, do your best, your friends will support you blah blah. The cast goes through the games unleashing flashy moves winning games, and informing the viewer all the while on how the sport operates, so pretty standard. And that's all, nothing exciting or unexpected so it gets a bland 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt is good, on par with most other modern series, nothing outstanding or glaringly bad. Sound as well, just an unmemorable sound track that has upbeat music, sad music, and intense music to put you with the pace. 7 all around there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are exactly what you would expect in a sports series no exceptions. Hinata your lead is the underwhelming player with one good skill that wants to be the best, the secondary name whatever his face is a 'prodigy'. So the two mains fit the trope. Then the assortment of angry, moody, shy. Hot female team manager. Captain and his inner circle who are all sad about graduating and get one last shot at a championship they never won. So the characters while are unique in their own sort, are not in the overall grand scheme of anime script writing, and its not bad its a formula that has clearly been working. But that doesn't mean it is without flaws.\\n\\n\r\nSo to end Haikyuu is an enjoyable sports series that is a good watch that follows all tropes and cliches floating around the sports genre. Overall 7\\n\\n",

They each play their parts so well.\r\nThe story progress paces on in a perfect pace, not too quick to rush things\r\nnot too slow as well. The balace between character building, comedy and\r\ndrama are divided so impressivly it just feels so logically that this anime\r\nstands it ground in the top 50 of whole MAL-database.\r\nIts easily a top favourite even for those like myself dont have any interest\r\nin volleyball.This anime makes you laugh till your stomach is about to burst, feel for the characters and above all taste the \"team spirit\"!\\n\r\nI'd give this anime and over 9000 rating but I can sadly only give it 10, its a 10 score at its highest for me, art, story, characters EVERY SINGLE THING!",

            "content": "\u201cDoes losing prove that you\u2019re weak? Isn\u2019t losing difficult for all of you? A challenge where, after ending up on your hands and knees you must see if you can stand up again? If you stay on your hands and knees, THAT proves you are weak\u201d \u2013 Ittetsu Takeda on the meaning and importance of losing\r\nDigging through the massive world of anime, I always chose to skip the sports genre, with Slam dunk being the only sports anime I\u2019ve ever watched as a kid. Fast forward to 10 years and I found myself delving through categories of music, drama, rom-com and slice-of-life more often thananything else, the latter being the most preferred genre on my list. Then about a month ago I stumbled upon an old slam-dunk pencil case that my Dad bought me on my 12th birthday. Seeing that old pencil case brought back fond memories, consequently making me want to explore the sports genre more than ever. And so the search began for the next big thing!\\n\\n\r\nI was tempted to explore similar titles (in terms of sports) like kuroko no basket, but I thought it\u2019d be best to go with something different, because I saw this as an opportunity to expand my view over the vast landscape of sports anime and to successfully do that, I would have to turn my head a little and look into a different direction. After shortlisting Dia no ace, Free!, Overdrive, kuroko no basuke and Haikyuu! (all of which I\u2019ll be watching eventually), I finally settled with the latter because the story struck a little out of the ordinary to me (in the best of ways) and because I remember enjoying playing volleyball whenever the cousins got together. \\n\\n\r\nSummary:-\\n\\n\r\nA lot can be said about sports anime in general, but at the very core of this category are willpower, motivation and, in case of team sports, team-work. Haikyuu does not fail to deliver on these even in the slightest. The story follows the life of Shoyo Hinata, a middle-schooler, as he seeks to play Volleyball after coming across a match on TV at a store in town. He then feverishly pursues to form a team in his final year, only to face a humbling defeat in the very first match they ever played. The match is dominated by a player in the opposition named Tobio Kageyama, nick named \u201cKing of the court\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the fact that Hinata\u2019s team lost, the viewers are introduced to the protagonist\u2019s exceptional speed and athletic abilities, which are rough but there nonetheless. This sparks a lot of excitement as viewers anticipate the full development of Hinata\u2019s skills into a complete package during the course of the entire series.  After facing defeat at the hands of a better team, Hinata vows to Kageyama that he will defeat him the next time they face each other. Time flies by and we\u2019re treated to a quick montage as the protagonist works towards this goal whilst also preparing to appear for his High-school entrance exams. With all the hard work and effort, Hinata makes it into the very same school that he saw playing on TV for the first time, the team that inspired him to play volleyball \u2013 Karasuno High.\\n\\n\r\nFate had a different plan for Hinata, though. On his very first day, out of all the people that he could find at that school, he runs into his rival Kageyama who is also looking forward to join the volleyball club. The story takes off as the two try to work together in an attempt to emerge as team-players and how the once formidable team of Karasuna High looks to regain their former glory.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal thoughts:-\\n\\n\r\nIt was one of the best anime-watching experiences I\u2019ve had in a while. This anime made me want to explore the sports genre afresh; I am honestly happy I made the choice of watching this anime. There are many things in this anime that you can relate to; be it the fact that the protagonist excels at playing the sport despite his short height or simply the recurring themes of motivation and hard work which appear to be skilfully imbued into the very fabric of the show, you are guaranteed to take away a whole lot of goodies from this anime. I personally enjoyed the relationship between the protagonists (I think it\u2019s fair to list Kageyama under that category because he significantly helps Hinata to up his ante on the court, and you will see just what I\u2019m talking about once you give this anime a shot.) which starts off as rivals at \u201cthe other side of the net\u201d but then they soon find themselves standing on the same side, fighting not against but with each other. I believe this is a classic and timeless theme in storytelling \u2013 from enemies to friends. \\n\\n\r\nBut that by no means is clich\u00e9d and it certainly does not take away the glory from this anime, on the contrary I think it works perfectly for this kind of genre. Competitive sports are nothing without, well, competition, and finding yourself assisting a player who was scoring against you without breaking a sweat not too long ago, is indeed a though hurdle to overcome\u2026 but\u2026 only when you\u2019re young and reckless. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on in this show, they\u2019re just in highschool, not the age where you\u2019d expect the majority of the students to have the mental fortitude and maturity of, say, a professional league player who transfers to another team and then plays against his parent club without hesitation (there are other factors like monetary benefit involved but you get the point).That\u2019s what makes this a thrilling prospect for a sports-centric storyline! Seeing how the two would get along despite the egos they have due to their young ages; you have yourselves two brilliant players playing against each other, and then all of a sudden you put them in the same team and see how it all works out. . . To that I say, awesome. This anime thrives at telling you that story. First 4 episodes in and you\u2019ll be seeing exactly what I\u2019m talking about, and it only gets better from there on.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also excels at redefining the meaning of \u2018losing\u2019. The lines mentioned in the opening statement really spoke to me, and I really wanted to share them with you by the means of this review, so that you know that this anime is based on a very substantial philosophy which you and I can apply to our daily lives. Failure is just another stepping stone to success but we tend to forget that. We are only human after all, we have our moments of sadness but when we\u2019re through with all the troubles and reach our destination, we can look back at all those times we thought we lost and laugh about it. At the end of the day, good things will always happen to those who do not give up. So if you\u2019re reading this review and you\u2019re going through a time where you think you\u2019ve lost at something, just know that you\u2019ll taste victory soon enough as long as \u201cyou can stand up again\u201d. So stay strong, don\u2019t lose heart and keep your head held high.\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh yeah, don\u2019t forget to watch this anime :) \uf04a \\n\\n",

            "content": "In my opinion sports anime is one of the most difficult kinds to do because, if you stop and think, sport is something that could be very boring to watch because it's very repetitive, but Haikyuu!! has found the way to attract me from the first to the last chapter.\r\n  When you watch this guys playing volley they make you feel as you were part of the team and also to feel the tension of every match. But matches aren't the hole anime, knowing the different members of the team and their stories makes you keep watching chapter after chapter until youfinish it.\\n\r\n  In terms of art I liked it, I didn't find anything that surprised me but I think that it is very pleasant to watch. Anyway this is very subjective and you have to see it to know if you like it.\\n\r\n  About the soundtrack I don't have much to say, the idea is good and it suits very well with the anime.\\n\r\n  So in conclusion if you are looking for an sports anime to make you feel energetic and to have some fun I think you'll really enjoy watching Haikyuu.\\n\\n\r\nPd: be careful, this anime will make you want to play volleyball as never before :)",

            "content": "Okay, so I watched this, rated it a 10, and left it at that. But I loved this anime so much that I decided it would be rude of me not to explain why.\r\nIf I could sum up this show in one word it would be:\r\ninspirational.\r\nThis is seriously a great show. I've never really been into sports anime but this anime completely turned my expectations upside down.\r\nThe main character, Shoyo Hinata, fell in love with volleyball at a young age when he saw the national championship match on TV. Although he's short in stature, he wants to make it big just like the infamous \"LittleGiant,\" a player who made it to nationals despite his height. Hinata goes to the same highschool as the \"Little Giant,\u201d Karasuno Highschool, in pursuit of his dream. In the series, Hinata trains to be the best, and does not lose hope even in the face of the largest obstacles.\\n\r\nThen there's \"King of the Court\" Tobio Kageyama. He's bossy. He's intense and hotheaded. He hates teamwork and wants to do everything on his own. His skill is unprecedented on the court and everyone knows it. After a fallout with his middle school team accusing him of doing it all himself, Kageyama goes to Karasuno in hopes of becoming better, and proving his old team wrong.\\n\r\nThese two polar opposites are forced to work together, and with the added members of Karasuno's Volleyball Team, they all learn to bond with one another.\\n\r\nEvery episode is meaningful. There are no fillers, no missed steps. Haikyuu!! is truly a masterpiece of a show. I have never laughed or cried as much as I have with Haikyuu!!. It is an anime that makes you cheer when the team strikes a goal, laugh at the team members\u2019 stupid jokes and arguments, and have a mini-depression when things get tough. This show really motivates you to do something in life. It makes you believe. I love those shows that affect you more than just an ordinary sitcom. They force you to see the world in a different way. This show did it for me.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story was flawless. It began with Hinata and Kageyama not getting along, and when they finally bonded, then the bigger picture loomed: getting to nationals. The entire way there was filled with good plot. New characters that were introduced were actually well developed and fit into the story (not just randomly thrown in just because). The main characters had character development, the side characters had character development, everyone was getting character development, it was like Oprah giving out free stuff all over again.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nArt was awesome. Visuals were really well done. Background was nice, character art was nice. Matches were filled with action. Even though none of the characters in appearance stood out that much, (except for Hinata with his bright orange hair) it didn't matter because you'll grow to love them so much you simply won't care if they stand out or not. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was upbeat when it needed to be, intense when it needed to be. Anime doesn't need to have a soundtrack that sounds like Beethoven for me to like it. It was suitable for the anime and that's all that matters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 11/10\\n\r\nI'm gonna rate it an 11/10 because I can. I love all the characters, none of the characters had boring personalities. Everyone had their quirks, their habits, their challenges, their own personal internal conflicts that they battled with. Even opponents weren't shown as \"evil\"; the anime showed them as being people, laughing with their teammates, going through obstacles, just like the main characters. Everyone seemed so real. Everyone was shown to be meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 11/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show so much it scares me.\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about this show is that it offered tons of different viewpoints. There was this one episode where this one team lost (it was kind of a background team, insignificant to the plot, other than the first team that Karasuno beat in a competition), and the anime showed sympathy for the losers, and showed their point of view, and how they felt, and how, if this was a \u2018story\u2019 where the winners were the main characters, the losers \"at least got to be part of it.\" It might not sound like much now, but it really struck me and showed that yes. The producers of Haikyuu!! really know what they\u2019re doing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nJust watch it. It\u2019s one of those shows that you need to watch. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s sad, it\u2019s motivating, it\u2019s heartfelt, it\u2019s everything a show is supposed to be, and more.\\n\r\nWho needs romance when you have teamwork? Never would\u2019ve taken this question seriously until watching this show.\\n",

            "content": "Characters\r\nWren:\r\nHinata isn\u2019t a bad main character. I love his pure determination. Sure, he might not be the best receiver, but does he let that drag him down? No! He actually uses it to his advantage, wielding his faults like a pro. He doesn\u2019t back down from a challenge. Hinata would make an amazing role model.\r\nKageyama is a child prodigy. Let\u2019s not attempt to dumb it down. He\u2019s amazing. I love his character development. He is originally a stubborn king who doesn\u2019t pay attention to anyone else, but, by the end of the series, he trusts everyone else. He plays on a team at last. \r\nKageyamaand Hinata are awesome together. I love their teamwork. The two of them work well together, complementing each other\u2019s skills. Just watching them practice is amazing. I\u2019m in awe.\\n\r\nOverall, the teamwork in the entire anime is strong, even with the other teams. They work together, as an unit not as a single player. Each has their own part to play. And they do it very well.\\n\r\nSugawara is awesome. He\u2019s calm and collected. But has so many emotions. You never see the yearning within him. He\u2019s very good at controlling his feelings. He is very smart, and I admire him. He lets Kageyama take the setter position. But he watches from the sidelines and learns so much about the other players.\\n\r\nDaichi is kinda ignored at times. But he\u2019s a super cool character! He\u2019s the captain. While, the series focuses on Hinata and Kageyama, Daichi\u2019s there. A strong and steady leader who offers up his best advice and supports the team. I\u2019d like to be a leader like him, one day.\\n\r\nAnd not to forget Asahi. He\u2019s a quiet and kindred soul. But he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders. He took the brunt of the loss to the Iron Wall Team (whose name I forget currently.) He feels so much. He looks like a roughhousing bad boy, but he\u2019s so quiet and nervous. \\n\r\nNishinoya is by far one of my favorites. He\u2019s a delinquent. And he\u2019s a perv. But he\u2019s a fantastic libero. Without him, I surely doubt that Karasuno would be able to receive a lot of the serves. He\u2019s creative in his receiving, even using his shoe to throw the ball into play. Sure, he\u2019s a comedy character, but I love him nonetheless.\\n\r\nWhen you are first introduced to Nekoma, you think, \u2018Wow. They\u2019re exactly like Karasuno!\u2019 I know this was on purpose, but the similarities just showed the vast differences between the two teams. The two of them are so vastly different. Not that Karasuno is weak and Nekoma is strong. But they have different strengths and weaknesses.\\n\r\nI love Kozume's story. His story reminded me of...well...me. I saw a part of myself in him that I\u2019d never seen before in any character. He was a loner. And it seemed like it didn\u2019t faze him. But he had friends and a team to support him. So maybe there\u2019s hope for me after all.\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t particularly understand the introduction of the girls team. Why did we need to know about them? They didn\u2019t become cheerleaders to the boys team or anything. While they had an interesting story, it wasn\u2019t expanded, so I felt like they were useless.\\n\r\nOikawa is kinda boring. Cute and smart doesn\u2019t mean a lot to me. Plus, I hated how he antagonized Kageyama. Sure, his story is fascinating, but that doesn\u2019t mean that an eager kohai is bad.\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\r\nWren:\\n\r\nThe episodes leave off a lot and force you to watch the next one. It really builds up the tension, even ending an episode in the middle of a match. Which is a so so for me. I don\u2019t mind furiously watching 3 or more episodes a day, but I have a life (sorta). I gotta do my homework and all.\\n\r\nThe first half is super boring because they aren\u2019t in tournaments. They go through a lot of practice matches. Which aren\u2019t REAL matches. Well, sorta. They do act like they are real matches. In the first half, we see a lot of slow-motion and a lot more dramatization. Which I didn\u2019t really like.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the second half is much more interesting. The matches speed up, and you really get to see Karasuno in action. I loved this half much more. It felt like watching an actual tournament. And there was a lot of tension because of this.\\n\r\nSomewhere in the middle, the show introduced the opposite of Karasuno. By this, I mean, showing the game from the opponent\u2019s viewpoint. And it was amazing. You got to see the people who lost and their emotions. (Especially the team that Daichi\u2019s friend was on.) It made me love this show. \\n\r\nAnd right about there,(ep 16, I think) this show acknowledged it was a show. \\n\r\nLife isn\u2019t about winning and losing. It\u2019s about learning from your mistakes. And changing your ways. This show proclaims this message loud and clear. You have to get up when you\u2019re knocked down. It\u2019s a fact of life. And this show is by far the best example of getting back up I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nWren:\\n\r\nOkay...I\u2019m not a huge fan of the art. At times, it looks off. The proportions don\u2019t seem right or something. Plus, the shading on the characters is really distracting for me. \\n\r\nAlso, that ball animation! It\u2019s great. I love how they gave the ball life and motion. Like a really volleyball.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack\\n\r\nWren:\\n\r\nThe first OP is insane. I love it. It sets the perfect tone. I\u2019m ready for an awesome battle. I got pumped up. I wanted some awesome volleyball action. I was ready!\\n\r\nThe second one is much more tame. Which I don\u2019t like. The second half is made up of the tournament. The calmer OP doesn\u2019t match the intensity of the matches. The first OP would suit the second half much better.\\n\r\nAdmittedly, I didn\u2019t listen to the endings. I\u2019m not a huge fan. \\n\r\nBut in the second half, there was this background song that I ADORED. It was so cool. I don\u2019t remember what episode it starts in, though.",

            "content": "Note:\r\nSkip ahead to the third paragraph if you are only interested in my actual review of Haikyuu!!.\r\nI recently decided to sit down and re-watch this season and I'm so glad I did. The 3 year time span combined with the second and third seasons packed with intense games really made me lose some appreciation for the \"start\" of it all... There's also the benefit of everything staying fresh in your mind because you aren't forced to wait out the weeks, which I believe is the reason in my re-appreciation of the season.\r\nI remember when I first dove into Haikyuu!! back when it was currently airing.It was my third real dive into the sports genre after Hajime No Ippo and Cross Game. It was somewhere between 5 to 8 episodes into the season and it really pulled me in... Maybe some of that had to do with the fact that I didnt start at the premier of the show, because admittedly the show can be viewed as a bit of a slow starter by some and I wouldnt even disagree with that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview Start:\\n\r\nIf I had to label this season anything I would say it is the season where the flock of crows regroups but is still very much unrefined. It does take quite some time in the seasons run for Karasuno to actually finish the regroup  but thats to be expected given how things came to be.\\n\\n\r\nYou have the baby crows just flying into the flock which needed their proper orientation of course. (Hinata, Kageyama, Tsukishima, and Yamaguchi) After that you have Nishinoya and then you have Asahi who have thier own reasons why they arent their from the start which I won't spoil here. If all that wasnt enough, Karasuno was also having staff problems as well... Talk about A LOT to sort out before even starting...\\n\\n\r\nAll that might be tough for some. Watching it weekly, I still understood it was for background purposes so I stuck it through. This is mainly where my re-appreciation comes in. Not having to wait the week in-between episodes this time around it was much more smooth and I was also able to connect a few more dots later that I wasnt the first time around in watching any of the 3 seasons so far. \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not I was thinking back before my re-watch and in my memories I thought most of the season revolved around Hinata and Kageyama which is absolutely incorrect. Sure they have their obvious tension because of how things started and in the aspect of the games its their combo attack that is the main portion of Karasuno's offense but by no means does the first season just center on those two alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself has a nice hint of comedy mixed in which they actually carry through all seasons so far. It doesnt feel like it gets in the way of anything. It actually feels like it enhances the atmosphere to me. Predominatly involving Hinata and Kageyama but theres a little bit of it coming from all angles involving everyone which is a nice touch for me. The soundtrack is pretty damn amazing too, all around. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all I really enjoyed my re-watch, I believe this season did an excellent job at laying a good foundation for the show  and I would recommend this season as well as the whole franchise to anyone who has been on the fence about trying the sports genre.\\n\\n\r\nHope this was an enjoyable read for anyone who stuck it out this far...",

            "content": "This is my first review so don't freak out if I do anything offensive or wrong.\r\nSo after watching ping pong animation, I was so excited to check out some more awesome sports anime and Haikyuu was suggested by many people.\r\nFirst of all, This is one of those few anime which according to me doesn't need any change in their story. Many would argue that story could be even better but I think if after changing the story little, but I also want that original story to exist because it is one of its kind without accommodations.its story involves a subtle acceleration of characters thatany accommodation would break easily. All the anime I ever watched this one stands out because it doesn't skip the improvements and training of the characters from begging to the end, it shows exactly from one step to another how players get good through practice demanding you to sink into the story in order to feel their improvements.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to me, the most important thing required for a good successful sports anime or any anime, in general, is the character development.And Haikyuu is one of the best examples of great character development, it doesn't leave a single character to enter the chamber of your heart.Every character left a huge impact on me, even the side characters were hard to forget.Unlike ping pong the animation which was oriented more over the life of sportsmen outside the field, Haikyuu was more centered towards the rules of games and essential things required for a sportsman.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this anime, I got all the rules of volleyball which was never delivered by any other sports anime I have ever watched.And the most important thing is that I enjoyed it a lot, I completed it in just 2 days that is just ridiculous because the minimum time in which I have finished a anime of such duration is like 2 weeks.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I didn't like is the music which was sometimes not fitting and sometimes was not intense enough. If they could switch music of Boku no hero academia with this one it would have become a much better one, that's not possible I guess just sayin\\n",

The story line is very interesting. To see the trial and error that the team has gone through due to characters' personalities. It makes me happy to also see them grow during this season.\r\nCHARACTERS: There are a lot of characters that are introduced during the season, but I will talk about the MAIN 2 characters.\r\nHINATA: He is the underdog that craves for opportunities. He is one of the characters in the anime that I can relate to themost.\\n\r\nKAGEYAMA: The king of the court pissed me off in the beginning. But I love it how he is able to gradually learn how to be more humble. In the end, he is one of the boastful characters that has earned my respect.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: This is an awesome anime! Personally, I have heard bad things about sports animes (I forgot the reason though). Seeing the team fly during the tournament makes me want to cheer for them more. I cannot wait to watch the next seasons!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Haikyuu is easily my favorite sports anime to date (22/04-17)\r\nIt's has all the excitement of a good shounen sport (like kuroko for ex) \r\nBut it has none of the complete disregard for human/physical limits that we see so often in shounen anime. \r\nThe characters and their ability's are very down to earth in comparison and even if they are still way to good to be highschooler's it still never feels over the top in any way. They characters also have very real and also character defining flaws that they of course, have to overcome. \r\nThe animation in the show is solid. The Openings are beautifullyanimated most of the time, and the soundtrack is good all the way through. No awkward downspikes in animation quality that sometimes happen in some shows. \\n\r\nThey do use some stills here and there with motionlines instead of actual motion. This is most likely only the animators saving times on less important scenes, and i really dont blame them. The instead put their effort where it count's, and that makes me happy.\\n\\n\r\nI like the voice acting too, the performances are consistent through-out the cast and no one ever feels forced or out of place.  The music/voice and other noise is very well equalized and what needs to be in the forefront is, at all times. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to nitpick on something is that the matches can somtimes be a little unevenly paced. Some parts of the matches are so detailed and take up ALOT of the air-time while sometimes we get kinda anti-climactic timeskips. Though this isn't a problem with Haikyuu specifically, but with sports-anime in general. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a top-notch shounen sports, and if you like the genre, this is a must watch!\\n\\n",

From both of the OPs to the story, which in my opinion is the best part. \r\nThe story of this anime hit me hard, I'm trying to not sound cheesy here. I once played a sport and had a love hate relationship with it. I was trying to give it my all but certain things always got in my way, or at least that's what I tell myself, but came out on thebottom pretty much every time. There is a specific moment, those who've watched this show know exactly what I'm talking about. That, I think, perfectly portrays someones love of a sport, someones wish that they would've tried harder. This is one of the reasons I think this show is so great. On top of all the great crazy plays and jokes is a very solid story. \\n\\n\r\nANNNDD...\\n\\n\r\nITS SO HYPE!!!\\n\\n\r\nThis show is one of the hypest anime I've ever seen and I don't think anything could beat it in my book. The moments of triumph were well earned and had impact every time. Which just goes to show how great the characters are.  YET ANOTHER reason why this show is so great.\\n\\n\r\nOkay I'm gonna go play some volleyball and watch season 2 of this show. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The story follows the main character named Hinata, Shouyou he likes to play volleyball but nobody in his middle school played volleyball. When he gets to high school, he joins the volleyball team. He isn't very good because he never played volleyball on an actually team so its your typical underdog story. The story is nothing new and very common story gets a 5.\r\nNow for the art & sound, not bad but not great somewhere in the middle the art & sound gets a 7. Next is the characters the characters aregreat which is expected from a sports anime. The characters have there own personality and well written the character gets a 8.\\n\\n\r\nLast is my personally enjoyment I really enjoyed watching this anime my personally enjoyment gets a 8. After averaging everything out the score comes to a 7. This is a good anime if you like sport anime but if you don't like sport anime this anime wont change your mind.",

The music on top of these scenes make the anime stand out even more.  They really brought the manga to life and for a show like this, I definitely prefer watching it than reading it.\r\nI feel that the charactershelp the show's pacing. They're funny with their antics and because this is a sports anime, the focus is a lot on the characters and their relationships and how they react to what is happening rather than the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very simple and I feel there's not much leeway with this genre so having great characters is a must.  There has been some character development which is always a plus.\\n\\n\r\nThe predictable storyline may be the only flaw of this anime, but even then, I was hooked on this show from the first episode.  This anime would be great start for those who never watch this genre.  It would make you want to play volleyball, as well.",

            "content": "\"Does losing prove that you are weak? Isn't losing difficult for all of you? A challenge where, after ending up on your hands and knees, you must see if you can stand up again? If you stay on your hands and knees, that proves that you are weak.\" - Ittetsu Takeda\r\nBeing an avid volleyball fan and player, the sports anime genre became something that I felt comfortable with and can relate to. I quickly became a fan and especially NEVER looked down the sports anime genre. When coming across Haikyuu!!, I was totally pumped for obvious reasons as nostalgia flooded in my mind. As soonas I started watching, I couldn\u2019t stop. By the time the first season was over, it couldn\u2019t quite quench my thirst for more. However, this doesn\u2019t mean it's my all-time favorite anime because it involves my favorite sport and it does have some flaws. But nonetheless, it was one of the top animes of the fall of 2014 and it remains in my heart as one of my favorites.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow that is all kept in mind, shall we start?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows 2 main characters named Hinata Shoyo and Kageyama Tobio. Like every other sports anime I have watched (Kuroko no Basket, Slam Dunk, Diamond no Ace) with the 2 main characters, there is a duo of 1st Years that are or will be valuable assets to the team. After playing a match against each other, they have no choice but to work together and set aside differences because they have become players of Karasuno. Like every other sports series, the team\u2019s dream is to win it all the way to nationals through an elimination tournament. \\n\\n\r\nDelving deeper, it is more than just your typical shounen anime. It is certainly not complex, but good enough to be \u201cwowed\u201d. It is not a story where when some monster 1st Years come and then *BOOM!* it's automatically an overpowered team. It is not anything like that. In the beginning, the team starts out disjointed. Any team alone cannot drastically become really good overnight. Even the talented duo of Tobio and Shoyo, they still have ways to go to grow and learn due to their inexperience. The team is more important than talent of the players. Thus, winning does not come easy, making outcomes unpredictable at times. When it comes to matches, the whole episode is often not on Karasuno\u2019s point of view, but rather the other teams they face. That is what makes the matches special; it gives the perspective of the other teams and its players. It feels as if they are the main characters of the show for just that episode. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it has the \u201cdeficit syndrome\u201d as I would like to call it. Like some other sports animes, the protagonist\u2019s team ends up beating the other team by a few or one points from either team is down with a few point deficit. It is ridiculous and clich\u00e9. Some people don\u2019t really mind that because it adds suspense and unpredictability, but I personally despise it. The story is not exclusively about battling matches, it also includes backstory and flashbacks to explain about the past connecting to the present.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is well paced and contains no fillers whatsoever. It doesn\u2019t stall and gets right to the point to keep the juices flowin\u2019. Oh, by the way, there is minimal fan-service. Don\u2019t worry; there are enough awesome jammed-packed and funny moments that keep you at the edge of your seat! Speaking of funny moments, its comedy is gold. It is similar to Slam Dunk\u2019s type of humor on the court and off the court, but more playful. Some parts were so irresistible that I had to rewind the play button and still laughed like a hyena, tearing up often. The scenes will switch the tone to serious, light-hearted, and awesomely epic when it is appropriate. Drama is apparent good as well, giving a good balance to the action.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is where the show shines. It\u2019s the action that makes you stay past 12 midnight; the show is so immersive that hours will turn into minutes. Soon enough it's already 3 AM, but you're still going. The games get very intense often and get anybody\u2019s hearts pumpin\u2019.  It can even tempt you to imitate volleyball plays. During games, the variety of creative plays is astounding. None of the plays were ever linear or one-dimensional. Some of the action is exaggerated, not abused like KnB, but still executes well with jaw-dropping plays without making the players look like gods. It shows you it is not all about scoring and smacking the ball, there is also a mental game and strategy involving different angles of the match. It is amazing of how the show displays many ways to outsmart/outplay your opponent just to score a point. Overall, the show does have solid authentic volleyball content. Beyond all these things, the show takes themes seriously. It tackles themes not just in volleyball, but off the court as well. It will teach the importance of trust on and off the court and losing isn\u2019t necessary bad. There are many others, but I\u2019ll let you discover it yourself!\\n\\n\r\nOh, if you're new to volleyball you don\u2019t have to worry! Whether or not you play or have experience, anybody will enjoy this series. I recommended my friend, who has no prior knowledge/experience about volleyball, completely loved the show. He even tried the sport itself. Throughout the series, mostly in the beginning, it will teach you the fundamental basics/ideas of volleyball. However, some ideas and preferences are slightly varied compared to other countries that \u201cserve\u201d volleyball, but nothing major. Haha, get it? Never mind let\u2019s move on...\\n\\n\r\nAt the surface, the show contains generic main characters. I was not surprised when they were first introduced during the first 2 episodes. You will get the idea if you at least watched Slam Dunk or DnA. But once you get to know them, they are not just a hollow shell. They both have enriched personalities and completely define their own as characters. This doesn\u2019t go also apply to Karasuno\u2019s players, but other team\u2019s players as well. Some players do have similar qualities, but there is a fine line between their styles. There is a ton of character development throughout the series; you especially see that within Karasuno\u2019s team. Not a lot of the characters are static and they go through challenges or walls that change them. The cast is huge; the different variety of characters is enough to pick out a likeable character. Even though Shoyo and Tobio are the main characters, they aren\u2019t always handed the spotlight. The show doesn\u2019t abuse their main character status and lets other players to have an opportunity to shine. Sometimes they become supporting characters at moments and works most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m only familiar with Production I.G.\u2019s KnB and it is what I expected to be. It is not a masterpiece, but it good enough to execute great action and emotion in the characters. I personally like the art style with its bright colorful palette, matching it to the show\u2019s sense of humor. When things get scary or creepy, the transition to from colorful to dreary colors is excellent. The background is consistently detailed and rarely an eyesore. The volleyball itself and the net is sometimes 3-D animated, showing some production value. When it comes to matches, the flow of the body language and movement of the players is superb. Also, what is rare in anime is that the show has the lack of unrealistic hair colors (Red, Green, Blue, etc.). I personally like it that way, but it is all about preference. However, from there, there are flaws. Some of the characters look similar and many action scenes were repeated with the overlay of different teams. But all of these are minor and can be overlooked when things get caught up in the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST soundtrack is not exactly memorable as I hoped it would be, especially during matches when it needed. However, I both found the openings and endings catchy, hopefully you will too. The voice acting is solid; some include award-winning voice actors such as Kaji Yuki, Okamoto Nobuhiko, and Kamiya Hiroshi. The sounds on the volleyball court are impressive. From volleyball shoes squeaking on the court to the crack of a volleyball spike, it sounds perfect.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nArt 9.5/10\\n\r\nSound/Voice Acting 8.5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you\u2019re new to the sports genre or volleyball, Haikyuu!! is still worth watching. If you\u2019re new, this is the perfect gateway anime for sports. This is one of few rare gems of the sports anime genre, you won\u2019t find many with an excellent balance combination of action and comedy. With season 2 coming around the corner today (WHAT?!), what are you waiting for?\\n",

EXACTLY like Kuroko No Baskett, but with Volleyball, if you didn't like Kuroko, there's a COLOSSAL chance you won't like this, but if you DID like Kuroko no Baskett, chances are, you'll like this just as much if not more.\r\nIt has way more comic reliefs and way less pointless drawn out conversations, everything isshort, concise and it doesn't feel like you're getting cheated out of an episode at any given moment, action packed start to end. They definitely have more knowledge about Volley than KnB had about Baskett, and pretty much every move (to the exception maybe of the main character's speed but I think it's supposed to be seen as an exaggeration other than mach 5 speed) is legitimate, no one jumps 7 feet into the floor or goes \"in the zone\", it's pretty realistic play.\\n\\n\r\nEven in the characters' personalities you will find many similarities to KnB, so yeah, what was meant to be a smart ass review saying \"welcome to Hinata No Volleyball\" turned into a friendly comparison between both animes.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the soundtrack and animation in this one is just as pristine, so, yeah.\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't watch Kuroko however, ignore this review!",

I did talk to friends of mine who did play volleyball on a team in school and they said it was very accurate. This recieves so much love fromme and I have definitely watched it multiple times.

Up to this point I have only ever watched Ace of Diamond as a true sports anime and so going into Haikyuu, there is a ton of similarities with the main cast. I love how the main character Shoyo Hinata has that fire and desire and pure love of volleyball which I can relate tooabout basketball. All the volleyball scenes are so cleanly animated and in sport's anime fashion dripping with in the moment insight from the players themselves. The one thing that put me over the top was the directors use of music for every scene and how they affect them positively and bring forth all of the emotion.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu!! Is that dose of sport's anime fire and desire, and if you're on the fence of starting I have a feeling you'll be cheering fly Karasuno very soon :)",

Its not beautiful to thinking of winning and losing in such stark shades. Each character template seems familiar, the tropes are cyclic with Kazuhito Narita a copy of rival school\u2019s Taketora Yamamoto; Asahi Azumane a copy of Kazumasa Hanayama.\r\nEven Hajime no Ippo which came out in 1989 had a character that developed emotionally, gradually and naturally. This character set Haruichi developed makes me believe each character is an isolated island of made up parts. \r\nUnderwhelming emotional depth and non-realisticsetting\\n\\n\r\nI agree it's shounen manga but don\u2019t tell me fabrication beats an eclectic writer. After watching ping pong the animation, I realised the sport mixes itself into an athlete's life. The evolution and interplay with his team mates, coach, family and school makes you love Smile and Peco. Ippo\u2019s guts and grit gives you a strong rooting for him when he enters the ring. It\u2019s unfair but hard to write a story where no truth was ever there. A strong reason good writers pull from their environment. Evoking a sense of storytelling cadence and depth that pretty visuals can\u2019t hide, that reels you in, that makes you binge watch and then watch again.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Haikyuu!! is about volleyball, plain and simple. I for one have never been into volleyball and despite not being a fan of the sport, I decided to watch this series. And in all honesty, it doesn't matter if you love or hate volleyball, the series itself is so fantastic and exhilarating. Each episode left me eager to watch the next and it made me wish I played volleyball in my youth.\r\nThe story follows Shoyo Hinata, during junior high he suddenly falls in love with volleyball and it becomes his whole life. He tries to form a club during junior high but cannot find the membersuntil his last year where he competes in a tournament and gets dominated by \"The King of the Court\" Tobio Kageyama. Vowing to surpass Kageyama and beat him the next time they meet, he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball club only to find out that Kageyama is now his teammate. What follows is an amazing story where Hinata and Kageyama must work together to become Karasuno's most powerful duo.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with Hinata and Kageyama there is also Daichi Sawamura, the teams captain, Koshi Sugawara, the team's veteran setter, Asahi Azumane, the team's ace and Yu Nishinoya, the team's libero. Each character has an undying passion for volleyball and wants to win more than anything. Each character must also deal with challenges on their way to victory. Hinata must get over his fear of losing and stop being intimidated by the much taller opponents, Kageyama must learn to rely on his teammates and understand that he cannot win on his own, Sugawara deals with being replaced by Kageyama as the teams starting setter and Asahi must overcome his own guilt when he believes he's let his team down. My favorite character is Nishinoya, he's entertaining, exciting and a complete badass on the court.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is filled with excitement and suspense. Each episode left me eager to watch the next. This series made volleyball seem so awesome and fun to play. The character's passion for the sport made it that much more exciting and emotional to watch. Many episodes deal with the amazing feeling to win but also how hard it is to lose which will leave you smiling and tearing up throughout. The music in particular got me pumped for each episode especially the first opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a great series and I enjoyed each and every episode of it. One thing I did really like as well is that plot points developed over a few episodes and didn't just appear out of nowhere. Even if you aren't a volleyball fan before this series, like me, it will leave you wanting to see more. The storytelling and watching the characters play is some of the most exhilarating stuff to see and I could honestly get into volleyball after watching this. The Rio 2016 Olympics have started when I finished this series and volleyball is actually one of the events I'm most excited to watch because of Haikyuu. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",

            "content": "(This is my first review so sorry if it's missing in some areas)\r\nTo be honest, I'm not really a sports anime fan and I've not seen that many sports animes, but even I can tell Haikyuu!! is a one of a kind, masterpiece.\r\nAfter losing his first official match to Kageyama, Hinata vows to get stronger and surpass Kageyama in High School. Only to discover that they both end up in the same High School, Karasuno. The show may have the stereotypical teamwork and perseverance etc, however I felt that Haikyuu!! did a great job of using these themes to create a unique and different sportsshounen. The story had good pacing, no crazy strength gained in a 1- minute montage etc.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that was amazing about this show is how they continuously had volleyball, volleyball and more volleyball and it never seemed to bore me.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation/art impressed me as it successfully portrayed the characters feelings, emotions and personality. The varying determination could be seen in every player. It takes some time to get used to seeing the faces through the net, but it soon felt like normal. The matches themselves were pretty good, though sometimes the amount of time the ball spends in the air is too much to the point 'unrealistic' isn't a strong enough word.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening songs were also very good, it almost felt like you could feel the determination and hard work. The background music always fitted the mood. The voice actors were also amazing, each of them fitting the characters personality splendidly. Though I did expecially like Oikawa's VA Namikawa, Daisuke. He was great at conveying Oikawa's traits.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about the anime is the characters. They all have their own strengths and weaknesses and the character development was steady. The flashbacks always seemed to be at the right time and the pasts were slowly revealed for not just Karasuno, but Aoba Johsai and also Nekoma. Even for the antagonists, I couldn't help but love them too.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell from this review, my enjoyment was high and I recommend this to everyone, even if you aren't interested in sports. I am highly certain that after watching Haikyuu!! You will want to play volleyball yourself. \\n\\n\r\nStory- 9/10\\n\r\nArt/Animation- 8/10\\n\r\nSound- 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters-10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9/10\\n\r\nOverall- 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: Spoiler-Free Review of Both Seasons So Far!!\r\nPLEASE WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!!\r\nI am in no way a diehard fan of sports or sport anime in general. I usually find them tedious and boring. I had a very hard time convincing myself to watch this show because of that fact. I mean, it's volleyball, I figured I would have more fun watching paint dry. Oh boy was I wrong.\r\nGiving this diamond in the ruff a try might be one of the best anime decisions I've ever made. You know an anime is pure gold when it gets you fully invested in a story you otherwise wouldn't careat all about. The story telling in Haikyuu!! and it's second season, were absolutely spectacular. The ensemble cast all had significant roles to play in the story, and it never felt like the story was too focused on the main characters. This anime even made you feel bad for the minor characters on the opposing teams. Haikyuu might have the best character development of ANY anime I've ever seen.... regardless of genre. \\n\\n\r\nI personally found the pacing to be perfect. Each match was given ample time to develop without feeling rushed or drawn out. As a viewer, I felt like a member of the team who needed to give every opponent the respect they deserved, rather than just automatically disregarding a team as a stepping stone.  From a larger scale (season to season), the pacing was also excellent. From very early on, a clear goal for our protagonists was presented. It was made very clear where the story was going, and what the team would need to do to reach their goal. I found myself very satisfied with the way the team's progress towards this goal was approached. Very high marks all around in terms of plot. \\n\\n\r\nI think one aspect of an anime that can sometimes be overlooked are the sound effects in each episode. Haikyuu!! did a wonderful job of making the audience feel like they were in the gym training, or on the court with the team in during a match. I very much enjoyed the immersiveness of the sounds in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs a pessimist, it kind of annoys me that I can't find anything major that's wrong with Haikyuu!! This anime was very enjoyable and should be given a chance regardless of your feelings about the genre. I have high hopes for season 3, and hopefully this wonderful anime will continue to impress me.",

(I\u2019ll try to make this review as short and straight to the point as possible!)\r\nSTORY: 8\r\nIt follows a pretty basic plot, but long story short: his rival, Kageyama, becomes his teammate. It\u2019ll expand from that Hinata and Kageyama to learning about the rest of the team as well, watching them compete in matches against other schools, etc. and it\u2019ll keep you always wanting more. \r\nCHARACTER: 10\r\nThe development of Hinata and Kageyama\u2019s relationship is amazing, I loved every second of it. I loved Hinata\u2019s determinations, Kageyama learning to work with his team, Asahi overcoming his fear of lettinghis team down, etc. I adored every single member of the team, each of them had their own personality and quirks, and the way they interact with each other feels very real and you\u2019re constantly rooting for them as they work together. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\r\nBoth openings are super catchy, I found myself humming it even when I was just doing schoolwork haha. The voice actors fit perfectly to the characters they were portraying! I didn\u2019t really notice many problems with the sound, but I\u2019m no expert in this criteria. \\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\r\nSome people hate the way characters are drawn, but I actually loved the way characters were drawn! But even if you hate it at first, it\u2019ll probably grow on you so it\u2019s not too big of a concern. Each of the characters have an almost more realistic look to them. The animation during games/matches are great. Solid animations! \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nI loved every second of this anime, and when i wasn\u2019t watching it, it was all that was on my mind! \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nIf you are still hesitant on this anime\u2026 don\u2019t be. Go watch it right now, and have a blast. I\u2019m begging you, please give this anime a chance, you won\u2019t regret it!",

            "content": "Sports anime hasn't really been a genre that I have looked upon or a genre I wanted to look upon, but looking at Haikyuu and the ratings and recommendations that people said definitely intrigued me to watch it.\r\n(MINOR SPOILERS)\r\n(Story 9/10) \r\nhaikyuu's story is probably one of the best sports anime out there as it is the most presentable sports anime. It tells the story about Hinata Shoyo, a teenager who pursues his dream to become the best ace on his volleyball team after watching a match of the Small Giant, Hinata's role model, many years ago. Though starting his high school year he runs intoa rival that he played against in his junior years and was ultimately defeated. It's story is presentable in a way as it definitely kept control of Hinata's story and the other characters stories. Haikyuu definitely made me more interested in volleyball then ever before. \\n\\n\r\n(Art 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu's art is what make's it unique. It was drawn beautifully and definitely matched up to the anime itself. The art had amazing color and beautiful drawn edges and the attention to detail was beautiful. The animation in the anime is possibly one of the reasons why it got some attention. The sharp movements and amazing detail is almost Ufotable and Madhouse level of animation possibly even better. \\n\\n\r\n(Sound 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI thought the sound of the anime was just satisfying as each swing and hit of the volleyball was just alluring. The Opening of the anime was by far amazing as it fit the mood in the anime and fit the theme that it gave. The Ending song of the anime was also beautiful as it had beautiful well written music. The soundtrack is definitely the reason why the sound is so amazing. As it is also the same person who did Death Parade's music, Haikyuu's music had a jumping exhilarating feeling to it. It's soundtrack definitely fits well into the anime as it is gives off a nice feeling to it.\\n\\n\r\n(Character 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are always a great asset to anime and Haikyuu delivers. There are tons of characters in this anime that will take me forever to explain to you guys but here are some of the main people.\\n\\n\r\nShoyo Hinata is the main character in our anime and the one pursuing his dreams of becoming the best ace on his team but ultimately is the decoy. Hinata has a great sense of humor and is always energetic and enthusiastic about everything. Although he may be short Hinata possesses a great ability of jumping really high. Don't get on his bad side though when playing against him, you'll be stepping on needles afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nTobio Kageyama is also a main character in the series as he was the team that went against Hinata many years ago. He was dubbed \"The King\" but has always hated that saying and always hated when Hinata would tease him about it. Kageyama is the teams setter who is ultimately important to the team for Hinata. Hinata and Kageyama may share a difficult past but when their abilities are combined together they are the most fearsome duo.\\n\\n\r\nTooru Oikawa is Kageyama's and Hinata's rival in the series. He is considered the antagonist in the series as he has the most violent serves and is considered the best setter in volleyball. Although he may have these scary attributes, Oikawa has a charismatic side of him and can flatter and make any girl fall in love with them everywhere he goes. He does share a past with Kageyama and has always hated him since junior high.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu is definitely a comedic anime since it adds a breezing feeling to the anime. Each episode contains different settings and different character perspectives and is definitely a show where people can enjoy some quality time with Hinata and can also enjoy the sport genre as well.  \\n\\n\r\n(Overall 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nConcluding this review, Haikyuu is definitely a sports anime that shouldn't go  unknown to the human eye. It definitely adds comedy, sports, and definitely a shounen feeling to it and is surely something anyone will find entertaining.",

I don't usually watch sports animes, or animes without Romance, however, since I recently joined my schools' volleyball team, I thought I would give Haikyuu!! a try. Boy am I glad I did. This anime was 10/10 amazing, I could not pick out anything bad about it at all. Not only was this anime realistic, as in the main team actually makes mistakes, loses games, and the moves aren't over exaggerated, it even almost made me cry, MULTIPLE TIMES. It was so fun to watch as they struggle to improve and to achieve their goal. Each character's characteristics andstrength were very refined and unique. The plot is easy to understand, and the goal is clearly there. Overall I would definitely suggest this anime to everyone, especially the people who enjoy volleyball.",

YOU CAN MISS THIS ONE! THEY'RE WAY TOO AHEAD\") but have the non-game moments/training drag a little bit.\r\nIt's literally that simple.\r\n(PS: I am the former.

It's not like other anime where they believe they can, yell out their determination and win. \r\nNO!! Here they get heart-ache, even after being determined and a lot of practice. And it's not just the main characters.\r\nThe loss and victory everyone feels in this anime, a person can relate to it, there is a lot of feels, heart racing, pillow gripping, screen yelling, palm sweatingmoments . The humor is just outstanding, around most of the turns there is humor. And the characters just add more to that with their behavior.\\n\\n\r\nThis really is one sport anime that no one will regret watching, so I really do recommend this to anyone.",

            "content": "Sports anime have become quite popular recently. I'm not really into this genre, but I saw a few things like Kuroko no Basuke (which was \"okay\"), Free!! (which was really enjoyable) and Yowamushi Pedal (which I hated). When I decided to give Haikyuu!! a try, I was kind of sceptical, but after first few episodes I found myself absorbed into the story and eventually fell in love with this anime and am now waiting for the second season. \r\nFirst of all, I'd like to point out the wounderful combination of voice actors (including my favourite Kamiya Hiroshi). Their acting was perfect and Haikyuu!! was areal pleasure for my ears :) The characters are also great and their story is told through their actions, words and thoughts, without those long annoying flashbacks. Some flashbacks are present here, of course, but they are interesting to watch and there's no wish to skip them. \\n\\n\r\nThe story here is great as well. It has some sports anime cliches, but it's really interesting to follow. Some moments are really intense and make you cling to your monitor and be like \"SCORE THE POINT PLEASE SCORE THE DAMN POINT AND WIN THIS SET\", some moments are really funny (actually, it's been a while when I actually laughed out loud watching anime), and some moments are just enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nSo thanks to Haikyuu!! I got to understand volleyball better (I never thought it's so hard and complicated), had some really pleasand days spent watching this anime, and even decided to write my first review on this website :) \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, this anime is really well-balanced and for me it was still interesting when I decided to rewatch it. So I rate it 10/10 and wait for the next season :)",

            "content": "Sometime last week, something miraculous happened. I was browsing online and I saw this random recommendation about a volleyball anime, the name of which I had heard pop up here and there in various comments and websites. Not being a fan of sports anime, yet having nothing better to do, I decided to watch the first episode, to kill time if nothing else. \r\nSo then, would I recommend this anime to someone else?\r\nI finished the first season in two days. So yes, I would recommend Haikyuu!! to everyone else.\r\nStory: Exhilarating. Exciting. Heartwarming. Those are some of the many descriptors I could give to Haikyuu!! ifI were required to summarise the story. It follows Shoyo Hinata and Tobio Kageyama as they join the Karasuno Volleyball club, with ambitions to reach the nationals, and more than that-to play the game the love.\\n\\n\r\nIt is by no means a novel concept. A once majestic team now thrown from the top, looking to reclaim their legacy with the addition of some exceptionally talented players to the new year, who also happen to be rivals. But where Haikyuu!! succeeds is in the execution of the above concept, to near perfection.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself rooting for Karasuno as the season progressed, wanting to see each character get their own victories, no matter how minor. And that's the best part about this show. Everyone wins, some more than others. Unlike cerain sports anime (looking at you, Kuroko no Basket) Haikyuu!! is different in that our protagonists aren't unbeatable forces of nature.\\n\\n\r\nThey win. They lose. It shows us that simply because one or two players are geniuses, victory is not guaranteed. This keeps the tension going, as I kept wondering who would take the match, unlike KnB, where I was bored after the first five episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnother way I can describe the story is that it is to a certain extent, realistic. Never once did I think that any victory or loss Karasuno achieved or suffered was undeserved, and that's how it should be. Each team has their own strengths and weaknesses, and there is an underlying strategy to all matches, no matter how small it may seem.\\n\\n\r\nIt progresses well too. Save for a few episodes an scenes where I found myself bored enough to look at something else, it kept me glued to my screen, especially in the final tournament matches. I admit, I almost cheered at the final match's ending because of the excitement.\\n\\n\r\nWhat works so well for Haikyuu!! is that it's not the story of one boy, or two boys(KnB again.). Rather, it is the story of a team, consisting of individuals of differing personalities and ideals. The way their interactions, and those between them and their rivals (I refuse to use enemies or antagonists) are written make Haikyuu!! an extremely entertaining watch.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Production I.G did a very very good job with the art and animation. In fact, it surprised me that they did KnB as well, because the difference in art styles and direction is so vast between the two. For example, Haikyuu likes to use a paint brush like art style some times to emphasize force and fluidity, which conveys the feeling without being too over the top. \\n\\n\r\nGenerally speaking, motion is fluid, and you really feel the speed and weight behind each strike on the ball. Very well done, I must say. This is especially true when Oikawa does his service aces. I swear, he had my heart pumping whenever he set one of those bad boys up.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is some excellent work by Produciton I.G.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Do you remember those three words I used when I was describing the story? Ctrl+C & Ctrl+V because that's precisely what this soundtrack is. Some background OSTs are just pure awesomeness, specially those when they're strategizing or analyzing. The openings and endings are nice, as well, though I am sad to say I skipped those some time because I wanted to watch the matches so much.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is also done very nicely, specifically those in the background. The cheers in the final matches genuinely conveyed excitement and purpose, rather than just being yells of 'GO!!'. And this is doubly true when Oikawa's about to drop a service ace on some fools.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Let me make something clear. I hated Shoyo Hinata and Tobio Kageyama. I don't like overly cheery 'I want to play all the time no matter what!' protagonists, nor do I like overtly genius characters. I may be alone in this, but the fact that I loved Haikyuu's characterization in general should tell you what my opinion of them are.\\n\\n\r\nI don't like Shoyo because he feels too much like a simplistic dead-set idiot. I get my Luffy and Ichigo from Luffy and Ichigo, I don't need it from others as well. Kageyama, on the other hand, felt like he had no equal, and thus had no challenge to overcome. \\n\\n\r\nI was wrong. So very wrong. I never grew to even stand Hinata, but Kageyama is a different matter. I saw his genius being countered by experience, strategy, and intelligence, and I suddenly didn't have as much a problem with them as before. Don't get me wrong, I still don't like him, but I get where he's coming from. (Unlike Hinata)\\n\\n\r\nBut as I said before, this is the story of teams. And that's where Haikyuu!! shines. The characters of both the home and rival teams are very well fleshed out, to the point where there were instances when I started hoping for the rivals to win, because I felt they deserved it more than Karasuno. Not to say Karasuno is bad, by any means. Every member -the ace, the libero, the spikers, setters, blockers, even those outside the court like the benched or the manager and coach- is developed at least in some minute way, and that, I think, is excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like I said, it was hard to find faults with Haikyuu!! Not because it's a masterpiece, but because it draws you in so well it's hard to focus on anything else. Believe me, there is no chance that you'll come away from this disappointed. That, I can guarantee you.\\n\\n\r\nSo go on. If you were considering watching Haikyuu!!, then by all means, jump straight in. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Service Ace/10",

Haikyuu is one of a few rare titles where the rivals will push themselves harder when the main characters retaliate. \\n\r\nShounen as it is, this in turn makes the main characters to give all of them and pump you and me up.\\n\\n\r\nBiggest strength of the show is displayed on the volleyball matches. \\n\r\nMarvelous directing and well-placed slo-mo scenes manage to place the audience within the matches, and in turn feel the immense pressure and intensity.\\n\r\nYou just can't take a breathe when the matches starts.\\n\r\nThe production value is over-the-top, even just for the volleyball matches alone.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a fan for the two OPs and two EDs, they're quite decent and have the common shounen vibe. \\n\r\nTho the soundtracks are marvelous. Especially the piano track that plays everytime a character is going to stand up and rise again from his failure.\\n\r\nthe soundtracks helped to heat up the atmosphere and max the hype. That's the main job and I call it a job well done. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I.G. has been taking blame for the poor Arise, their efforts in animating sport titles are widely recognised.\\n\r\nAmong that, Haikyuu remains the best and purest to the shounen core, while manages to keep the audience motivated and passion for more.\\n\r\nMou ikkai! Season 2 and beyond for us Production I.G.!",

About a team that wants to show the world that they're still strong and can go to nationals (and win). The art is great, very colorful and the animation is outstanding. The sound is one of the highlights of this anime, the sounds of the volleyballs being spiked, or the teammates saying \"don't mind!\" To their comrades, very thought trough with the dialogue. The characters are interesting, determined and strong-willed, with a bit of comedy involved(like funny faces and playful fighting). My enjoyment from this anime made me bring out my inner child, it's a very hype anime and the episodes are never a let down. Even a slow episode is still worth watching. Overall I give this anime a 9, it will not be a waste of time to watch and you can even learn about volleyball which I think is a great aspect. I had no idea that there were so many positions in volleyball and how coordinated you have to be! Would recommend.",

            "content": "Wow. This show was a roller coaster ride, and I absolutely loved it. After watching the first episode all the way back in December, I abandoned it to watch some other shows, including Durarara!! and Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu Love!, but just a few weeks ago, I decided to give it another chance, and I'm so glad I did. I've been a fan of sports anime for a while, having watched and enjoyed Free! and Yowamushi Pedal (as well as planning to watch Kuroko no Basuke when i get a chance), but Haikyuu!! went above and beyond my expectations and quickly became my favorite sportsanime and definitely one of my favorite anime just in general.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about me, let's get onto the volleyball.\\n\\n\r\nThe huge overarching plot is your typical sports anime kind of thing, where the main team has to overcome the obstacles presented by other teams in order to win the championship or whatnot. In that, Haikyuu!! isn't really anything special or different from other anime in its genre. But that's okay, because it makes way for this series' biggest strong point: the impressive characters and characterization.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Hinata and Kageyama are the main characters, and their relationship is focused on the most throughout the series. They're both written extremely well, and they also have a ton of character development, both individually and as a team. But they by all means aren't the only characters in the series, and the producers make sure you know that extremely well, by making sure you both get to know and in some cases fall in love with the other, more minor characters. From the tough-looking teddy bear spiker Azumane Asahi to the super-energetic \"fight me!\" attacker Tanaka Ryuunosuke, as well as all the other characters you meet, the series lets you meet your teammates and know them really well, almost as if you were playing on a real team instead of watching one. Most of them also undergo a lot of character development themselves, Asahi really standing out among the rest of the team, although I can think of at least two other characters who undergo some as well. However, the main cast is huge, making for some characters to almost get left out of the action. Yamaguchi Tadashi especially comes to mind, as he sometimes gets a little bit of the spotlight, then practically disappears for episodes at a time. And even so, some of the other characters barely get focused on at all. \\n\\n\r\nBut that's not it. Along with getting to know your teammates, you also get to know your rivals and your enemies, too. After all, Karasuno High has to play against someone to win, right? There's  a lot of focus on rival school Nekoma High and its players, especially quiet setter Kenma, in a few episodes, and the match against \"Iron Wall\" blocking central Dateko has a lot of focus on their team, too. \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest school other than Karasuno to get the spotlight, however, is definitely Aoba Johsai, Karasuno's true rival. Not only does the team have a lot of players from Kageyama's middle school, but their captain, Oikawa Tooru, is given a huge spotlight on his own in the later episodes of the series. I won't spoil it, of course, but while you might hate him early on, Oikawa just might become one of your favorite characters, and his motivations are both relatable and heart-wrenching. Aoba Johsai will probably make you question who you're actually rooting for, due to the amazing characterization on both sides of the net. That's what happened for me, at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great, the characters all have lots of expression and they all are voiced extremely well. The voice cast was wonderful to listen to, and Oikawa's \"Yahoo!~\" never gets old. Plus, the music is great. The openings and endings are all extremely catchy, but the OST that plays during the show itself is also a work of art that enhances the feeling of the series a lot and contributes to its success.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also pretty great, being from Production I.G. and all, and in some cases it enhances the over-the-top feeling of the show, which I loved. There were bits when it seemed a bit repetitive, but overall, it was great visually. Some of the facial expressions were pretty hilarious, too. \\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu!!, overall, is a great anime, one of the best in its genre, at least in my opinion. But hey, I played a lot of volleyball before watching the show, so maybe it's just me. Either way, it's an extremely fun watch, and it gets even better as the show goes on, at least until you end up crying over something or another. Even then, you will still love it. The elements all combine to create an amazing experience, and the characters especially stand out as characters you may just fall in love with. I'm extremely excited for season 2, and if it's anywhere as good as this season, it'll be a hit in my book.",

            "content": "Ah where to start...\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story was great. Suspensful, full of action, leaving you on the edge of your seat, but having it's hilarious moments which can just leave you busting up. Very well done, but I did feel the first couple of episodes were a bit slow. Now don't get me wrong, they're still great episodes, it just doesn't do the rest of the series justice. If you're not loving it by the third episode, give it one more and you'll be hooked. Well paced, and well done. Only a 9 due to the lackluster of the first couple of episodes.\r\nArt: 9\r\nA quite uniqueart style, not that one I loved immediately but soon came to cherish. Bright colors everywhere helping to show the more upbeat tone of the anime, along with the hilarious faces some of the characters pull. All facial expressions are quite expressive and never the same for long. Perfectly timed slow motion implemented to help you grasp the full importance of the scene and to kill you with it's beautiful suspense. Very nice and a great change of pace from other anime art styles.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening is extremely catchy and completely captures the happy, energetic mood this anime puts out. The music can easily go from the happy and carefree tone of a comical scene straight into the dramatic, suspenseful tone of the truly intense scenes, both helping to excel your emotions to the max whether it be laughing or crying. The ending was okay, not the catchiest in my own opinion, but also does help the energetic, happy feel like the opening does. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nOh the characters... All the characters are amazing. All are unique, quirky, and easily lovable. Everyone can choose a favorite from our haikyuu team, or even from one of the enemies. Every character has amazing depth, conveying motives and emotions very effectively. And this isn't just for our lovely protagonist's team, nope, it goes into everyone. Heck, I was rooting for the opponent to win occasionally 'I know, I know, I'm sorry, I love you Hinata...'. Great character development throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis show made Sundays something to always look forward to. Whether it be a suspenseful continuation of the last episode, or just a happy-go-lucky new start, it was always something to get excited about. With my love for the characters, seeing their ups and downs, I personally really got into it. I go from laughing to almost in tears in a mere minute.  Highly enjoyed it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nQuite a suspenseful and addicting story, a unique art style that really captures the characters, very fitting music and a great opening, beautiful character development along with quirky unique, and easily lovable characters, extremely enjoyable. Overall quite a fantastic anime. Recommendable to everyone, even if they're not a sport kind of person. ^-^ Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "Before Haikyuu, I avoided watching sports anime in general. The only reason why I tried Haikyuu was because I needed some filler anime while other anime were between seasons.\r\nEpisode 1 hit me right in the heart, and I found myself tearing up. Before I realized it, I was laughing, tearing up, and cheering throughout the first season. Here are some metrics and explanations as to why.\r\nFor normal people, read the top half. For fujoshi and fudanshi, feel free to read the bottom half.\r\nStory: 9.5 / 10\r\nHaikyuu is the only sports anime I have ever watched, but there is a lot of emphasis on growth andpractice. There is only one goal: win. On its face, it sounds simplistic and boring. But the execution is excellent! But its execution is mainly through character development. See character for more. \\n\r\nMy only two complaints:\\n\r\n1. The ball takes forever to fall during narration.\\n\r\n2. There are some unbearably cheesy moments here and there\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 / 10\\n\r\nIt seems like each character's design is unique, and not born from a template. Their expressions are incredible! I read that the reason why the art is so powerful is because Furudate Haruichi, the author and artist of Haikyuu, also wrote horror manga. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 / 10\\n\r\nThe Japanese voice actors give so much life to each character! They were able to make me laugh, tear up, and cheer. The soundtrack is great, and has some character specific soundtracks that are fitting. Game sounds and environment sounds compliment scenes, especially the cheering during games. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10++ / 10\\n\r\nCharacter development is Haikyuu's #1 hook. No character is left behind in terms of growth. Each has a fear. Each has a different drive. It is amazing watching everyone evolve, learning how to tackle tough situations and operate outside of their comfort zones. The character interactions are hilarious and moving! I found myself laughing and tearing up often. The best part is that this is not limited to the main cast, but also applies to opposing teams. While other anime will portray opposing teams as a bump in the road or some evil team, each opposing team gets a realistic treatment with their own dynamics. The most powerful thing about these characters is that I can relate to them in a sense. I never played volleyball. But the themes about being defeated, aiming to be better, and never giving up hit really hard. The characters of Haikyuu inspire me to be better, no matter how much people try to drag me down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.7 / 10\\n\r\nHaikyuu is one of my favorite anime. I have re-watched each season, and I still get teary eyed, still laugh, and still cheer. I can't pick a favorite character. But Hinata's and Nishinoya's resilience compel me to push myself in everything I do. \\n\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nFujoshi and fudanshi analysis below. \\n\r\nDo not continue if you do not want to read about homosexual undertones.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nIf you are reading this, you're wondering about the shounen-ai undertones. There are some other anime that pile on the homosexual themes, leaving little to the imagination. But in Haikyuu, there is no holding each other in bed, no locking eyes while in each other's arms, and there is no face caressing. \\n\\n\r\nInstead, there are bunch of a goofy and gorgeous guys fighting, teasing, and competing. Testosterone and tensions everywhere. Though there is a bunch of testosterone swirling about, most team members are still great friends with one another.\\n\\n\r\n(Tension + fighting + teasing + competition) * friendship * testosterone = shipping galore!\\n\\n\r\nThere is plenty of day dreaming and shipping to be had in Haikyuu.",

FREAKING VOLLEYBALL I know it sounds weird like \"volleyball sounds so boring like come on that's what a girls in bikinis play at the beach.\" but I'm going to tell you know that this is one of the nest god damn sports shows out there.\r\n-STORY: The story is really good, it starts out slow then it starts to let you get to know the characters then later on adding more with theirown stories. story about a kid who saw a live volleyball match with a short player nicknamed \"The Little Giant\" then wanting to grow up and join the same high school team and go to nationals. But then he meets the king of the court and they join the Karasuna which is now know as the fallen crows. Its time for redemption\\n\\n\r\n-ART: The art style is absolutely beautiful, from the reflection of the ball in their eyes to the perspectives of all the characters. It clearly shows the intensity of game and the excitement and fear of the bystanders waiting to see what exactly happens.\\n\\n\r\n-MUSIC/SOUND: the music is great it goes with whats happening on screen and gets you the edge of your seat waiting to see what is going to happen next. Also the amount of symbolism and foreshadowing and just the meaning behind all the shots in the Opening show how much time they too to put it together.\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTERS: The characters are introduced slowly and everyone is given a backstory to an extent. the character development happens slowly until at one point you clearly notice that this person has definitely changed in the last couple episodes, from kagiyama relying on his teammates to the senpai's gaining confidence in the team to tsukshi finally taking volleyball seriously.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall i'd like to say that i enjoyed this series and that i recommend it. obviously it isn't perfect but just watch it and decide how you like it yourself. \\n",

However, there is no sound track that are memorable. Can't give it a higher score.\r\nCharacter 7/10: Characters with diverse personalities. However, most characters are stereotypes and there is not much development. Specifically, Hinata is portrayed as too childish to be a high schooler\r\nStory 6/10: Story is too slow at the beginning and wasboring at times. It sped up when it gets to the tournament.

But it was too slow and I almost dropped it before it gets there.\\n\\n\r\nIn my own rating system, a perfect show gets 9/10. If a show strikes me hard emotionally or teach me something that change my life, then it goes another +1. This is a 7/10 show in my mind.

            "content": "Note: This is a short review of the whole series.\r\nIf somebody were to ask me what is the most important aspect of a show I'd say it's the characters. If asked why, I'd give as an example Haikyuu!!\r\nThe story of a bunch of high school kids playing volleyball sounds boring and uninteresting- and it really is. However, why do I love this show so much? Because of the characters. Once you really start caring about them, everything they feel- you feel it too. Their passion, their insecurities, their sadness and, of course, their happiness. And everything that is important to them- is important to youas well. Yes, this show is about a bunch of high school boys playing volleyball- but, trust me, you\u2019re going to feel every second of the volleyball games like you\u2019re the one who poured all his/her passion it.\\n\r\nYou are probably curious to find out why am I saying the characters are so great- what\u2019s so special about them? Well, couldn\u2019t really say it\u2019s something special- it\u2019s their relatability, personalities and the way they are portrayed. Each and every individual has one trait which makes them likeable: Hinata\u2019s undying love and passion for a sport in which he has a major disadvantage- and his overflowing ambition to become great despite his shortcomings, Kageyama\u2019s willingness to change his rough personality in order to fit in better with the team, Nishinoya\u2019s amazing enthusiasm, team spirit and willingness to not give up, Daichi\u2019s amazing leadership which keeps the team together - and the list could go on.\\n\r\nI also mentioned how incredibly relatable these characters are. In Haikyuu!!, there\u2019s always this feeling that the characters are starting from the bottom- that they are in no way great but they are working their hardest, doing their best and are feeling the same nervousness a normal person would feel if they were in their situation. I love how they put a lot of focus on some character\u2019s lack of self confidence (which for me personally is as relatable as possible), on their fear of losing, on the pressure of living up to their own expectations and on the disappointment in themselves when they make a mistake. In Haikyuu!!, you always have your fingers crossed for the characters to succeed the techniques they plan on doing cuz you saw how hard they worked and how much they want wish to able to do them. However, you do seem them fail a lot. And when they succceed- it makes you feel so damn happy and proud.\\n\r\nYes, Haikyuu!! is by no means a dark or serious show- it\u2019s a light-hearted, at times funny and endearing story that will have you feeling happy, excited and sometimes nervos thanks to our loveable characters.\\n\r\nEnding note: this was my first ever review- hope it wasn't too bad.\\n",

            "content": "Currently sitting in the top 50 along with its two succeeding seasons, Haikyuu!! is definitely a popular anime here on MAL. While not quite as perfect as some may claim, it is still a highly enjoyable watch, thanks to an engaging yet straightforward plot, with lovable characters, consistent artwork, and high-quality sound.\r\n[Story - 8]\r\nThe plot of this show is, as mentioned before, rather straightforward - Shouyou Hinata becomes enamoured with Volleyball in middle school, and decides to sign up for his high school's club on his first day. Along the way, he meets multiple challenges, such as brusque teammates and overwhelmingly powerful opponents, and hehas to learn how to properly rise to the challenge.\\n\\n\r\nThis may not seem rather engaging at first, but once you watch the first couple of episodes, there's a 9/10 guarantee that you'll watch the rest of the season to see how this pans out for our protagonist. It gradually increases in intensity thanks to the introduction of expanded team dynamics, and the high amount of tension that is the norm in competitive sports. The ending is even rather shocking, and definitely provides a hook to watch the following season.\\n\\n\r\n[Art - 7]\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to call out a weakest element, this would be one, and only for a minor flaw. While the art style in this show is rather consistent, with a warm colour palette and distinctive character designs, I noticed that several animations were re-used multiple times. Most people may not notice this, so it can be considered minor, but I'm still disappointed in Production I.G. for having done so. Nonetheless, I found myself rather satisfied with the art in this show, and I'm interested to see how it'll transform in the following seasons.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 8]\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects used in the show are of high-quality: usually I don't pay attention to SFX, but something about this show's use of them was rather fulfilling to experience. The variety of sounds of the ball being smacked, blocked, etc. etc. helped a lot in creating an intense atmosphere during game time.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus do their jobs splendidly, with each one giving their character a distinctive tone. I was especially pleased with the seiyuus for Hinata, Tsukishima, and Oikawa, as I found they even /enhanced/ the characters. No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is rather stellar, and suits the show well: With a variety of acoustic/alt rock tunes that back each scene, it definitely gives a 'youth sports nostalgia' vibe. While no particular OST track stands out for me, I enjoyed the cohesive work overall. The OP and ED themes are just as suitable too, and I definitely recommend /at least/ checking them out. \\n\\n\r\n[Character - 7]\\n\\n\r\nDespite a couple of hiccups in terms of characterization, I feel like this show did admirably well in handling the characters. The show revolves around the Karasuno High School Boys' Volleyball Club, which our protagonist is a part of. Other characters that are quickly introduced in this group are his rival-teammate Tobio Kageyama, stalwart captain Daichi Sawamura, and resident jokester Ryuunosuke Tanaka. They, along with the rest of the team, may not have much depth at first, but are quickly shown to be rather passionate about their hobby and readily supportive of each other, along with struggling internally with issues such as past betrayals and the impending doom of the end of high school. While they can admittedly be rather melodramatic for /high school volleyball/, I can definitely understand their struggle and I feel like it contributed to the show's intensity. However, there is also tons of comedy as expected of high school boys, such as teenage crushes and pranks, which helps to balance it all out.\\n\\n\r\nThere are multiple teams in the show, as is expected of sports anime, so obviously the flaw of 'underdevelopment' can loom over. However, I found that some characters who would have been underdeveloped are otherwise fleshed out (or at least starting to become fleshed out). One notable example is a genius of a rival setter named Tooru Oikawa: Formerly Tobio's 'senpai' in middle school, he poses the greatest threat to Team Karasuno throughout the season, and constantly keeps them all on their toes. He too struggles internally, with a longtime desire to become number one in his prefecture and go to Nationals. He's rather memorable in my honest opinion, and while I know the outcome of his arc, I'm excited to relive it.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters, however, definitely do suffer from some lack of substantial development. Characters such as Kiyoko Shimizu (Karasuno BVC Manager), Ittetsu Takeda (BVC Advisor), and Keishin Ukai (BVC Coach), all have so much more potential, yet are left in the dust by the BVC. I blame this on the source material not having dedicated enough time to these characters at this point, and I hope it is rectified in the upcoming seasons.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment/Overall - 9/8]\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of some nitpicking with characterization and art, I found this anime to be a fun watch! Even though I read the manga first, it was exciting to relive the high-velocity action of the earlier arcs, and I'll definitely be watching the following seasons. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for an easy-to-digest + fun anime, especially if you enjoy sports. I can see this being a nice modern gateway anime.\\n",

            "content": "Characters can make or break a show. Creating people rather than simple two-dimensional drawings on a screen is difficult but depending on the type of narrative it can be the most important aspect in determining if an anime is good or not. A show can stand on its own even if it lacks fantastic character writing, but to reach greatness, fictional storytelling needs well-crafted characters. Haikyuu stands out among anime in more than one way, but its characters are ultimately what make the show great, enjoyable and nail-bitingly exciting. It\u2019s well animated, action-filled games certainly add to the emotional impact, but without the amazing peoplein this anime, those scenes would not effectively stand out.\\n\\n\r\nMaking an emphasis on the term \u2018people\u2019 rather than \u2018characters\u2019 makes an important distinction in how well a show has built up believable human-beings. Any fictional being with a bit of art and dialogue is a character. To create a character is easy. To create a person is hard. Making people means that the author(s) have a steady grasp on what makes a person, a person on more than a surface or physical level. Humans are complex things, each one has their own experiences that shape them, their own personalities that dictate how they react to their environment, and on top of all of this, they are ever changing. No person\u2019s mind stays the same forever, it is continuously molded by life and other people. To build a character that takes all of this into account requires understanding and creativity. Making characters that lack key elements of humanity will create an issue in the level of investment a person can put into a show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter investment is key. It is a prime mover in how immersed a viewer can get in a story. Character believability drives character investment which drives immersion. If you cannot believe that a character is real, you cannot get invested in them or their actions and a wall is formed between fiction and reality, immersion is broken. Some shows may not need to rely on character investment as much as others, again it depends on what kind of story is being told, but for a show like Haikyuu, it is absolutely critical.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily for Haikyuu, its characters are well developed and easily believed. To say Haikyuu is lucky is actually a disservice to the the show\u2019s writers and the original mangaka. Luck has nothing to do with how each of the main characters is well developed enough to convince a viewer that they are real people. They are more than drawings on a screen, they are three-dimensional persons each with their own motivations, experiences, relationships, emotions, etc. A show like Haikyuu needs and thrives on good characters. This is a show about high school volleyball, portrayed in a somewhat realistic manner. It follows the standard sports-anime format of tournaments and practices without much else in between. As far as plot goes, that sums up the show, while at the same time sounding completely mundane and uninteresting to most potential viewers.\\n\\n\r\nHaikyuu does not exactly have the most unique, or interesting premise to the majority of the anime fanbase. It is an animated show about a sport that most probably have little interest in. Even in the world of major league sports, and the huge business in making them spectator sports, volleyball doesn\u2019t exactly draw in the big crowds. To reach a larger audience, Haikyuu needs its great characters to drive its story, because it can not rely on its sport-based-plot to do so.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the hook which in turn draw viewers into the sport. Once drawn in, a viewer will find themselves engaged in the sport. The connection is another layer of investment. Part of the reason that good characters can get viewers immersed in a show is because of empathy. The ability to feel what other people are feeling is a very basic ability shared between almost all of humanity. Empathy only works with other people though. It is highly likely that if a viewer cannot believe that a character is human, they will not feel empathy for them, or it will be reduced relative to how far from real a character feels. Through empathy, a viewer becomes invested in a character, but beyond that they also become invested in whatever that character is doing, and that is how Haikyuu manages to draw you into the sport.\\n\\n\r\nBeing empathetic towards a character means the viewer feels their emotions. In Haikyuu, the characters are fully invested in volleyball. They pour their hearts and souls into each match, and you can feel it. The characters\u2019 investment in the sport seeds viewer investment in the sport, even if said viewer has little actual interest in volleyball outside of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the root of the show\u2019s hype, not the action, but the characters themselves. Haikyuu is widely regarded as a show that can--and will--pump up your excitement. Every point has you on the edge of your seat in anticipation. You may have no interest in watching a live, professional, volleyball match on television, but these fictional matches between made-up Japanese high schoolers has you rooting for the Karasuno High Volleyball Club every step of the way as you eagerly await new episodes.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike real life professional sports, in anime, you get to know the players on a deep and emotional level. Those watching the anime are given views into their personal lives and frequently into their their own thoughts. This builds a stronger relationship between the characters and the viewer which can be exploited to create interest by association in whatever it is that the characters put effort into.\\n\\n\r\nAs a story, Haikyuu does not do anything fundamentally different from many other sports anime. As a genre, sports-anime are fairly niche, but Haikyuu, with a plot that doesn\u2019t truly stand out, manages to draw people in, even if they aren\u2019t sports fans at all, let alone volleyball fans. It builds fantastic characters and relationships in order to prey on human empathy and connect viewers to the sport indirectly thus building hype in a setting most would not consider to be engaging.",

They win some, and lose some games, but we all watch in amazment as the Karasnuo team builds up the ranks. And we watch the characters develop. Personally I loved watching this series, I won't spoil anything from the anime so you don't have to worry. \r\nBut I really did enjoy the anime in a whole. For the story, I felt it was a little cookie cutter when it came to plot, that there is some under dogwith a unknown power that leads the worst team to the top. I thought the animation was really beautiful, I liked the add of different art style when they fought in games. I wasn't sure what to execpt for sound, but I guess it was good for a volleyball anime. \\n\r\nThe characters were amazing, you could see the character development through out the anime, I thought it was perfect. \\n\r\nEnjoyment of the show was pretty high, with each episode left on a cliffhanger. You always want more with each episode. \\n\r\nOverall this is a enjoyable sport anime to watch, and I would recommend it if you like action with the violence.",

            "content": "Haikyuu!! is a show full of jokes, crazy characters, pumping the viewers up with the emotions of excitement. However, this little review will focus on how successful the show is at getting the viewers to sympathize with the characters.\r\n** Contain a bit of spoiler. **\r\nI absolutely adore this anime and one of the many reasons why I kept coming back to watch it is because of the way the story was told. The story isn't complex but rather very \"humble\" and \"human\", which in my opinion is what makes it great.\r\nHaikyuu!! is (obviously) about volleyball, but what made it interesting is the fact that Igot to see it from many different points of views be it from a spiker, a libero, a new player, etc. For example, I got to see what it feels like to be a coach, someone who, in the past, knows how it feels like to be a player on the court. The show got me to realize how much pressure they're in when they have to pick the right players and to not be distracted by pity or sympathy, but rather to focus on \"what's best for the team.\"\\n\\n\r\nSince the story follows Karasuno's team, all of the opposing teams can easily be seen as enemies. However, Haikyuu!! often reveals every team's back story, giving insights to their life which acts as a reminder that they're human, that they're more than just opponents; they, too, work and practice daily to get to where they are. I especially liked the episodes that were done in tribute to the teams that lost in the first day of Inter-High; they felt regret, sad and weak. The idea of, \"oh, it's already over?\" comes into play. The many hours of practice they've done, the many hours of pushing their bodies to the limit and aching only to lose on the very first day and to be done for the rest of the season. It's very hard to look down on them because, even though their amount of passion and dedication isn't as much as other teams, in the end, they got to play the sport that they like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, more than just the teamwork, more than just the hype of playing the game, Haikyuu!! tells of something with much more meaning.",

            "content": "As most have already said: this review will be pretty biased, because I LOVED this anime. I binged it in 5 days and put lots of life things on hold just to finish watching it (seriously - my room is a mess). I stayed up way past a proper bedtime just to get one more episode in every time, but it was worth it. \r\nI started Haikyuu!! with pretty low expectations. I knew most sang its praises, but 1) I don't like sports, and 2) I'm not a big fan of testosterone-fueled stories...which is exactly what most sportsball stuff is. There's just a lot of\"proving you're a man\" and other bullshit I don't care about. So I was worried Haikyuu!! would be everything I don't like in a story, but was willing to stick it out for at least 5 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn't even take 5 episodes for me to be hooked on the show. Just the first two episodes roped me in, and from then on I wasn't capable of stopping.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY // The story behind Haikyuu!! is fairly basic. There isn't this elaborate plot happening during games or practices. For the most part, it's pretty straight forward. However, the simplicity of the story is what makes it so much fun. There's more of a focus on the characters and how they become a team, and the lack of a complex story narrows the show's focus directly onto the matches, which are some of the most important moments. I think some sort of mystery or \"greater motive\" would ruin what makes this anime's story so fantastic. Haikyuu!! focuses on its characters and how they interact, and that's my weakness.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND // The art is fantastic, I love the music, and the sound effects are really well-done. They're also well-timed to pull the right emotions out of the viewer in prime moments. This is particularly clear during the matches when you're already on the edge of your seat as it is!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER // I loved every one of the characters. Hinata and Kageyama are my favorites, but the supporting cast is brilliant! Like Asahi, the gentle giant with amazing power, and Yuu, the fireball short stuff who's always cheering his teammates on and trying his hardest. Tanaka was one of my favorites for his personality and fierceness, and Tsukishima for his quiet sarcasm. But really, the team's dynamics and the various personalities in every character make it very hard to pick an absolute favorite. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT // I thoroughly enjoyed every episode, and I was on the edge of my seat during every match. I got chills, laughed out loud, smiled when they won, and was so proud what Kageyama and Hinata continued to shock everyone with their \"god-like\" quick. I finished this and immediately started season 2 because I needed more!\\n\\n\r\nI'm fairly certain this will remain in my top 5 favorite anime for some time. I loved everything about it and while that might sound biased, it's true. I can't think of a single problem area for me, and that makes it a masterpiece in my eyes. I definitely get why everyone has been rallying behind this series. It's also inspired me to give other sports anime a chance, so I can't wait!",

Yup it's about high school students playing volleyball. There are a lot of intense battles going on in this anime. Also, we can see how the team play together and their aspect in the game. This is not like Eyeshield 21, where the main character has exaggerated moves, where as in Haikyu, there are not a lot of exaggerated moves..very few are being used but that is okay..In my old school, we used to play volleyball and I thinkit is a boring sport because all we do is receive, no diving or rolling, no positions, techniques are boring, and plus if ball touched slightly through the net when serving, that counts as a point for other team..BUT in Haikyuu, I get to know more about volleyball, the techniques are awesome  and other stuff as well..\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8-\\n\r\nThe animation is okay...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9-\\n\r\nThe seiyuu is perfect, totally matches the character. Also the sound during in the game matches the movement and everything else. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10-\\n\r\nThis anime does a very good job in character development. Haikyu isn't just focus on one particular character, like Eyeshield 21 and other sport anime, it focused nearly all the teammates...We can see a lot of players  improve, like Yamaguchi, a pinch server, he used to be a weak player, but then becomes the important one...Also, we can see how other characters like Hinata, Kageyama, Tanaka, Noya, and ect practice and improve their skills during practice and put that into the Preliminary. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10-\\n\r\nI honestly enjoy this anime, I never skipped anything because its awesome. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10-\\n\r\nI know this is a terrible review because of my grammar, but this is all my thoughts on this amazing anime!\\n\\n",

            "content": "There comes a time when you've watched a few shows of the same genre that you unconsciously start to compare new shows to those that have come before them. Sports anime in particular is a hard genre to kick this habit, particularly because many of the same tropes are used throughout each show's plot. In Haikyuu's case, these comparisons actually raised the show up in my eyes as I watched this highly enjoyable spectacle do many of these tropes better than shows previous. \r\nKeep in mind that I have only seen a handful of sports anime in the five years I've been watching anime. ButHaikyuu does hit many of the same beats that Kuroko no Basuke does; as such I will be referencing that show to some extent throughout the review. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest hindrance of Haikyuu is the plot's predictability, as it does incorporate many familiar tropes of sports anime into its story. We have the underdog sports team hoping to claim national glory. We have the slightly weak new first year coupled with the prodigy first year. Training camps happen and the all important Inter High tournament comes up in the second half. All in all, the plot of Haikyuu proceeds in typical sports anime fashion and while the action is certainly captivating the outcome of certain matches can be all too predictable. Once you learn that there are two national tournaments a year in volleyball, those familiar with Kuroko no Basuke's plot can easily predict how the Karasuno team will fair in the Inter High tournament. . It\u2019s harsh to judge an anime like this on predictability because the beats it follows are the beats of sports anime, but it does detract a little from the drama when you can already predict the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, a major boon to the series is its action sequences. Beautifully animated and directed, the show pulls you right in as soon as the first serve flies and you're captivated for the rest of the match. The plays are fast paced and each serve is action packed with drama. Here in Haikyuu, while some plays are flashy, the show does a wonderful job in making you believe these plays could be done on the real world by real people. This is in contrast to Kuroko; while a wonderful show, throughout it I kept thinking to myself that no real person could actually pull off most of the plays the Generation of Miracles did. The show also does a superb job in explaining the basic rules of volleyball for those who, like me, have no experience with the sport.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also well done throughout. Though most of them are fairly one dimensional, its truly a marvel to watch these players come together on the court to form a functioning team. You can feel it when they are happy, excited, and sad. Kageyama is the only one who really has any development this season, but it is desperately needed because of the background he's coming from. All of the others have fairly hilarious personalities and their interactions with each other provide most of the comic relief. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I come to the art and sound. The soundtrack fades in fairly well with the action and quite good overall; the openings and endings are also decent. The voice acting is fantastic as well. The true gem though is the animation, which is overall very tight and well defined and frankly quite beautiful. The color palate is soft but the colors stand out well, especially brighter colors like Hinata's hair. The direction is simply superb, especially during action sequences. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this ride with Haikyuu has been a long one. I had it on hold for at least a year before picking it up again in preparation for the third season; this probably just says that the first half, like most sports anime, is fairly slow, but the action does pick up in later episodes. This was riding at a 9 for a long time because of the predictability, but the top notch direction in the later episodes as well as the ending melted my cold heart enough for me to say screw it and give this thing a 10. Truly a marvel and my favorite sports anime.",

What I like about this anime that separates it from others is that the team has a fair share of losses, the characters don't develop and gain skills instantly. And you can really feel the tension on the court.\r\nArt: 10 - Outstanding!!\r\nThe art was really well done, and there were those bits in the art that really showed how powerful a hit really was, how quickly the ball flew across the court, the emotion andalso just how hard they were trying. I loved the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't bad but compared to everything else in the anime, it lacked a bit. It missed a bit of OOMPH maybe the sound effects or something, I still don't know myself but it just sounded like it missed something.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 - Great!\\n\\n\r\nI liked all of the characters, the character development was good, and the characters didn't get crazy skills out of nowhere, it really shows just how much hard work and perseverance the characters put in to practice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 - Great!\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, I had so much adrenaline rushing through me while watching this anime, it really gets you going.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 - Great!\\n\\n\r\nIn general, Haikyuu is an amazing anime and I would recommend it to anyone. I really loved basically everything in this anime and will most likely watch it again.",

            "content": "I usually avoid sports anime and manga because they are all somewhat the same and become repetitive. If you have watched other sports anime, you will see nothing new when it comes to story progression, training and character growth, but you still find yourself rooting for the characters. Although Haikyuu!! follows this same rough formula, I was drawn into it from the start.\r\nVolleyball is not a sport that I give too much thought to when I think of interesting or fascinating sports. Before watching this, I don't think anyone normally would. Now, I have an appreciation for the game and the work that is involvedin playing. Like all sports, it requires discipline to practice and willpower to keep going in the face of defeat. This anime captures those elements well without ever really shoving it into your face. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character Hinata, is a short guy that is underestimated because of his height. Hinata's hero is known as the \"Little Giant,\" who is also short, but is the ace of his professional volleyball team. This gives Hinata the inspiration to overcome obstacles that a regular volleyball player wouldn't normally face. His main partner in crime is Kageyama. While extremely skilled, Kageyama's arrogance blinds him from knowing the true meaning of teamwork. The interactions between these two opposing forces are often an explosion waiting to happen, which is entertaining to watch, bringing smiles and laughs as it causes trouble for their own team and their opponents. \\n\\n\r\nOther iconic members are slow to join be it physically and/or mentally, making the story advance steadily and intelligently, which gave me an even greater incentive to see how the story will unfold. A good chunk of time is spent getting to know all of the members of the team, not just Hinata and Kageyama. Even more funny moments arise when the other members interact with each other in a heated, but comedic argument. Over time, as the team's gaps are filled, they grow in strength and settle any unfinished business and resolve any personal demons that made them reluctant to join the volleyball team. In other words, this anime treats the team like a team. Attention is given to all the members and you will understand why they are important.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the matches is when the anime really shines. A great deal of work is put into the animation and the facial expressions. The action tightens and intense moments are wonderfully crafted. Without using words to describe their emotions while the tension is high, any viewer can easily see how passionate the characters are while the volleyball is rocketing over the net. The sound is fluid and overlaps with the movements perfectly. The reason I love the matches the most is for the music. When the team is at its peak or is faced with a formidable opponent, the mood is not only set through the music, but also expertly instills emotion into you as you watch the match continue. Through the music, if the characters are standing at the top of the world, you will feel like you are as well, basking in the moment along with the rest of the Karasuno team. I found myself rewinding to replay the moments where the music enforces the intensity and found that the emotions that are given by watching are as powerful as the first time I saw it.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you do not like the sports genre, even if you do not like volleyball, Haikyuu!! may still be enjoyable for you. What makes it memorable are the music and the characters' interactions. If you seek a diverse and remarkable cast, each one with their own motivations, then you will no doubt appreciate this anime. Just like any family, they fight, but at the end of the day, they are a team.",
