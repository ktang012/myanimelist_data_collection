            "content": "First of all, I have seen the original FMA and although it was very popular and original, the pacing and conclusion did not sit too well with me. Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the original, this time sticking to the manga all the way through, but there were people who thought it would spoil the franchise. That myth should be dispelled, as there's only one word to describe this series - EPIC.\r\nI admit that as I've seen the original and read the manga, the pacing of Brotherhood seems to start off being VERY fast (I finally got used to the pacing afterwatching the first fifteen eps or so). Events that took up half a volume of the manga and had spread though a few episodes of the original anime were now shown in just a single episode. However, after trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who's new to FMA (not comparing it to the manga nor the original), I believe that the pacing works and it manages to tell an intriguing story effectively with little confusion. The plot is full of clever ideas and unpredictable twists that link various parts of the story together. By the final episode, all loose ends are neatly tied up and what's left is a hugely satisfying epilogue.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it's a bit simpler but that's just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we're familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main/supporting casts I've ever seen, and you'd probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that's forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers. \\n\\n\r\nFMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it's finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it's too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it's recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.",

            "content": "Adaptations have long been a thorn in the side of anime viewers, but not because they are inherently bad. No, the main problem has been that many studios have regarded the original work almost as an afterthought, and there are a number of shows that could have been wonderful if the writers had simply stuck to the original story.\r\nOne of the issues at hand seems to be ownership as producers, writers and directors all seem to want the work to be reflective of their style and perception, and in order to stamp their mark on a show they will makes numerous unnecessary changes or additions.Admittedly there are times when the adaptation supersedes the original work, but more often than not the result is at best a decent anime, and at worst utter twaddle.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the other side of the coin, where the anime adaptation sticks to the storyline set out in the original work. Normally one would expect these to be superior works, but in a strange irony this is not always the case. The problem with these types of adaptations is that the original work may not have been very good, or even have a suitable narrative, to begin with, and turning them into anime only seems to exacerbate their inherent flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the Full Metal Alchemist franchise manages to steer clear  almost all of these pitfalls. The problem is, there are no other anime that have so evenly split the viewing public's opinion between the two versions of the series. Unlike the 2003 adaptation, Brotherhood is a faithful representation of Arakawa Hiromu's hit manga, and while many fans of the franchise laud it as the best thing since sliced bread, there are a number who consider the original anime version to be the superior tale.\\n\\n\r\nBut we'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nMany people will already be familiar with the particulars of the story, and in a very real sense the common perception is well formed. Unfortunately, one of the problems with liking something too much is that one becomes blinded to its flaws, and while Brotherhood has very few noticeable ones where the narrative is concerned, this also serves to make them stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told in a very straight forward, no nonsense manner that is kind of refreshing given the penchant for filler episodes. The issue though, is that the content of the tale is much lighter in tone, much more typically \"shounen\" in its essence, than that of the first adaptation. One of the reasons for this is because the undercurrent of obsession amongst the main characters peters out towards the end of the story - a stark contrast to the ending in the first adaptation. Instead, these obsessive behaviours are effectively \"de-humanised\" by pushing them on to the non human characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a very clear sense that the plot is geared towards a more typical shounen standpoint and mentality, and while the whole still works very well as a story, one does have to wonder if the writers for the first adaptation didn't steal a march on Arakawa. It's possible that she had to change her idea of how the tale should develop because the first anime version took a much darker path than most other shounen franchises.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the ending allows for a degree of catharsis that was missing from the first adaptation, and although there are some broad similarities between the two versions at times, in truth they are as different as chalk and cheese. As an added bonus this series is far less dependent on random comedic moments, and the difference this makes to the flow of the plot is palpable when the two versions are directly compared.\\n\\n\r\nOne big advantage that Brotherhood has is that the seven year gap has allowed for improvements in various aspects of production, and it shows in a number of areas. The animation is more fluid than before, although admittedly the difference isn't really obvious at first and only really appears during large scale action set pieces. The character designs will be very familiar to any fan, but are subtly sharper and more defined than in the previous series.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, one of the biggest plus points for Brotherhood is actually its wealth of interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs one would expect, a number of the characters from the first adaptation appear in Brotherhood, but there are also several who are notable for their absence as they do no appear in the manga. Instead, a horde of new characters appear throughout the course of the series, many of whom have their own goals, ideals and personalities. Indeed the biggest difference between the two versions is the sheer number of people who all seem to have some impact on the story.\\n\\n\r\nFor much of the series Edward and Alphonse Elric behave in a manner that many who have watched the first adaptation will find familiar, and one of the nice things about this is that familiarity is used to very subtly develop the pair into very different characters. The change in their personas happens very gradually, but by the end of Brotherhood one can see just how much growth the pair has undergone.\\n\\n\r\nStrangely enough, the most interesting additions to the series are actually Yao Ling and Olivier Mira Armstrong (Alex Louis Armstrong's older sister - but without all the muscle flexing), two of the supporting roles. Yao Ling presents a strange dichotomy for the series to tackle, and while he doesn't develop as much as he possibly could have, this is offset by the moral and ethical dilemmas inherent in his situation towards the end of the series. On the other Olivier Armstrong possesses some of the strongest characterisation in the whole story, and while she is without doubt a major player at certain points of the show, what makes her interesting is the fact that the viewer is never quite sure of her goals.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a number of very strong characterisations in the series, but one of the things that is a little strange is the difference between the two versions where the homunculi are concerned. Unlike the first adaptation the homunculi in Brotherhood have very different origins, even though they still deal with similar obsessions. This raises an interesting perspective on the series as a whole, and is one of the reasons why Brotherhood is far more of a shounen tale than the original adaptation. The plot takes on a subtly lighter tone, even though it may not seem that way, once their origins are understood, and the main reason for this is the \"de-humanisation\" I mentioned earlier. The viewer is aware that these characters, though human-like in form, are not linked to humans in any way, and this awareness acts as a buffer so the viewer is less likely to question the actions and behaviour of the homunculi. In essence one is subjected to the ethos that monsters are evil and do bad things, which raises some interesting issues where Kimblee, Greed and the military's generals are concerned.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the acting is possibly the main reason why Brotherhood is able to pull off its feat of developing not only the familiar characters, but also the new additions. Paku Romi and Kugimiya Rie reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonse Elric, but with the exception of a few roles, the remaining cast are very different from the first outing. Now normally one might consider this a recipe for disaster, but it's a testament to the quality of not only the actor's abilities, but also the scriptwriters, that this series easily stands shoulder to shoulder with the original.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very well composed and produced, and the series has a surprisingly large number of opening and ending themes, especially for 64 episode series. That said, fans of Brotherhood may find themselves in a bit of a quandary, especially if they prefer the OPs and EDs from the first series. As for the sound effects, they are handled in a decidedly competent manner that makes one wonder why other shounen anime seem to have trouble in this department. Granted there are occasions when there's a bit of a cacophony, but in general the effects are clear, bold, and well choreographed.\\n\\n\r\nNow unlike most viewers, I actually consider Brotherhood to be equal to the first series, and I don't really fall on one side or another. Like a number of fans my preference is for the much darker tone of the first series, however the cathartic ending of Brotherhood, as well as the improvements in production and animation, go some way to balancing the scales. Some people prefer the somewhat darker nature to Ed's character from the first adaptation, but in all honesty the rationale behind the two versions is very different, and while they're broadly the same character, that perception is only really valid until the last few episodes of either show. The same principle applies to Alphonse, Roy Mustang, in fact to most of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Brotherhood is just as entertaining and involving as its predecessor, and it's a testament to Arakawa's skill as a mangaka that she has been able to produce a tale that, at the very least, rivals the original anime adaptation.Yes, Brotherhood is more typically shounen than the other version, but the nice thing about this is that fans are given two very good versions of the same story, and that is something rare in anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow if only all remakes, revisions or reboots could be this good.",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an immense amount of praise in the MAL community, is the #1 ranked show and is constantly referred to as a masterpiece and the greatest show ever created. I've seen many fans preach about how \"it lives up to the hype\" and \"can never receive too much praise\". Now this is just the opinion of one guy. I'm certainly not the law of the land or anything. However, I personally feel as though calling FMA:B a masterpiece and the champion of all shows is a bit of a stretch. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it or that itisn't a very solid addition to the ranks of notable shows; I really would like to preface this review by saying that I believe that FMA:B is a very good show and I wouldn't be nearly as harsh on it if it weren't for the God status the show has attained in America. I would happily remand \"greatest show ever made\" to \"greatest long-running shonen ever made if you haven't seen the 2011 Hunter X Hunter\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of the MAL categorical rating system, as I've mentioned in some of my previous reviews. I oftentimes outright ignore it. However, looking at the categories right now, I feel as though this is one instance where I can use it to talk about everything I want to so I'm going to use it.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe FMA:B plot and world-building are some of its strongest aspects. The world that it creates is an immersive, full-feeling thing with many animate pieces that move even when you aren't looking at them. It's an extremely creative world as well, adopting its own set of universal laws including alchemy through equivalent exchange, mind-body duality and its own interpretation of a higher power, and it sticks by these laws. Never once does the story contradict its own rules, instead using them in creative ways to build off of each other. The plot is also one of the most engaging parts of the show, unveiling itself at just the right pace to keep you interested whilst still keeping a few major cards to play at the very end. The pieces fall into place in a way that is satisfying because it simultaneously mind-blowing and obvious, and that's one of the marks of strong storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the FMA:B story is certainly one of the best I've seen, I find that I have to withhold my 10 score here on the grounds that its incredible direction and creativity are marred by some detrimental weaknesses. First of all, the exposition is handled extremely poorly. The first and third episodes feel like they're from some shitty cartoon network show, the show blatantly ignores the show-don't-tell rule in the entirety of its first chunk (with characters spelling out exactly what is happening and why it's happening) and its tendency to repeat important plot points over and over again quite frankly feels insulting to me as the audience as though the show is assuming I'm not able to pay attention or figure things out for myself and need to have the fact that Ed and Al committed the sin of human transmutation and lost their bodies told to me at least twenty-five times in the first two hours of show. Secondly, there's a period of time which I would probably refer to as the third fourth of the show (episodes 40-53ish) in which the show drags incredibly, adopting a typical battle-shonen approach of having characters engage in multiple-episode long one-on-one or two-on-one battles, giving them plenty of time to pose and stand off and monologue at each other. This isn't how fighting or war works, and these contrived battles really take away a lot of the climactic atmosphere. Finally, the show's ending is not nearly as satisfying as I wish it had been. The final few episodes are for the most part brilliant, but once the show plays all its cards and it's resolution time, it wraps itself up with cliches and in-your-face themes. \\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely astounding 80% of the time and absolutely horrid 20% of the time. Thus the 8 score. The action is all stunning, the openings gorgeous, the backgrounds consistent and unique, building a sense of a real lived-in world. The character designs are sometimes a little bland, but for the most part they are memorable and the homunculi look brilliant so I don't have any real complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I have a problem with is the obnoxious number of times that the show goes \"anime\" - reducing its characters to shittily-drawn caricatures and its animation to blocky, looped motion. Usually this is used during the shows attempts at humor, which I'll talk about later, but most of the time it was just extremely cringe-inducing and distracting, ruining the sense of continuity and immersion in this world. The show obviously wants you to take it seriously (it sure loves its drama) and when Al is portrayed as a big grey mound with a squiggle for a mouth it makes this difficult. There's a difference between having your character goof around and having the show itself goof around. It almost feels like a laugh-track, telling the audience \"this is the funny part!\"\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, however, the art is gorgeous. When it counts, it shines, and that's really what matters. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\\n\r\nUndeniably the strongest aspect of the show. I have no complaints whatsoever. The soundtrack is never distracting but always effective, the voice-actors (especially for Bradley and Al) absolutely nailed it and the openings and endings... dear lord. It's been said before, but the openings and endings to FMA:B are some of the very best ever made, both in sound and visuals. They tell small stories of their own. They set the tone for the episode and for their section of the show as a whole. I especially loved 'Golden Time Lover' and 'Chemistry', but I have to give special mention to SID's 'Rain'. As far as I'm concerned, that opening could have been the end of the show. It single-handedly established a sense of finality, a long-endured struggle of these characters and their causes. Everyone is portrayed as exhausted, weak and full of both despair and determination: protagonist and antagonist alike, fighting under the rain. Not for glory, not for honor, but just for the one thing they care most for. Personally, it made me extremely hyped for the final stretch of the show. It wasn't quite what we got, but at least we got some of it.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that there is an intense connection between a show's opening and the audience's willingness to appreciate it. It is very likely that the intensity of many fanbases is in part due to the ability that openings such as these have to maintain feelings in regards to the show, oftentimes perhaps even distorting or altering memories of the show itself into what the opening would have you believe the show was like rather than what it was actually like. Obvious examples that jump to mind are Sword Art Online's \"Courage\" and Guilty Crown's \"My Dearest\". Remember how those shows were absolutely nothing like that? No?? IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely call out the show's characters on being the weakest link and the most undeserving of the praise that the show receives. For starters, the writing is often clunky and awkward, but that's not the main issue. It's because most of them are not really characters: they're plot devices with one or two distinguishing traits tacked on. They're entirely predictable, not because they feel like real people but because they do the same things over and over again. Al talks about what he'll do when he gets his body back. Ed talks about how they'll find a way and how they will atone for their mistakes and etc. It's not that it's melodrama: it's the fact that it's the SAME melodrama over and over again. It wasn't until sometime past episode 30 that Ed stopped sounding perpetually like a broken record and started to feel as though he were actually developing, but even then he was really just defined by his arc and not by any amount of complexity.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the pitfall that so many of these characters fall into. If your character's only real traits beyond their development for the sake of the show are \"hates being called short\" and \"hates milk\" they're really more of a tool with some googly eyes stuck on to them. Other characters are even worse: Armstrong is manly. His sister is more manly. Mustang wants to be Fuhrer and avenge Hughes (he's even got this great relationship with Hawkeye that could have been seriously compelling if they ever had any real conversations about anything besides \"we must overthrow the government\" and \"Hughes!\" over and over again). Winry likes Ed and automail. Ling wants to be emperor. Now, FMA:B is a complex, busy show. I could understand if it didn't have the time to make these characters anything more than chess pieces for its grand and elaborate plot, giving them a few distinguishing traits because that's really all it can manage without dragging itself out immensely. But it DOES have the time: it has all the time it spends having Ed yell about being called short. It has all the time it spends having Armstrong pull of his shirt and yell about being manly. It has all the time it spends having Ed and Al talk about getting their goddamn bodies back over and fucking over again as though I would somehow manage to forget it. Ling passing out from lack of food. May fawning comically over Ed. Mustang is antisocial LOL. The same gags, over and over again, barely even rehashed in any original way. Not only do they become painful to watch, they devour all of the development that this shallow cast of characters could have had to make me actually invested in them. They're far too static, with most of them having a single change or revelation over the course of the show's 64 episodes in order to indicate that they have grown as a person. But a good character has so much more than that: what kind of music do these people listen to? Why? Who are their role models? Why? What books do they like? What are their favorite places to eat? What do they appreciate in the people they're close to?? What are their personal histories...\\n\\n\r\nOh wait, sorry! I didn't mean to ask that last one! Please, I take it back! NOOOOOOO...\\n\\n\r\nYeah so I forgot to mention something. Screw all that stuff about making these characters possess complex personalities, FMA:B has a better way to define them.\\n\\n\r\nTRAUMA\\n\\n\r\nEveryone who's remotely relevant has a traumatic backstory. It's a harsh world, sure. I get that. Here's the issue: people are introduced and then defined through their trauma. Now this isn't Angel Beats bad, where horrible things happen to perfectly innocent people for no reason. Most of the tragedy is partially a result of the decisions of the characters involved, and their resulting struggle is a combination of having to cope with the consequences and with themselves and their mistakes. However, this cannot be used as a SUBSTITUTE for character development. A supplement, sure, but I still remember in episode four when Ed and Al meet a state alchemist who literally introduces himself with something along the lines of \"my wife left me because we were too poor\" before he even tells them his goddamn NAME. Here, come on in! Take a seat! Would you like some sorrow pie or tragic backstory cake? We have plenty! Ed and Al's dad left, then their mom died, then they f*cking ripped their bodies apart. Winry's parents were murdered in cold blood. Mustang had to kill lots of people. Armstrong had to kill lots of people. Everyone had to kill lots of people. Scar watched everyone he loved get killed, and then had to kill lots of people. These are always the first things we find out about people, and then for the rest of the show they are defined almost exclusively by them. If anyone is overly happy and wholesome, it means something horrid is going to happen to them. It's basic emotional manipulation. Look at this adorable little girl and her dog! Dead. Look at this smiling, picturesque family! Husband dead. Dead. Everyone innocuously happy has to die or lose someone close to them. The more broken and internally conflicted you are, the safer you are. There's no need to pile more grief on Scar, so he's relatively safe.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the characters suffer from repeatable and preventable problems. They exist mainly to function as morals-in-a-bottle with gags tacked on to them. They're difficult to relate to, because all we know about them is whatever themes they embody and one or two dumb jokes. Ikuhara writes characters more personable than this, and his stories don't make sense on PURPOSE. I did give the characters a 6 though, and there are reasons for that.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, despite their lack of humanization the characters complete their tasks of being walking themes with relative effectiveness. This isn't anywhere near Log Horizon S1 bad. These characters are here for a reason, they represent something, and they represent those things well. Sure, they could have easily been better, but they fulfill their purpose and for that alone they are not failures. I will also give special mention to Scar, who, while still actively defined by his trauma was executed far more impressively than the other characters. This is probably in part because the show actually viewed him as morally ambiguous as opposed to just making the character FEEL morally ambiguous when there was really no doubt that the show wanted you to think this was a 'good guy' (*cough* Mustang)\\n\\n\r\nSecond off, there are some exceptions to the rule. Most of my complaints thusfar have been leveled at the shows protagonists. They are the ones that suffer from dismal repetition and blatant violation of show-don't-tell. Where the show does excel is with its antagonists. There are seven homunculi in the show, incarnations of the seven deadly sins, and they so utterly clobber their \"good-guy\" counterparts in terms of being engaging, personable subtle characters that it isn't even funny. Their intensive backstories are never shoved in your face, their apparent contradictions are given plenty of time to be uncovered by the viewer, and the deliciously ironic conclusions to their arcs are done tactfully. Many times I found myself actively routing for them because they were just so much more interesting and well-executed. I would happily watch an \"Adventures of the Homunculus\" spinoff cataloging the several hundred years most of them lived before the start of the series.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\\n\r\nI was constantly gripped by the plot. I actively looked forward to the openings and endings. The art was oftentimes orgasmic. The homunculi made me want to start looking for ingredients to make a philosopher's stone with. However, I was constantly frustrated by the show's apparent lack of respect for its viewers and by its absolutely abysmal humor. I've already said it, but I don't know if I've driven home just how infuriating it is to have exposition repeated to you over and f*cking over again and how cringe-inducing it is when somebody violates the show-don't-tell rule at extremely tense and crucial moments. It actively snapped me out of the experience whenever Ed and Al had a conversation about getting their bodies back after the 5th time it happened, and when God literally spelled out for Ed that he had discovered the meaning of life I facepalmed hard. That's not how you do themes, man. That just comes off as preachy. That's something the show suffered constantly from: it felt incredibly preachy. It's character's speeches about the answers they had found to their struggles felt much more pointed at the audience than at anyone in the show they were talking to, and that bothered the ever-loving crap out of me. And have I mentioned the humor? For every joke the show has that lands, it tries about five others that fall on their face. As I've already mentioned, they're repetitive and used as a substitute for meaningful character interactions and development. It seems as thought the show is trying to use them as a counterbalance for its immense amount of melodrama, but instead they end up just ripping apart the tone and stagnating the story. Despite these gripes, I did overall enjoy the experience and felt that the positives did inevitably outweigh the negatives so I will happily give it a 7 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7\\n\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not a masterpiece. It's a very respectable, unique, inspired and creative show and it's definitely a classic. I would happily recommend this to most people. However, don't go in with irrational expectations. It's enjoyable, it's engaging, it will definitely give you plenty to think about, but in my personal opinion it gets a little too much praise and a little too much hype. I probably would have enjoyed it more myself if I hadn't heard nothing but angelic worship for it before going into it. I formally apologize to any huge fans of the show that I may have offended: it's not by any means a bad show! I don't give out 7s all that lightly, believe me. This is merely an argument against FMA:B being the be-all-end-all of anime. Thanks for reading if you made it through that wall of text, and have a nice day!\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nFMA Brotherhood is an anime that needs no introduction. This is the highest rated anime on all of MAL. This is the anime that the current generation of anime fans holds above all others as the greatest single anime EVER made! In the following paragraphs, I will be reviewing this legendary series and discussing whether or not it truly deserves this title.\r\nSPOILERS for both Brotherhood and 2003 FMA!!!!\r\nPlot: \r\nThe plot takes place in the country of Armestris, which is basically like an alternate WW2 Germany. It is constantly at war for reasons that are less than just and is ruled by a rather nefarious government.What makes this world special is that alchemy is the primary science instead of the much less fun and flashy science of our own reality. Alchemy allows practitioners to transmute material into other useful material, and basically do all kinds of awesome stuff! Our heroes are the Elric brothers, who wish to find the legendary Philosopher's Stone and gain back their original bodies that they lost in a forbidden alchemy ritual gone horribly wrong. In order to search for the stone, they join the military. Unfortunately this means they have to serve under a rather evil government and face strong moral dilemmas. The Elric brothers don't wish to take part in the government's genocidal campaigns, but they need the military in order to accomplish their own personal goals. Of course, things are a bit more complicated by the fact that many in the military are actually good people and are either unaware of just how bad the government is, or feel remorse for their crimes and  wish to change the government. This is refreshing for a shonen series in which \"good and evil\" is too often clear cut. We have all seen Hollywood movies where the German Army is filled with nothing but pure evil monsters with zero humanity. As a side note, eventually Hollywood got MUCH better with treating the Germans this way... thanks to us ethnic Germans making up 40% of the US population, but Hollywood STILL treats the Russians and certain other groups this way! \\n\\n\r\nEventually, the Elric brothers uncover the frightening truth that the real leader behind the government is an ancient evil being called \"Father\" who uses his homunculus minions to due his bidding and wishes for ultimate knowledge and power! The Elric brothers also make many allies on their adventures including Scar, the Xingese, and Hohenheim, who all contribute in the fight against Father. The plot ultimately concludes with a very happy ending, which pleased fans far more than the bittersweet ending of the 2003 anime. It should also be noted that unlike the plot of the 2003 anime, FMA Brotherhood mostly stays faithful the Hiromu Arakawa's original manga.\\n\\n\r\nDifferences between 2003 FMA and Brotherhood:\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are many differences in the plot which I will get to, the most immediately obvious difference is in the tone of the series' narrative. The 2003 FMA has a VERY dark and somber tone throughout the series, which makes it really stand out as the oddball of the shonen world. FMA Brotherhood has tragic moments, but they are balanced out with zany comedy, more happy endings, and less emotional suffering in general. The tone in Brotherhood actually feels like you are watching a shonen anime like Naruto or One Piece. You know going in that there will be sad parts, but all will turn out well in the end. FMA 2003 feels closer to watching Berserk than it does to watching Naruto or One Piece! Whether a viewer prefers lighthearted shonen or brooding seinen is a matter of taste, but let us take a look at the subject matter being dealt with in this series. In both the 2003 FMA and Brotherhood, this is a series about German soldiers serving a genocidal regime and ultimately having to rebel against the government and try atone for their crimes. Does that sound like something that should be a fun, zany comedy? \"It is almost certain that we will fail. But how will future history judge the German people if not even a handful of men had the courage to put an end to that criminal?\" - Henning Von Tresckow. I can ASSURE you he didn't tell a stupid joke 20 seconds afterwards so that his listeners wouldn't feel sad about the deaths of 17 million civilians murdered by the Nazis as \"untermenschen\". Was the movie Das Boot a fun comedy? NO! Have you ever wondered why that is? The reason is that making a movie or series about German soldiers reflecting on mass genocide into a delightful romp is fucking stupid as hell! To think that people on MAL accuse Elfen Lied of having bad tone whiplash. FMA Brotherhood thematically achieves a mood whiplash other anime can only dream of.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to characters and plot differences. Firstly, lets talk about everyone's favorite FMA character, Roy Mustang. In FMA 2003, Roy is the one who murdered Winry's parents instead of Scar. Roy is also MUCH more affected by his guilt for having murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in the name of an evil government. In 2003 FMA, Roy actually tries to kill himself in a state of deep depression, but Hughes stops him and instead inspires him to live, so that one day he can overthrow and lead the government. Roy actually manages to kill Fuhrer Bradley and do what he had dreamed of for so long. However, he is too overwhelmed by the emotional stress to simply stay in the military and take a role of leadership like he does in Brotherhood. Roy retires to a simple life with Hawkeye instead and only uses his alchemy again in the movie Conquerors of Shamballa to save the people of Central. Roy is a MUCH more empathetic and truly human character in the original 2003 series. He is actually, truly effected by guilt and stress the way a real person that isn't a total sociopath would be. He doesn't just feel kind of bad for about 5 minutes, then move on. \"I killed those people under orders, I don't have to REALLY feel too bad about it.\" If the point is to make Roy a true military hero that reveals the full horrors of war and shows how even good men will commit evil deeds under orders, then the 2003 anime accomplishes this a LOT better than Brotherhood did!\\n\\n\r\nNow let's look at the Arab anti-hero Scar. In both series, Scar is a survivor of the Ishvalan genocide who is consumed with the desire for vengeance against the State Alchemists that slaughtered his people. In both series, Scar has an elder brother who violated Scar's Ishvalan religion and practiced alchemy, ultimately saving his life and giving him his special arm. However, in the 2003 anime we learn that Scar's brother violated a FAR more sacred law and tried to resurrect his dead lover with alchemy. This was of course a miserable failure that drove his brother mad with grief and furthered Scar's hatred of alchemy. This works better in terms of narrative, because it gives Scar even more reason to hate alchemy as violently as he does and view it as \"false\". It also better explains why Scar sympathized with Edward Elric, because he could tell he had lost his limbs in a human transmutation and was reminded of his own brother. In terms of objective \"writing 101\" and constructing a narrative, this extra back story from the 2003 anime was brilliant and felt far more complete than Brotherhood. Scar's end is also WAY better in the original 2003 anime. In Brotherhood, Scar fights his ultimate battle against Wrath, who was only the 3rd strongest homunculi, not the real mastermind behind the Ishvalan genocide, and had no real connection to Scar since they had never met. In the 2003 series, Scar fights his ultimate battle against the pure evil State Alchemist Zolf Kimblee, who murdered his brother and gave him his namesake scar. Which of these makes sense in terms of basic storytelling? Having a character's big fight be against a personal opponent where the struggle actually MEANS something, or have the fight be against a barely connected random character? It is sad that Scar has to die in the 2003 series, but his death is a heroic one and ultimately a much better written conclusion to his story. In Brotherhood, Scar somehow survives in order for a happier ending and we get a quick cameo of him working to rebuild Ishval. Scar is a flawed anti-hero consumed with a desire for revenge. In the original series, his tragic and heroic death makes the audience care a LOT more about him than Brotherhood does. Would it have been good storytelling in Lord of the Rings if Boromir for some reason survived, then we get a quick 2 sentences about how he is living happily in Gondor after the war? No. That would be really stupid and Tolkien being a good writer, realized that and gave Boromir a heroic death of penance that better closed his story.\\n\\n\r\nThere are WAY too many examples, so we will make our final one a comparison between Dante and Father. How can I even compare them? You are probably thinking right now. \"Dante is just a forgettable Filler Villain and Father is one of the greatest villains in anime history!\" The truth is that Father...isn't actually a very good villain. Remember that this is a story about an alternate WW2 Germany and a group of soldiers fighting against an evil government following a massive genocide. Adolf Hitler was not a nice man, but he WAS a human being. Dante is powerful, but ultimately just an ordinary human sociopath who wishes to sacrifice countless people she views as inferior to guarantee her own Godhood and immortality. I think that sounds a LOT closer to Hitler than a fucking ink blot genie from Ancient Persia looking for ultimate knowledge. If you are going to tell a story with OBVIOUS real world parallels, then STAY CONSISTENT! Government atrocities and genocides happen due to ordinary human leaders with extremely selfish desires, NOT evil genies! The Holocaust, Cambodian Genocide, Rwandan Genocide, and Armenian Genocide were not caused by Mr. Popo!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nFMA Brotherhood is a very well animated series and admittedly does look better in most places than the 2003 original. Is the animation enough to give it the title of greatest of all time? No. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for FMA Brotherhood is once again quite solid, but isn't even as good as the 2003 FMA OST, let alone worthy of the greatest of all time title! Just compare the main theme from the Brotherhood OST to the main theme Bratja from 2003 FMA. The main theme for Brotherhood is a fairly bland orchestral piece with some ominous chanting that sounds like a throw away extra from the Hellsing Ultimate soundtrack. The main theme from the 2003 FMA is a heartbreaking, beautiful song about an elder brother asking forgiveness from his younger brother. Bratja is WAY better than anything in Brotherhood without question! Compare the first opening theme of Brotherhood to the 1st opening of the 2003 series. The 2003 series has Ready Steady Go, one of the greatest openings in the history of anime. Brotherhood has an extremely forgettable opening that wouldn't rank in the top 500 anime openings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nFMA Brotherhood is a good anime overall, but it is ONLY a good anime. It isn't anywhere NEAR the greatest anime ever made! It is actually vastly inferior to the original 2003 FMA and even that wasn't the single greatest anime of all time, although a MUCH better candidate than Brotherhood. Of course the title of G.O.A.T. is a highly subjective and debatable matter, but there isn't a single category where Brotherhood REALLY outshines its competitors. Some people say Legend of the Galactic Heroes is the greatest of all time. I'm not going to say that LOTGH is an absolutely flawless work, because it isn't. However, it actually stays consistent in its tone with the heavy ideas and themes it presents. Brotherhood does not. Brotherhood is WAY closer to Elfen Lied than LOTGH in terms of keeping a consistent tone  to respect very dark and serious subject matters. LOTGH has an absolutely EPIC scope with hundreds of well written characters, maybe the most intricate politics in all of anime, and gets viewers to really think about real world problems and issues in terms of government, better than any other anime ever made. In other words, LOTGH actually DOES have areas where it clearly outshines its peers and therefore has a far more legitimate claim to the throne. Cowboy Bebop has almost without question the greatest original OST in anime history, is more accessible to non-anime fans than any other anime, and is an absolute blast from beginning to end. Once again, it has areas where it is clearly the best, so a more legitimate claim. Name just ONE thing that Brotherhood is the best at? Most tearjerking? nope. Best written? not even close. Most philosophical and complex? Hell no. Best art? nope. Best soundtrack? nope. It is solid around the board, but it isn't actually truly great at anything! I would therefore argue that Brotherhood is NOT the greatest of all time, is INSANELY overrated, and you are honestly much better off watching the 2003 FMA. I'm sorry if this review hurt any feelings. My job as a critic is to say what needs to be said.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Since I couldn't find any legitimate objective analysis in any of these fanboy reviews, I decided put my own review: \r\nHere's why FMA:B and it's Manga counterpart don't work:\r\nIt's just a disjointed piece of art. The initial premise of the narrative: two young siblings that horrifically lose their mother and parts of themselves is incredibly dark and powerfully poignant. Their journey to find the philosophers stone is one that's objectively adventurous but the endpoint is still inherently adult and sophisticatedly gritty; especially as it delves into the implications of bringing a dead person back to life early on in the series.\r\nSo why is it disjointed?Because there's a mistranslation of tonal nuance throughout the entire series. Now I don't mean stylistic aspects such as art style choices e.g. Chibi segments (because those are minuscule details in the grand scheme of storytelling devices), but rather the way they're implemented in the story. For example, one second we're dealing with the introspective reconciliation of human birth and how beautiful it is and the very next we drop it for side-gags just to transition into the next topic/character development. It just doesn't fit. It's formulaic. It's predictable storytelling at it's finest and it absolutely ruins the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a huge shame because the character development and dialogue in the series is exquisitely written (some of the best in any story I've ever seen); e.g. Edward's speech about his existential crisis provided a deep psychoanalytical view into his personality and character. This is amazing character development! However it actually lessens the impact of the narrative and my personal enjoyment of the series because it contrasts heavily with the tone of the series. Right down to the very commercial transitions with the quirky voice-over of the title; every little stylistic choice is presented as a complete antithesis to the themes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist should NOT be sugarcoated with a light-hearted aesthetic. This is something I'd hate to say in any other series because pretentiously \"dark and gritty\" series (*cough* Tokyo Ghoul *cough*) are the bane of my existence but this is the one exception. If the themes of the series are of complex adult issues, why is the tone appealing to childish humour and zany adventurous antics?\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, I totally understand why Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is considered one of the greatest Animes of all time because it is substantially provocative and extremely complex behind the aesthetics much like many other great Animes like One Piece, Hunter X Hunger, Cowboy Bebop and Dragon Ball.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, it just doesn't work from a narrative perspective because it feels disjointed and unfocused in the way it clashes with stylistic ambiguity. Through this loss of tone, the series becomes a chain of loose threads that are vaguely commentating on the overall themes of the narrative which is why I rated Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the Manga: 5/10.",

            "content": "Now, this is a prime example of how to adapt an manga into an anime the RIGHT way.  The original Fullmetal Alchemist, though well made and very popular, went into a downward spiral as soon as it diverted from the manga storyline and never seemed to recover.  This however, shows that instead of trying to add their own story elements when adapting manga/visual novels etc., sometimes anime producers should just sit back and retell the great story that has already been written in the original.\r\nThis anime starts off at a breakneck pace.  It shoots entire volumes of the manga in a coupleof episodes.  It was to be expected though, as Bones is trying to fit 100+ chapters of manga into a 1-year long series.  However, once you get used to it the pacing seems very appropriate for the series and only seems to increase the suspense.  While small elements have been omitted from the manga, these are mainly non-essential and have no impact on the story.  Yet while many of these omitted elements are comedic in nature, Brotherhood still manages to switch between seriousness and comedy so fast you'll get whiplash.  I quite enjoyed this particularly as a sort of trademark of the series.  The actual plot-line twists and turns in unexpected ways and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the climax grips you like no other.  Many disregard the plot as being generically shonen, but it is these twists and its exploration into the psyche and motivation of the characters that propel it past this \"generic shonen\" label.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is of a different style to the original FMA.  It is a little simpler, and comedic scenes sometimes even stray into an outright chibi style, but this is by no means a bad thing.  If anything it is closer to the the style that Hiromu Arakawa draws with in the manga.  What its lacking in detail, it makes up for with first-class fight sequences (as to be expected of Bones).  The animation overall is quite polished and character movements are very fluid and natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters on both sides really caught my attention as one of this series' strengths.  It boasts a diverse range of characters, all of which have considerable substance and a distinct purpose in the storyline.  The Homunculi especially turn out to be completely different from the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, and more awesome in my opinion.  Edward and Alphonse are still the main focus of the story as they quest to find the Philosophers' Stone and restore their bodies, but now Winry also takes a more central role along with Ed and Al's father, Hohenheim.  There is also a host of new characters which didn't feature in the first anime adaptation, including a few from the mysterious country Xing and a new main villain.  Being completely faithful to the manga, all the characters' separate journeys and origins are told in much greater detail.  Each character's values and beliefs are tested almost to breaking point as the story reaches its later stages, providing a somewhat surprising and refreshing depth to the cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I initially disliked about this series was the soundtrack, which lacked substance and was very repetitive.  The first opening was brilliant, one of the best I have seen, but the background music was lacklustre.  However, as the series went on more music was added and the soundtrack began to add a great atmosphere to fight scenes and dialogue alike.  The voice actors also really show their ability throughout the series and seem very well suited to their roles.  With such an all-star cast of voice-actors you wouldn't expect any less.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Bones has done an awesome job surpassing its previous effort and faithfully retelling the Fullmetal Alchemist manga.  Enjoyment wise, you'd be hard pressed to find a shonen anime that will entertain you as much as FMA Brotherhood.  Truly a great anime, there's no other way to describe it.  A must-see for people new to anime and hardened otakus alike.  Overall score: 9.4/10 (rounded to 9).",

Ever since its release, fans and critics alike have a mixed reaction to the show. Some of them say that the original show is better while others say this is better. I can't see why we can't like both. They each have things that really work about them. I think they are both masterpieces on a entertainment and artistic level. Some moments in the show will make you laugh, then the next question life, and thencry your eyes out. Some moments in the show are just plain beautiful from the characters, animation, and the really touching moments. There are moments were some of the characters you get attached to die. (Not going to tell what characters because of spoilers, obviously.) A character will get super depressed, and one even almost goes insane. All of these characters express real human emotions unlike some other anime which they express one key emotion. The emotional scenes aren't forced, they have a really big impact on you as a person. You'll start to relate to every character and even question life. Some examples being \"What is the truth?\" or \"Could humans play the role of god?\" That's why I love this show so much.

Anyway the end to this anime is one of the best endings I've ever seen in an anime. It was very beautiful and touching. This review is suppose to be spoiler free (In most cases.) So I can't tell you my thoughts of the ending. If you want more in detail of the ending, just ask me. Anyway, I can't talk about much about the story without repeating myself, so let's go to the art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 10/10 Standout(s) The animation\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell that they had a huge budget just by looking at a character. It was very solid and very easy on the eyes. This really shines in the well animated action scenes. They were just plain epic! What I didn't explain in full detail in my review of the original was the character designs. I didn't give enough praise for them, I just said they were creative and expressive, that was it. You can tell which character is who at first glance. That's a really hard thing to do for a 64 episode anime, but this show pulls it off very well. The character's have there own unique features that stand out among the rest. Now let's go to the sound.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 Standout(s) The dub\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack really fit in with the anime. I mostly loved the music they played in the action scenes or when there was something bad going on. I found it very unique and weirdly fit with the tension of a scene. For the dub, most people consider it one of the best dubs out there and I don't blame them. The only difference between the dub for the original and the dub for this was Al's actor. Al's original actor, Aaron Dismuke, had too deep of a voice to play Al anymore. So they got Maxey Whitehead to play him. So was Maxey good as Al? She did a fantastic job in my eyes. When I saw the first episode, I thought that was the original actor. That's how good her performance was. If you want me to go in depth about the dub, read my review of the original. Now the one you've all been waiting for, the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 Standout(s) Every single one of them\\n\\n\r\nThis is my favorite character cast in any anime. They were all very entertaining in their own little way. If you want to hear me talk about Ed and Al, read my review of the original show. Let's just talk about Roy Mustang and Maes Hughes.\\n\\n\r\nRoy Mustang:\\n\\n\r\nOn the outside, Roy seems like the calm, collected, and cool guy. On the inside he values the lives of his comrades like Riza Hawkeye and Maes Hughes. If one of them were to die, he would just be sad for the rest of his life. He also has a temper that sometimes gets the best of him. This is a guy you don't want to mess with. He'll burn you to death with his flame alchemy. What makes Roy such a good character is that he'll protect those he values with all his heart. He does have a few weaknesses too, you can't have a good character without his or her faults. Like I said, his temper and the fact that if you were to kill one of his friends, he would vow to kill you no matter what and won't forgive you. He doesn't forgive his enemies that easily. Overall, Roy is defiantly one of the best characters in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMaes Hughes:\\n\\n\r\nHughes may seem like the comic relief when you first meet him, but he has more of a personality then that. He is kind, outgoing, and an overall funny person! It's kind of weird how him and Roy get along so well. Hughes is more fun and loud while Roy is more calm and collected. He loves so many people and almost doesn't hate anyone. He loves his daughter and his wife. There's even a few jokes about them in some of the episodes. It feels like his family is the military, his real family, and the Elric brothers. He made a huge impact on the audience for reasons I won't spoil. Overall, a fun guy and a great character!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPeople who will love this show: Everyone, especially fans of the manga.\\n\r\nPeople who won't like this show: I don't know who wouldn't like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPositives: Everything\\n\r\nNegatives: None\\n\\n\r\nThis is defiantly one of the best animated shows of all time. It's amazing how many things you'll learn in this anime. It taught me all sorts of things about life. I am in love with this series. Great anime and deserves a 10 from everyone. So watch it if you haven't.",

            "content": "This review is only meant for those who haven't seen the original anime version of Fullmetal Alchemist. \r\nWhat can I say about this show? I never even tried to follow the original anime.. I knew it was a big success and has a lot of followers everywhere. But it just didn't catch onto me like it did with so many others. With this renewed version, which follows the manga storyline a lot more precise than the first version, the team behind FMA: Brotherhood did a fantastic job. \r\nThe characters are instantly attractive.. what I mean with that is they are very well portrayed as people,unlike so many other anime shows. The story is also instantly compelling.. it drops you right into the world of FMA and does a thorough job of explaining to you how things work. And as far as I've seen, the story never gets repetitive or old. As soon as you finish one episode.. you'll force yourself to watch the next. \\n\r\nThe voice actors are another major plus. The sheer talent of many of them is just unbelievable. I especially liked the fact that the voice actor who did (among others) Kira/Yagami Light's voice in Death Note, Mamoru Miyano. Does the voice for Ling Yao, which makes his character even more intriguing. \\n\r\nIf FMA Brotherhood keeps up this kind of pace, quality and plot development, then I'm definitely going to add it to my 'All-time-favourite-anime' list. \\n\r\nA must see!",

            "content": "If one wishes to obtain something, something of equal value must be given, that is the law of equivalent exchange, the basis of all alchemy, the law that governs the world of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.\r\nBrotherhood follows the adventures of brothers Edward and Alphonse elric , who have commited taboo and tried to transmutate their mother back from the dead. As a result alphonse is left without his body and stuck to a metal armor and ed with a metal arm and a leg  thus the nickname fullmetal. Thus the two brothers embark on a quest to find the famous philosopher's Stone that is saidto allow alchemists to ignore the law of equivalent exchange and help them get their bodies back. I will not go into more details because it will spoil the wonderfull story of the anime. Anyway let's get started. \\n\\n\r\nAs opposed to it's 2003 counterpart  Brotherhood does not have filler episodes or sidestories, the manga being almost finished at the time the anime started. There were a few ovas and specials that came out towards the animes end or after it had finished but I am not counting those.But I have to say they managed to strike a perfect balance. Since it had all the source material it needed the anime does not feel stale,I think it goes on  at a great pace  and it manages to strike a perfect balance between fights, serious moments, light hearted ones . But if you are a big fan of the 2003 anime you might find this a bit too fast as some of the characters lack the development they had in the first series and you might not feel as attached to them as you were back then. Though personally I loved the pacing, as I never got bored and I got entangled in a wonderfull story that just kept dragging me in.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has greatly improved over its predecessor and even now it's way above your usual animes. The facial expressions are great and the battles, oh man they are going to give you a boner, even if you're a girl. Trust me. Though some people might be set off a bit by the fact that the animation style seems to change from battle to battle, but I think that increases it's quality as very rarely you will have the same two characters battling each-other thus each battle seems unique and fresh. I especially enjoy the ones that involve Wrath as man he is a beast.\\n\r\nThe sound is great. I have watched the anime in jappanese thus that is the sound version I shall review.Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonnes and deliver a top quallity performance yet again, but the rest of the cast is not going to let you down either as you can feel they actually enjoy voice acting these characters and that they give their all in their performance. Also I swear to god all the openings and endings are epic. I have all those songs on my playlist at the moment since god they are awesome and fit the show perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nI also like the fact they Brotherhood doesn't do something a lot of anime do and by that I mean they do not spoil what will happen in the anime with the intro or outro because they are all custom made and not just scenes picked up from the anime to show off.\\n\\n\r\nNow the greatest strength of the anime are its characters. The original series mostly explored just the two protagonists Edward and Al, but brotherhood manages to show off almost any character they introduce, their motives and their dreams. For example Roy Mustang and his dream to become the next Fuhrer to protect all his comrades or scar's dream first of revenge and later of change. As I said earlier some might characters might feel a bit rushed because of the fast pace of the anime (I'm looking at you hughes and nina) but I assure you it does not draw back from the story one bit as they still somehow fullfill their role.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime lacks a bit in the replay value, as you wil already know all the big reveals which will probably detract a little from the overall enjoyment  for some, but I watched it multiple times (around once every one and a half years) and I found it refreshing most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso if you want to watch the 2003 series you should do it before you watch Brotherhood for one simple reason. The 2003 anime is also a very solid addition to one's library but Brotherhood is the superior version in all areas and you might not enjoy the 2003 version as much if you watch it after brotherhood. Though if you watch the new series after the 2003 one you will definetly still enjoy it as much, if not even more,  as opposed to watching it first.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this will always be one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever watched, excelling in all areas with a very compelling story line, complex characters, astonishing art and epic soundtracks. I wholeheartedly recommend you go watch it right now, it is a classic and a must see for any anime enthusiast out there.",

            "content": "One of my favorite anime of all time!\r\nI was one of those people who thought that FMA: Brotherhood is the second season of Fullmetal Alchemist (2003). FMA Brotherhood has been popping up in Best Anime Lists on Youtube so it piqued my interest.\r\nIt follows, or rather it is more parallel with the story in the manga. The art and animation is magnificent, it stayed true to the characters' design but there was a more polished look. The fluidity of the movements during fight scenes are also a feast for the eyes.\r\nI could not find a single flaw in this series (except I that I wantedmore episodes). The characters were all wonderfully written. It's hard to create secondary characters that are as strong as the main ones when it comes to viewers' attachments. \\n\\n\r\nI found myself falling in love with these amazing characters while I was watching FMAB. It didn't matter if the characters were only shown for one episode, I'm looking at you Nina and Alexander. What mattered was the impact those characters gave. (Like a sledge hammer to the heart)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the story, it's hard to find words to describe FMAB's story. The only thing I can think of is that it's magnificent. It's funny, action packed, mysterious heart wrenching and beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those anime that will leave you feeling empty after you finish it. And I mean that in a good way. I've invested so much emotions in this story, in these characters that when it's finally over it left me feeling lost. That is how amazing this is and I'm not just saying that. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is quite a masterpiece in my opinion.",

            "content": "I'll start this by saying that despite being an adamant fan of Fullmetal Alchemist for a couple of years now, I've never managed to finish the first anime series. I've remained caught up with the manga as much as possible, however, and I'm very excited at where this series is going to go.\r\nFullmetal Alchemist, as I'm sure you know, is the story of the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse. Their story begins a number of years before the actual start of the series, with the tragic death of the boys' mother. Edward and Alphonse, child prodigy alchemists at the time, form a pact to resurrecther. Extensive alchemical training finally culminates in the most important experiment of their lives; the forbidden practice of Necromancy. But something goes wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEdward is forced to stare in horror as his brother is decomposed before his eyes. He is then whisked away to a mysterious location, where a strange entity reveals to him what the experiment lacked; the Philosopher's Stone. Edward is then returned to his home, where he discovers his brother still missing and his own leg gone. In an act of desperation, he sacrifices his own arm in order to preserve his brother's soul into a suit of armor. Events thereafter eventually culminate in a new mission for the Elrics; to procure the Philosopher's Stone and use it to recreate their own bodies.\\n\\n\r\nSounds like heavy stuff, right?\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this series is that it manages to provide some great humor that actually fits quite nicely into its overall dark premise. There are some definite lighthearted moments, but never at the cost of plot, and they never take away from the genuinely touching or tragic scenes. The story itself is very enjoyable, and tends to explore some very deep themes, such as the ethics of resurrecting the dead and the effects of war on individuals and societies.\\n\\n\r\nStoryline aside, this series is visually stunning. Every cell of animation is detailed enough to almost seem like live action, and the characters themselves, based closely on manga author Hiromu Arakawa's original designs, are positively beautiful in motion. Some may be slightly bothered by the atypical face structures, but I find that they range between unnoticeable and and an improvement over the original series'. The movement is fluid and natural to the point that the opening alone should be enough for any animation enthusiast to be satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very entertaining. The very best, as I can assure you from following the manga, are a bit down the road, but the cast as of two episodes in are more than enough to tide anyone over. Roy Mustang is the perfect blend of snarky and serious, with a bit of eccentricity thrown in that any fans of the original anime series should be well familiar with (Tiny Miniskirts will almost assuredly make an appearance in this series once more,) and Edward Elric's familiar short temper, large ego, comedic frustration and occasional moments of genuine caring blend together in what is shaping up to be even better than last time.\\n\\n\r\nOne interesting thing about this series is the very first episode. It chronicles the events of an incident in central involving Isaac McDougal, a State Alchemist turned rebel after the Ishbal War, also known as Isaac the Freezer for his water-based alchemy specialty. This was never a part of the original Manga, and indeed only invented to keep audiences from experiencing Deja Vu from the first series. However, it is of such high quality and entertainment value that calling it filler would be downright unfair. It sets the stage for the rest of the series wonderfully and lets you know right away that you're in for a wild ride.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this is a series to stick with. It's already fantastic, and I can assure those of you who have never read the manga that it only goes up from here. A definite 10/10.",

Now this is a spectacular adaptation worthy of the manga; this is the epitome of a masterpiece anime. The series is just the right length; the storyline never drags, or falters. Although FMA:BH is strung together with an incredible strong plot, the characters are the real highlights of the series; the majority of the cast is thoroughly fully fleshed out with dilemmas worthy of our attention. And while author places nearly all major characters in perilous decisions, and theyoftentimes follow through with these heinous choices, one cannot help but offer up sympathy to these fictional characters. There were many times where I frowned upon some of their judgement, but I often found myself contemplating: Could I have made a better decision if I were in their shoes?\\n\\n\r\nThe Elric brothers are amazing protagonists to follow in this splendid coming-of-age story. In the end, many of my values in regards to adults, decisions, and moral choices were uprooted, and I find myself realizing that more and more, life is less black and white, but moreso filled with shades of grey.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely watch this series. Might I add, some of the soundtrack borrows from classical pieces such as Chopin's Etude Op.10 No.3, which only made the emotional scenes hit me *that* much harder.",

            "content": "There isn't much more I could say with all the praise it already has, but I truly believe that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood deserves every bit of it.\r\nThe pacing is phenomenal; filler is minimal to nonexistent and every episode serves as another step forward. I know a few people who thought that the first few episodes were not explanatory enough, but one of the great things about it is its lack of unnecessarily long narratives; it gives you just enough background information without petulantly walking you through it.\r\nFMAB is also one of the only anime that I prefer the dubbed version over the subbed. The voiceactors are fit fantastically in their roles, and the openings and endings were, for the most part, great. The animation was gorgeous as well, especially in action shots.\\n\\n\r\nBut I think the most important thing to be taken into account is the plot and characters. At its center, FMAB is about two brothers who have just enough flaws for you to emotionally connect with them, but not so many that it crosses the boundary into overly annoying. The length (64 episodes) allows for steady character development, whether it be for the better or worse. Even the villains have some sort of depth without making it seem like a rushed pity backstory. It can sometimes have crass humor (which serves surprisingly well as comic relief), but it is also harshly realistic; good people die and there isn't always a good reason for it.\\n\\n\r\nSo go watch it! I hope you'll love it as much as I do.",

            "content": "\"You have to believe in yourself. Because if you don't believe in yourself, you will not only bring down yourself, but also many others that believe you and depend on you.\"\r\nIt may not be a quote directly cited from the series, but it is one of the things this series has taught me. This show was great from start to end, and despite knowing some spoilers beforehand, it still delivered to a 10 out of 10 rating - something that's not usually happening for a shonen anime because they tend to overuse a certain trope.\r\nTo kick off, I have been fairly reluctant to watch FullmetalAlchemist: Brotherhood, because I have already seen the first series before the remake happened, and I was afraid that half of the anime would be the same as season 1, but since I heard it had rave reviews, I have put it in the corner of my plan to watch list anyway. Some long time after that, I heard the threat that many anime sites are going to be shut down, and I panicked by mass-watching anime and reading manga. Fullmetal Alchemist was one of the anime I started to watch during that period.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was admittedly a little predictable. But that might have been because I saw the first season, and a few spoilers on what happens ahead, or it might have not been. Despite the fair predictability, the anime has still delivered a great dose of tension, drama, fun, light-hearted moments to not make me burst out in tears from the heavy dramatic ones, and also action - thus I believe majority of the viewers would enjoy. If anyone is discouraged by the 64 episodes, just start slowly, you'll notice it will consume you in no time, because this anime is one of the few that are neither rushed or way too slow-paced.\\n\\n\r\nSome people say D.Gray-man sneaks around seinen territory, but not nearly as much as this anime. The plot gets into a fairly dark theme at times, sometimes even gets slightly into political matters...  and the art matches it well. The colors are not very vibrant, which might have taken a toll on the character designs - then again, this toll has made the characters even more believable and gave distinctive features to them and their descendants.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack matches the mood of the anime in all possible moments. Violin is used for several melodies of the soundtrack, which make a perfect match for the dark theme of the anime. As for the openings and endings, they consist of catchy songs, which serve as a great introduction/outro of the episodes. I also have no remarks to the seiyuus, as they did a fairly well job to match the characters' profile.\\n\\n\r\nWith matching art and matching voice actors, it is possible to admit the fact that the profile of the characters is constructed to be fairly believable - they have their ups and downs, and it is possible to tell where the characters \"got that attitude from\". Their reactions are also believable; they do not overreact as much as it happens on other anime of this genre. I would cite a few examples, but I'd prefer to avoid any spoilers so you see that for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that overall, Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood was a very captivating and enjoyable show, captivating me enough to take much breaks than most anime I have watched. I believe the masterpiece rating is indeed deserved for this one, although I wouldn't quite recommend it for starting audiences, as it would make their expectations of other anime series too high... then again I'm just kidding! You probably won't regret watching this one whatever audience you are from, but I can't tell you that for sure - you'll have to see for yourself.",

            "content": "I'm going to be completely honest here... this is my favorite anime I have ever seen. Why you ask? Simple: (besides a few irritations) there is nothing wrong with this show.\r\nThe story follows two brothers who live in a corrupted country in a world where alchemy is possible. After their mother dies, they try to perform the ultimate taboo of alchemy: human transmutation. The transmutation backfires and the younger brother (Al) loses his entire body and the older brother (Ed) loses his left leg. In order to bring Al back, Ed sacrifices his right arm to bond Al's spirit to a suit of armor. Now,with Ed having a mechanical arm and leg, and Al having a suit of armor for a body, they are willing to join the corrupted military in order to find a way to bring each others bodies back to their original form. Now tell me that story doesn't seem awesome to you? Story: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is simply fantastic. Since FMA:B is considered to be on the more \"shounen\" side of anime, animation is key to it's success. And, boy did they hit the nail on the head with the beautiful animation. Art: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is absolutely amazing! FMA:B has arguably the best dubs ever made. It is one of the rare instances where the dub is just as good as the sub, so watch it either way! As for the sound track? Oh my gawd... you haven't experienced true awesomeness until you've heard FMA:B's main theme! Not to mention that every single opening is absolutely breathtaking. Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that makes FMA:B so awesome is that everyone has a purpose behind their actions, and there is no such thing as a \"dull\" character in this anime. Even the biggest antagonist have a goal they are trying to accomplish, making even the biggest villains lovable. Characters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is never a dull moment in FMA:B where they just sit around doing nothing. There are rarely ever any filler episodes (if any at all), leaving the show to become full of wonderful twists and turns that will drag you in right away. Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDoes FMA:B have some flaws? Yeah, I guess. However, most of these flaws don't exactly work against the show as a whole. One of FMA:B's biggest flaw is the first ten or so episodes. It's not that they aren't interesting (trust me, they are) but rather they often can't tell when to be serious. However, even this flaw is something that anyone can look past, since the show itself is so enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nTo recap, FMA:B is nothing short of a masterpiece. The story is touching and sends a meaningful message. The art is breathtaking, and makes the action scenes that much more awesome. The soundtrack is a masterpiece in itself, and the dub is critically acclaimed as one of the best dubs ever. All the characters have so much depth that it's impossible to hate a single character of this anime. Finally, the anime was just flat out enjoyable from start to finish, grabbing the viewers attention from episode 1 and becoming more and more interesting as the show progresses. Overall: 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Ah, Fullmetal Alchemist, what an amazing ride through the world of alchemy, I'm not surprised at all it is #1 on MAL, since it also is, and probably will be, at least for a long time, #1 on my list.\r\n If you're reading you probably came here looking to see if you should watch this anime or if my opinion is the same as yours, and please do not forget what this is, MY review.\r\nLet us start with the best: The story - 10/10\r\nFullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood's plot is the most incredible thing I have seen in an anime, seriously, If i could, I would go andmeet Hiromu Arakawa and thank her for having an amazing imagination and ability to create and draw this masterpiece. You may be thinking \"Another fanboy, better find a real review\", and well, maybe you're right, but I have to praise what deserves to be praised, and this certaninly does.\\n\r\n Sure you can say the first episodes were a bit rushed, but wouldn't people still complain if they had slowed it down instead? For me the pacing of the story felt natural and that they did not need to waste the beginning of the series explaining the story since it is slowly explained as the anime progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art - 10/10\\n\r\nSometimes an anime can feel a little off when the art style does not please our eyes, even though the story is actually good, but this is definitely not the case. The art style is really enjoyable and I just loved those round faces!\\n\r\nThe fight scene, don't even get me started! The animation is gorgeous and Bones sure knows how to deliver well-animated fights with amazing angles and details that really make the watcher enjoy what the're watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound - 10/10\\n\r\nI can tell you this: I have every opening on my cellphone and I regularly listen to the ending songs and background music when I feel like listening to those serene and beautiful soundtracks or the epic songs from the  several fight scenes. The voice actors did an amazing job with every single character, and even though I did not watch the dubbed version, I did watch a couple of bits on youtube, and it sounded pretty well too. I don't think there's much else to say here, top notch as always.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters - 10/10\\n\r\nThe second best thing about Fullmetal Alchemist is it's characters. Every single character has a completely different personality and exceptional development, each one having their different reasons to act the way they do.\\n\r\nEven the villains are awesome, with their dark stories and troubled personalities that make our heros' journey be long and troublesome. It also has the best main villain of all time from any anime I've seen so far, that's a +1 right there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - In case it's not obvious by now, 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed every single episode from this amazing series which left me sitting on the edge of my seat with all the plot-twists and cliffhangers that followed the previous one, that with the awesome animation quality by Bones, beautiful soundtracks and lots of relatable characters with funny, troubled, brave and heartwarming personalities.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience that managed to surpass it's other version's \"awesomness\" and show us what anime truly is about, and that's how it managed to reach my #1 spot, truly a masterpiece that won't be forgotten anytime soon, at least by me it won't. :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Heart filled moments just hit you like a damn bus. 10\r\nArt: Oh my god the art is great. I am sure there were some flaws, because there are flaws in everything, but honestly if there were flaws I never caught them. Thecharacter design is great, but even just the scenery is fantastic. 10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The ost for this show is perfect. The voice acting for it is also perfect. I don't think I have watched another anime where I love the Japanese voices and the English. Fantastic job from everyone. 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh my god again perfection. The characters are all great. You basically grow up with Ed, and Al. There physical, and mental transitions are so subtle that you really feel like you are watching them grow. Some anime have time skips where they just skip like seven years and then just throw you in, but not This anime you watch them grow it is amazing. 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: My enjoyment is through the roof. FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece that I think is going to stand the fates of time well. I was never bored like I am with some anime. I was always hooked. My enjoyment and overall score are both 10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched this series I really really really recommend you dive in, and just let it hit you all at once.",

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) is not exactly like them. It is not the usual 'go on an adventure' type with dozens of episodes and fight scenes that all look the same. FMAB is more story-oriented and tactical.\r\nFirst, the story is very well wtitten and everything is properly planned out and coincides with each other bringing out every element in the right manner at the right time. The concept is really good with theright blend of fantasy and reality.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the brothers are the focus of the show, each and every character has a role to play and help develop the story accordingly and develop themselves as well. This keeps the viewers alive to every character.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are soo cool. You would love atleast 4 of 'em.\\n\r\nI am not bothered by animation/art, but it is really good though.\\n\r\nI also liked the fact that there were some great statements and quotes about life, you know.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, FMAB is one hilarious anime!! Then a little bit of drama and a little bit of a romance here and there gives it a proper outfit. I could recommend any type of person to watch this anime. For me it has become one of the classics\\n\r\nI saw this show when I was small and liked it instantly. Because I didn't see it properly I saw it again, and boy, was I glad I did! I loved every bit of it. Now I wouldn't say it doesn't have flaws, but why be a nit-picker when it is so enjoyable. No anime is perfect to everyone's mark afterall, eh",

There was some mind rape-type feelings when I watched it the first time through, though I forgot why. Lots of interesting twists, at least if you haven't had it partially spoiled for you. \r\nOverall score: 10\r\nArt- Mostly great, but I feel they only really took it up to 10 for fight scenes, while the other parts are not as fantastic, but still decent. As far as gore goes, this may or may have not been worse than Elfen Lied, andI've only seen clips of that, so... that's a plus I guess, but nothing will make me more grossed out than Naruto Shippuden, so not enough organs being torn out of living  bodies is what I guess I'm saying. A lot of other kinds nastiness though, like the faces of half-dead souls in limbo, bodies, gory scenes of a guy making heads essplode with no head but plenty of blood, and a LOT of failed scientific experiments. A LOT. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 9\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- Incredible breathtaking soundtrack, great Dub and Sub voice actors, and the sound effects weren't so bad that you could tell they were fake, so...\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Very interesting ones. Multiple psychos on both sides, rather complex and very simple personalities, Original character designs, interesting naming, and both hilarious and not-very-hilarious flaws for each of them. Not a giant, in-your-face amount of character development in the main cast, but they didn't need that much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: No questions asked. This is one of the best anime ever. I loved it. It was funny, It was sad. It had a little romance, and a lot of humor and a heluva lot of action. Also, they didn't yell their attack names, (cause they don't really have attack names) so that made it even cooler than it was before. \\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 10\\n",

            "content": "First of all, I have seen the original FMA and although it was very popular and original, the pacing and conclusion did not sit too well with me. Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the original, this time sticking to the manga all the way through, but there were people who thought it would spoil the franchise. That myth should be dispelled, as there's only one word to describe this series - EPIC.\r\nI admit that as I've seen the original and read the manga, the pacing of Brotherhood seems to start off being VERY fast (I finally got used to the pacing afterwatching the first fifteen eps or so). Events that took up half a volume of the manga and had spread though a few episodes of the original anime were now shown in just a single episode. However, after trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who's new to FMA (not comparing it to the manga nor the original), I believe that the pacing works and it manages to tell an intriguing story effectively with little confusion. The plot is full of clever ideas and unpredictable twists that link various parts of the story together. By the final episode, all loose ends are neatly tied up and what's left is a hugely satisfying epilogue.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it's a bit simpler but that's just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we're familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main/supporting casts I've ever seen, and you'd probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that's forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers. \\n\\n\r\nFMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it's finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it's too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it's recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.",

            "content": "Adaptations have long been a thorn in the side of anime viewers, but not because they are inherently bad. No, the main problem has been that many studios have regarded the original work almost as an afterthought, and there are a number of shows that could have been wonderful if the writers had simply stuck to the original story.\r\nOne of the issues at hand seems to be ownership as producers, writers and directors all seem to want the work to be reflective of their style and perception, and in order to stamp their mark on a show they will makes numerous unnecessary changes or additions.Admittedly there are times when the adaptation supersedes the original work, but more often than not the result is at best a decent anime, and at worst utter twaddle.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the other side of the coin, where the anime adaptation sticks to the storyline set out in the original work. Normally one would expect these to be superior works, but in a strange irony this is not always the case. The problem with these types of adaptations is that the original work may not have been very good, or even have a suitable narrative, to begin with, and turning them into anime only seems to exacerbate their inherent flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the Full Metal Alchemist franchise manages to steer clear  almost all of these pitfalls. The problem is, there are no other anime that have so evenly split the viewing public's opinion between the two versions of the series. Unlike the 2003 adaptation, Brotherhood is a faithful representation of Arakawa Hiromu's hit manga, and while many fans of the franchise laud it as the best thing since sliced bread, there are a number who consider the original anime version to be the superior tale.\\n\\n\r\nBut we'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nMany people will already be familiar with the particulars of the story, and in a very real sense the common perception is well formed. Unfortunately, one of the problems with liking something too much is that one becomes blinded to its flaws, and while Brotherhood has very few noticeable ones where the narrative is concerned, this also serves to make them stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told in a very straight forward, no nonsense manner that is kind of refreshing given the penchant for filler episodes. The issue though, is that the content of the tale is much lighter in tone, much more typically \"shounen\" in its essence, than that of the first adaptation. One of the reasons for this is because the undercurrent of obsession amongst the main characters peters out towards the end of the story - a stark contrast to the ending in the first adaptation. Instead, these obsessive behaviours are effectively \"de-humanised\" by pushing them on to the non human characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a very clear sense that the plot is geared towards a more typical shounen standpoint and mentality, and while the whole still works very well as a story, one does have to wonder if the writers for the first adaptation didn't steal a march on Arakawa. It's possible that she had to change her idea of how the tale should develop because the first anime version took a much darker path than most other shounen franchises.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the ending allows for a degree of catharsis that was missing from the first adaptation, and although there are some broad similarities between the two versions at times, in truth they are as different as chalk and cheese. As an added bonus this series is far less dependent on random comedic moments, and the difference this makes to the flow of the plot is palpable when the two versions are directly compared.\\n\\n\r\nOne big advantage that Brotherhood has is that the seven year gap has allowed for improvements in various aspects of production, and it shows in a number of areas. The animation is more fluid than before, although admittedly the difference isn't really obvious at first and only really appears during large scale action set pieces. The character designs will be very familiar to any fan, but are subtly sharper and more defined than in the previous series.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, one of the biggest plus points for Brotherhood is actually its wealth of interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs one would expect, a number of the characters from the first adaptation appear in Brotherhood, but there are also several who are notable for their absence as they do no appear in the manga. Instead, a horde of new characters appear throughout the course of the series, many of whom have their own goals, ideals and personalities. Indeed the biggest difference between the two versions is the sheer number of people who all seem to have some impact on the story.\\n\\n\r\nFor much of the series Edward and Alphonse Elric behave in a manner that many who have watched the first adaptation will find familiar, and one of the nice things about this is that familiarity is used to very subtly develop the pair into very different characters. The change in their personas happens very gradually, but by the end of Brotherhood one can see just how much growth the pair has undergone.\\n\\n\r\nStrangely enough, the most interesting additions to the series are actually Yao Ling and Olivier Mira Armstrong (Alex Louis Armstrong's older sister - but without all the muscle flexing), two of the supporting roles. Yao Ling presents a strange dichotomy for the series to tackle, and while he doesn't develop as much as he possibly could have, this is offset by the moral and ethical dilemmas inherent in his situation towards the end of the series. On the other Olivier Armstrong possesses some of the strongest characterisation in the whole story, and while she is without doubt a major player at certain points of the show, what makes her interesting is the fact that the viewer is never quite sure of her goals.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a number of very strong characterisations in the series, but one of the things that is a little strange is the difference between the two versions where the homunculi are concerned. Unlike the first adaptation the homunculi in Brotherhood have very different origins, even though they still deal with similar obsessions. This raises an interesting perspective on the series as a whole, and is one of the reasons why Brotherhood is far more of a shounen tale than the original adaptation. The plot takes on a subtly lighter tone, even though it may not seem that way, once their origins are understood, and the main reason for this is the \"de-humanisation\" I mentioned earlier. The viewer is aware that these characters, though human-like in form, are not linked to humans in any way, and this awareness acts as a buffer so the viewer is less likely to question the actions and behaviour of the homunculi. In essence one is subjected to the ethos that monsters are evil and do bad things, which raises some interesting issues where Kimblee, Greed and the military's generals are concerned.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the acting is possibly the main reason why Brotherhood is able to pull off its feat of developing not only the familiar characters, but also the new additions. Paku Romi and Kugimiya Rie reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonse Elric, but with the exception of a few roles, the remaining cast are very different from the first outing. Now normally one might consider this a recipe for disaster, but it's a testament to the quality of not only the actor's abilities, but also the scriptwriters, that this series easily stands shoulder to shoulder with the original.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very well composed and produced, and the series has a surprisingly large number of opening and ending themes, especially for 64 episode series. That said, fans of Brotherhood may find themselves in a bit of a quandary, especially if they prefer the OPs and EDs from the first series. As for the sound effects, they are handled in a decidedly competent manner that makes one wonder why other shounen anime seem to have trouble in this department. Granted there are occasions when there's a bit of a cacophony, but in general the effects are clear, bold, and well choreographed.\\n\\n\r\nNow unlike most viewers, I actually consider Brotherhood to be equal to the first series, and I don't really fall on one side or another. Like a number of fans my preference is for the much darker tone of the first series, however the cathartic ending of Brotherhood, as well as the improvements in production and animation, go some way to balancing the scales. Some people prefer the somewhat darker nature to Ed's character from the first adaptation, but in all honesty the rationale behind the two versions is very different, and while they're broadly the same character, that perception is only really valid until the last few episodes of either show. The same principle applies to Alphonse, Roy Mustang, in fact to most of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Brotherhood is just as entertaining and involving as its predecessor, and it's a testament to Arakawa's skill as a mangaka that she has been able to produce a tale that, at the very least, rivals the original anime adaptation.Yes, Brotherhood is more typically shounen than the other version, but the nice thing about this is that fans are given two very good versions of the same story, and that is something rare in anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow if only all remakes, revisions or reboots could be this good.",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an immense amount of praise in the MAL community, is the #1 ranked show and is constantly referred to as a masterpiece and the greatest show ever created. I've seen many fans preach about how \"it lives up to the hype\" and \"can never receive too much praise\". Now this is just the opinion of one guy. I'm certainly not the law of the land or anything. However, I personally feel as though calling FMA:B a masterpiece and the champion of all shows is a bit of a stretch. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it or that itisn't a very solid addition to the ranks of notable shows; I really would like to preface this review by saying that I believe that FMA:B is a very good show and I wouldn't be nearly as harsh on it if it weren't for the God status the show has attained in America. I would happily remand \"greatest show ever made\" to \"greatest long-running shonen ever made if you haven't seen the 2011 Hunter X Hunter\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of the MAL categorical rating system, as I've mentioned in some of my previous reviews. I oftentimes outright ignore it. However, looking at the categories right now, I feel as though this is one instance where I can use it to talk about everything I want to so I'm going to use it.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe FMA:B plot and world-building are some of its strongest aspects. The world that it creates is an immersive, full-feeling thing with many animate pieces that move even when you aren't looking at them. It's an extremely creative world as well, adopting its own set of universal laws including alchemy through equivalent exchange, mind-body duality and its own interpretation of a higher power, and it sticks by these laws. Never once does the story contradict its own rules, instead using them in creative ways to build off of each other. The plot is also one of the most engaging parts of the show, unveiling itself at just the right pace to keep you interested whilst still keeping a few major cards to play at the very end. The pieces fall into place in a way that is satisfying because it simultaneously mind-blowing and obvious, and that's one of the marks of strong storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the FMA:B story is certainly one of the best I've seen, I find that I have to withhold my 10 score here on the grounds that its incredible direction and creativity are marred by some detrimental weaknesses. First of all, the exposition is handled extremely poorly. The first and third episodes feel like they're from some shitty cartoon network show, the show blatantly ignores the show-don't-tell rule in the entirety of its first chunk (with characters spelling out exactly what is happening and why it's happening) and its tendency to repeat important plot points over and over again quite frankly feels insulting to me as the audience as though the show is assuming I'm not able to pay attention or figure things out for myself and need to have the fact that Ed and Al committed the sin of human transmutation and lost their bodies told to me at least twenty-five times in the first two hours of show. Secondly, there's a period of time which I would probably refer to as the third fourth of the show (episodes 40-53ish) in which the show drags incredibly, adopting a typical battle-shonen approach of having characters engage in multiple-episode long one-on-one or two-on-one battles, giving them plenty of time to pose and stand off and monologue at each other. This isn't how fighting or war works, and these contrived battles really take away a lot of the climactic atmosphere. Finally, the show's ending is not nearly as satisfying as I wish it had been. The final few episodes are for the most part brilliant, but once the show plays all its cards and it's resolution time, it wraps itself up with cliches and in-your-face themes. \\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely astounding 80% of the time and absolutely horrid 20% of the time. Thus the 8 score. The action is all stunning, the openings gorgeous, the backgrounds consistent and unique, building a sense of a real lived-in world. The character designs are sometimes a little bland, but for the most part they are memorable and the homunculi look brilliant so I don't have any real complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I have a problem with is the obnoxious number of times that the show goes \"anime\" - reducing its characters to shittily-drawn caricatures and its animation to blocky, looped motion. Usually this is used during the shows attempts at humor, which I'll talk about later, but most of the time it was just extremely cringe-inducing and distracting, ruining the sense of continuity and immersion in this world. The show obviously wants you to take it seriously (it sure loves its drama) and when Al is portrayed as a big grey mound with a squiggle for a mouth it makes this difficult. There's a difference between having your character goof around and having the show itself goof around. It almost feels like a laugh-track, telling the audience \"this is the funny part!\"\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, however, the art is gorgeous. When it counts, it shines, and that's really what matters. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\\n\r\nUndeniably the strongest aspect of the show. I have no complaints whatsoever. The soundtrack is never distracting but always effective, the voice-actors (especially for Bradley and Al) absolutely nailed it and the openings and endings... dear lord. It's been said before, but the openings and endings to FMA:B are some of the very best ever made, both in sound and visuals. They tell small stories of their own. They set the tone for the episode and for their section of the show as a whole. I especially loved 'Golden Time Lover' and 'Chemistry', but I have to give special mention to SID's 'Rain'. As far as I'm concerned, that opening could have been the end of the show. It single-handedly established a sense of finality, a long-endured struggle of these characters and their causes. Everyone is portrayed as exhausted, weak and full of both despair and determination: protagonist and antagonist alike, fighting under the rain. Not for glory, not for honor, but just for the one thing they care most for. Personally, it made me extremely hyped for the final stretch of the show. It wasn't quite what we got, but at least we got some of it.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that there is an intense connection between a show's opening and the audience's willingness to appreciate it. It is very likely that the intensity of many fanbases is in part due to the ability that openings such as these have to maintain feelings in regards to the show, oftentimes perhaps even distorting or altering memories of the show itself into what the opening would have you believe the show was like rather than what it was actually like. Obvious examples that jump to mind are Sword Art Online's \"Courage\" and Guilty Crown's \"My Dearest\". Remember how those shows were absolutely nothing like that? No?? IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely call out the show's characters on being the weakest link and the most undeserving of the praise that the show receives. For starters, the writing is often clunky and awkward, but that's not the main issue. It's because most of them are not really characters: they're plot devices with one or two distinguishing traits tacked on. They're entirely predictable, not because they feel like real people but because they do the same things over and over again. Al talks about what he'll do when he gets his body back. Ed talks about how they'll find a way and how they will atone for their mistakes and etc. It's not that it's melodrama: it's the fact that it's the SAME melodrama over and over again. It wasn't until sometime past episode 30 that Ed stopped sounding perpetually like a broken record and started to feel as though he were actually developing, but even then he was really just defined by his arc and not by any amount of complexity.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the pitfall that so many of these characters fall into. If your character's only real traits beyond their development for the sake of the show are \"hates being called short\" and \"hates milk\" they're really more of a tool with some googly eyes stuck on to them. Other characters are even worse: Armstrong is manly. His sister is more manly. Mustang wants to be Fuhrer and avenge Hughes (he's even got this great relationship with Hawkeye that could have been seriously compelling if they ever had any real conversations about anything besides \"we must overthrow the government\" and \"Hughes!\" over and over again). Winry likes Ed and automail. Ling wants to be emperor. Now, FMA:B is a complex, busy show. I could understand if it didn't have the time to make these characters anything more than chess pieces for its grand and elaborate plot, giving them a few distinguishing traits because that's really all it can manage without dragging itself out immensely. But it DOES have the time: it has all the time it spends having Ed yell about being called short. It has all the time it spends having Armstrong pull of his shirt and yell about being manly. It has all the time it spends having Ed and Al talk about getting their goddamn bodies back over and fucking over again as though I would somehow manage to forget it. Ling passing out from lack of food. May fawning comically over Ed. Mustang is antisocial LOL. The same gags, over and over again, barely even rehashed in any original way. Not only do they become painful to watch, they devour all of the development that this shallow cast of characters could have had to make me actually invested in them. They're far too static, with most of them having a single change or revelation over the course of the show's 64 episodes in order to indicate that they have grown as a person. But a good character has so much more than that: what kind of music do these people listen to? Why? Who are their role models? Why? What books do they like? What are their favorite places to eat? What do they appreciate in the people they're close to?? What are their personal histories...\\n\\n\r\nOh wait, sorry! I didn't mean to ask that last one! Please, I take it back! NOOOOOOO...\\n\\n\r\nYeah so I forgot to mention something. Screw all that stuff about making these characters possess complex personalities, FMA:B has a better way to define them.\\n\\n\r\nTRAUMA\\n\\n\r\nEveryone who's remotely relevant has a traumatic backstory. It's a harsh world, sure. I get that. Here's the issue: people are introduced and then defined through their trauma. Now this isn't Angel Beats bad, where horrible things happen to perfectly innocent people for no reason. Most of the tragedy is partially a result of the decisions of the characters involved, and their resulting struggle is a combination of having to cope with the consequences and with themselves and their mistakes. However, this cannot be used as a SUBSTITUTE for character development. A supplement, sure, but I still remember in episode four when Ed and Al meet a state alchemist who literally introduces himself with something along the lines of \"my wife left me because we were too poor\" before he even tells them his goddamn NAME. Here, come on in! Take a seat! Would you like some sorrow pie or tragic backstory cake? We have plenty! Ed and Al's dad left, then their mom died, then they f*cking ripped their bodies apart. Winry's parents were murdered in cold blood. Mustang had to kill lots of people. Armstrong had to kill lots of people. Everyone had to kill lots of people. Scar watched everyone he loved get killed, and then had to kill lots of people. These are always the first things we find out about people, and then for the rest of the show they are defined almost exclusively by them. If anyone is overly happy and wholesome, it means something horrid is going to happen to them. It's basic emotional manipulation. Look at this adorable little girl and her dog! Dead. Look at this smiling, picturesque family! Husband dead. Dead. Everyone innocuously happy has to die or lose someone close to them. The more broken and internally conflicted you are, the safer you are. There's no need to pile more grief on Scar, so he's relatively safe.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the characters suffer from repeatable and preventable problems. They exist mainly to function as morals-in-a-bottle with gags tacked on to them. They're difficult to relate to, because all we know about them is whatever themes they embody and one or two dumb jokes. Ikuhara writes characters more personable than this, and his stories don't make sense on PURPOSE. I did give the characters a 6 though, and there are reasons for that.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, despite their lack of humanization the characters complete their tasks of being walking themes with relative effectiveness. This isn't anywhere near Log Horizon S1 bad. These characters are here for a reason, they represent something, and they represent those things well. Sure, they could have easily been better, but they fulfill their purpose and for that alone they are not failures. I will also give special mention to Scar, who, while still actively defined by his trauma was executed far more impressively than the other characters. This is probably in part because the show actually viewed him as morally ambiguous as opposed to just making the character FEEL morally ambiguous when there was really no doubt that the show wanted you to think this was a 'good guy' (*cough* Mustang)\\n\\n\r\nSecond off, there are some exceptions to the rule. Most of my complaints thusfar have been leveled at the shows protagonists. They are the ones that suffer from dismal repetition and blatant violation of show-don't-tell. Where the show does excel is with its antagonists. There are seven homunculi in the show, incarnations of the seven deadly sins, and they so utterly clobber their \"good-guy\" counterparts in terms of being engaging, personable subtle characters that it isn't even funny. Their intensive backstories are never shoved in your face, their apparent contradictions are given plenty of time to be uncovered by the viewer, and the deliciously ironic conclusions to their arcs are done tactfully. Many times I found myself actively routing for them because they were just so much more interesting and well-executed. I would happily watch an \"Adventures of the Homunculus\" spinoff cataloging the several hundred years most of them lived before the start of the series.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\\n\r\nI was constantly gripped by the plot. I actively looked forward to the openings and endings. The art was oftentimes orgasmic. The homunculi made me want to start looking for ingredients to make a philosopher's stone with. However, I was constantly frustrated by the show's apparent lack of respect for its viewers and by its absolutely abysmal humor. I've already said it, but I don't know if I've driven home just how infuriating it is to have exposition repeated to you over and f*cking over again and how cringe-inducing it is when somebody violates the show-don't-tell rule at extremely tense and crucial moments. It actively snapped me out of the experience whenever Ed and Al had a conversation about getting their bodies back after the 5th time it happened, and when God literally spelled out for Ed that he had discovered the meaning of life I facepalmed hard. That's not how you do themes, man. That just comes off as preachy. That's something the show suffered constantly from: it felt incredibly preachy. It's character's speeches about the answers they had found to their struggles felt much more pointed at the audience than at anyone in the show they were talking to, and that bothered the ever-loving crap out of me. And have I mentioned the humor? For every joke the show has that lands, it tries about five others that fall on their face. As I've already mentioned, they're repetitive and used as a substitute for meaningful character interactions and development. It seems as thought the show is trying to use them as a counterbalance for its immense amount of melodrama, but instead they end up just ripping apart the tone and stagnating the story. Despite these gripes, I did overall enjoy the experience and felt that the positives did inevitably outweigh the negatives so I will happily give it a 7 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7\\n\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not a masterpiece. It's a very respectable, unique, inspired and creative show and it's definitely a classic. I would happily recommend this to most people. However, don't go in with irrational expectations. It's enjoyable, it's engaging, it will definitely give you plenty to think about, but in my personal opinion it gets a little too much praise and a little too much hype. I probably would have enjoyed it more myself if I hadn't heard nothing but angelic worship for it before going into it. I formally apologize to any huge fans of the show that I may have offended: it's not by any means a bad show! I don't give out 7s all that lightly, believe me. This is merely an argument against FMA:B being the be-all-end-all of anime. Thanks for reading if you made it through that wall of text, and have a nice day!\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nFMA Brotherhood is an anime that needs no introduction. This is the highest rated anime on all of MAL. This is the anime that the current generation of anime fans holds above all others as the greatest single anime EVER made! In the following paragraphs, I will be reviewing this legendary series and discussing whether or not it truly deserves this title.\r\nSPOILERS for both Brotherhood and 2003 FMA!!!!\r\nPlot: \r\nThe plot takes place in the country of Armestris, which is basically like an alternate WW2 Germany. It is constantly at war for reasons that are less than just and is ruled by a rather nefarious government.What makes this world special is that alchemy is the primary science instead of the much less fun and flashy science of our own reality. Alchemy allows practitioners to transmute material into other useful material, and basically do all kinds of awesome stuff! Our heroes are the Elric brothers, who wish to find the legendary Philosopher's Stone and gain back their original bodies that they lost in a forbidden alchemy ritual gone horribly wrong. In order to search for the stone, they join the military. Unfortunately this means they have to serve under a rather evil government and face strong moral dilemmas. The Elric brothers don't wish to take part in the government's genocidal campaigns, but they need the military in order to accomplish their own personal goals. Of course, things are a bit more complicated by the fact that many in the military are actually good people and are either unaware of just how bad the government is, or feel remorse for their crimes and  wish to change the government. This is refreshing for a shonen series in which \"good and evil\" is too often clear cut. We have all seen Hollywood movies where the German Army is filled with nothing but pure evil monsters with zero humanity. As a side note, eventually Hollywood got MUCH better with treating the Germans this way... thanks to us ethnic Germans making up 40% of the US population, but Hollywood STILL treats the Russians and certain other groups this way! \\n\\n\r\nEventually, the Elric brothers uncover the frightening truth that the real leader behind the government is an ancient evil being called \"Father\" who uses his homunculus minions to due his bidding and wishes for ultimate knowledge and power! The Elric brothers also make many allies on their adventures including Scar, the Xingese, and Hohenheim, who all contribute in the fight against Father. The plot ultimately concludes with a very happy ending, which pleased fans far more than the bittersweet ending of the 2003 anime. It should also be noted that unlike the plot of the 2003 anime, FMA Brotherhood mostly stays faithful the Hiromu Arakawa's original manga.\\n\\n\r\nDifferences between 2003 FMA and Brotherhood:\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are many differences in the plot which I will get to, the most immediately obvious difference is in the tone of the series' narrative. The 2003 FMA has a VERY dark and somber tone throughout the series, which makes it really stand out as the oddball of the shonen world. FMA Brotherhood has tragic moments, but they are balanced out with zany comedy, more happy endings, and less emotional suffering in general. The tone in Brotherhood actually feels like you are watching a shonen anime like Naruto or One Piece. You know going in that there will be sad parts, but all will turn out well in the end. FMA 2003 feels closer to watching Berserk than it does to watching Naruto or One Piece! Whether a viewer prefers lighthearted shonen or brooding seinen is a matter of taste, but let us take a look at the subject matter being dealt with in this series. In both the 2003 FMA and Brotherhood, this is a series about German soldiers serving a genocidal regime and ultimately having to rebel against the government and try atone for their crimes. Does that sound like something that should be a fun, zany comedy? \"It is almost certain that we will fail. But how will future history judge the German people if not even a handful of men had the courage to put an end to that criminal?\" - Henning Von Tresckow. I can ASSURE you he didn't tell a stupid joke 20 seconds afterwards so that his listeners wouldn't feel sad about the deaths of 17 million civilians murdered by the Nazis as \"untermenschen\". Was the movie Das Boot a fun comedy? NO! Have you ever wondered why that is? The reason is that making a movie or series about German soldiers reflecting on mass genocide into a delightful romp is fucking stupid as hell! To think that people on MAL accuse Elfen Lied of having bad tone whiplash. FMA Brotherhood thematically achieves a mood whiplash other anime can only dream of.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to characters and plot differences. Firstly, lets talk about everyone's favorite FMA character, Roy Mustang. In FMA 2003, Roy is the one who murdered Winry's parents instead of Scar. Roy is also MUCH more affected by his guilt for having murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in the name of an evil government. In 2003 FMA, Roy actually tries to kill himself in a state of deep depression, but Hughes stops him and instead inspires him to live, so that one day he can overthrow and lead the government. Roy actually manages to kill Fuhrer Bradley and do what he had dreamed of for so long. However, he is too overwhelmed by the emotional stress to simply stay in the military and take a role of leadership like he does in Brotherhood. Roy retires to a simple life with Hawkeye instead and only uses his alchemy again in the movie Conquerors of Shamballa to save the people of Central. Roy is a MUCH more empathetic and truly human character in the original 2003 series. He is actually, truly effected by guilt and stress the way a real person that isn't a total sociopath would be. He doesn't just feel kind of bad for about 5 minutes, then move on. \"I killed those people under orders, I don't have to REALLY feel too bad about it.\" If the point is to make Roy a true military hero that reveals the full horrors of war and shows how even good men will commit evil deeds under orders, then the 2003 anime accomplishes this a LOT better than Brotherhood did!\\n\\n\r\nNow let's look at the Arab anti-hero Scar. In both series, Scar is a survivor of the Ishvalan genocide who is consumed with the desire for vengeance against the State Alchemists that slaughtered his people. In both series, Scar has an elder brother who violated Scar's Ishvalan religion and practiced alchemy, ultimately saving his life and giving him his special arm. However, in the 2003 anime we learn that Scar's brother violated a FAR more sacred law and tried to resurrect his dead lover with alchemy. This was of course a miserable failure that drove his brother mad with grief and furthered Scar's hatred of alchemy. This works better in terms of narrative, because it gives Scar even more reason to hate alchemy as violently as he does and view it as \"false\". It also better explains why Scar sympathized with Edward Elric, because he could tell he had lost his limbs in a human transmutation and was reminded of his own brother. In terms of objective \"writing 101\" and constructing a narrative, this extra back story from the 2003 anime was brilliant and felt far more complete than Brotherhood. Scar's end is also WAY better in the original 2003 anime. In Brotherhood, Scar fights his ultimate battle against Wrath, who was only the 3rd strongest homunculi, not the real mastermind behind the Ishvalan genocide, and had no real connection to Scar since they had never met. In the 2003 series, Scar fights his ultimate battle against the pure evil State Alchemist Zolf Kimblee, who murdered his brother and gave him his namesake scar. Which of these makes sense in terms of basic storytelling? Having a character's big fight be against a personal opponent where the struggle actually MEANS something, or have the fight be against a barely connected random character? It is sad that Scar has to die in the 2003 series, but his death is a heroic one and ultimately a much better written conclusion to his story. In Brotherhood, Scar somehow survives in order for a happier ending and we get a quick cameo of him working to rebuild Ishval. Scar is a flawed anti-hero consumed with a desire for revenge. In the original series, his tragic and heroic death makes the audience care a LOT more about him than Brotherhood does. Would it have been good storytelling in Lord of the Rings if Boromir for some reason survived, then we get a quick 2 sentences about how he is living happily in Gondor after the war? No. That would be really stupid and Tolkien being a good writer, realized that and gave Boromir a heroic death of penance that better closed his story.\\n\\n\r\nThere are WAY too many examples, so we will make our final one a comparison between Dante and Father. How can I even compare them? You are probably thinking right now. \"Dante is just a forgettable Filler Villain and Father is one of the greatest villains in anime history!\" The truth is that Father...isn't actually a very good villain. Remember that this is a story about an alternate WW2 Germany and a group of soldiers fighting against an evil government following a massive genocide. Adolf Hitler was not a nice man, but he WAS a human being. Dante is powerful, but ultimately just an ordinary human sociopath who wishes to sacrifice countless people she views as inferior to guarantee her own Godhood and immortality. I think that sounds a LOT closer to Hitler than a fucking ink blot genie from Ancient Persia looking for ultimate knowledge. If you are going to tell a story with OBVIOUS real world parallels, then STAY CONSISTENT! Government atrocities and genocides happen due to ordinary human leaders with extremely selfish desires, NOT evil genies! The Holocaust, Cambodian Genocide, Rwandan Genocide, and Armenian Genocide were not caused by Mr. Popo!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nFMA Brotherhood is a very well animated series and admittedly does look better in most places than the 2003 original. Is the animation enough to give it the title of greatest of all time? No. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for FMA Brotherhood is once again quite solid, but isn't even as good as the 2003 FMA OST, let alone worthy of the greatest of all time title! Just compare the main theme from the Brotherhood OST to the main theme Bratja from 2003 FMA. The main theme for Brotherhood is a fairly bland orchestral piece with some ominous chanting that sounds like a throw away extra from the Hellsing Ultimate soundtrack. The main theme from the 2003 FMA is a heartbreaking, beautiful song about an elder brother asking forgiveness from his younger brother. Bratja is WAY better than anything in Brotherhood without question! Compare the first opening theme of Brotherhood to the 1st opening of the 2003 series. The 2003 series has Ready Steady Go, one of the greatest openings in the history of anime. Brotherhood has an extremely forgettable opening that wouldn't rank in the top 500 anime openings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nFMA Brotherhood is a good anime overall, but it is ONLY a good anime. It isn't anywhere NEAR the greatest anime ever made! It is actually vastly inferior to the original 2003 FMA and even that wasn't the single greatest anime of all time, although a MUCH better candidate than Brotherhood. Of course the title of G.O.A.T. is a highly subjective and debatable matter, but there isn't a single category where Brotherhood REALLY outshines its competitors. Some people say Legend of the Galactic Heroes is the greatest of all time. I'm not going to say that LOTGH is an absolutely flawless work, because it isn't. However, it actually stays consistent in its tone with the heavy ideas and themes it presents. Brotherhood does not. Brotherhood is WAY closer to Elfen Lied than LOTGH in terms of keeping a consistent tone  to respect very dark and serious subject matters. LOTGH has an absolutely EPIC scope with hundreds of well written characters, maybe the most intricate politics in all of anime, and gets viewers to really think about real world problems and issues in terms of government, better than any other anime ever made. In other words, LOTGH actually DOES have areas where it clearly outshines its peers and therefore has a far more legitimate claim to the throne. Cowboy Bebop has almost without question the greatest original OST in anime history, is more accessible to non-anime fans than any other anime, and is an absolute blast from beginning to end. Once again, it has areas where it is clearly the best, so a more legitimate claim. Name just ONE thing that Brotherhood is the best at? Most tearjerking? nope. Best written? not even close. Most philosophical and complex? Hell no. Best art? nope. Best soundtrack? nope. It is solid around the board, but it isn't actually truly great at anything! I would therefore argue that Brotherhood is NOT the greatest of all time, is INSANELY overrated, and you are honestly much better off watching the 2003 FMA. I'm sorry if this review hurt any feelings. My job as a critic is to say what needs to be said.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Since I couldn't find any legitimate objective analysis in any of these fanboy reviews, I decided put my own review: \r\nHere's why FMA:B and it's Manga counterpart don't work:\r\nIt's just a disjointed piece of art. The initial premise of the narrative: two young siblings that horrifically lose their mother and parts of themselves is incredibly dark and powerfully poignant. Their journey to find the philosophers stone is one that's objectively adventurous but the endpoint is still inherently adult and sophisticatedly gritty; especially as it delves into the implications of bringing a dead person back to life early on in the series.\r\nSo why is it disjointed?Because there's a mistranslation of tonal nuance throughout the entire series. Now I don't mean stylistic aspects such as art style choices e.g. Chibi segments (because those are minuscule details in the grand scheme of storytelling devices), but rather the way they're implemented in the story. For example, one second we're dealing with the introspective reconciliation of human birth and how beautiful it is and the very next we drop it for side-gags just to transition into the next topic/character development. It just doesn't fit. It's formulaic. It's predictable storytelling at it's finest and it absolutely ruins the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a huge shame because the character development and dialogue in the series is exquisitely written (some of the best in any story I've ever seen); e.g. Edward's speech about his existential crisis provided a deep psychoanalytical view into his personality and character. This is amazing character development! However it actually lessens the impact of the narrative and my personal enjoyment of the series because it contrasts heavily with the tone of the series. Right down to the very commercial transitions with the quirky voice-over of the title; every little stylistic choice is presented as a complete antithesis to the themes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist should NOT be sugarcoated with a light-hearted aesthetic. This is something I'd hate to say in any other series because pretentiously \"dark and gritty\" series (*cough* Tokyo Ghoul *cough*) are the bane of my existence but this is the one exception. If the themes of the series are of complex adult issues, why is the tone appealing to childish humour and zany adventurous antics?\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, I totally understand why Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is considered one of the greatest Animes of all time because it is substantially provocative and extremely complex behind the aesthetics much like many other great Animes like One Piece, Hunter X Hunger, Cowboy Bebop and Dragon Ball.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, it just doesn't work from a narrative perspective because it feels disjointed and unfocused in the way it clashes with stylistic ambiguity. Through this loss of tone, the series becomes a chain of loose threads that are vaguely commentating on the overall themes of the narrative which is why I rated Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the Manga: 5/10.",

            "content": "Now, this is a prime example of how to adapt an manga into an anime the RIGHT way.  The original Fullmetal Alchemist, though well made and very popular, went into a downward spiral as soon as it diverted from the manga storyline and never seemed to recover.  This however, shows that instead of trying to add their own story elements when adapting manga/visual novels etc., sometimes anime producers should just sit back and retell the great story that has already been written in the original.\r\nThis anime starts off at a breakneck pace.  It shoots entire volumes of the manga in a coupleof episodes.  It was to be expected though, as Bones is trying to fit 100+ chapters of manga into a 1-year long series.  However, once you get used to it the pacing seems very appropriate for the series and only seems to increase the suspense.  While small elements have been omitted from the manga, these are mainly non-essential and have no impact on the story.  Yet while many of these omitted elements are comedic in nature, Brotherhood still manages to switch between seriousness and comedy so fast you'll get whiplash.  I quite enjoyed this particularly as a sort of trademark of the series.  The actual plot-line twists and turns in unexpected ways and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the climax grips you like no other.  Many disregard the plot as being generically shonen, but it is these twists and its exploration into the psyche and motivation of the characters that propel it past this \"generic shonen\" label.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is of a different style to the original FMA.  It is a little simpler, and comedic scenes sometimes even stray into an outright chibi style, but this is by no means a bad thing.  If anything it is closer to the the style that Hiromu Arakawa draws with in the manga.  What its lacking in detail, it makes up for with first-class fight sequences (as to be expected of Bones).  The animation overall is quite polished and character movements are very fluid and natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters on both sides really caught my attention as one of this series' strengths.  It boasts a diverse range of characters, all of which have considerable substance and a distinct purpose in the storyline.  The Homunculi especially turn out to be completely different from the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, and more awesome in my opinion.  Edward and Alphonse are still the main focus of the story as they quest to find the Philosophers' Stone and restore their bodies, but now Winry also takes a more central role along with Ed and Al's father, Hohenheim.  There is also a host of new characters which didn't feature in the first anime adaptation, including a few from the mysterious country Xing and a new main villain.  Being completely faithful to the manga, all the characters' separate journeys and origins are told in much greater detail.  Each character's values and beliefs are tested almost to breaking point as the story reaches its later stages, providing a somewhat surprising and refreshing depth to the cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I initially disliked about this series was the soundtrack, which lacked substance and was very repetitive.  The first opening was brilliant, one of the best I have seen, but the background music was lacklustre.  However, as the series went on more music was added and the soundtrack began to add a great atmosphere to fight scenes and dialogue alike.  The voice actors also really show their ability throughout the series and seem very well suited to their roles.  With such an all-star cast of voice-actors you wouldn't expect any less.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Bones has done an awesome job surpassing its previous effort and faithfully retelling the Fullmetal Alchemist manga.  Enjoyment wise, you'd be hard pressed to find a shonen anime that will entertain you as much as FMA Brotherhood.  Truly a great anime, there's no other way to describe it.  A must-see for people new to anime and hardened otakus alike.  Overall score: 9.4/10 (rounded to 9).",

            "content": "\"We're not gods, we're only human. We can't even save a little girl, so what good are we?\"-Edward Elric\r\nNow let's talk about the best rated show on this website. Ever since its release, fans and critics alike have a mixed reaction to the show. Some of them say that the original show is better while others say this is better. I can't see why we can't like both. They each have things that really work about them. I think they are both masterpieces on a entertainment and artistic level. Some moments in the show will make you laugh, then the next question life, and thencry your eyes out. Some moments in the show are just plain beautiful from the characters, animation, and the really touching moments. There are moments were some of the characters you get attached to die. (Not going to tell what characters because of spoilers, obviously.) A character will get super depressed, and one even almost goes insane. All of these characters express real human emotions unlike some other anime which they express one key emotion. The emotional scenes aren't forced, they have a really big impact on you as a person. You'll start to relate to every character and even question life. Some examples being \"What is the truth?\" or \"Could humans play the role of god?\" That's why I love this show so much. You'll start to look at the world in a different perspective after you watch this and the original show. Now shall we get to the review?\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10 Standout(s) The fantastic end to the series\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know my original thoughts of the story, read my review of the original show. Anyway the end to this anime is one of the best endings I've ever seen in an anime. It was very beautiful and touching. This review is suppose to be spoiler free (In most cases.) So I can't tell you my thoughts of the ending. If you want more in detail of the ending, just ask me. Anyway, I can't talk about much about the story without repeating myself, so let's go to the art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 10/10 Standout(s) The animation\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell that they had a huge budget just by looking at a character. It was very solid and very easy on the eyes. This really shines in the well animated action scenes. They were just plain epic! What I didn't explain in full detail in my review of the original was the character designs. I didn't give enough praise for them, I just said they were creative and expressive, that was it. You can tell which character is who at first glance. That's a really hard thing to do for a 64 episode anime, but this show pulls it off very well. The character's have there own unique features that stand out among the rest. Now let's go to the sound.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 Standout(s) The dub\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack really fit in with the anime. I mostly loved the music they played in the action scenes or when there was something bad going on. I found it very unique and weirdly fit with the tension of a scene. For the dub, most people consider it one of the best dubs out there and I don't blame them. The only difference between the dub for the original and the dub for this was Al's actor. Al's original actor, Aaron Dismuke, had too deep of a voice to play Al anymore. So they got Maxey Whitehead to play him. So was Maxey good as Al? She did a fantastic job in my eyes. When I saw the first episode, I thought that was the original actor. That's how good her performance was. If you want me to go in depth about the dub, read my review of the original. Now the one you've all been waiting for, the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 Standout(s) Every single one of them\\n\\n\r\nThis is my favorite character cast in any anime. They were all very entertaining in their own little way. If you want to hear me talk about Ed and Al, read my review of the original show. Let's just talk about Roy Mustang and Maes Hughes.\\n\\n\r\nRoy Mustang:\\n\\n\r\nOn the outside, Roy seems like the calm, collected, and cool guy. On the inside he values the lives of his comrades like Riza Hawkeye and Maes Hughes. If one of them were to die, he would just be sad for the rest of his life. He also has a temper that sometimes gets the best of him. This is a guy you don't want to mess with. He'll burn you to death with his flame alchemy. What makes Roy such a good character is that he'll protect those he values with all his heart. He does have a few weaknesses too, you can't have a good character without his or her faults. Like I said, his temper and the fact that if you were to kill one of his friends, he would vow to kill you no matter what and won't forgive you. He doesn't forgive his enemies that easily. Overall, Roy is defiantly one of the best characters in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMaes Hughes:\\n\\n\r\nHughes may seem like the comic relief when you first meet him, but he has more of a personality then that. He is kind, outgoing, and an overall funny person! It's kind of weird how him and Roy get along so well. Hughes is more fun and loud while Roy is more calm and collected. He loves so many people and almost doesn't hate anyone. He loves his daughter and his wife. There's even a few jokes about them in some of the episodes. It feels like his family is the military, his real family, and the Elric brothers. He made a huge impact on the audience for reasons I won't spoil. Overall, a fun guy and a great character!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPeople who will love this show: Everyone, especially fans of the manga.\\n\r\nPeople who won't like this show: I don't know who wouldn't like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPositives: Everything\\n\r\nNegatives: None\\n\\n\r\nThis is defiantly one of the best animated shows of all time. It's amazing how many things you'll learn in this anime. It taught me all sorts of things about life. I am in love with this series. Great anime and deserves a 10 from everyone. So watch it if you haven't.",

I never even tried to follow the original anime.. I knew it was a big success and has a lot of followers everywhere. But it just didn't catch onto me like it did with so many others. With this renewed version, which follows the manga storyline a lot more precise than the first version, the team behind FMA: Brotherhood did a fantastic job. \r\nThe characters are instantly attractive.. what I mean with that is they are very well portrayed as people,unlike so many other anime shows. The story is also instantly compelling.. it drops you right into the world of FMA and does a thorough job of explaining to you how things work. And as far as I've seen, the story never gets repetitive or old. As soon as you finish one episode.. you'll force yourself to watch the next. \\n\r\nThe voice actors are another major plus. The sheer talent of many of them is just unbelievable. I especially liked the fact that the voice actor who did (among others) Kira/Yagami Light's voice in Death Note, Mamoru Miyano. Does the voice for Ling Yao, which makes his character even more intriguing. \\n\r\nIf FMA Brotherhood keeps up this kind of pace, quality and plot development, then I'm definitely going to add it to my 'All-time-favourite-anime' list. \\n\r\nA must see!",

            "content": "If one wishes to obtain something, something of equal value must be given, that is the law of equivalent exchange, the basis of all alchemy, the law that governs the world of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.\r\nBrotherhood follows the adventures of brothers Edward and Alphonse elric , who have commited taboo and tried to transmutate their mother back from the dead. As a result alphonse is left without his body and stuck to a metal armor and ed with a metal arm and a leg  thus the nickname fullmetal. Thus the two brothers embark on a quest to find the famous philosopher's Stone that is saidto allow alchemists to ignore the law of equivalent exchange and help them get their bodies back. I will not go into more details because it will spoil the wonderfull story of the anime. Anyway let's get started. \\n\\n\r\nAs opposed to it's 2003 counterpart  Brotherhood does not have filler episodes or sidestories, the manga being almost finished at the time the anime started. There were a few ovas and specials that came out towards the animes end or after it had finished but I am not counting those.But I have to say they managed to strike a perfect balance. Since it had all the source material it needed the anime does not feel stale,I think it goes on  at a great pace  and it manages to strike a perfect balance between fights, serious moments, light hearted ones . But if you are a big fan of the 2003 anime you might find this a bit too fast as some of the characters lack the development they had in the first series and you might not feel as attached to them as you were back then. Though personally I loved the pacing, as I never got bored and I got entangled in a wonderfull story that just kept dragging me in.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has greatly improved over its predecessor and even now it's way above your usual animes. The facial expressions are great and the battles, oh man they are going to give you a boner, even if you're a girl. Trust me. Though some people might be set off a bit by the fact that the animation style seems to change from battle to battle, but I think that increases it's quality as very rarely you will have the same two characters battling each-other thus each battle seems unique and fresh. I especially enjoy the ones that involve Wrath as man he is a beast.\\n\r\nThe sound is great. I have watched the anime in jappanese thus that is the sound version I shall review.Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonnes and deliver a top quallity performance yet again, but the rest of the cast is not going to let you down either as you can feel they actually enjoy voice acting these characters and that they give their all in their performance. Also I swear to god all the openings and endings are epic. I have all those songs on my playlist at the moment since god they are awesome and fit the show perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nI also like the fact they Brotherhood doesn't do something a lot of anime do and by that I mean they do not spoil what will happen in the anime with the intro or outro because they are all custom made and not just scenes picked up from the anime to show off.\\n\\n\r\nNow the greatest strength of the anime are its characters. The original series mostly explored just the two protagonists Edward and Al, but brotherhood manages to show off almost any character they introduce, their motives and their dreams. For example Roy Mustang and his dream to become the next Fuhrer to protect all his comrades or scar's dream first of revenge and later of change. As I said earlier some might characters might feel a bit rushed because of the fast pace of the anime (I'm looking at you hughes and nina) but I assure you it does not draw back from the story one bit as they still somehow fullfill their role.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime lacks a bit in the replay value, as you wil already know all the big reveals which will probably detract a little from the overall enjoyment  for some, but I watched it multiple times (around once every one and a half years) and I found it refreshing most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso if you want to watch the 2003 series you should do it before you watch Brotherhood for one simple reason. The 2003 anime is also a very solid addition to one's library but Brotherhood is the superior version in all areas and you might not enjoy the 2003 version as much if you watch it after brotherhood. Though if you watch the new series after the 2003 one you will definetly still enjoy it as much, if not even more,  as opposed to watching it first.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this will always be one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever watched, excelling in all areas with a very compelling story line, complex characters, astonishing art and epic soundtracks. I wholeheartedly recommend you go watch it right now, it is a classic and a must see for any anime enthusiast out there.",

FMA Brotherhood has been popping up in Best Anime Lists on Youtube so it piqued my interest.\r\nIt follows, or rather it is more parallel with the story in the manga. The art and animation is magnificent, it stayed true to the characters' design but there was a more polished look. The fluidity of the movements during fight scenes are also a feast for the eyes.\r\nI could not find a single flaw in this series (except I that I wantedmore episodes). The characters were all wonderfully written. It's hard to create secondary characters that are as strong as the main ones when it comes to viewers' attachments. \\n\\n\r\nI found myself falling in love with these amazing characters while I was watching FMAB. It didn't matter if the characters were only shown for one episode, I'm looking at you Nina and Alexander. What mattered was the impact those characters gave. (Like a sledge hammer to the heart)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the story, it's hard to find words to describe FMAB's story. The only thing I can think of is that it's magnificent. It's funny, action packed, mysterious heart wrenching and beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those anime that will leave you feeling empty after you finish it. And I mean that in a good way. I've invested so much emotions in this story, in these characters that when it's finally over it left me feeling lost. That is how amazing this is and I'm not just saying that. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is quite a masterpiece in my opinion.",

            "content": "I'll start this by saying that despite being an adamant fan of Fullmetal Alchemist for a couple of years now, I've never managed to finish the first anime series. I've remained caught up with the manga as much as possible, however, and I'm very excited at where this series is going to go.\r\nFullmetal Alchemist, as I'm sure you know, is the story of the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse. Their story begins a number of years before the actual start of the series, with the tragic death of the boys' mother. Edward and Alphonse, child prodigy alchemists at the time, form a pact to resurrecther. Extensive alchemical training finally culminates in the most important experiment of their lives; the forbidden practice of Necromancy. But something goes wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEdward is forced to stare in horror as his brother is decomposed before his eyes. He is then whisked away to a mysterious location, where a strange entity reveals to him what the experiment lacked; the Philosopher's Stone. Edward is then returned to his home, where he discovers his brother still missing and his own leg gone. In an act of desperation, he sacrifices his own arm in order to preserve his brother's soul into a suit of armor. Events thereafter eventually culminate in a new mission for the Elrics; to procure the Philosopher's Stone and use it to recreate their own bodies.\\n\\n\r\nSounds like heavy stuff, right?\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this series is that it manages to provide some great humor that actually fits quite nicely into its overall dark premise. There are some definite lighthearted moments, but never at the cost of plot, and they never take away from the genuinely touching or tragic scenes. The story itself is very enjoyable, and tends to explore some very deep themes, such as the ethics of resurrecting the dead and the effects of war on individuals and societies.\\n\\n\r\nStoryline aside, this series is visually stunning. Every cell of animation is detailed enough to almost seem like live action, and the characters themselves, based closely on manga author Hiromu Arakawa's original designs, are positively beautiful in motion. Some may be slightly bothered by the atypical face structures, but I find that they range between unnoticeable and and an improvement over the original series'. The movement is fluid and natural to the point that the opening alone should be enough for any animation enthusiast to be satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very entertaining. The very best, as I can assure you from following the manga, are a bit down the road, but the cast as of two episodes in are more than enough to tide anyone over. Roy Mustang is the perfect blend of snarky and serious, with a bit of eccentricity thrown in that any fans of the original anime series should be well familiar with (Tiny Miniskirts will almost assuredly make an appearance in this series once more,) and Edward Elric's familiar short temper, large ego, comedic frustration and occasional moments of genuine caring blend together in what is shaping up to be even better than last time.\\n\\n\r\nOne interesting thing about this series is the very first episode. It chronicles the events of an incident in central involving Isaac McDougal, a State Alchemist turned rebel after the Ishbal War, also known as Isaac the Freezer for his water-based alchemy specialty. This was never a part of the original Manga, and indeed only invented to keep audiences from experiencing Deja Vu from the first series. However, it is of such high quality and entertainment value that calling it filler would be downright unfair. It sets the stage for the rest of the series wonderfully and lets you know right away that you're in for a wild ride.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this is a series to stick with. It's already fantastic, and I can assure those of you who have never read the manga that it only goes up from here. A definite 10/10.",

Now this is a spectacular adaptation worthy of the manga; this is the epitome of a masterpiece anime. The series is just the right length; the storyline never drags, or falters. Although FMA:BH is strung together with an incredible strong plot, the characters are the real highlights of the series; the majority of the cast is thoroughly fully fleshed out with dilemmas worthy of our attention. And while author places nearly all major characters in perilous decisions, and theyoftentimes follow through with these heinous choices, one cannot help but offer up sympathy to these fictional characters. There were many times where I frowned upon some of their judgement, but I often found myself contemplating: Could I have made a better decision if I were in their shoes?\\n\\n\r\nThe Elric brothers are amazing protagonists to follow in this splendid coming-of-age story. In the end, many of my values in regards to adults, decisions, and moral choices were uprooted, and I find myself realizing that more and more, life is less black and white, but moreso filled with shades of grey.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely watch this series. Might I add, some of the soundtrack borrows from classical pieces such as Chopin's Etude Op.10 No.3, which only made the emotional scenes hit me *that* much harder.",

            "content": "There isn't much more I could say with all the praise it already has, but I truly believe that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood deserves every bit of it.\r\nThe pacing is phenomenal; filler is minimal to nonexistent and every episode serves as another step forward. I know a few people who thought that the first few episodes were not explanatory enough, but one of the great things about it is its lack of unnecessarily long narratives; it gives you just enough background information without petulantly walking you through it.\r\nFMAB is also one of the only anime that I prefer the dubbed version over the subbed. The voiceactors are fit fantastically in their roles, and the openings and endings were, for the most part, great. The animation was gorgeous as well, especially in action shots.\\n\\n\r\nBut I think the most important thing to be taken into account is the plot and characters. At its center, FMAB is about two brothers who have just enough flaws for you to emotionally connect with them, but not so many that it crosses the boundary into overly annoying. The length (64 episodes) allows for steady character development, whether it be for the better or worse. Even the villains have some sort of depth without making it seem like a rushed pity backstory. It can sometimes have crass humor (which serves surprisingly well as comic relief), but it is also harshly realistic; good people die and there isn't always a good reason for it.\\n\\n\r\nSo go watch it! I hope you'll love it as much as I do.",

Because if you don't believe in yourself, you will not only bring down yourself, but also many others that believe you and depend on you.\"\r\nIt may not be a quote directly cited from the series, but it is one of the things this series has taught me. This show was great from start to end, and despite knowing some spoilers beforehand, it still delivered to a 10 out of 10 rating - something that's not usually happening for a shonen anime because they tend to overuse a certain trope.\r\nTo kick off, I have been fairly reluctant to watch FullmetalAlchemist: Brotherhood, because I have already seen the first series before the remake happened, and I was afraid that half of the anime would be the same as season 1, but since I heard it had rave reviews, I have put it in the corner of my plan to watch list anyway. Some long time after that, I heard the threat that many anime sites are going to be shut down, and I panicked by mass-watching anime and reading manga. Fullmetal Alchemist was one of the anime I started to watch during that period.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was admittedly a little predictable. But that might have been because I saw the first season, and a few spoilers on what happens ahead, or it might have not been. Despite the fair predictability, the anime has still delivered a great dose of tension, drama, fun, light-hearted moments to not make me burst out in tears from the heavy dramatic ones, and also action - thus I believe majority of the viewers would enjoy. If anyone is discouraged by the 64 episodes, just start slowly, you'll notice it will consume you in no time, because this anime is one of the few that are neither rushed or way too slow-paced.\\n\\n\r\nSome people say D.Gray-man sneaks around seinen territory, but not nearly as much as this anime. The plot gets into a fairly dark theme at times, sometimes even gets slightly into political matters...  and the art matches it well. The colors are not very vibrant, which might have taken a toll on the character designs - then again, this toll has made the characters even more believable and gave distinctive features to them and their descendants.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack matches the mood of the anime in all possible moments. Violin is used for several melodies of the soundtrack, which make a perfect match for the dark theme of the anime. As for the openings and endings, they consist of catchy songs, which serve as a great introduction/outro of the episodes. I also have no remarks to the seiyuus, as they did a fairly well job to match the characters' profile.\\n\\n\r\nWith matching art and matching voice actors, it is possible to admit the fact that the profile of the characters is constructed to be fairly believable - they have their ups and downs, and it is possible to tell where the characters \"got that attitude from\". Their reactions are also believable; they do not overreact as much as it happens on other anime of this genre. I would cite a few examples, but I'd prefer to avoid any spoilers so you see that for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that overall, Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood was a very captivating and enjoyable show, captivating me enough to take much breaks than most anime I have watched. I believe the masterpiece rating is indeed deserved for this one, although I wouldn't quite recommend it for starting audiences, as it would make their expectations of other anime series too high... then again I'm just kidding! You probably won't regret watching this one whatever audience you are from, but I can't tell you that for sure - you'll have to see for yourself.",

            "content": "I'm going to be completely honest here... this is my favorite anime I have ever seen. Why you ask? Simple: (besides a few irritations) there is nothing wrong with this show.\r\nThe story follows two brothers who live in a corrupted country in a world where alchemy is possible. After their mother dies, they try to perform the ultimate taboo of alchemy: human transmutation. The transmutation backfires and the younger brother (Al) loses his entire body and the older brother (Ed) loses his left leg. In order to bring Al back, Ed sacrifices his right arm to bond Al's spirit to a suit of armor. Now,with Ed having a mechanical arm and leg, and Al having a suit of armor for a body, they are willing to join the corrupted military in order to find a way to bring each others bodies back to their original form. Now tell me that story doesn't seem awesome to you? Story: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is simply fantastic. Since FMA:B is considered to be on the more \"shounen\" side of anime, animation is key to it's success. And, boy did they hit the nail on the head with the beautiful animation. Art: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is absolutely amazing! FMA:B has arguably the best dubs ever made. It is one of the rare instances where the dub is just as good as the sub, so watch it either way! As for the sound track? Oh my gawd... you haven't experienced true awesomeness until you've heard FMA:B's main theme! Not to mention that every single opening is absolutely breathtaking. Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that makes FMA:B so awesome is that everyone has a purpose behind their actions, and there is no such thing as a \"dull\" character in this anime. Even the biggest antagonist have a goal they are trying to accomplish, making even the biggest villains lovable. Characters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is never a dull moment in FMA:B where they just sit around doing nothing. There are rarely ever any filler episodes (if any at all), leaving the show to become full of wonderful twists and turns that will drag you in right away. Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDoes FMA:B have some flaws? Yeah, I guess. However, most of these flaws don't exactly work against the show as a whole. One of FMA:B's biggest flaw is the first ten or so episodes. It's not that they aren't interesting (trust me, they are) but rather they often can't tell when to be serious. However, even this flaw is something that anyone can look past, since the show itself is so enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nTo recap, FMA:B is nothing short of a masterpiece. The story is touching and sends a meaningful message. The art is breathtaking, and makes the action scenes that much more awesome. The soundtrack is a masterpiece in itself, and the dub is critically acclaimed as one of the best dubs ever. All the characters have so much depth that it's impossible to hate a single character of this anime. Finally, the anime was just flat out enjoyable from start to finish, grabbing the viewers attention from episode 1 and becoming more and more interesting as the show progresses. Overall: 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Ah, Fullmetal Alchemist, what an amazing ride through the world of alchemy, I'm not surprised at all it is #1 on MAL, since it also is, and probably will be, at least for a long time, #1 on my list.\r\n If you're reading you probably came here looking to see if you should watch this anime or if my opinion is the same as yours, and please do not forget what this is, MY review.\r\nLet us start with the best: The story - 10/10\r\nFullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood's plot is the most incredible thing I have seen in an anime, seriously, If i could, I would go andmeet Hiromu Arakawa and thank her for having an amazing imagination and ability to create and draw this masterpiece. You may be thinking \"Another fanboy, better find a real review\", and well, maybe you're right, but I have to praise what deserves to be praised, and this certaninly does.\\n\r\n Sure you can say the first episodes were a bit rushed, but wouldn't people still complain if they had slowed it down instead? For me the pacing of the story felt natural and that they did not need to waste the beginning of the series explaining the story since it is slowly explained as the anime progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art - 10/10\\n\r\nSometimes an anime can feel a little off when the art style does not please our eyes, even though the story is actually good, but this is definitely not the case. The art style is really enjoyable and I just loved those round faces!\\n\r\nThe fight scene, don't even get me started! The animation is gorgeous and Bones sure knows how to deliver well-animated fights with amazing angles and details that really make the watcher enjoy what the're watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound - 10/10\\n\r\nI can tell you this: I have every opening on my cellphone and I regularly listen to the ending songs and background music when I feel like listening to those serene and beautiful soundtracks or the epic songs from the  several fight scenes. The voice actors did an amazing job with every single character, and even though I did not watch the dubbed version, I did watch a couple of bits on youtube, and it sounded pretty well too. I don't think there's much else to say here, top notch as always.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters - 10/10\\n\r\nThe second best thing about Fullmetal Alchemist is it's characters. Every single character has a completely different personality and exceptional development, each one having their different reasons to act the way they do.\\n\r\nEven the villains are awesome, with their dark stories and troubled personalities that make our heros' journey be long and troublesome. It also has the best main villain of all time from any anime I've seen so far, that's a +1 right there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - In case it's not obvious by now, 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed every single episode from this amazing series which left me sitting on the edge of my seat with all the plot-twists and cliffhangers that followed the previous one, that with the awesome animation quality by Bones, beautiful soundtracks and lots of relatable characters with funny, troubled, brave and heartwarming personalities.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience that managed to surpass it's other version's \"awesomness\" and show us what anime truly is about, and that's how it managed to reach my #1 spot, truly a masterpiece that won't be forgotten anytime soon, at least by me it won't. :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Some moments are more breath taking than others, and I mean that in two ways. 1. The comedy often had me in tears, and breathless because of how hard I was laughing, and 2. Heart filled moments just hit you like a damn bus. 10\r\nArt: Oh my god the art is great. I am sure there were some flaws, because there are flaws in everything, but honestly if there were flaws I never caught them. Thecharacter design is great, but even just the scenery is fantastic. 10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The ost for this show is perfect. The voice acting for it is also perfect. I don't think I have watched another anime where I love the Japanese voices and the English. Fantastic job from everyone. 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh my god again perfection. The characters are all great. You basically grow up with Ed, and Al. There physical, and mental transitions are so subtle that you really feel like you are watching them grow. Some anime have time skips where they just skip like seven years and then just throw you in, but not This anime you watch them grow it is amazing. 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: My enjoyment is through the roof. FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece that I think is going to stand the fates of time well. I was never bored like I am with some anime. I was always hooked. My enjoyment and overall score are both 10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched this series I really really really recommend you dive in, and just let it hit you all at once.",

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) is not exactly like them. It is not the usual 'go on an adventure' type with dozens of episodes and fight scenes that all look the same. FMAB is more story-oriented and tactical.\r\nFirst, the story is very well wtitten and everything is properly planned out and coincides with each other bringing out every element in the right manner at the right time. The concept is really good with theright blend of fantasy and reality.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the brothers are the focus of the show, each and every character has a role to play and help develop the story accordingly and develop themselves as well. This keeps the viewers alive to every character.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are soo cool. You would love atleast 4 of 'em.\\n\r\nI am not bothered by animation/art, but it is really good though.\\n\r\nI also liked the fact that there were some great statements and quotes about life, you know.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, FMAB is one hilarious anime!! Then a little bit of drama and a little bit of a romance here and there gives it a proper outfit. I could recommend any type of person to watch this anime. For me it has become one of the classics\\n\r\nI saw this show when I was small and liked it instantly. Because I didn't see it properly I saw it again, and boy, was I glad I did! I loved every bit of it. Now I wouldn't say it doesn't have flaws, but why be a nit-picker when it is so enjoyable. No anime is perfect to everyone's mark afterall, eh",

There was some mind rape-type feelings when I watched it the first time through, though I forgot why. Lots of interesting twists, at least if you haven't had it partially spoiled for you. \r\nOverall score: 10\r\nArt- Mostly great, but I feel they only really took it up to 10 for fight scenes, while the other parts are not as fantastic, but still decent. As far as gore goes, this may or may have not been worse than Elfen Lied, andI've only seen clips of that, so... that's a plus I guess, but nothing will make me more grossed out than Naruto Shippuden, so not enough organs being torn out of living  bodies is what I guess I'm saying. A lot of other kinds nastiness though, like the faces of half-dead souls in limbo, bodies, gory scenes of a guy making heads essplode with no head but plenty of blood, and a LOT of failed scientific experiments. A LOT. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 9\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- Incredible breathtaking soundtrack, great Dub and Sub voice actors, and the sound effects weren't so bad that you could tell they were fake, so...\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Very interesting ones. Multiple psychos on both sides, rather complex and very simple personalities, Original character designs, interesting naming, and both hilarious and not-very-hilarious flaws for each of them. Not a giant, in-your-face amount of character development in the main cast, but they didn't need that much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: No questions asked. This is one of the best anime ever. I loved it. It was funny, It was sad. It had a little romance, and a lot of humor and a heluva lot of action. Also, they didn't yell their attack names, (cause they don't really have attack names) so that made it even cooler than it was before. \\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 10\\n",

            "content": "To this day my writing is influenced by Fullmetal Alchemist. I read the manga about ten years ago, but I still remember most of the characters by name. The author's vision and its execution were not without flaws, but the overall end result was sheer brilliance. The themes of loss, sacrifice and transformation are seamlessly integrated into the plot and character backstories.\r\nWhat makes this story exceptional is how universal its subject matters are. Everybody goes through growing pains, but in the case of the Elric brothers Edward and Alphonse, their transition into adulthood is nothing short of hardcore. The boys lost their mother, who theyliterally tried resurrecting, but in addition to failing miserably with the alchemical ritual, Edward lost two limbs and Alphonse his entire body. Turns out, despite the sheer magical potential of alchemy, it can't be used to bring people back to life.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a good reason why Fullmetal Alchemist has few peers. A story like this is impossible to create unless you've survived fucked up shit, possess the social support and intelligence to make sense of it and have the skills as a storyteller to convey those experiences. The author clearly thinks ill of shortcuts to personal growth (miracle cures, religion, etc.), evidenced by the first episode alone.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems obvious to point out the inspiration to this series is human darkness - even ethnic genocide makes it into the plot. It's astonishing how deep Fullmetal Alchemist goes with its harrowing concepts, yet rarely feels depressing. The characters talk about their emotions, then keep pushing forward, make new allies and grow as people. To be fair though, they don't actually get many chances to lament their misery, because the intense plot constantly whips them forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe main mysteries involving the plot are discovered shortly into the series, but the bad guys quickly clean house and cover everything up. This killing creates an incredible tension that sets the pace for the entire rest of the series. Not only that, but on many occasions the episode's cliffhanger is just brutal, reminiscent of Attack on Titan. Friendly advice: DON'T watch this series before bed, make the time to binge it!\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters is varied in genders, ages and body types. Their designs are focused and simplistic, though not without depth. Unlike how females are often drawn in anime, in Fullmetal Alchemist they look nice, but not overtly sexualized. There's also just about no fanservice. Even some of the evil characters are surprisingly humane, which indicates the author's ability for deep empathy. That's a real feat, considering the eyes she has for true darkness.",

Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are raised by their mother Trisha in the remote village of Risembool. Their father Hohenheim, a noted and very gifted alchemist, abandoned his family while the boys were still young, and while in Trisha's care they began to show an affinity for alchemy. However, when Trisha died ofa lingering illness, they were cared for by their best friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako. The boys traveled the world to advance their alchemic training under Izumi Curtis. Upon returning home, the two decide to try to bring their mother back to life with alchemy. However, human transmutation is a taboo, as it is impossible to do so properly. In the failed transmutation that results, Al's body is completely obliterated and Ed loses his left leg. In a last ditch attempt to keep his brother alive, Ed sacrifices his right arm to bring Al's soul back and houses it in a nearby suit of armor. After Edward receives automail prosthetics from Winry and Pinako, the brothers decide to burn their childhood home down (symbolizing their determination and decision of \"no turning back\") and head to the capital city to become government sanctioned State Alchemists. After passing the exam, Edward is dubbed the \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" by the State Military, and the brothers begin their quest to discover the nature of the fabled Philosopher's Stone, under the direction of Colonel Roy Mustang. Along the way, they discover a deep government conspiracy to hide the true nature of the Philosopher's Stone that involves the homonculi, the alkahestrists of the neighboring nation of Xing, the scarred man from the war-torn nation of Ishbal, and their own father's past.\\n\\n\r\nsound(10/10)\\n\r\nthe sound before fight is so great.The ending and opening theme songs were also great.The respective opening and ending themes for the first 14 episodes are \"Again\" by Yui, and \"Uso\" (\u5618?, lit. \"Lie\") by Sid. From episode 15-26, the respective opening and ending themes are \"Hologram\" by Nico Touches the Walls, and \"Let It Out\" by Miho Fukuhara.

From episodes 51-62, the respective opening and ending themes are \"Rain\" (\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3 Rein?) by Sid, and \"Ray of Light\" by Shoko Nakagawa. While episodes 63 and 64 do not use opening themes, they use \"Rain\" and \"Hologram\", respectively, for the endings.[6]\\n\\n\r\nAnimation(9/10)\\n\r\nanimation is very good, every character is unique and not overlapping, many animes have similar face characters which is very difficult to distinguish on watching 1 or 2 episodes but in FMA:Brotherhood characters are so peculiar and great in art.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter(9/10)\\n\r\ncharacter are neither too many nor too less, Elric, Edward and Elric, Alphonse are the main characters and present throughout the series.There are many other supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10)\\n\r\nThere are many funny scenes when people  thinks Elric, Alphonse as Edward and Edward gets angry when he is called Shorty...Too funny\\n\\n\r\noverall(10/10)\\n\r\nIt's a great masterpiece anime.\\n",

But for me is something more important than that, so let me try this again\u2026\r\nFMA: Brotherhood THE FIRST anime show I ever watched.\r\nLet me be honest with all of you, I started watching anime 3 years ago \u2013and manga a few months ago-, so in all honesty I am a newbie, but since the start \u2013my start- I\u2019ve been able to watch some of the most fantastic histories/shows of my life, leaving aside\u201creal\u201d \u2013and by real I mean with actors in flesh and blood- shows like: Twin Peaks, 24, Lost and others.\\n\\n\r\nI am lucky to have friends that have immersed themselves since children\u2019s in the anime world, an those friends showed me an amazing way to start watching anime, and amazingly, now I\u2019m doing this  review for a friend of mine \u2013and of course all those- that want\u2019s to start watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nSince the first time I started watching FMA: Brotherhood I heard very mixed reviews. Some call this one a masterpiece, some others call it a shameful thing in comparison with 2003-2004 FMA version.  But for me both versions are amazing, but I hold dear this version a little bit more for being my first anime show.\\n\\n\r\nFMA: Brotherhood is one of those \u201cweird\u201d anime that has everything and still their foundation holds perfectly because all the plots, all the drama, all the fights and scenes are \u201cone for all and all for one\u201d or in the words of the joker \u201cThey complete each other\u201d.\\n\r\nSo let us begin \u2013finally- this review.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-STORY: 10-\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly the story is neither great nor good. It\u2019s fantastic, original \u2013word that I don\u2019t use very often- amazingly developed, in other words an EPIC MATERPIECE.\\n\r\nFMA: Brotherhood attempts \u2013very closely- to follow the line designed in the original manga as opposed in the original Show. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s a story of friendship, of brotherhood, of moments filled with happiness and saddens, of regrets and treasured memories it has EVERYTHING.\\n\r\nAnd it has one of the most \u2013or probably- the most AMAZING ending of them all.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ART: 10- \\n\r\nIn all honesty \u201chuge pockets\u201d will always save everything, whether a movie, a TV SHOWS or an anime.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to see that the team that made \u201cFMA: Brotherhood\u201d a reality had a very good budget just by looking at the art. But let\u2019s not \u201cmess\u201d with the amazing work made by the ART Designers of this show, for it doesn\u2019t matter what we are talking about \u2013in the art department- it is easy on the eyes. So beautiful and inspiring.\\n\r\nThe characters are probably my favorite part/design in an anime that was made perfectly.\\n\\n\\n\r\n -SOUND: 10-\\n\r\nLet me tell you this, FMA: Brotherhood soundtrack is the first soundtrack I downloaded -from an anime- it\u2019s mesmerizing, it\u2019s perfect.\\n\r\nIf I remember correctly no other anime has made me sing their main theme: \u201cAgain\u201d by \u201cYUI\u201d or a song like \u201cLapis Philosophorum\u201d.\\n\r\nAnd most importantly it doesn\u2019t matter if you watch the anime subbed or dubbed, it\u2019s amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a soundtrack that is memorable, a soundtrack that can change the mood of the moment by itself without the need of words nor actions.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER: 10-\\n\r\nTo call anything in this show \u201cthe jewel of the crown\u201d is honestly a waste of time after all, the wholeness of the show IS THE \u201cjewel of the crown\u201d. But I WILL waste my time by naming the CHARACTERS of this show THE \u201cjewels of the crown\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single character is memorable and distinguishable. All of them are entertaining and most importantly everyone shines on their own way. Ed in all honesty is one of my favorite characters of all time, Roy Mustang is a character filled with life\u2026 wait EVERY SINGLE one is filled with life, something that isn\u2019t easy to make, they shine whether individually or in a group. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT & OVERALL: 10-\\n\r\nThis is one of those shows that everything is perfect.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a masterpiece, an anime worthy of your attention and love.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before \u201cmost epic anime show of all history\u2026 in other words THE masterpiece.\u201d\\n\r\nThat line is enough to describe this show.\\n\\n\r\n Thank you for reading.",

            "content": "I, personally, love everything about Fullmetal, for not only is it an amazing anime, full of an incredible amount of heart and soul,  but it was also the first anime that really introduced me to the beautiful world of manga, anime and Japanese culture. Whilst not being the first anime i ever watched, (dragon ball z being the first, followed by Nartuo (which i personally never really liked), it was the first anime that i completed fully. So, to my surprise, in 2010, after about a 3 year break from anime, when i came across the title Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, i was surprised thatthe story wasn't over yet, (i never had access to the internet until the age of 13, this being in 2010, and the library where i got my manga didn't have the complete volumes of Fullmetal), yet i decided to ignore it, only until recently i decided to watch it, due to my passion for anime coming back in 2013, and i gotta say, every moment, every minute was absolutely astonishing and to this day Fullmetal Alchemist will always have a special place in my heart and will always be my favorite anime. :3\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story of FMA:B is basically the tale of 2 brothers, Ed and Al, who after performing a forbidding type of Alchemy called  Human Transportation to bring their dead mother back to life end-up not only failing to bring their mother back to life but also sacrificing their bodies, Ed losing his arm and leg, whilst his brother AL is locked to a suit of armor. The story of Fullmetal Alchemist is rich, full of brilliant themes and ideas that at times can be absolute tear-jerkers, to dark undertones, such as genocide, corruption, lust, greed, envy and wrath. The whole story is essentially a journey to reclaim what has been lost and a chance at redemption (for example ED AND AL trying to re-gain their lost limbs). Everything about the plot to full-metal is almost flawless, the ending is absolutely spectacular leaving absolutely no plot holes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: the art is simplistic, yet captivating. I absolutely loved the art style, i found it very re-refreshing and the character designs where amazing, all handled by my personal favorite animation company BONES.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music in Fullmetal is absolutely brilliant, especially the opening and closing songs. All music does a fantastic job at showing the themes and the underlining feel of the show, a chance of redemption and to find what has been lost. Over the Dub and the Sub, for fullmetal, i would have to go with the DUB, every performance is top-notch, not one bad bit of dialog, yet you can never go wrong for the 2, sub and dub, both are top-notch. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: i refuse to explain how incredible they are, watch it, for the love of god, watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I gave the anime a goddamn 10/10, i love almost everything about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: WATCH IT, READ IT, BUY IT, worth all of your money.\\n\\n\r\n(compared to the original i believe they are both amazing peaces f work that must be seen)",

            "content": "Okay, so this is only my third review at this point, meaning that my reviewing pants are still a little tight and don't cup the goods just right yet, but I'm a firm advocate of sink or swim and, this being a review of one of the most popular [and currently highest rated] shows on MAL, I figure that I'll either be met with wild success or consigned to the murky depths of obscurity.\r\nRight, so I'd like to go into this saying that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shining beacon of hope amongst the fetid mire of what counts for shounen today. My own personalbiases aside, I have never seen an anime that so completely earned its rating of 10 by being so consistently competent in just about every category. The merits of its predecessor, Fullmetal Alchemist, may be widely disputed, but there is no doubt that Brotherhood is one of the best anime that I've had the pleasure of watching and arguably the most well rounded shounen out there. Now, being the pleb that I am, I've never actually read the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, and therefore cannot attest to how closely the show follows it, but those of you who watched the original will find that, up to a certain point, it treads pretty much the same ground as its predecessor; beyond that point, the two stories diverge wildly with the introduction of the neighboring country of Xing [China, basically] and the squinty-eyed badasses that hail from it. On an off note, I always thought it odd that, in most anime, the Japanese characters look for all the world like young white teenagers, but when you introduce a Chinese guy, it's all \"harrows\" and squinty-eyes from there.  At any rate, the Xingese characters really put the militaristic regime of Amestris [the setting of most of the story] into perspective, but I'll get to them later.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is excellently paced, chronicling the Elric Brothers' journey to get their bodies back and their subsequent discoveries about the nature of alchemy itself. This sets the perfect premise for an exciting story that explores the consequences of human transmutation and the myriad of other complex moral issues presented by something such as alchemy. It also [frequently] touches on the physical and emotional repercussions of war, and the use of alchemists as a military asset, but my favorite part of the story is perhaps that it finally elucidates on Houenheim, the boys' father, who was an enigmatic figure throughout the entirety of the original, and his curious relation to the show's behind-the-scenes antagonist [of whom, by the way, is far more interesting than the original's]. I would elaborate more on the story itself, but I'll abstain from it for fear of spoiling any plot twists or revelations, of which there are many. The only real complaints that I have are that FMA:B suffered once or twice from your typical stilted anime dialogue and odd anime morality. This isn't to say that the characters weren't all consistent and believable in their decision making, they really were,  but there was one point where a character, in an incredibly justified fit of rage, was about to kill someone who clearly deserved to die [that he'd been looking for throughout the whole show in fact], but was stopped. Why? Because afterwards he \"wouldn't be the same.\" I imagine not; he'd probably have quite a load off his chest and walk with a little more skip in his step in my opinion, but everyone else may as well have been quoting Star Wars, what with their \"if you strike him down in anger, then you\u2019ll give in to it yourself,\u201d as though avenging countless lives is paramount to joining the Dark Side. I'd say that scene was absolutely confusing, but it actually contributed to an interesting bit of characterization for one of the bad guys; and besides, only a Sith deals in absolutes. \\n\r\nAnother [in fact, the only other] gripe that I had was with how they treated the beginning, which, as I mentioned before, is roughly the same as the original's [which was quite dark], except for some reason they thought it\u2019d be a good idea to throw more Cartoon Faces in there. I mean, I understand throwing in a little humor for the sake of levity when things are getting too grim, but when a girl is contemplating murder after being coerced with promises of reuniting with her deceased boyfriend, having her aim at the wrong person just to throw in another \"haha, Ed is short\" joke doesn't quite cut it. Not to mention that one of the times Al went into \"cartoon\" mode during a funny scene it struck me that he looked an awful lot like a big grey condom, a thought which I just couldn't shake off for the rest of the show. Aside from that, the story is pretty much flawless.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, while Ed and Al are obviously the main duo, what with them being featured prominently on the box art, they can't really be said to be the only main characters. Brotherhood also follows a fairly sizable cast of interesting characters, showing no particular favor to any one of them, instead opting to diligently flesh out each and every one of their individual journeys; including among them an ambitious military officer's campaign to root out dangerous enemies on the inside and rise among the ranks of his fellow soldiers to the esteemed title of Fuhrer [which I understand sounds suspicious to anyone post 1945, but despite obvious comparisons, Amestris isn't Nazi Germany], to the survivor of a domestic genocide [okay... maybe it is] and his quest for vengeance, with a whole array of compelling characters in between. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm on the topic of characters: if you were to ask me which of those  were my favorite, I'd be a genuine loss; every one of them is consistent and interesting, and they compose what is certainly one of my favorite casts in anime or media in general. I must, however, award special merit to a few: King Bradley, for perfectly encapsulating all that is man; fearless, pertinacious, and unrepentant. Riza Hawkeye and Roy Mustang, for being the most well-rounded female character and the most relatable badass respectively. Houenheim, for having a beard worthy of Rider himself, and...\\n\r\nActually, you know what? Never mind, all of them were amazing. Not to mention that FMA:B sports the biggest cast of female badasses that I've seen since Black Lagoon. A few characters are necessary to mention however, such as the new Xingese characters, Ling Yao [and his guards Lan Fan and Fuu], and Shao May [possibly one of the most refreshingly competent kids I've seen in anime], who are introduced around the time that Brotherhood starts coming into its own, and add a lot of supplementary lore about the world surrounding Amestris; also the Homunculi, because I really enjoyed how most of their deaths seemed to be accompanied by some underlying theme that corresponded to their respective traits. While there is so much to love, the thing that I find most impressive about the characters is that seemingly all of them are relevant. Honestly. I can't tell you how many characters were introduced that I immediately pegged as throwaways, but come the end of the show there they are, doing things. Important things. No single character can be considered the product of bad writing and they all experience growth and development in their respective arcs, oftentimes as a result of their novel interactions with the rest of the cast. By the way, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the battles, this being a shounen and all. The animation is top notch for the fights this time around and you can tell that the development team went all out on each and every one; this show sports some of the most well animated fighting that I've seen. Not to mention that the action is pretty clever, and revolves around the use of tactics as opposed to power levels, meaning that the winner of any one confrontation was entirely circumstantial and therefore appropriately suspenseful. Every encounter is fast paced and exhilarating, and thankfully so, because there are plenty of them.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the music and voice acting are superb. I personally watched Brotherhood dubbed, and would highly recommend it myself, because how often do you get to enjoy a genuinely outstanding dub? I tried the sub as well and found the voice acting similarly inspired; I really only chose the dub for the sheer novelty of actually getting to listen to a competent English cast. Each voice actor did an amazing job and matched their character perfectly. Ed and Al were voiced splendidly, easily conveying an entire range of emotions, Bradley was a warm family man and a menacing leader in the same breath, you could hear Roy's pain at his past molded into fuel for his ambition for the future, and of course, I could listen to Alex Louis Armstrong FOR GENERATIONS! The music was likewise impressive; this was actually one of few anime where I listened to every single opening song, every time. The OST as a whole was grand and, though some were perhaps initially overused, I never once found the BGM to be jarring or unfitting to the scene. Brotherhood also knows when to use silence; a valuable skill that many shows haven't quite gotten the hang of. Absolutely no qualms in the audio department.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant pool of trite shounen anime; the story is captivating, the fights are thrilling, and the characterization is exemplary. Sure it may have its flaws, like that stupid \u201cno confirmation of [romantic] feelings [to each other] until the very end\u201d thing that anime does, but that\u2019s a minor thing when compared to the tour de force of competency that is Brotherhood. There\u2019s a reason that it\u2019s resting comfortably at #1 after all.\\n",

            "content": "I was dreading having to make my way through Brotherhood at some point considering my high regard for the first series and not really liking the manga adaptation's more conventional plot developments. But considering enough people were praising the daylights out of Brotherhood and some even boasting that the first series was no longer relevant, I decided to check things out for myself and see what got people giddy over this adaptation of the series. And after venturing my way through Brotherhood, I would have to say that those calling the first series irrelevant are ridiculous considering both titles have completely different takes on theirsource material and the handling of them that whichever series you prefer would depend on what you are looking for in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn Brotherhood's case, it takes the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and makes a more closer adaptation of the source material which is quite focused on world building and creating a grand scale plot coming out of the Elrics finding out details about the Philosopher's Stone and eventually finding out about a national conspiracy and heinous plot connected to the Homunculus and powerful figures in the Amestris military. This take on FMA does follow a more conventional plot than the first TV series as much of the complex characterization found with prominent characters in the original series is greatly toned down with Brotherhood creating a more plot-focused series and morality with many characters being more black and white as the series has more purely \"good\" and \"bad\" characters with the former being always right in their convictions within the series and the latter having no redeemable traits and being wrong in their actions. With me believing that good characters in an anime should be morally grey with flawed heroes and villains with redeemable traits, I wasn't digging Brotherhood's conventional take on characters.\\n\\n\r\nBrotherhood did have some elements that I did get some enjoyment out of. With Brotherhood being more focused on world building and plot advancement, the series expands more on the world of the series than what the first series did by introducing more branches of the military and some other countries neighboring Amestris, particularly Xerxes and Xing. This also allows the introduction of some new characters in the series with several characters from Xing and within the military that Ed and Al befriend and ally with when dealing with the Homunculus and the conspiracy they uncover. In addition, some characters from the original series who were underdeveloped and not having much screen time (Hohenheim, Alex Armstrong and Roy Mustang's men being prominent examples) are given more focus in this series, get some moments of fleshing out and are given bigger roles to play.\\n\\n\r\nStill though, there are enough issues I have with Brotherhood that outweigh the praises I give it above. The show's first 12-13 episodes run at a fast pace providing little time to connect with characters introduced and with the events of those episodes having been portrayed in the first series, Bones appeared to have intentionally sped through the events to get going with what wasn't covered by the first series. With Bones more closely following the manga's storyline for Brotherhood, these earlier episodes had featured a major flaw to FMA manga-ka Hiromu Arakawa's earlier chapters in that her fast advancement of events gave little time for emotional investment from readers in regards to how characters reacted to major events that shook their resolves as the lack of time and depth on plotting in earlier chapters did kill their quality to a great extent. With the slower pacing and greater character focus found in FMA's first series, Arakawa had adopted these elements to a degree with her storytelling in later chapters which helped improve the quality of her writing.\\n\\n\r\nI also found myself getting quite irritated with the show's comedy getting in the way of more serious moments. This was quite prominent in Brotherhood's earlier episodes where moments of slapstick and characters going super-deformed killed the suspense of serious moments. While the series does tone down on these moments in later episodes as the plot gets darker and more serious, they still pop up on occasion and when they do, I still found them to be a mood killer during most scenes.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the praises I gave for new characters and expanded depth on underdeveloped characters who appeared in the original series, I couldn't give the same thing for a majority of other characters who appeared in the first series. Brotherhood's portrayal of these characters are more conventional and less complex as heroic characters aren't confronted with any possible flaws to their actions and personal beliefs; as well as all the villains being so shallowly evil that they're laughable and I could care less if they get beaten up and killed off.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episodes to a good extent also felt quite contrived with how things progress just to allow all the surviving characters to have a good ending. A number of moments were deus ex machina thrown in for villains to be defeated through means which the series never explored and they kind of cheapen how I felt about the hardships faced by the Elrics and other prominent characters to get what they desire.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, visual details with Brotherhood are a bit simpler than the first series with color tones being more subdued. This is especially prominent with background designs in many shots as their quality looks quite washed out compared to scenery found in the foreground. Still, character designs of those from the original series still look the same as they were from over five years ago. While animation shortcuts are apparent in a good number of shots in Brotherhood, the series does have its animation highlights with the occasional fluid fight sequence and some good fight scenes involving Envy's true form.\\n\\n\r\nFor music, much of Brotherhood's insert music consists of stringed and piano pieces that do well at complementing the peaceful and intense moments seen throughout the series. On the other hand, many of the OP and ED musical choices chosen for the series consisted of some generic J-Pop and J-Rock that hardly grabbed my interest, though the first OP, Yui's again, did well at fitting with Brotherhood's mood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found my perceptions of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to be no different from when I read the manga. It goes for a more conventional style of storytelling compared to the first FMA series and while it does have its moments of good quality involving character focus and world building, its more plot heavy and conventional focus drives it to lose much of the complexity given to prominent characters of the first series and the poor quality to its plotting in its beginning and ending episodes does kill quite a bit of the plot buildup that I would be expected to care about. While a worthwhile watch to those craving an epic-style action-adventure series or wanting a more faithful adaptation of the FMA manga, those wanting better characterization and solid drama with the series (in my case) would be better off seeing the 2003 anime adaptation of FMA.",

            "content": "\"Alchemy: The science of reconstructing and deconstructing matter\"\r\nFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of those anime that's really hard to stop watching once you begin. I remember the first time I watched it, I wanted to keep watching more to find out what happens, but I'll admit at first I did not enjoy it since there were many things I did not understand, but as I watched it again three years later, I enjoyed every bit of it. Following the manga closer than its 2003 counterpart, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is an example of how an action anime should be done.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is one of thebetter written stories in anime. It follows through with its consistency, its somewhat original, and has you intrigued all the way through. There's a major buildup to the final villain of the series, and the buildup pays off quite well. The story has its share of twists and many times, the show is unpredictable at times, which is always a good thing. There are times when the series gets too action-heavy, though and it seems to drag a little. Nothing too bad. I also thought that the beginning episodes with the deaths of certain characters were rushed in comparison to the first series. There's a lot of suspension of disbelief moments in the action scenes as well, such as people losing gallons of blood but still somehow alive or some moves performed by characters. And the whole \"military is secretly evil\" plotline is a bit cliched if you ask me. Other than that, the story is really well-done, I believe.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat more can I say? The art direction is amazing. The detailed character drawings, the animation in the fight scenes, the drawings in comedic and depressing scenes. I'd say that the artwork fits the show's dark story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nOh man, I could go on and on about this. The soundtrack of this series is damn amazing. In fact, I am listening to it as I'm writing this review. Every soundtrack is beautifully orchestrated, and fits each scene well. They are a joy to listen to while watching the show, as well as when doing other activities. The openings and endings chosen for the show are also excellent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nEach and every character in this series is interesting and memorable. Even someone as useless as Yoki becomes useful. All of them go through development and you truly feel for what the characters are going through. I can definitely say that these characters were integrated into the story extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWith the copious amounts of action (Wrath and Pride!!), the great story, and the lovable characters, this show is nothing but enjoyment. I'd recommend it to anyone: anime lover or not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nDon't miss out on this one. There's a reason as to why this anime is the number one ranked on MAL.",

            "content": "Before I go into this review, I'm just going to say that I actually like FMAB. It is a good anime, and definitely a must watch. That said, there are just a few things about it that just rub me the wrong way.\r\n   First of all, the story. It starts out dark, atmospheric, and complicated, just like the first anime, but unfortunately the story loses most of that atmosphere about a quarter of its way into the story, where as FMA was able to maintain that feeling of brooding tension from beginning to end. The pacing is terrible as well,and the reason of this is also the main reason as to why the story loses its feel: the first act.  Arkawa wrote the manga in a fairly clean three part story;\\n\r\n-the first act (which concludes with Greed's spoiler)\\n\r\n-the second act (Briggs)\\n\r\n-the third act (Promise Day)\\n\r\nThe problem with the first act isn't in its composition, indeed, in terms of composition I'd say that that the first act is the best of the three. Its all in the manner in which the story is told. The entire first act is blasted through in about 15 episodes, followed by a choppy, confusing transition into the second part. The rest of the story suffers as a result, as the second act is entirely plot driven with little space for development with the main characters, which in turn leads to the feeling that you're not actually watching a story as much as you are just watching people you don't care about do things for hours on end. The third act is admittedly outstanding, but there is still a slight feeling of indifference radiated by several characters and certain events take an absurd amount of time to come to pass. There is a reason for this pacing problem, that problem being that the show seemingly expects people to have watched the first series and tries not to bore them with the first act. Which is completely and utterly idiotic given the unbreakable golden rule of adaptations: never assume that the audience has seen the original or read the book. The ending is a mixed bag as well. Its undeniably satisfying, but it is also far too simple and happy for such a complex series.\\n\r\n   The cast of Brotherhood is a mixed bag, some characters (Ed, Alphonse, Scar, Izumi, Major Armstrong) are solid, but not as good they were in the original. Others (pretty much just Mustang and Winry) are better than they were in the original due to a higher level of focus and more interesting subplots. A few characters, unfortunately, are either boring archetypes or just plain useless. May Chang and Yoki have practically no purpose in the story other than to be love interests or comedy relief. There is no depth to their characters and no real purpose (May Chang does introduce a new kind of Alchemy to the main characters, but that could have also been done just as easily by Ling giving Ed a book or something), so when they get in danger or die, the audience has no reason to give a damn other than \"Well, I thought she was kind of cute.\".  The worst character, however, is easily Olivier Mira Armstrong, and believe me (or hate me, which is probable) when I say that this character is the literal epitome of almost everything wrong with modern media. So many people these days fall in love with characters just because they subvert gender/racial stereotypes, which isn't even remotely close to being a reason to like a character (unless if you in turn are racist or sexist). Olivier Mira Armstrong isn't well rounded, has no character development other than a cliche growing of fondness towards her \"weak\" brother, and does absolutely nothing other than order others around and act like a badass (and by badass I mean backstabbing old guys and getting her ass handed to her by the dumbest character in the series). We never see Olivier laugh, cry, get scared, or do anything other. Good character my ass. As for the villains, there is some good and some bad. Pride and Kimblee are awesome, though I still prefer the orginal Kimblee. Envy is a decent one as far as generic psychopaths are concerned, and the Azula moment that he pulls against Mustang towards the end is spectacularly handled. Wrath on the other hand is a badass but forgettable, and his moment of goodness in the end felt horribly contrived. The big bad lead villain works, but is basically a less subtle Voldemort with a vendetta against God. Once again, badass, but forgettable.\\n\r\n  As far as art goes, FMAB is okay. Some things look a bit too round (Mustang literally looks like a five year old) and Edward's hair takes even longer to get used to. The action, animation, soundtrack, and voice acting are all brilliant and help ease you through the story where the pacing and the tension fails.\\n\r\n  Overall, Brotherhood is a pretty good series, as long as you don't think too much about the ending or tha pacing or the characters. Just enjoy the ride and don't expect the masterpiece that the MAL community might pressure you into believing it is.",

FAB is an action,adventure,psychological,thriller,drama,comedy anime also having a slight touch of romance. The anime has done an exceptional work in combining all the geners and has balanced it perfectly.\r\nFAB tells the story of two brothers who lost their bodies while trying to bring their dead mother back to life. So they go in search of a stone which amplifies the power of an alchemist called the philosepher's stone.\r\nFAB has got an amazing story which makes you wanna keep on watching it and each episode has got its own twist. Every single episode iscrucial and even skipping one could make you totally clueless. Also, its got an unusual attraction and watching each episode will make you wanna see more. \\n\\n\r\nThen comes the characters. Every single characters are likable and respectable. As the story progresses there is a very good character development. The feelings, emotions, friendship, love and resolve of the characters leave a deep scar in your heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has got a good Art. Also the detailing and the way the characters are potrait are all magnificent. The characters are potrait in a way which goes well with their personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime seems to be a perfection in whatever way you look at it. Especially, in sound. The voice given to most of the MCs are top notch and it matches the characters. Also, I think the English Dubbers did a good job, mainly Edward Elric's voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nFAB is an anime which delivers a promise to the people that just reads its name. The anime is sure to give you a taste of some fine exitement and suspense. Unlike others, this one can be a treat for your whole family.\\n\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood is an anime having its own class. A mind blowing piece of work that can make everyone satisfied of their life. Personally I think FAB is a hundred times better than FMA.

            "content": "Have you ever gotten that feeling of overwhelming sadness once you finish an anime/manga because you know there will never be another one like it in its genre? That was the feeling I got when I finished Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\r\nAfter the controversy of the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime deviating greatly from the manga, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was created as a completely faithful adaptation of the manga. Despite being a shounen series, Brotherhood adopts a unique, more mature approach to action shounen anime while still retaining the basic qualities of the genre.\r\nThe series takes place in a small, but powerful country called Amestris that mirrors NaziGermany. Amestris is a militaristic totalitarian country in which its most powerful figure (well, sorta) is the head of the military, addressed as F\u00fchrer. There are many other historical references, including imperialistic desires, trench warfare, and an event similar to the Holocaust, and they help us to understand the situation Amestris is in at the start of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the journey of teenage alchemists Edward and Alphonse Elric, brothers determined to get back their original bodies after a deadly accident following a failed Human Transmutation. As they try to find the legendary Philosopher\u2019s Stone, an all-powerful item that can purportedly return them to their bodies, it becomes apparent that this mysterious object is tied in to every single conflict Amestris has been in. Unlike other shounens\u2019 plots, which are tailored to maximize fighting, FMA\u2019s plot is intriguing and full of genuine suspense. At its core though, the series is an endearing story about the resilient bond between two brothers who\u2019ll never give up until they achieve their goal, despite seemingly impossible odds and obstructing obstacles.\\n\\n\r\nIn the series, alchemy is a blend of supernaturalism and chemistry that essentially takes an object and changes or transmutes it into a different object. A highly practical ability, alchemy can be used for medical purposes, fighting, building, etc. As an aspiring science major, this is one part of the series that really impressed me. For instance, there is a scene where Ed is forced to fight a character that can shield his body with diamond, one of the hardest substances on earth. After realizing the makeup of the shield, Ed transmutes the diamond into graphite (both are allotropes of carbon), a much more brittle substance. All the carbon atoms were still present, but now they were rearranged to weaken the shield. The incorporation of chemistry gives the fights so many possibilities. The Law of Conservation of Mass is somewhat applied to alchemy in the concept called Equivalent Exchange. Whatever the amount you use is the amount you receive. Of course, one of the powers of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the ability to defy this rule of Equivalent Exchange, a reason why it is so coveted.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the fighting in this series is relegated to close combat (until the final battle). Usually, the combatants are armed with some type of weapon, or if they\u2019re alchemists, they can also transmute projectiles. But sometimes, the fights are as simple as hand to hand combat. Few people have truly unique abilities, especially since most fighting alchemists have similar abilities and the normal people can\u2019t use any supernatural abilities anyway, so you won\u2019t see crazy destructive powers like those of Naruto or Bleach. However, don\u2019t misconstrue the fights to be any less exciting. The action is just as exhilarating, and with the inclusion of alchemy, we often see incredible environmental manipulation. Strategy is important, so the alchemic principle of understanding is sometimes crucial in fights. However, as a shounen that is more plot-driven than most, some of the fights are rather one-sided. After all, fights are supposed to be decided quickly, not take up several episodes and waste our times. Many of the fights serve to advance the plot, so more than anything, we see character development and learn more about the events preceding the series during these fights.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are easily the best part of the series. There are many of them, and they all serve specific roles in the series. The most important ones are given fleshed-out backstories, and through these, we learn about their unique personalities, values, and internal conflicts, as well as get a sense of what exactly happened to lead up to the actual events of the series. Each character has some sort of goal that they hope to achieve, be it a return to a previous life, revenge, becoming the next F\u00fchrer, or achieving immortality. The main antagonists of the series are the Homunculus, an immortal group of near-invincible creatures with human exteriors. There are seven of them, each one representing one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and much of their personalities and goals are based upon their respective sins. Their mysterious \u201cFather\u201d is the one who created them. These characters are far from one-dimensional. Their psychological conflicts and emotional backgrounds really help you empathize with them. In fact, Fullmetal Alchemist has spawned a number of my favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow, despite all the praise I\u2019ve given to Brotherhood, it does have a few setbacks, although whether these can be called setbacks depends on the viewer. The show often likes to resort to light-hearted slapstick comedy typical of a shounen series. Accompanying this is the occasional use of the chibi style of art. Some people may find this aggravating, although I personally have no problem with it. Also, the pacing of the series is somewhat inconsistent. Initially, the series moves rather quickly, resolving conflicts in only one or two episodes. At times, this gave the series an episodic feel. However, the pacing becomes much more streamlined towards the middle. Towards the latter part of the series, the pacing slows down considerably, and the final arc pretty much occurs within the span of a few hours. Again though, I found no problem with this personally, and the way the show was paced at different parts worked well with the occurrences in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very suitable for the atmosphere of the show, giving an eerie, serious, ethereal, heartwarming, tragic, or lively feel depending on the scene. It\u2019s not exactly memorable though, but it works. All the OPs and EDs are fairly good as well. On the other hand, the voice acting is perfect for the characters, especially Ed\u2019s voice. Emotions are flawlessly conveyed through the voice actors. The animation is also fantastic. The fight scenes are exciting and flow well. No choppy movements. Occasionally, the faces do look somewhat disfigured and disproportionate (often times Mustang\u2019s), but other than that, the artwork is detailed and generally solid.\\n\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience. Its world is so intricate, but gradually, everything is explained in full detail, and it truly is beautifully crafted.  This isn\u2019t just another shounen anime. Its incorporation of political, religious, psychological, and philosophical elements and its focus on plot over fighting definitely make it a much more mature series than your typical shounen. At the same time, its slapstick comedy and grand fights are the reason for its shounen tag, but that\u2019s not a bad thing. Also, this is the only action series that has invoked any serious emotion in me, showing that I actually cared about these characters. It is unfortunate to see it end, but all good things must eventually come to an end. This is a shounen that\u2019s done right.",

            "content": "People tell me that I am too old for Japanese cartoons (those people are specifically idiots that prefer to say cartoons rather than anime). Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood aired 5 years ago so it classifies as an old anime but get this, I am never going to be too old and too late to watch FMA: B. \r\nFor some reason, otaku members in MAL may or may not be tired of seeing reviews that has a score of ten in FMAB. To those who are sick of seeing reviews like this saying how awesome Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is, well you guys better get usedto it. After all, this show is by far the most epic thing I have ever seen in my entire life and I\u2019m not just saying that because I am a fandom of it. The moment I first watched it, I was completely addicted and it became my instant favorite. (You may want to skip the third paragraph because I went through a long way before watching FMA: B but if you are interested on the story, fine with me.)\\n\\n\r\nOkay, this anime was never my decision to watch and it comes with a whole journey of doubt. Last 2010, I was amazed after seeing Soul Eater and I became a huge fan of it. I used to go to this website called animecrazy.net (You guys may never heard of this website but it was removed some year ago or years ago) and it has this section called \u201cMost Popular Anime of all time\u201d and every time I view it I see Soul Eater at number 9 which makes me happy; however, as months pass, it goes to spot #13 and I was completely mad and to think the anime that beat Soul Eater was Fairy Tail and Full Metal Alchemist/Brotherhood. I had a huge grudge on those two shows so I promised that I will never betray Soul Eater (hardcore fan girl right?) but that assurance was broken until now. I watched shows that were really crappy before seeing Full Metal. For example, 12 anime shows that completely tell nothing but friendship and getting a boyfriend and some shows with potential but with plot holes and open endings. I never really felt so bored. Not even a single anime left me with an incredible impression for the reason that most of them never gave me a superb feeling like what SE handed me years ago. Until one day, I was watching Baccano! And saw a recommendation about Full Metal so I did it and broke my pledge. I deceived SE but I never thought that it was going to be my best decision EVER!\\n\\n\r\nFull Metal Alchemist has a great story because each arc has a connection with one another. The first arc is the goal of getting Al and Ed their bodies back. The second arc is the villain\u2019s plan which I will not tell you because I am not going to be a spoiler. The third arc is a clan\u2019s mission in finding immortality in order to save their culture. The fourth arc is the anti-hero\u2019s plan of seeking revenge on the military. If you think that\u2019s all, think again. There are more back stories, more characters to invade, more unexpected happenings and more development on every character\u2019s relationship. What makes it unique is that it uses Alchemy which is an ancient part of Chemistry (which is being taught to students of our era). Alchemy for some people claims to be magic of some sort but believe it or not it helped produced Chemistry that we know of today. This show is mainly talking about alchemy and it made it look so damn good. Some people will think that it\u2019s going to be a boring show because it talks about a philosophical science but it is more than that. There will be a unexplainably awesome adventure for you guys with comedy, drama (lots of it), action, and surprisingly, a little subtle romance. I give the plot an outstanding 10 because face it, Arakawa-sensei made a story like no other. It is unique, incomparable and marvelous in a million levels. Sure, people will think that I am exaggerating a bit and yes there are flaws in this anime like there are some clich\u00e9 ticks; nevertheless, it is quite different because there are no fillers and Brotherhood is straight to the point, a little fast paced and of course, the episode that capped everything is undoubtedly superior and satisfactorily complied with my expectations and even surpassed it. \\n\\n\r\nAniplex and Funimation had become popular in every anime show. Both organizations never fails to amaze me with their techniques when it comes to graphics but I won\u2019t lie, the art is just very good and it did its best for a 2009 show by depicting very iconic styles and motifs. The background can be a little simple like its lacking details and animation. The colors were just nicely done. They know when to make a vibrant scene and a when to put a shadowy effect. Everything was just balanced and pleasing. People may observe it as mediocre but it did a splendid job for the graphics. Considering how it has a more modern impact unlike the original 2003 FMA, it also has great animation schemes.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best points in FMA: B is their OST or original soundtrack. Every anime that has Bones as their producer really has excellent music that you won\u2019t absolutely ignore (take OHSHC, CB and SE for example). For the opening songs, my biggest recommendation and the song that I really liked is Yui\u2019s Again. It has a rather lavishing drama and courage mixed into it. It has a dramatic entry at first but it has a catchy tone in the latter part of it. The third opening, Golden Time Lover is also convincing and fun to listen to because it has rock music and it is also upbeat and likable. The fourth opening is great too, Period by Chemistry has a slow and not too quick rhythm but it uses electric guitar as its main tune. The second opening is full hope and has more happiness into it. Rain is just too all over the place but the video that comes along with the song helps. It is good but it just wasn\u2019t notable for me. The endings were just as grand as the OPs. The best among the rest is Miho Fukuhara\u2019s Let it Out (which is better than Frozen\u2019s Let it Go) because it is the song that never gets out of my head. It is very iconic and very dramatic. It made me cry so hard every time it plays with a very sad moment in FMA: B. I loved it so much and is willing to make it as my favorite Otaku song. Uso, Shunkan Sentimental, and Ray of Light were all good and aspiring to hear. The blend of RnB and Alternative Rock was splendid (am I right). For Tsunaida Te, I disliked it because of the rap that goes along with the piano it didn\u2019t blend with the slow and steady melody. For the sound effects, some were quite repetitive but hey, that\u2019s what makes it iconic and memorable. When it plays somewhere you\u2019ll know that it is Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood\u2019s soundtrack. The voice actors were flawless. They placed all the great emotions at the right time and the right place. Whether they need to be funny, sad, and emotionally fine they did it at the greatest quality as possible. Although, I am not fond of the English dub in many anime shows, FMA: B\u2019s English dub was distinct. The Japanese dub is great too but the English dub was more hilarious. I was just a little concerned with Ed\u2019s voice in the Japanese dub because Paku Romi is good at Edward\u2019s younger voice but when Ed became a little older, she should\u2019ve made her voice a little deeper but no sweat, she is a girl after all. In the English dub Vic Minogna\u2019s voice was flexible at all costs. Kugimiya Rie and the English dub actors of Alphonse did an exceptional job (they were too many I can\u2019t distinguish who was who). The others were awesome too making this anime lively and entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are also one of the strongest potential of Brotherhood. Of course, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric were a great main character duo. Both were entertaining and somehow have various personalities. Individually, they are different but both are awesome protagonists. The supporting casts were explicit from Roy Mustang to the villains. I didn\u2019t hate any character in this anime. Each and every one of them was lovable and funny. Yeah, so some of them have the common personality like the pervert, the overly protective main character and the defenseless girl but somehow they are all fantastic when seen together and they also have unique characteristics. (Take Note: I mistook Edward as a girl and Al as a robot, I am so stupid, am I the only one though?)\\n\\n\r\nIf giving enjoyment an infinity I would've done it by now but sadly it\u2019s only a ten. This anime has outstanding puns, dramatic parts, a little romance, overwhelming action scenes and an ending that no words could describe my feelings because it was the best one. (Thank you Arakawa!) FMA: B was the first shounen anime that made me cry. There were episodes that were just too intense that I never expected to shed a tear. The jokes were funny and were not corny. Yeah sure some of it was always shown but they place the jokes at the right time without confusing the person and making the viewers say \u201cwhat the hell am I watching?\u201d There weren\u2019t too many ecchi scenes in Brotherhood because like I said it is pretty straightforward. Action scenes were not too dull. They preserved the specialness in every character\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in order to give out their true power in the end. Romance? Well, I can't believe that it has one but don\u2019t worry, the show doesn't focus much on the love story.  \\n\\n\r\nWith a great story line, lovable characters that you won\u2019t forget, unmistakably exquisite music and sound effects, a different art and amusing parts there is no denying that you should really NOT miss FMA: B. I am not saying this because I am a fan, I am saying this because I am a victim of watching an extraordinary anime that never left my mind. I was thinking about this anime for like weeks now and there isn't a second or a minute that I never wait for the next episode. I will always admire this anime because of its strong capability to make a person learn about sacrifices and pain. Life is cruel but in the end, you\u2019ll know that everyone needs to lose something to gain what you really want. Just like what Edward said, \u201cA lesson without pain is meaningless\u201d so you have to stand and endure it. You shouldn't miss Fullmetal but instead have the time to watch it and you will be captivated. It wasn't ranked as number one in MAL for no reason. Because of FMA: B, I finally learned to move on and keep moving forward. If you haven't watched it yet, you will lose half of your life and your limbs. \\n",

            "content": "I have seen both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and both are good to watch. In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric and Roy Mustang & the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it is not as impressive as the first half.\r\nAnywayz, Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairlystraight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy. \\n\r\nAnd I will finish by saying that if you are going to watch one anime in the entirety of your life time, Choose FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood",

            "content": "You've probably heard of Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood, as it is widely known through the anime community as a fantastic and incredible anime. The main rule of this anime is of Equivalent Exchange; To gain, something of equal value must be lost.\r\nSo, what's the Story?\r\nThe story follows brothers Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric in a journey to find a mythical gem known as the Philosophers Stone in order to bend the laws of alchemy and receive the bodies they lost trying to bring back their mother after her death at the hands on an illness. That is the basics, though the second half of the anime isvery different and the story becomes a lot more serious and the entire tone goes from a selfish journey for their own benefit and turns into a massive story that is absolutely fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the anime, as a whole, was clear and enjoyable, and kept the overall feeling of the anime constant, always adding suspense, comedy, sadness, and any emotion possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. From main characters like Edward, to background characters, each is given a motive, story and enough time to actually create a connection. Every character was understandable and somewhat likable or relatable.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub and the dub are both amazing, and the dub is one of the best ever for any anime, every character's voice is great, well used and memorable. Not a single voice sounds wrong. Every character sounds exactly like you'd expect them to and it makes the entire anime a lot easier to watch as well as a lot more enjoyable, creating a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation style is incredible, fluent and beautiful. It works perfectly, and somehow they use the same animation style effectively no matter what emotion they are attempting to convey. Comedy. seriousness and sorrow are all presented fantastically\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is easily one of my all time favourite anime, and I have yet to meet someone who genuinely dislikes it. It's worth a shot, and I know you'll fall in love with it, just like I did. Watch it all and there will definitely be a least one character you love and at least one part of the story you will always remember.",

            "content": "The original Fullmetal Alchemist was a fantastic anime back in 2004. It had a fantastic story, and amazing characters, but unfortunately, the pacing was slow, and the ending was somewhat bittersweet. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, it's remake, on the other hand manages to fix just about every problem the original had, and even manages to improve all the good points from the original.\r\nThe story of the Fullmetal is one not to forget. The story revolves Edward Elric, and his brother, Alphonse Elric, who are searching for a way to return back to their original lives after committing a dangerous taboo, human transmutation. The story revolves aroundthe idea that in order to receive something, you must sacrifice something of equal value. The brothers live in a fantasy-like militaristic nation that has a great focus on the use of alchemy called Amestris. This is an incredible story that uses it's time wisely, with just about every moment having a importance in the grander scheme of things. Not everything is as it seems, as they are some really clever plot twist you won\u2019t forget. Despite the fact the the story is massive, it never seems to complicated. It explains everything in a way that it doesn't talk down to you, but you never feel like you've been given to much info to keep track of either.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the anime by far, are the characters. The show has a huge cast of likable characters, each with own interesting personalities. None of the characters feel like stereotypes, and they are all given enough depth to make them feel alive. There\u2019s the main dou, Edward and Alphonse Elric, two brothers who are searching for a way to get their original bodies back, and their childhood friend, Winry, who is always making sure the two brothers are safe. There\u2019s also the members of the military, Roy Mustang, a man who wishes to become the fuhrer of Amestris, with his devoted team, and a loving father and husband, Hughes. And, of course, the antagonists of the show, the mysterious homunculi whose motives see, unclear at first, and a man looking for revenge, Scar. I haven\u2019t even mentioned the side characters. Ninjas, Alchemy teachers, engineers, and a runaway father. Hell, I don\u2019t even know if I can call these side characters. They're all so important, with their own different goals and character development, they could be considered all to be part of the main cast. They are all so varied, you\u2019re bound to have your own favorites.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for the show is great too, although some might prefer the originals art style over this one. It looks a bit more simpler compared to the originals, but that\u2019s mainly because the original had some fantastic artwork. I will say this, though. The animation is great and has some incredible action scenes, and nice facial expressions. The art style is beautiful as well, creating fantastic environments, with a great use of distinct colors. The animation does fall once in a while, but it\u2019s so rare, you\u2019ll hardly notice it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the sound. This show has a fantastic orchestrated soundtrack, with solid voice acting. The anime has five opening and ending songs, and they\u2019re all a joy to listen to. The music complements the show greatly. Every scene is backed up by a great track, giving them all it\u2019s intended atmosphere. It can make scenes intense or relaxing, exiting or melancholic, and most importantly, meaningful. The only complaint I would have is that some of these tracks are played too often, but it never really bothered me. The voice actors for this show are great as well. There\u2019s not really a weak voice actor in the bunch, and some of them really do help push the characters to seem more believable. You can\u2019t go wrong with either subbed or dubbed.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t stop praising this show enough. The show is incredible, with practically no flaws(I tried my best to even find the few nitpicks that I did find). You\u2019ll end up finding these episodes passing by too fast, with these 64 episodes will all hold something memorable. This is not a show you want to miss.",

            "content": "FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood was released in 2009 and it is a remake of the FullMetal Alchemist, where the story takes another path and twist from the original. Brotherhood is considered to be better than the original from most of its viewers.The whole animation has deep meanings as its designed based on facts and different cultures, Its not just a random put-together. It has a good way of transmitting the anime's emotions such as comedy style and drama, and will definitely make you laugh sometimes , and other times feel sad or even cry.\r\nThe anime consist of 64 episodes which by my opinion is a verygood amount that doesnt tire you and its not too short either. There are also some stand-alone side stories: Blind Alchemist, Simple People and Tales of the Master.\\n\\n\r\nGraphics: The graphics on this animation are much improved than its predecessor. The graphics engine changed and if you watch this animation on more than 720 p you are gonna love it! The movement is smooth and the physic in the anime are as realistic as they can considering its a fantasy world with super extra special effects! It has Naturalistic colors which will not make your eyes hurt and the design of things around is pretty interesting as well. For an anime released in 2009 it has awesome details. Characters are well designed and give you the exact face expressions depending on the situation.\\n\r\nArt: The openings and the ending of the series are awesome as they have great music and awesome design. As every anime openings of course they are kinda spoily as they show things from the series that have not happened yet. The anime has awesome soundtracks in general where they fit perfectly on the situation.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: We are in a world where in contrary with ours the people can apply Alchemy! Alchemy is the science where you can take matter , Understand it , dissolve it and then put it back together in something different. All people there can do it pretty much , at least people that are practising the art. Out protagonist tried to follow a forbidden alchemy type when their mother passed away. Wanting to bring their mother back they applied what can be said as human alchemy. The process backfired and Edward lost his leg while his little brother lost his whole body. Edward not knowing what to do he sacrificed his arm to tie his brother soul on an iron armor. After they survived Edward had surgery to apply prosthetic parts and his brother remained as an armor. Now Edward applies to work for the military thinking that he has a chance to find a way to discover the Philosophers Stone, a legendary ingredient which will help him and his brother recover their bodies. The questions are so many that they dont know where to start looking. What are the creatures called homunculus that have the name of the seven sins? What is their connection with the Stone and the way to immortality? Will the two brother stay together until the end or will the guilt consume them?\\n\\n\r\nIn General: The plot is very well made and i can tell you that it is so complete that it doesn't let you any holes or blanks when the anime ends. It is deeply mysterious and very moving in such ways that it will definitely make you cry! The plot doesn't only move around the protagonists as all characters in the series are interesting and have an awesome story. \\n\\n\r\nIn Depth Details: The whole world in the animation seems to be Germanized as for starters there is a Fuhrer in the anime. The state alchemists are called dogs of the military and in general the story is very militarized. There is this extermination of the Ishval where i can connect it with gypsies due to their lifestyle , cultural similarities and the fact that Germany killed about 1 million Romans(gypsies) during the war and also the war on multiple fronts. There is also an obsession with the occult in the high ranking members. If you have watched the original FullMetal Alchemist you will see that at the end of the series and the movie, it takes place in Germany 1923 on hitler's age  where the German Nazis are looking for power to invade other countries.\\n\r\nAccording to the writer: Arakawa has stated she didn't use any specific countries or cultures to create Amestris, but rather a combination of several European countries from several different periods between the 17th and 19th centuries and, more specifically, the changes that occurred in the Western Europe during the Industrial Revolution (with a greater inspiration in England). According to her, however, there's no implied relation or comparison to any specific country, time, or government.",

            "content": "Before watching Brotherhood, I've watched the original series few years back. FMA 1 was good and awesome too, but the thing I hated about it is that the ending is not tragic and is not satisfying. So, knowing that there was an another adaptation of the series made me all curious about it.\r\nSince I enjoyed watching Brotherhood, I never realized I finised watching the whole thing in just one week.\r\n\"Why?\", you may ask? Well, at the first few episodes, the pacing of the plot was pretty fast, for someone who have watched the original FMA before. But, if you were not aware of the originalseries, maybe the pacing would be okay for you. It was not as detailed as the first series, but since there are new additions to the plot, new friends and enemies, and fuller character development, especially with Winry [who was just a minor supporting character in the original series] and of course, with the Elric Brothers, you won't bother about the pacing and embrace these awesome changes instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe story plot was different from the original FMA; the first 6 episodes were adapted from FMA1, and the next episodes were all different. Since this plot was faithful to the manga, you'll be surprised... and happy, that there are new things to discover in Brotherhood, as I've mentioned above. The addition of the east country of Xing and the northern Briggs, and their corresponding characters, was like a breath of fresh air to the series, as we can see and expect more stories and more types of alchemy and auto-mail. Also, the origins, forms, and the battles against the homunculi were totally different too. The fight scenes were all amazing. Yes, there are bloodbaths here and there, but that's the part I love the most while watching them fight, whether by weapons, alchemy, or simply a fist-to-fist battle.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the part I love the most in watching FMA is on the last few episodes. The ending was simply touching, since  Edward still sacrificed something for his younger brother, but in Brotherhood, he sacrificed something different... and less tragic. I also loved the part where Ed, Al, and Hohenheim worked together when they fought with Father, and I simply cried when Hohenheim said to Trisha's grave that he's happy that at last, Edward called him \"Dad\". The ending of FMA 1 was disturbing and not really satisfying, whereas in the ending of Brotherhood, you will love it so much you will wish for a sequel... or an afterstory perhaps.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Brotherhood was clearer, more crisp, and lot more contemporary than the original, as expected from a recently-produced series. I'm not really that particular about how the anime was drawn or animated, but Brotherhood was one of the exemptions to it. The battles were not crappy, and I really got creeped out when the \"immortal army\" was released [the white doll-like humans] from the Central underground.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus have done a good job in portraying their roles in Brotherhood, especially Ed and Al's. I also love the OPs and EDs used in Brotherhood, especially \"Hologram\", which was the second OP and surprisingly the last ED of the series. The background music used were perfectly synched with the scenes in a particular episode. After watching the series, you will definitely want to listen to the whole OST.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the kinds of characters in Brotherhood-- from the heroes, supporting characters, new characters, and to the villains-- it wasn't possible NOT to love at least one of these kinds. I even loved the character of Greed, who was a bad-turned-good character, and in the end, found satisfaction from his comrades. Also, the guys from Xing were also amazing, especially May, which inspired Al to study eastern alchemy in the latter parts of the story. Also, the addition of Alex Armstrong's older sister was also awesome, and also one of my favorite new characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd most especially, I love how Winry was turned into a REALLY important character in the series, and how Ed masked his OBVIOUS liking to her.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the series. I laughed with it. I cried like a baby, especially whenever Ed shows his selfless nii-san love for Al. I was intrigued with every ending of the episode, which was one of the reasons I finished the whole thing in a week. The series was not a disappointment in my part, and it made me wish that all of the other remakes would be AS GOOD as this. This is a quick recommend to my friends who love to watch shounen and for those who were familiar with the original FMA, because Brotherhood was told in the manga's point of view, and the story came in full circle in the end.\\n\\n\r\nRight now, I am suffering from a post-anime series depression, which I think will last a few weeks or more. It's not because the series was bad, rather, Brotherhood was too good for me to finish quickly. All my friends who've watched Brotherhood had the same feeling: the feeling of not watching any anime series for a few weeks before moving on, since when you finished watching Brotherhood, it would feel that a part of you ended with it. After watching the series, I was stunned for a few minutes, and told myself \"This is it; I finished FMA Brotherhood. What will happen next?\"\\n\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a good addition to the anime series you should watch before you die [LOL, but seriously]. If you like more action, NO filler episodes, and a satisfying ending, this one's for you.",

            "content": "Full Metal Alchemist is the work of mangaka Arakawa Hiromu, and is undoubtedly her most famous work. While an anime series under the name of Full Metal Alchemist did air in 2003-2004, the actual manga itself had not finished at that point and, as a result, the ending differs significantly from the actual manga\u2019s ending. Airing in 2009-2010, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (henceforth referred to just as FMA) rectified this. Finally viewers were able to experience the joy of the entire Full Metal Alchemist story adapted to anime format \u2013 and what a joy it is.\r\nFMA is very quick in establishing an action-packed storyline, soonevolving from the small-scale tale of two boys trying to find a way to recover their bodies into an epic quest to save the people of the nation of Amestris from being literally devoured, as a family of homunculi seek to gain the power of God (perhaps the Japanese \u2018Kami\u2019 is more appropriate here, as this God is more of a divine lifeforce than a fully-fledged supreme being). One of the coolest parts about FMA\u2019s storyline, and this came as quite a surprise to me, was how dramatically the pacing slows down in the last quarter. These last 16 episodes represent only about 2 days\u2019 worth of the story, and from this point on everything really is switched up to 11. The action definitely is amped up from this point on, but so too are the personal stories of our characters. It\u2019s hugely rewarding to follow all the mini-storylines as they comes together for the story\u2019s suitably epic conclusion. Without going into any spoilers, the ending to FMA was as close to perfection as I think anime will ever get.\\n\\n\r\nFMA succeeds on multiple levels, being an accomplished mixture of the more enjoyable and light-hearted fights and comedy that a good shounen needs, with a very mature and intelligent approach to the personalities of the characters. It straddles the line between a more adult philosophical anime and a shounen anime placing action first and foremost, dedicating equal time to both these approaches. This is possible largely thanks to the concept of alchemy \u2013 the superhuman powers alchemy grants its user is almost absolute. The theme of humans playing god is heavily prevalent in the show, as is the concept of religion in general (Never is the maxim \u2018advanced science is indistinguishable from miracles\u2019 more applicable than in the case of alchemy in FMA). It\u2019s a very compelling topic of discussion, and one happily that FMA doesn\u2019t fail to address. The first mini-story of the show, set in the religious town of Leto, is designed to introduce you to our main characters, is focused exactly on this idea, with a healthy dose of action and drama for good measure.\\n\\n\r\nWithout further ado though, let\u2019s look at the characters of FMA and why it is this aspect of FMA that is truly what sets the show apart. These characters are what drive the show\u2019s considerable runtime to be a constantly entertaining and, thankfully, filler free experience. I counted about 30 characters who received decent development in the story, an astonishing figure when you consider that\u2019s a character being fully developed every 2 episodes!\\n\\n\r\nIt probably won\u2019t come as a shock to you, but it soon becomes apparent when watching FMA that the characters were its biggest strength. This is not only due to the fact that none of them stick to the archetypes loved by many (myself included), but because of how many of the leading characters are both physically and emotionally scarred. Our main characters, Edward and Alphonse, strive to save the world, but not because it is a simple driving principle that they live by, but because they need a solution to atone for their sins. This is not an uncommon driving force in FMA: the Ishbalan war soldiers, Lieutenant Hawkeye, Major Armstrong and Colonel Mustang, are also examples of characters living with regret, as is Scar, an Ishabalan hunted by the country and determined to exact revenge on the soliders of Amestris for killing his entire race! These characters are spending the bulk of their lives having to deal with the consequences for their actions. \\n\\n\r\nThis is why the primary villains of the series, the homunculi, are so much more important than just punching bags. Each homunculus is named after one of the seven deadly sins, and overcoming and defeating the sins that our cast bears is brilliantly exemplified by the action-packed battles with the antagonists. These details add fantastic depth to what could easily have been a very plain \u2018stopping bad-guys trying to take over the world\u2019 situation. In a normal shounen anime, I would normally say overcoming enemy after enemy is not the same as character development, but in the case of FMA, it very much is. \\n\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist makes full (hehe) use of the wonderful opportunities the writer has set up to allow the characters to flourish as humans, not just ideals with bodies or walking plot devices. As a result, the tragedies that befall these characters are not only obstacles for them to overcome. No, they are genuine disasters that scar these characters in longer-lasting and character defining ways. It is the way that the characters are shaped by the actions that surround them that gives them such relatable and loveable traits. \\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t spend too long on the animation and music section of FMA, because this review is getting long enough as it is! The sound and music of FMA is something I regularly look back on fondly, because there\u2019s not a moment where it slips up. Voice acting is perfectly cast, and Edward\u2019s squeal when someone calls him short never gets old. The theme songs for FMA are also consistently on point, starting strong with Yui\u2019s fantastic \u2018Again\u2019 and never looking back, especially impressive due to the fact that FMA switches up its OP and ED a total of 5 times in its 65 episode running time. \\n\\n\r\nBy contrast, if there\u2019s one thing that Full Metal Alchemist doesn\u2019t excel in, it\u2019s the animation. It does the job and is pleasing to look at, but isn\u2019t anything that you would write home about: character movements are smooth and some of the alchemical constructions are pretty impressive, but that\u2019s pretty much that. \\n\\n\r\nTo wrap-up, FMA is that rare breed of shounen anime where the difficulties the characters face are solved by brains sometimes just as much as they are by brawn, but FMA doesn\u2019t stop there. The characters are all likeable, well-rounded and intensely well-written people. Such is the complete quality of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood that, over the course of writing this review, my analysis of the characters and their situations has led me to respect them even more than I did having just finished the series for a second time. \\n",

            "content": "*Spoiler Warning\r\nAside from the usual everyday anime Art and Sound standard(of which most animes pass anyways), there are essentially three main factors that I see as important in Anime:\r\n1. Complexity(detail) (which adds Depth)\r\na. Characters\r\nb. Plot\r\nc. Setting\r\n2. Progress (which adds Depth)\r\na. Character Development\r\nb. Plot Development\r\nc. Shifts of Setting\r\n3. Novelty (which, again, adds Depth)\r\na. Characters\r\nI. Personality\r\nb. Setting\r\nc. Plot\r\n--------\r\n1. Complexity(detail)\r\nIt's understandable that because FMA: Brotherhood paid attention to its simple-minded viewers(readers), the resulting complexity of the entirety of the anime would turn out bland. The characters were too simple, particular the main characters. The plot was horrendously predictable after 3-4 episodes and then there was the lack offocus in the setting. We see an icy place, dessert place, and then there's the ordinary regions where the main characters dwell.\\n\\n\r\na. Character\\n\\n\r\nEdward Elric, supposed talented alchemist(or close), with a terrible past. He is strong-willed but at the same time childish. He gets very attached to acquainted \"war\" victims and is always affected by the past. He uses automail(right arm and left leg) and alchemy to fight his way through almost everything. *At first, He hates his father*. He wants to bring back his and his brother's bodies. That's it. No deep personal philosophy. No internal struggle. No moral ambiguity. No split \"demonic\" personality. No subconscious complications. No crazy stuff. No bullshit. He just does what he feels is right. True, Ed experiences things such as guilt and sorrow because of the things he feels as mistakes. He consistently feels regretful for trying to transmute her own mother, and his own dad accused him for actually just being a coward. Nevertheless, said reaction and thoughts are way too simple. In the end, the show just forces the viewer and Edward to just swallow everything and move on. \\n\\n\r\nAlphonse Elric. I actually preferred this guy over his brother. I mean think about the psychology of a character stuck on an empty armor? Think about its implications. I also liked the idea that Alphonse is naive yet inhumanely able. He doesn't have to eat or sleep and is almost immortal. (though arguable since it was mentioned that there is a possibility that the armor would reject his soul eventually.) Link \"naive\" to his actual physicality. His main vulnerability is still an internal idea---the seal transcribed within his metal body. The only problem with the character is the lack of focus on his own thoughts and so on. The lack of exploration in his psychology. There was one episode that showed Al's doubt of his own existence, but this wasn't clearly detailed enough.\\n\\n\r\nB. Plot***\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here. Mother dies. They become state alchemist. Look for philosopher's stone. (How are they even allowed the time?) *They meet homunculus. They save everyone from homunculus at the same time they get their bodies back. That's it. They should've at least included Lin's \"chinese struggle\" and absorbed the surrounding nations within the plot.*\\n\\n\r\nC. Setting \\n\\n\r\nAutomails? Interesting idea. Problem: Detail, no elaboration.\\n\r\nHow many nations were there? I only remember desert, snow, and the rest of the dullness. Where is the economy?\\n\r\nAlchemy. The main idea of the show. Quite elaborate in terms of \"the gate\", \"immortality\", and other plot-devices. Problem: How much variety of alchemy did Ed and Al actually use? Move rocks and move more rocks. Mustang did fire tricks. Where are the complicated algorithms? The \"super moves\"? The classification of alchemy? There were mentions of \"eastern alchemy\", \"western alchemy\"; \"comprehension, deconstruction, reconstruction\"; \"equal exchange\" but these things weren't sufficiently fused and utilized as a basis for a unique battle system. sigh.\\n\\n\r\n2. Progress***\\n\\n\r\n***Ok. What happened again? They walk everywhere and found out that what they were looking for was right beneath their city and that it's sourced out of human souls? How did they change physically and mentally? ***\\n\\n\r\nA. Character Development\\n\\n\r\nHow much did Ed grow? How much did his personality go from A to B? How much did his height go from A to B? Ask yourself.\\n\\n\r\nHow much did Al grow? After experiencing all those moments, you'd think they'd have a more bad-ass versions of themselves...\\n\\n\r\nI mean at least change the character's appearances. Transmute Al's armor into some flexible form or cut Ed's hair. \\n\\n\r\nB. Plot Development\\n\\n\r\nWhen I said I already knew the outcome after 3-4 episodes, I wasn't kidding. Maybe that's exactly why I felt there wasn't much change. These \"homunculus\" just won't die. They keep coming back and it's like a show of power-puff girls where the girls continuously fight their arch-nemesis's. And don't even get me started on the shallowness of the homunculus'. (though I particularly liked Envy and his end.) Almost nothing, aside from what was already known, was happening. They found out about city's secret and they go back to their traveling and meeting new friends and then they go back traveling and finally they decided to finish the job.\\n\\n\r\nC. Shift of Setting\\n\\n\r\nI guess I shouldn't have expected One Piece. There were some interesting places such as the destroyed kingdom or the northern camp but almost everything happened in the same region.\\n\\n\r\n3. Novelty\\n\r\nAlchemy and Automail(Shounen) is an interesting combination. If I hadn't watched the first anime, It wouldn't better. Not really. They give you interesting general ideas and they stop there. More details would have produced more novelty. Character-wise, the two had too normal personalities. Interestingly enough, the flashbacks had a more novel point of view than the original. \\n\\n\r\nA. Characters\\n\\n\r\nWhat would have really gotten well was if their circumstances actually shaped a plenty of their personalities. The loss body parts didn't serve much meaning in terms of their character build up. What I saw was stubborn kid and naive brother. How swell...\\n\\n\r\nB. Setting\\n\\n\r\nGood General Idea - Not detailed = meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nC. Plot\\n\\n\r\nNovel in general but the lack of detail lessens the entire novelty. \\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nClearly not for CPN(character, progress, novelty)-oriented individuals. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So in honor of FMA Day 2014 (I know I'm a bit late), I've decided to write a review for my #1 all-time favorite anime (and manga), Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\r\nHonestly, I don't know what I could say about this show that hasn't already been said, but I'll give it a shot anyway.\r\nI'm not going to do what I typically do for a review which is listing the categories and what score I gave them; just know that everything is 10/10. \r\nI'm also going to address some critique that I've seen of the show and why I agree/disagree with it.\r\nAlso I'm avoiding talking about the 03anime because as far as I'm concerned it doesn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nI apologize in advance for this wall of text.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this show is absolutely phenomenal. Not only does it manage to tell the story of the main two characters, Ed and Al, it also gives ample time to all the other characters to show where they come from and how they think. And the show does this all without losing steam or taking long breaks from the action, and also without having characters monologuing in the middle of fights. There's also plenty of comedy, but it never once ruins the mood of the show (cough cough Pandora Hearts).\\n\r\nPeople like to bash on the rushed beginning of the show, but the reason for the rushed beginning is called Fullmetal Alchemist 2003. Brotherhood quickly sped through the episodes that the 2003 anime had already covered because the good stuff was yet to come. If the pacing at the beginning isn't appealing to you, I'd suggest also watching the corresponding episodes of the original anime. That pacing is more true to the manga's. Plus, after the first 13 or so episodes of Brotherhood, the pacing slows down but, once again, without losing steam. Once the show hits episode 15, new characters that weren't in the 2003 adaptation appear and immediately take part in the story. But the new characters don't stop there. They keep appearing for a long while after that.\\n\r\nEverything in the story is so flawlessly executed that even this type of anime isn't your thing, you can't help but admire how perfectly everything fits together and how many pains the author took in planning every step of the story. Then when you go back and watch the show again, you realize all the subtle foreshadowing that was carefully placed and not obvious enough that you pick up on it before it happens.\\n\r\nThis show is technically classified as a shounen anime, though I tend to cringe at that because FMAB isn't really a shounen. If you compare it to a more typical shounen such as Soul Eater, you begin to realize just how different it is. In Brotherhood, there's no yelling out the names of attacks, no long breaks in fights to monologue about plans, and the alchemy used isn't seen as an unquestionable staple of the world. Alchemy itself constantly called into question and many times the characters are forced to ask themselves if it's morally right to use alchemy to change the course of the world (whereas in Soul Eater they don't really debate the morality of the souls they collect). \\n\r\nOverall, even people that don't like anime like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I've gotten several of my friends (as well as my dad) into anime using this show as a beginning step. If you watch the dub and ignore the obvious fact that it's animated, it doesn't seem like what people typically perceive as an anime at all. It's on a whole other level from everything else I've seen.\\n\r\nIn addition, Brotherhood sticks to the manga nearly perfectly (the only things cut out were some minor character development and comedy scenes). Considering Studio Bones has a tendency to deviate from the source material (see: Ouran, Soul Eater, Noragami, FMA 03, etc.), with this show they did an admirable job with delivering an adaptation so accurate that you can read/watch one and not have to watch/read the other, even though I'd recommend doing both because of the anime's gorgeous art and music and the manga's few forgotten moments and the slightly different chapter divides.\\n\r\nBecause Brotherhood was put into production when the manga was wrapping up, the show avoids filler episodes (possible exceptions include episodes 1 and 27, in which 1 simply introduces the characters and some foreshadowing and 27 is basically a recap episode that also provides some hints at foreshadowing). If you miss an episode of the show, chances are you'll be very confused as to what is happening. Each episode smoothly leads into the next and they're pretty much unskippable. If it's your first or even second time watching the show, I wouldn't recommend skipping even the fillers because of the foreshadowing they provide. I've seen firsthand how confused the \"fillers\" can make people while I laugh and say that it'll be explained later. And it will. Everything gets explained so clearly, yet all the subtle ways in which the plot points connect amazes me every time I watch the show.\\n\r\nAs far as worldbuilding, I give triple thumbs-up to Hiromu Arakawa. She created multiple countries and while we don't get to see too much of life back home (I still want a Xing spinoff), the ideology of the foreigners and how it conflicts with the Amestrian characters' clearly shows. On top of that, Arakawa designed a government system which plays a crucial role in the story (then again, everything plays a crucial role in the story), as well as all of the laws and finer points of how the country is run. I've seen several other animes in which the government is used a plot point, but none of them use government quite as effectively as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood does. So many side stories and spinoffs could potentially grow out of the complex world Arakawa created.\\n\r\nSorry for writing so much about the story, but there's a lot to write about.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are amazing. Not as sharp as Attack on Titan, maybe, but it definitely fulfills all expectations. The battle animation is fluid and well executed, there's subtle use of CGI at certain points, the alchemy lightning is pleasing to watch, and the backgrounds are nicely detailed and do well to set the mood. Some people have said that it's simpler than the 03 anime's style, but I honestly can't see it. If anything, I find it more detailed. There's a few moments in which the same shot is used for more than a few seconds, as well as moments where the characters don't move around very much, but this is a minor detail and excusable considering the top-notch fight animation. There are no dips in quality throughout the show, and everything is handled as one would expect a high-budget anime to be handled.\\n\r\nOne of the things I especially love about the art in FMAB is the subtle aging of the characters. They age gradually, like real people, and you don't even notice the process happening until you look back on their appearances at the beginning and realize how much they've changed.\\n\r\nIn addition, the women of FMAB are completely unsexualized as well as totally kickass. After watching other animes with copious amounts of fanservice, only now can I appreciate this anomaly and not take it for granted\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the music in this show. While I felt that some tracks were overplayed in the beginning, this becomes less of a problem toward the end of the show because tunes you haven't heard before are suddenly revealed. The opening and ending songs are also very pretty and catchy (though I'm not too big a fan of the third ED), with my personal favorite opening being the last one. However, the first and fourth openings are awesome as well, and I think the first one in particular captures the mood of the show. I also loved the synchronization of some of the sequences to the songs, which I think is a very nice touch.\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting, I've seen this anime both dubbed and subbed, and while I like the dub more, both versions are really good. The actors are spot-on as their characters, and I love how they managed to get most of the voice actors from the 2003 anime back for Brotherhood. Even Alphonse's '03 dub actor, Aaron Dismuke, came back, though not as Al because he was too old at that point; instead he voices a minor but important character. Overall, the voice acting in both English and Japanese was really good, and it's safe to go with whichever one you're more comfortable with (though personally I'd say go with the dub because that way you can concentrate on the pretty art and animation).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are simply outstanding. Not only do they all get their backstories thoroughly explored, they all develop and change throughout the show. I've seen a lot of people griping about the fact that the show pretty much completely changes themes from the beginning, but the theme change is BECAUSE the characters changed. Wow, characters can change? Like real people?! I had no idea!\\n\r\nWhenever I'm getting people into this show, I tell them, \"If you see a character that you kind of like, don't worry, because their backstory will be explained.\" And they always seem kind of doubtful, but in the end they realize that it's true.\\n\r\nAnother reason why I hold this show in the highest regards is that there are many different races, cultures, and religions being portrayed; and while some characters make racist comments, the cultures themselves are treated with the highest respect. The episode detailing the events in Ishval is one of the most grim of the show; the Ishvalans being handled by the story as carefully as if they were a real race.\\n\r\nThe romance in this show develops subtly and beautifully and never once hijacks the plot. In addition, while it's amusing to watch Ed and Winry struggling with their feelings for each other, Ed does something pretty atypical for a protagonist: He blames himself for making Winry upset, and not because she got mad at him, but because he knows he should have been there for her. It's not all that often you see the male protagonist apologizing for causing the female protagonist grief.\\n\r\nOn top of how well-rounded and three-dimensional all of the characters are, they're all very well designed. Each one of them looks and moves differently according to their personality, and a lot of the characters change outfits regularly (which doesn't seem like much, but it's the little things that count, especially considering most animes don't do this and a lot of them have some kind of uniform, school or otherwise, to avoid having to have the characters changing outfits).\\n\r\nAll in all, every one of the characters in FMAB leave a lasting impression on the viewer, whether they were in the show for one episode or all of them. It's so hard to pick a favorite.\\n\\n\r\nEven though this show, at 64 episodes, is the longest anime I've seen yet, it's such a fast watch that it honestly doesn't feel like it. While I personally haven't set any records with the speed of my watching, friends of mine have finished the show in time periods from 2-4 days, because of the sheer addictiveness of it. And the show IS addictive. Every few months I get a strong urge to rewatch it and cry all over again. And while I'll never completely forget every detail, every time I rewatch it I'm still blown away. \\n\\n\r\nThis show draws you in with the seriousness of the story, the depth of the characters, the gorgeous art and sound, and pretty much every other detail you can think of. To sum it up, if you want a viewing experience on a whole other level from anything you've seen, if you want an ending that will make you break down and rethink your life, if you've seen the original FMA and enjoyed it, watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It's not the #1 rated anime on MAL by accident, and it'll definitely always be my #1.",

            "content": "One thing I distinctly remember about the 12 year old me was a fear of becoming a mega nerd who watched anime. I enjoyed video games but didn\u2019t want to plunge headlong into the void I saw before me. Well, times changed and I found myself watching my first anime at a college friend\u2019s behest. In 2011 I found myself entranced with the deep and exciting world of Fullmetal Alchemist and the story of the two Elric brothers as they journeyed to redeem themselves. The ending to that first series, however, was a letdown that shook my good impressions of the strong opening. That opinionremains to this day.\\n\r\n\tA few months later I recounted my experiences to my friend and, to my surprise, he replied that a retelling of the series had recently finished which remained faithful to the source material. After a few months, I sat down on Netflix and watched Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The whole time I wondered: can the series be better than the original? Could the already great relationship I encountered between the two brothers be deepened? \\n\\n\r\nStory:\t\\n\r\nFirst, I\u2019d like to explain the story. Two brothers, Edward and his younger brother Alphonse Elric, live in the mysterious land of Amestris where Alchemy is a science practiced by those gifted with this strange ability. The Elric brothers grow up in their hometown with their childhood friend Winry and their mother until a plague comes through the area. Tragically, their mother passes away in the epidemic but Edward and Alphonse resolve to see their mother\u2019s smile once more. They study from books their absent father left behind and attempt to do the forbidden: bring the dead to life. Needless to say the attempt turns horribly wrong and the series then focuses on the siblings trying to return themselves back to normal. \\n\r\nWhat separates Brotherhood from its original 2003 counterpart is not really apparent at first. The brothers commit the same horrible act and what immediately follows is eerily similar. When the story reaches Dublith, however, Brotherhood begins to tell a new story. The result, I am delighted to say, is an exciting epic that twists and turns throughout the whole of the mythical world Hiromu Arakawa has laid out for us. The purpose for which the two brothers fight becomes deeper and deeper without ever losing sight of what originally drove the two to join the fight in the first place; and the resolve of the Elric brothers is pushed to the limit in ways you would never think possible. The ending is especially epic as the underlying philosophy of the show comes to light. It\u2019s amazing to see a show that does this well in the end and Brotherhood deserves every ounce of praise it gets for its story\\n\r\nSadly, it would be a lie to claim this story is perfectly told. Both the very beginning and middle section of the series suffer from pacing issues. To be frank, the beginning is often criticized for the choice to gloss over material covered in the 2003 counterpart.  While all the material is there, you might be wishing for just a little more explanation before the show continues at full speed. The middle section of the anime also suffers from a pacing issue, but this time it\u2019s too slow. While it was nice to take a breather from the action immediately preceding this section, Brotherhood falters as it introduces the final set of characters that will join in the epic climax. \\n\\n\r\n24/25\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nProbably the most remarkable aspect of the original Fullmetal Alchemist series back in 2003 was the goofy and touching bond between the two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric. The rapid back and forth between the two served as an ideal backdrop to explore the two brothers\u2019 personalities. Fortunately this bond was not only kept with the new series, but taken to even higher heights. Seeing the two in action was truly a delight. \\n\r\nOne of the exciting things about Brotherhood was a truly diverse cast with characters that fairly consistently avoided the cardboard character models that are so easy to fall into. Minor characters that stand out include Yoki, Maes Hughes, and of course Lust. But what makes the series memorable is the diverse cast of characters with their own motivations. Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye are trying to atone for the crimes of the Ishvallan war of extermination and build a better world no matter what the cost. General Armstrong seeks to make Amestris as strong as it can possibly be and fights to make it so. And even the enemies have motivations that sum up to more than a simple \u201cwe must stop the main protagonists at all costs.\u201d Brotherhood massively succeeds in making the story engaging through its exciting cast, and I feel as if the story is as wonderful as it is because of the well-developed characters in this series.       \\n\\n\r\n24/25\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nOf course no animated series can exist without the medium of animation to carry facial expressions and convey action. To this respect, Brotherhood improves upon the solid foundations left by the 2003 series and the manga.  I particularly enjoy the character designs, but animation experts have raved about the fantastic fight scenes the series boasts. One animator, Yoshimichi Kameda, has received extensive praise for his touches and innovations in the Sakuga of several major fight scenes. Aside from that there are a few instances where the animation gets a little derpy and the chibi animation can sometimes interfere with the overall gravity of the plot; but I find it refreshing that a series so epic takes a small breather every now and then.\\n\\n\r\n16/17.5\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWith regards to the overall sound of the show, I felt as if there was some solid work put in on the part of Akira Senju. Unfortunately, the music of the series does begin to grind on you as the show reaches the climatic final scenes. This is alleviated somewhat by the execution of the music in the show as it never overpowers the quietest moments and never is lost even in the thick of combat. One major plus in my book is the work done by Funimation in their Dub of the show. Vic Mignogna delivers again in his reprise of Edward Elric and the rest of the English cast is, for the most part, quite solid. As I am not a native speaker of Japanese I generally prefer watching the Dub when I can so I am able to more effectively judge the quality of the voice acting; and the English cast is phenomenal. If I had to comment on the original voice acting performed in Japanese I would remark that the Voice actor for Edward sounds much younger than an American 15 year old would sound\u2026 Haters gonna hate.\t\t\\n\\n\r\n14/17.5\\n\\n\r\nAccessibility:\\n\r\nFinally, I would be negligent to recommend or condemn this series without mentioning the appropriateness of the series to all ages. While I do feel as if the series is a masterfully told story, there are elements that prohibit me from recommending this adventure to all. Most notably the dark one and violence make this series a no go for anyone under the age of 15. If you doubt me watch episode 4 and tell me it isn\u2019t dark. Also it seems like every shonen series has an uncontrollable urge to throw in a tub scene with the main love interest. Obviously this isn\u2019t family friendly. While complete nudity is not an issue, this series is not guitless when it comes to the regrettable trend of fanservice and innuendo. \t\\n\\n\r\n4/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment factor:\\n\r\nI loved Brotherhood\u2026 Enough said, and seeing as it tells a complete story that examines and plays out different philosophies as part of its intricate design, it seems as if Brotherhood will continue to be my most enjoyable TV experience for a long time.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nMany people have lauded Brotherhood since its completion and I am happy to include myself in their number. The sheer glory of the ending is a masterpiece that needs to be seen to believe, though the barrier of entry regrettably limits the audience of the series. For these reasons I rate Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood with a score of 92 out of 100 and grade the series as a Diamond rated show. Brotherhood is a monument to anime done well, and is a testament to a story told superbly. The combination of quality animation and well developed characters provide the perfect backdrop to a tale of two brothers. A tale where redemption is just beyond their reach. \\n",

            "content": "While FMA brotherhood offers an overall neatly wrapped full experience in anime and is a very easy anime to watch and be entertained by, it seems like many of the series'huge flaws which hurts its overall artistic quality are either being glossed over or are just not being talked about enough. In this review, I'd like to mainly address these issues and hopefully bring forth discussion. Is the anime good? Arguably, yes, it has a lot of great crowd pleasing aspects. Is it perfect and deserving of a 10/10? Sadly, far from it.  If this review sounds in anyway cynical and pessimistic, I apologize,for I only think the pages of praise this anime gets needs to be balanced out with a bit of honest criticism. I also felt that I couldn't give an adequate critique without using points in the plot as examples, so I'm sorry in advance for there are some spoilers included. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I found that brotherhood was ridden with far too many lazy convenient plot devices and shonen cliches for it to be enjoyable. What do I mean by this concretely? (spoilers ahead) If you look at episode 34 isn't it too much of a coincidence that sloth showed up right when the Elric brothers did in the exact same room? Consider the area sloth has to cover and how many times he actually emerges, isn't it too much of a coincidence that he showed up at Briggs right when the brothers was at the basement? Rather than having a story which melds encounters together naturally and smoothly, we get a cheap device made purely to advance the plot on very questionable grounds. There are other examples as well where we can see characters coincidentally being brought together if you watch the anime again. This is a terrible example of bad story writing and plot advancement. \\n\\n\r\nWhat about shonen cliches? Just count the number of times in a fight where at the last crucial moment another character shows up to hit the enemy/ally to save someone. I realize that's a really badass shonen cliche, and when used sparingly, it can be somewhat epic, but in this one, it felt too tired and predictable.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is also just far too naive and the actions and consequences of its characters are far too oversimplified. Brotherhood's predecessor might have its weaknesses, but it shines in it's realistic gritty overtones, and character growth in the Elrics as they journey through a bittersweet coming of age tale. In Brotherhood, there is only the illusion of character growth as they all have their respective emotional private dialogues, but these don't wallow past melodrama and towards episode 60, the elrics, mainly ed, are still the self righteous naive kids as they were when they started their journey. They don't murder under any circumstance for one but that morality is never explored because that's too much thinking and moral ambiguity confuses the audience I guess. In the original FMA, Ed had to resort to murder because of the situation and as dark as it was, the maturity was visible and there was a lot to be taken from that experience. \\n\\n\r\nOften times moral themes in this anime don't get explored beyond \"X is wrong so don't do it!\" just like that annoying scene towards the end (spoiler)where everyone tells Mustang he'll become a different person if he takes his satisfying revenge on the homunculus who's committed multiple unforgivable crimes against humanity, but never goes into depth about the nature of revenge or why Roy will become evil if he takes vengeance in this instance. The nature of Roy's revenge wasn't even an explored theme until this moment, and all of a sudden everyone gets on envy's side and turns their teeth on Roy for no other reason but to tell kids on the other side that acts like this is bad because it turns you into a fiend for some reason. Was I not the only one shouting for them to end envy's life already? This was after the blunder of them not ending one of the world's most dangerous beings before by \"putting him in a jar and giving it to a girl to be taken on a far journey\" without assessing all the risks properly. The homunculi were dehumanized in contrast to the original FMA and made completely unsympathetic (save wrath and old greed) , and we are suppose to sympathize for them at the end for some reason when they were made to barely unlikable? It seems like everyone protects envy throughout the plot. There is \"explaining morality through well written actions and subtext\" and there is \"preachy\" Brotherhood is definitely on the side of preachy.\\n\\n\r\nMustang as well as everyone else's involvement in the Ishballan war was also not exposed enough I felt. There was not enough psychological explorations on that dark. evil event in history. In the original, there were enough time dedicated to show us the gravity of what happens during war, specifically the massacre of innocents and the guilt state alchemists have to bear, but all that was glossed over in brotherhood, and I felt the weight of war in general was not conveyed well at all when the anime had multiple opportunities to do so. (not just the ishballan war, but the civil battle at the end as well) and instead, we get shallow melodrama, plenty of light comedic relief, and not much food for the mind for us to ponder on. It feels like at times, the anime is almost afraid to be depressing. Compare Hughe's death sequence in both versions and tell me the one in brotherhood has more of an emotional impact. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of comedic relief, the chibi comedy moments in this anime really ruined a lot of potential serious moments. Often times, there was too much light relieving, there was nothing left to relieve but we get comedic relief'ed anyways. The atmospheric tones was much too inconsistent at key times where the director doesn't grip you in any major emotion for a significant amount of time.  For an anime which uses so much comedy, FMAB suffers from the curse of just not being funny. I get it, Edward doesn't like to be called short, ok, I had a chuckle the first couple of times it was mentioned, but for the gag to be in almost every other episode was just straight overkill. I found laughter more in the subtler gags such as ed's terrible design sense. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother naive and convenient moment was when all of kimblee's men happened to be good guys. They needed someone to rescue ed and be dependable, so hey, the two chimeras who were just trying to kill him a minute ago turns out to be genuinely good people because we'd have a dead main character otherwise. They couldn't kill the two chimeras in the room with scar who were tied up because the anime isn't dark enough to do that, so hey, Al trusted them at their word and they happened to be good people incapable of betrayal because everyone has good in their heart and just need to be trusted and the world is a great and simple place just like that! and just like that two allies were added to the roster out of nowhere because Arakawa couldn't write herself out of that predicament any other way.. changes of hearts are not gradual and realistic, but are rather handed out like Jesus pamphlets. Scar didn't have a second thought when the elders in his tribe whom he trusts questioned his actions, but switches sides just like that when he meets an ishballan soldier for the first time? I'm just suppose to buy that and go along? \\n\\n\r\nThe author also ignores too many possibilities regarding the use of alchemy while writing this. In an anime about alchemy, you'd think it'd be used more. When Al and Marco's car got a flat tire at the end, where was alchemy? when ed and gang was fighting hoards of zombie homunculi, where was the alchemy to simply bind them to the ground or wall? when the gold toothed doctor was taking his sweet time to draw a transmutation circle, where was the simple attempt to clap the ground to disrupt it? These were all techniques shown to be utilized in earlier episodes but not used so the plot could unravel at a contrived pace which makes questionable sense. \\n\\n\r\nWhat the anime excels in is the fluidity of fight scenes, and the masterful animation with fine attention to detail all throughout, to the point where we can see the scar on Roy's hand healing scene by scene, episode by episode. I found characters in general to be paper thin and ill characterized because the episodes were more plot concentrated (but then again so was geass, but it dedicated enough time to character exposition at the same time) .I really wanted to like brotherhood...but really walked out feeling I just watched an above mediocre shonen which doesn't break the chains of its genre down to the last cheesy, sappy line uttered by its protagonist at the end.",

            "content": "When the original Fullmetal Alchemist came out in 2003, it was apparent that it followed the manga at first, but them went on it's path. Which didn't make it bad, but it annoyed many people, including me (Even though I didn't watch it until about 9 or 10 years after it came out.) \r\nBut! Our fandom had been blessed with a brand new (I'm speaking pass tense) series, that follows the manga, and is pretty damn good. I have been intimidated to write about this series because well, it's too awesome to tackle with reviews. \r\nBut here we go! \r\nStory 9/10 \r\nThis story is unique!I've never seen, or read, a story such as this one. What I think I liked most about it, was the fact that it HAD so many episodes. A story like this one can't be just put out there and finish up in 26 episodes or less. They did an amazing job wrapping everything up at the end of 64 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nWhat especially loved was the fact that the story flowed so nicely, even though when I first watched it I was confused during the first 13 episodes because I had watched FMA '03 before hand. You should probably wait a little bit before diving into this series after finished the original. It may seem the same, but it's a whole different ball park. However, no questions are left unanswered, and there are a lot of feels involved. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\r\nI am personally a fan of BONES, they do great animation work with a unique style of their own. It works nicely for this show, it has it's dark moments and the animation fits with that. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also the standard; 'Anime serious face' and the 'anime goofing off face'. EX: Ouran High school host club. I think BONES did really well, with character detail. But not so much with background animation, things seemed a bit off there. You'll see what I mean if you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 \\n\r\nExpect 10s from here on out, and I don't usually hand out 10s. \\n\r\nAhhhhh this series has the most beautiful sound track, each scene that has music accompaniment has a set of emotion. The sound track can make you laugh and cry, there even have been some scenes really helped with anger or hatred towards a character. \\n\\n\r\nThey re-use songs a lot, but still have a large amount of songs. My favorite is 'Brothers'. You will hear that a few times, it's a sound track that I could listen to all the time if I could. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 \\n\r\nThe story of this series effects the characters in a certain way (I can't say too much on that with out giving spoilers).  And what I really, really, love about these characters is that they react REALISTICALLY. I /adore/ characters who have negative backgrounds and react according to them. \\n\\n\r\nEven Maes Hughes who acts as a comic relief, is serious when he needs to be. There aren't any annoying characters, and there are a crap ton of strong female characters.  \\n\\n\r\nYou will grow to love all these characters, and feel for them! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\r\nThis anime, is hilarious, then sad, then action packed. I loved it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. \\n\\n\r\nOver all: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is an anime that will live in my heart for years. I've re-watched it 5 times, and never get tired of it. I HIGHLY recommend you watch this series, you will not regret it. \\n\\n\r\nNow, about the dub. I'm a person who prefers dub over subbed. But I can watch subbed and I know when I hear a bad dub. This is NOT a bad dub. In fact, it's the best I've seen in all the anime I have seen. I also highly recommend watching this anime dubbed if you like it that way. You will not be disappointed. Vic Mignogna plays the main character Edward Elric, and well, it's down right amazing. As well as the rest of the actors. \\n\\n\r\nThat's all, happy watching ^^",

But some of the themes this touches on feel so real the characters that they affect seem so human that you can't help be mortified at the tragedies, just as elation comes when it is due.\\n\\n\r\nThat's another big thing. The humor in this show is mild but it balances out the sorrow. It builds the relationships in tandem with the drama to show us something that isn't perfect, but is so clearly superior to Sakura's friendship speeches and although the dialogue at times felt subpar, it never felt completely pointless.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes, too, were rarely drawn out unnecessarily and were all beautifully crafted. I'm crossing my fingers that more shows will get their brotherhood, because although this series is longer than the original it felt more focused, and certainly it ended up feeling more meaningful. I may have given few hours to this show, but I feel equivalent exchange was not at play here because it has given me a lot more than I was expecting.",

            "content": "This is one of the greatest anime of all time.  I know that's kind of bold statement to make but in my opinion it is one of the greats and my personal favorite.  The story is great and is paced so well especially in comparison to FMA 03 the original adaption.  This anime's greatest strength is its story and characters because its characters are just that characters not cardboard cutout archetypes.  For example Winry Rockbell starts the show as this stereotypical childhood friend who is always keeping the main heroes in line but while she continues that she expands with aback story and emotion that shows she cares for her friends and the people around her.  The two main protagonist are Edward and Alphonse Elric who are excellently written as the short-tempered leader who just wants to protect who he loves in Edward and Alphonse as such a  softy who just wants do what's right in his quest for his body.  The story as I said before has excellent pacing moving from gripping drama to bits of humor to intense action seemlessly.  I'm not going to say this is perfect because it isn't some of fights lack speed and weight in the animation.  Speaking of which the animation isn't anything to write home about in my opinion keep in mind I watch this in 2014 so for its time its above average.  The sound overall is quite good the theme was carried from FMA which isn't a problem and the openings are much improved with the first standing out.  Overall its at least worth watching to get your own idea of it",

            "content": "Look, I can see why this anime is really loved, but I just don't think it's that good. \r\nNo, this is not a troll, and I think it's silly that people might think I'm trolling simply because I don't like a show, but when it's the highest rated anime on the sight I can probably come to expect some hate. But Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is just not that good. \r\nFor one, the pacing is really messed up. In the first season (12 episodes) we jump from past to present and zoom through something I can tell was probably a really important part of the story,and it left me with no way of attaching myself to any of the characters. Several characters die and impact the story and the mains but it's so rushed that as a part of the audience I can't find it in myself to care, really. It seemed like they were plot devices. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I think is bad is the way things are revealed. Without getting too much into spoilers, we're kept in the dark of a character's past until some part of the story like 40 episodes in, and then all of a sudden it's dropped on us and we're expected to get it. The anime also has a lot of \"philosophical\" undertones, I guess, but the philosophies are really weak and surface level. Such as Edward in the first few episodes when he's in that town and talks to the Rose character, telling her that humans can be made with ingredients found in the town market and that alchemists are atheistic because they know these things--but Edward has SEEN god. This, also, is conveyed after the fact, which just makes it even more confusing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really my biggest issue with the anime is that there seems to be an inconsequential bit of tension. IT's so repetitive. Ed and Al fall apart and we all know they'll just get put back together again The whole reason Ed has automail is so that it can get wrecked in the story so he seems to be in danger. Nothing ever comes of it! By the end all the characters are pretty much the same, no development has been done, but the show has a Disney ending anyway because, for some reason, a show with philosophical undertones needs to end happily. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was really good, and I enjoyed fight scenes well enough, even if a power like alchemy is poorly explained. It looked good all the way through, and there's no character designs I dislike either, but they use the same music tracks over and over in the show and I started to get tired of the music overall. I will say this, though, the openings and endings are pretty top notch. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall I didn't really like this show at all. My biggest thing is that I think this show has a high score because it came at a time that anime was booming, and it successfully adapted the source material in a way that the original failed to do. You know everyone says \"the book is better than the movie\" even when the movie was good? That's because, for some reason, people just think the thing that came first is better. So when a bad show is made from a bad manga, people think it's good because it stays faithful, but I don't like it. If you did, that's fine, but you have to remember that the philosophy is weak, the characters don't develop, and the ending is predictable.",

            "content": "Pros: Brilliant plot, excellent opening/endings, perfect flawed characters \r\nCons: Rushed Beginning, art style is a little cartoon-y \r\n Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is undoubtedly one of the most popular animes out there, and for a good reason. It follows two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric who attempted to bring their mother back to life with the most forbidden alchemy: Human Transmutation.  Their attempt failed, costing Alphonse his entire body, and Edward his left leg. In a desperate attempt to keep his brother with him, Edward willingly sacrificed his right arm in exchange for Alphonse's soul. Edward bound Al's soul to a suit of armor hefound in his basement.\\n\r\n This plot is perfectly explained in the original anime \"Fullmetal Alchemist\". It's like they created this with the thought that everyone watched the original first. I would highly recommend watching the first one if you want more insight on the transmutation, or reading the manga version. \\n\r\n I also criticized the art style to be a little cartoony for my taste, but gave it a  8. The style itself is clean and fresh but feels very simplistic. However, overtime when you watch this anime- one of my favorite parts is that the characters do not stay the same age. The characters grow in the story as you watch, and you don't realize it until you see the teenage protagonist actually looks like a young adult in comparison to the 12 year old you once got introduced to. \\n\r\n The soundtrack is wonderful, it's a great listen. The openings also make the characters grow/change like in the anime. When you see them separately, and look at them side-by-side, you'll see the growth. One of the most uniquest things I have ever seen in an Anime. \\n\r\n The characters in FMAB, are all lovely. They each have there own story/quest. In the end, you really enjoy watching them grow with the protagonists and see them help Edward and Alphonse reach there goal including there own. \\n\r\n Overall, this anime is wonderful and heartbreaking, and will make you laugh and cry. Even though this anime has flaws, I gave a 10 because of the wonderful journey it gave me. Its truly a treat.  It's a beautiful story you will honestly never forget.",

It's very interesting to follow them and see how they evolve through the serie.\\n\r\nFor me it's very important that it does not only have strong male characters but also very strong female characters. I personally love animes (and mangas) that have very strong females and that doesn't go for the more typical type of female that we often see in animes and mangas. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is truly epic and if you haven't watched it you should seriously reconsider. But be warned that you will probably become very emotional during the time you watch it.\\n",

            "content": "Best show I've ever seen.\r\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is probably the best series I've ever seen. There are several reasons for this: \r\n1) The story is truly compelling! It really grows on you, since the viewer wants the Elric brothers to reach their goal of getting their bodies back, because of their hard childhood, where their dad left home and their mother died. You grow a sympathy towards these two boys. The plot is amazing, though I don't want to spoil anything. The idea of Alchemy is great in my opinion. So I'll give the story: 10/10\r\n2) The art is top notch, the fighting scenes areamazing and the backgrounds are beautiful. The characters are well-made and they actually seem really human, though they are animated. (Wrath's fighting scenes are awesome!) - Art: 9/10 (almost 10/10l)\\n\\n\r\n3) The sounds in FMA Brotherhood is good, but still the show's weakest aspect. Sometimes the background music doesn't really fit, but it doesn't bring down the show. The opening and closing songs are really good, the second opening is one of my favourite Japanese songs. The genereal sounds and talking are good as well. - Sounds deserve a 9/10 (Close to 8/10, due to the background music being out of place at times). \\n\\n\r\n4) What really made me love FMA: Brotherhood is the characters in the show. They are truly geniously put together. I am a twin brother myself, so I was really touched by Edward's and Alphonse's brotherhood, since I feel that I would go through the same shit as they do, only to help my brother. \\n\r\nRoy Mustang is a great character, who has quite some shadows of his yesterdays hanging on his shoulders. He has killed many men during some civil wars, which happened in the country. \\n\r\nScar is also an important character, who was filled with hatred and seeks revenge on the State Alchemists, who destroyed the Ishbalans, who was Scar's people. \\n\r\nLouis Armstrong is a fun character, who brings a nice humourous aspect to the show with his Gai Sensei-like emotional and masculine behaviour. \\n\r\nThere are tons of other great characters, I could go on forever, but these were the highlights to me. \\n\\n\r\n5) All the reasons mentioned above made me enjoy this show more than I've enjoyed any other show. The plot is amazingly well-written and the characters are really believable and sometimes this show just bring the chills, since you really symphatize with the characters. The ending is just perfect, so I'll give FMA: Brotherhood the biggest 10/10 I've ever given to any show.",

However, I will say this, this anime is sad. You wouldn't expect it from seeing the title or a picture. But this anime is as sad as Clannad: After Story or any other anime that tries to be emotional. I recently rewatched this anime, and I experienced the train ride I had. This anime has so many unexpected moments, especially towards the end. SPOILERS AHEAD: I think that Hughes should have had a bit more screentime, don't get me wrong I want to say that I cried. But the thing that made me sad were the reactions of the other characters with hughes dying. They made the aftermath perfect, but before that,9/10. A bit more and it would be perfect. You learn a lot of things in this anime, They apply to real world situations. Let's face it, when we wish for something big, we always sacrifice something. Like \"I wish for Hoenn to be remade\" Your wish comes true but you lose hope halfway. The characters were very enjoyable, the villains were great as well, Animation and Sound, perfect. Overall, my rating would be 9.9/10 which I would say is near perfect. This anime is incredible, and everyone should watch it. I may be a bit too much of a fanboy, but trust me, you'll love it.",

            "content": "Full metal alchemist brotherhood the anime that has been called a masterpiece for so many years well to day I'm here to tell you my thoughts on that.Many people feel this way because it strictly follows the manga but just because an anime follows the manga doesn't necessarily mean its good.\r\nFull metal alchemist brotherhood is about 2 brothers Edward and alphanse Eric. After attempting to bring their mother back from the dead using  human transmutation Edward lost his arm and leg while al lost his entire body and had his soul sealed inside a suit of armor the two brothers set out to findthe philosopher stone hoping to get their bodies back to normal.\\n\\n\r\nStory- Now I will spoil some of the story in this review. FMAB started off pretty good then I realized a lot of stuff was not being explained the pacing was getting more and more shitty. Now many people say FMAB has a amazing story and its a masterpiece well It might've started off like that but it slowly evolved into a save the world from the big bad villain with a god complex kind of story. Now some parts in the story were very suspenseful and had my full attention. Then some parts of the story were really boring and I found myself zoning out continuously. The story had some really grasping scenes like when Hughes was murdered and when the guy with the blonde hair who loves to smoke(forgot his name lol) was stabbed in the back and was paralyzed for the waist down for the rest of his life and when Roy mustang flipped his shit and roasted Envy alive, those scenes were timed really well and caught me off guard. One thing FMAB did was focus on the drama to much which resulted in a shit ton of over dramatic scenes. Some of the dialogue was cliche and I couldn't stop fucking laughing because they were trying to be serious but I just couldn't take it serious, and I even started predicting some of the events in the story would happen. Anyway the story starts to go down hill and now the elric brothers new objective is to stop the bad guy who wants to obtain the power of god with them finding their bodies being their side quest. Then they have this cliche shounen ending where a seventeen year old kid beats the shit out of god. I mean this is just beyond cliche, the fight was good but i wasn't suprised because in the end i knew he would win. And the fairy tale happily ever after ending was disappointing to.   They never explained the origins of alchemy clearly nor do they explain anything else clearly so I was left with a shit ton of questions but no fucking answers. The story just didn't pull me in and It felt like I was just watching your typical action anime the story wasn't shit it just wasn't a masterpiece like everyone said it was.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation / Sound : The Animation was pretty good the character models and the back grounds were well done and so was the animation and art for the alchemy. The fight scenes where pretty neat but nothing too flashy. The voice acting was A1 I thought the sound effects for the fights and explosions were done well to. The intros and ending were just mind blowing sometimes I would just go on YouTube and just watch and listen to the intros. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is the weakest part of the anime.\\n\r\nOur 2 MCs Edward and Al do not change through out the whole series they remain the same naive little boys they were at the beginning hell the only thing that changed about Edward was his height he became taller as the series continued. Most the characters in FMAB get no development at all and some are just useless as fuck cough...cough... winry, now I don't dislike winry but sometimes she just annoyed the hell out of me and got in the way. The only characters in this show who got good development was Roy Mustang, Envy, crippled cigarette guy(forgot his name), hoenhime (I think I spelled it wrong), and Ling/Greed. Half of the villains on here are evil just for the hell of it and oh yeah the main villain with the god complex is called father he basically created the rest of the villains. Each of them are named after the 7 deadly sins and called homunculus. Apparently each villain represents a fragment of his soul you have\\n\r\nThe homonculus were extremely shallow and were evil to be evil. I mean out of all seven only three shine and those three are Wrath, Greed, Envy. The rest are extremely uninteresting including father. If i had to compare him to a villain it would be Aizen from bleach. \\n\r\nNow out of all of these villains the most memorable was Envy because of his hatred of humans and his twisted personality he was very exciting to watch and his death was put together really well. Now back to the other characters  Scar was very interesting at first but as the series continued he started to bore the hell out of me until I finally wasn't interested in him any more. Like I said before Roy Mustang got a lot of development he went from the cool and calm guy we know and love to a bloodthirsty animal obsessed over finding out who killed Hughes. Now full metal alchemist brotherhood has some interesting characters but failed to give them any development to the point where I didn't give a fuck if they died.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end by no means was FMAB a bad show no it was a good show that had a lot of potential but it failed to amaze me the unique story was ruined after a couple of episodes. I personally think this anime is overrated as fuck it wasn't bad its just overrated and it just didn't prove to be a masterpiece like everyone claimed it was  , but in the end this is just my opinion . The funny thing is I watched this before  the FMA 2003 version because everyone kept telling FMA 2003 was trash and the funny thing is I ended up liking 2003 more.   Do i recommend this show yes you might find your experience different than mine after all we are two completely different people. Well I'm done i hoped you enjoyed this review Peace!!!",

            "content": "*Spoiler Alert*\r\nTo me... Brotherhood is a huge disappointment.\r\nAfter seeing the original series and reading all the manga that has been released, I was looking forward to a series that was closer to the manga.\r\nThat's not what I got.\r\nWhat I got was very pretty and very fast moving anime with no emotional or personal relationships between the characters, other then that of Ed and Al.\r\nThere are parts in original series where i admit i cried, hard.\r\nLike the death of Hughes. \r\nI was surprised when his death in this series, didn't bring up a tear and wasn't more then side note. And in this series other thenthe apple pie made by Gracia, Edward had no personal or emotional relationship to Hughes.\\n\r\nHow can he be devastated by his death, when all he did was meet him a couple times? He barely knew the guy.\\n\r\nAnd where is Roy?\\n\r\nIts 12 eps into the series and i've seen what.. 2 eps with Roy in them. He was pretty important in the first series and in the manga. \\n\r\nWhat's happening with Scar and what's going on back in Central?\\n\r\nThis series is leaving a lot of blanks and questions. \\n\r\nAnd far as being more connected to manga, not really. Where are Ranfan, Olivier Milla Armstrong and Ling? \\n\r\nBy this point they should have at least made some kind of appearance. \\n\r\nAnd I'm sure for all the first time watchers of FMA this a great series, but if you go read the manga and loved the original series like I did... your just flabbergasted by how horrible this series right now, because you had more faith that it would be awesome.",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist, a story about 2 brothers going on a journey in a magical fantasy world, which brings us as the audience closer to the interesting idea of equal trade. \u201cGiving something in order to get something\u201d A very realistic idea but in this universe much more effective. To make a material out of another, a dream of the ancient alchemist to create gold and probably an idea that will occur to us in a distant unknown future. Fullmetal Alechemist is an anime I only can look kindly upon. \r\n7 years after the original anime fascinated many of viewer studio \u201cBones\u201d decided to make FullmetalAlchemist again, with slightly better graphics and more accurately to the manga and it seems like that Brotherhood is even better than the original, at least the majority of people on this website think so. \\n\\n\r\nI think it is quite understandable why the Brotherhood series is more popular and more liked than the original, at least on this website. It is also my biggest problem about it. On the one hand Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood had more action scenes and on the other it had a more complex but better explained storyline. That seems quite good doesn\u2019t it? Well the problem is Brotherhood explains every detail of the story, as if the storywriters think the audience can\u2019t think for themselves. The character constantly reminds you of several things so you absolutely can\u2019t forget them. Half way through an episode it also has to remind you of the anime you are currently watching, with shouting its name out loud, just to make sure. This penetrating need to explain everything goes way beyond normal story explanations. Even though in some cases explaining the story by SHOWING you the story is more enjoyable in many cases it need to be TOLD, especially in anime that are character based and have a lot of conversations involved. Sometimes a story gives you the clue \u201cA\u201d and the clue \u201cB\u201d and you have to come to the conclusion \u201cC\u201d, sometimes it gives you a clue \u201cA\u201d and the conclusion \u201cC\u201d and you can, if you want come to the result \u201cB\u201d.  \u201cBrotherhoods\u201d doesn\u2019t do that, it gives you everything and the character just screams the conclusion out as if they can\u2019t wait until you know their secret plan. I mean what is the secret behind something you tell everyone? \\n\\n\r\nIt just bothers me when villain out of no reason start telling you their whole plan, or what evil stuff they already did, especially when they don\u2019t need to. Why would they do that? And when they tell you everything about their plan why do they stop there? Why not telling the audience WHY they did that, WHAT motivations they had? Maybe going a little bit into the depth of characters? \\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s go to the analysis: \\n\r\nThe story had a more immature writing style. It\u2019s not only the already mentioned dragging you in only one direction and don\u2019t allow any open mind believe that make this anime immature there are more than just that point. The representation for example was very childish. You can\u2019t take a show seriously that constantly includes comedy parts, with a funny artstyle, which doesn\u2019t even spare villains. From the story part, compared to the original there isn\u2019t any uniqueness anymore. The anime really tries to be in the shounen genre since it lacks of consequences, motivations and logic in many cases. Even though this anime explains everything there are still many open question to it, which are very important once, maybe even plotholes or contradictions and not some simple questions like in the original, which are a matter of your own creativity.  \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing for the show changes a bit. First it starts of very fast, as if it wants to go through the story that the original had as fast as possible, and then it comes to a normal pacing. Besides the fast start the pacing was quite enjoyable. The start was a pretty important and emotional part in the original. But Brotherhoods because of the rushed pacing doesn\u2019t manage to create the same effect as the original at the start. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said before the animes main thematic is equal trade. It was everywhere in the original.  So many little details were made, from the beginning to the ending to bring this realistic idea which was presented in a fictive style closer to its viewers. The \u201cBrotherhoods\u201d-series lacks so mamy of these points. At the start you can see it, but the more the story progresses the more it goes lost until it\u2019s completely forgotten in the end. It is unbelievable that the writer of the manga doesn\u2019t even get the point of his own manga, why else would he make such a consequence free story.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is also very popular because of its action scenes. But they are way too uncreative. Think about it, in this world they could make every material out of everything (at least they make steal out of stone, so silicon into iron + carbon(you also have to consider the high temperatures that have to be created), which is already hell of a transformation) It is idiotic to fight just with your \u201csword\u201d when you have such an ability. You could create a vacuum or make the bottom liquid and then trap them. There are sure even far more greater ideas than that. \\n\\n\r\nBut Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood not only wants to be shounen it also tries as hard as it can to be accepted for mature audience as well. The unfitting and forced inclusion of dark gore themes and making some appearances especially bloody, but sadly they didn\u2019t manage to do that in terms of characters and basic of story. It\u2019s a childish story wrapped up with mature themes, explained to the audience as if they were kids. \\n\\n\r\nA very big shounen inclusion and a very annoying story-part is the \u201clove\u201d story they written into it. In the original the fact that the blond mechanic chick is so unimportant to Ed is a very nice thing. It\u2019s a story about 2 brothers going on a journey not a typical love story. Therefore the inclusion of such a thing only makes it feel like the storywriters tried as hard as they could to make it appealing to as many viewers as they can. And dont get me even started on how bad the consequence free, deus ex machina ending was... but it was pretty fitting for a  \u201cshounen\u201d anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe character are written more to appeal to a younger audience as well. You can clearly see that. Ed and Alfonse act only a little bit differently than in the original but its significant change made there. In the original they had childish attitude and believes, but unlike in shounen anime the show doesn\u2019t give them the opportunity to change the world. The thing that bothers me about shounen anime is the fact that the storywriters take a childish main protagonist who thinks that he alone could change the world and the storywriters give him the ability to do that. The drama in such shounen anime is reduced to pathetic written melodrama and the invention of motivations hasn\u2019t been done in any kind of way. \\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s go back to the protagonist and his brother. The thing is, in the original they followed a goal which they wanted to accomplish with everything they did. In brotherhood they rather help everyone out, what makes them common \u201chero-typed, being nice to everyone, expect for the bad guys\u201d- characters. \\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters in Brotherhood are either annoying or unfocused or badly written. You have for example arrogant, very little knowing characters as the \u201cgood\u201d guys, whom the storywriters use to explain the plot to the audience and we got emotionless, unmotivated and idiotic enemies who have not the slightest abilities to come up with a working plan and therefore aren\u2019t able to create any threat to the audience.\\n\r\nJust look at Van Hohenheim. In the original a serious guy with a goal, for which he even could make sacrifices to achieve it. And a carrying father for his children. A person who knows his limits. In Brotherhood: A typical whiny guy, who cant see anyone dying and who wants to save everyone, without goal and with a past that is completely idiotic.\\n\\n\r\nI also have to mention the homunculi, which are a very important group of character. Who doesn\u2019t know the original: The homunculi are the anti-heroes or the enemies if you like. The original gave them background story and motivations. Normally I don\u2019t think it is important for an action based anime to go into the depth of characters especially villains, but besides the fact that Fullmetal Alchemist has a lot of character conversations it\u2019s also every time a nice thing to do. In this case it feels also very special, since the homunculi represent the 7 deadly sins. Everyone acts like the deadly sin he represented which makes everything quite accurate and detailed.\\n\\n\r\nThe homunculi are now in brotherhoods not only rather unimportant but completely forgotten in terms of personifications, depth, motivations and everything else that made them likeable in the original. They have no background story or any kind of focus.\\n\\n\r\nThe homunculi don\u2019t act like the deadly sin they represented anymore. Envy acts arrogant all the time only saying he is envy, but there is no explanation why. Greed also has to tell the audience that he is greedy else you wouldn\u2019t know. The characters have to tell you what they are, they can\u2019t SHOW you.  The whole story has to be told to you to explain it and can\u2019t be shown to you. And Wrath said something like: I\u2019m proud of being a homunculus. Sloth is the worst of all because he is working overtime. \\n\\n\r\nArtstlye and soundtrack of \"Brotherhood\" were very good.The animations looked clean and the backgrounds and characterdesign was very well and detailed drawn. \\n\r\nSoundtrack was better in the original but \"Brotherhood\" had a lot of nice tracks as well. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Fullmetal Brotherhood was an enjoyable anime and maybe it would have been even a decent one, if there wasn\u2019t already an anime that is the same thing, only superior in every important aspect. Brotherhood only shines in the shounen aspect with illogical inclusion, annoying overused character, lack of motivation or any kind of uniqueness and plotholes unable to count. \\n",

            "content": "If there's one programme out there which a tad frustrating for me, it's Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I don't know about you, but I'm absolutely sick of seeing reviews giving this show a 10/10. Don't get me wrong though, I absolutely adore Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole and I do believe that the adventures of Edward and Alphonse should be viewed by all at some point. But it's really the fans' reaction to this show that drive me up a wall. At its core, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a great show that does a lot of things right (and I do mean a LOT of shitright) but ends up getting some shit wrong along the way as well.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it's important to understand why this show was made before I get started with the actual review itself. Before Brotherhood ever existed, there was the first Fullmetal Alchemist TV series: a loose adaptation of the manga which eventually broke away from the source material in order to tell its own story. Now, this was important for two reasons. The first is because at the time of the first series' creation, there weren't that many chapters there to adapt so either Bones had to wing it or Arakawa had to sacrifice her creative integrity and succumb to both publisher deadlines AND studio pressure as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe second reason is the most important: because the first series branched off and became its own entity, that gave Hiromu Arakawa much more time to flesh out the manga's universe and go in the direction she so chooses without having to worry about things like deadlines as much. Talk shit all you want about the first TV series, but just keep in mind that without the first TV series, the manga as we know it right now would be vastly different and Brotherhood would in all likelihood not exist. Of course, the fact that the circumstances behind this show's creation rely so heavily on what went down in the first show does come back to bite Brotherhood in the ass. How so?\\n\\n\r\nWell for one thing, the first 15 episodes of Brotherhood are rather... \"rushed,\" I guess? Now, this was actually a stylistic choice on the part of Bones since the logic at the time of creation was that the vast majority of people who are watching this show would have already watched the 2003 series first so they didn't want to bore returning viewers by showing them the same stuff they saw before. While that certainly is a respectable goal, there's only one little problem with that logic: this is supposed to be a REBOOT of the anime series. If you're going to reboot something, any prior entries in the franchise shouldn't even be factored into the equation.\\n\\n\r\nNow granted, I did complete Brotherhood first before going on to complete the 2003 series and nothing really seemed out-of-place, but upon re-watching after completing the 2003 series... it just didn't really feel the same. For instance, there's the whole ordeal with Nina Tucker. If you've spent ANY amount of time around the FMA fandom, you should have *some* idea that what happens to this 4-year-old girl is NOT pretty. In the 2003 series however, the Tucker family's role was expanded and we got to see more of Nina before \"it\" happened (and let me just say that the entire thing was fucking depressing after \"it\" happened).\\n\\n\r\nIn Brotherhood... Nina is just around for one episode and after tragedy befalls her, she's apparently one of the driving forces behind Edward and Alphonse's goals of becoming better alchemists. Let me get this straight: a little girl that you didn't even know for more than a week is going to be one of the driving forces behind our lead protagonists' goals for the entire series' run? Yeah... I'm not buying it. Yes, what happened to her is sad but I find it incredibly hard to believe that an incident like that to someone that Ed and Al barely knew would have THAT much of an impact on them. There are WAY more examples like that than I let on, by the way. I just don't feel like covering them all since that's far too much work on my end.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect about Brotherhood I take umbrage with is the comedy. To put it short, I don't really care much for Hiromu Arakawa's chibi-style humour since it just takes me out of the seriousness of the moment and just kills the mood altogether in a vein similar to Kuroshitsuji. Of course, that's not really a fair comparison since Bones is a far more competent studio than A-1 Pictures but it's still something to be mentioned. You can only imagine my frustration whenever I saw Ed go into chibi mode right after some intense action or a relatively serious moment goes down. I mean, yeah it gets a quiet chuckle out of me but do you really have to resort to THAT style of humour to elicit a laugh or two out of the viewers? Come on...\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that I don't really have a lot of praise for is the fact that despite the fact that it's definitely a cut above its competition in the battle shonen genre, it still FEELS like a battle shonen series in all the wrong ways from time to time. Don't get me wrong, Hiromu Arakawa really put in a lot of thought and effort into writing up the story and the characters but you can just tell where she got lazy and resorted to using some of the same clich\u00e9s that plague other battle shonen anime/manga series. They're few and far between, but when they pop up, chances are that you'll instinctively face-palm (especially if there's some bullshit monologue about friendship; I'm looking at you, final fight between Envy and Roy Mustang >_>).\\n\\n\r\nNow with all that ugliness out of the way, let's talk positives because hot DAMN is there a lot of praise to give this show. When it comes down to world-building, Hiromu Arakawa is all but unmatched. The world that Brotherhood is set in is masterfully crafted, with a lot of detail put into the locations that each part of the story takes place in. It's quite evident that the biggest reason why the manga took so long to complete would be that Hiromu Arakawa spent a great deal of time fleshing out the finer details of the locations that she brings up. In fact, the only works that I can think of that would be on equal or better footing than Brotherhood would be the likes of Harry Potter, Hunter x Hunter, One Piece, and Legend of the Galactic Heroes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that Brotherhood has going for it is the adventure. I don't know about you, but I always found myself enamoured with the new locations and such that Ed and Al would come across on their journeys. From Lior to Fort Briggs and even the ruins of Xerxes, I never cease to find myself captivated by what's going on. What's more is that the adventure from start to finish (with the exception of the first 15 episodes) is incredibly well-paced. No segment of the adventure feels drawn out to the point of being tedious or rushed to the point where nothing of substance actually happens and that segment could've easily been cut out. Each part of the narrative feels necessary to the plot and is given just enough time to make its impact before we move on to the next part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, one of the biggest complaints I see people lodging against the 2003 series is its supposed lack of action. Well Brotherhood makes up for that supposed weakness in full force. At its core, the Fullmetal Alchemist manga is a battle shonen manga and what battle shonen adaptation would be complete without epic fights? All the fights in Brotherhood are perfectly timed, so they're not hideously drawn nor are they dissatisfyingly short. What's more is that battles are only present in episodes where a fight NEEDS to go down for the sake of plot, so there are no pointless fights thrown in for the hell of it so the fights themselves don't detract from the story in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nBattles, adventures, and a masterfully crafted setting aren't the only thing that Brotherhood has going for it. Surprising though it may be, battle shonen series are actually able to have some damn good drama thrown into the mix which is more than capable of having you emotionally involved with what's going on and that's one of the hallmarks surrounding Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole. Whilst the focus of Brotherhood is more on the adventure than it is the drama, that doesn't stop the show from being able to have more than its fair share of compelling and emotionally involving moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that I want to talk about story-wise before I move on to the characters is the ending. The biggest reason why the 2003 series is so divisive amongst FMA fans as a whole is how the series itself actually concluded. The 2003 series' original conclusion was nothing short of bitter-sweet, with a MUCH heavier emphasis on the bitter than the sweet, even in the sequel movie Conqueror of Shamballah. Brotherhood's ending is the exact opposite. It is a happy ending in every sense of the word which fans found INFINITELY more satisfying than what was there previously. As the great Nobuhiro Watsuki said, shonen series are ultimately comics meant for boys and they should have happy endings. Why? Well... boys are young. Save the depressing shit for when they're older and develop a nasty drinking problem.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one area where Fullmetal Alchemist will always succeed (regardless of incarnation), it would definitely have to be with the characters. Of course with that said, Brotherhood is a more event-driven programme rather than character-driven so character development isn't really a priority. For example, Ed and Al more or less remain the same throughout their entire ordeal. They don't degenerate as individuals, yet they also don't improve or even change in any notable way throughout the entire show's run. Regardless, Ed's characterisation is absolutely spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really love about Ed's characterisation is the fact that despite going through a great deal of strife in his life, he knows how to laugh and have fun. He rebels against authority from time to time, he and Al fight like brothers do, he has childish outbursts from time to time, etc. What I'm getting at is that despite all of the crap he's gone through, he still behaves like a teenager would. In many ways, Ed reminds me of Peter Parker from the Ultmate Spider-Man comics and that resemblance really does boost him up several notches on my likeability meter. His dynamic with Alphonse is also something that I enjoy quite a bit because it feels a bit like Terry McGinnis/Maxine Gibson's relationship from Batman Beyond.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said about Alphonse. Throughout the course of Fullmetal Alchemist (this applies to the manga and both TV series), Alphonse more or less remains static throughout the entire show's run and doesn't get any characterisation beyond functioning as the Maxine Gibson to Edward's Terry MicGinnis and being the gentle giant/naive younger sibling. Any sort of subplot that seemed like it would add more to his character don't really play out as such so we're basically back to where we started. Take the part where Al doubts his own humanity for instance. You'd think that would be like a REALLY huge thing, but no... it gets resolved within 1-2 episodes and Al is back to re-transmuting Ed's soul once Winry knocks it out of Ed's body with her wrench... oh well, such is life.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters in Fullmetal Alchemist have always been of variable quality, and the same remains true in Brotherhood (perhaps even more so because Brotherhood has a MUCH larger supporting cast). Some characters like Roy Mustang, Greed, Scar, Father, and Fuhrer Bradley are REALLY well-written with their own degrees of complexity while others like Lust, Sloth, and Gluttony didn't really have much to their personality aside from being antagonists. I know that this shit is to be expected, but Hiromu Arakawa REALLY outdid herself when it came down to all this other stuff, and when I don't see that level of quality maintained throughout the work, it just leaves me feeling empty inside. \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Brotherhood is definitely among the best-looking shows that Bones has ever produced, but this is obviously to be expected. Bones is no slouch when it comes down to visual quality. Hell, even shows that they created more than a decade ago like RahXephon and Wolf's Rain hold up pretty damn well in 2014. If I had to sum up my thoughts on the visuals, I'd have to say that Brotherhood's aesthetics are more or less identical to the 2003 show's, but refined. Character designs are more in-line with the manga's, improvements in animation technology allow for less still frames/talking heads present, and what's more is that there's a good deal more background animation present. Speaking of which, Brotherhood's action is bar none some of the most enthralling that I've ever seen in ANY shonen anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother area where Brotherhood excels are in the OPs/EDs. It's rare for me to find an anime that I enjoy have multiple openings, all of which that I actually do like. Personally, I'm biased toward the 5th OP, as it's the opening that really just sets the stage perfectly for the final few episodes of Brotherhood. It has this atmosphere about it where everyone's weary and yet they're so close to their goal that they can't just give up now and that what I'm about to watch really is the home stretch. ED-wise, I'm biased toward the 1st ED because of the animation style as it's all-chibi artwork animated as if it were drawn in pencil with a great track playing over it. That actually brings me over to the audio side of the spectrum.\\n\\n\r\nAudio-wise, Brotherhood doesn't disappoint... asterisk. Now there is one complaint that I have with the OST but that's mostly because the 2003 show's OST is among my all-time favourite anime OSTs and yet Brotherhood just didn't live up to my expectations upon re-watch. This is a similar problem that I had with Hellsing Ultimate in the sense that its predecessor's OST is superior to my ears than the OST that we have for the reboot despite the fact that the one present is REALLY good stuff. There wasn't much in the way of background music that stood out, although it did serve as a complement to whatever was going on and there wasn't anything that I personally found inappropriate for the moment at hand. My favourite OP/ED themes are \"Rain\" and \"Uso\" by SID respectively, just so I can get that out of the way.\\n\\n\r\nDub-wise, Funimation steps up to the plate and delivers in full force. The cast is almost identical to the 2003 series' dub (which is one of my all-time favourite Funimation dubs, by the way), save for certain characters because let's face it: there's no way you can get the same people to work on a project they had a hand in 5-6 years ago all in one place. The most noticeable changes to the cast are Maxey Whitehead replacing Aaron Dismuke as Alphonse, Troy Baker replacing Chris Patton as Greed, J. Michael Tatum replacing Dameon Clark as Scar, and John Swasey aka Gendo Ikari replacing Scott McNeil as Hohenheim.\\n\\n\r\nI can safely say that Whitehead, Baker, Tatum, and Swasey all do an excellent job with the roles they were given and are on-par if not better than their predecessors... although I'm biased toward Chris Patton's version of Greed for... reasons. The rest of the dub is spot-on. Vic Mignonga, Travis Willingham, Caitlin Glass, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Laura Bailey, and everyone else who had a hand to play in this dub did an absolutely spectacular job. I'd like to hear dub haters try and talk shit about this dub, because I can't find anything wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts? Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shining example of what an adaptation SHOULD do, and yet it baffles me as to how people can consider this to be the best anime ever and something that is infinitely superior to the 2003 series. Despite my preference of the 2003 series, I'd say that they're equals. It's not often we get TWO adaptations which have VERY well-written plots and if you really are a manga purist, you can view the 2003 series as an alternate universe interpretation. Regardless, I absolutely enjoyed watching Brotherhood and I look forward to the day where I can own a DVD/Blu-ray combo pack of the entire show. Both the 2003 series and Brotherhood should be watched by all and both deserve a special place on your shelf of interesting items.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I'm out. Feedback is always welcome, as are monetary contributions and offerings of food, drinks, chromosomes and fancy clothes to the Dark Lord Chin-Chin.",

            "content": "After watching Fullmetal Alchemist, I was left with an unsatisfied feeling. Everything felt rushed, and the twists and turns lacked gravitas. So it was with great scepticism that I continued on to watch Brotherhood. Quickly, my fears about this remake were dispelled and I was hooked. Four days and 64 episodes later, I'm at the end and I'm blown away.\r\nI do strongly suggest you watch FMA before moving onto Brotherhood. FMA was good, had a lot of entertainment value, but half the things I wanted to see didn't happen - and I haven't even read the manga yet. But in Brotherhood you get everything youexpected to see and more.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Edward and Alphonse feels so much more real in FMA Brotherhood. I can actually see their bond and believe that they'd do anything to get their bodies back. In FMA, I wanted to see more brotherly moments, and I just didn't get that until Brotherhood. \\n\\n\r\nWinry had a much bigger role to play in Brotherhood than she did in FMA. Her interactions with Ed and Al we hilarious and touching, and the three of them really drive this story all the way. You never stop rooting for them and you never stop hoping that they can right their wrongs and get their bodies back.\\n\\n\r\nAnother favourite duo was Mustang and Hawkeye. I loved seeing the two of them together, because they just played off each other really well. They were there for each other through thick and thin and every scene they had together was a delight to watch.\\n\\n\r\nFMA Brotherhood left me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't stop watching, and when I had to because I needed sleep, I swear that all I could think about was FMA Brotherhood, the characters, and where I thought this anime would go. \\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend this!",

However the actual quality of the anime itself is far poorer.  What realy made FMA's previous anime adaptation so successfull was the overall direction of the anime.  The quality of shots used in this anime and the art itself is inferior to the original anime.  Obviously it is still highly enjoyable due to the story behind it, but the anime seems overhyped.  People feel pressured to believe thats its better due to the story being more accuratly followed.  This is notthe way to think.  The anime suffered hugely at first as well, as it attempted to catch up to the manga, thus rushing through over half of the story.  The sound was not bad, but then again it was not that good.\\n\\n\r\nFMA fanatics should enjoy this as it follows the manga more closely, however if you have not read the manga then I would reccomend the original series, as in all honesty it is of much better quality.",

            "content": "Alright, first review.... Please bare with me here.\r\nStory-10\r\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB) has an fantastic story. Its pacing at first is faster then I'd expect, since the '03 FMA's first few episodes were some of its most developing, but it quickly makes up for any lack of development later on in the show. It's also has the perfect length at 64 episodes, as if it were any shorter, I'd personally think it was a bit too short, and if it were any longer, too long. Everything is great, from the emotional beginning to the truly epic ending.\r\nArt-9\r\nFMA:B is animated gorgeously. Anything from its talking scenes, todrama scenes, to action scenes, all look great.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nI'm going to get this out of the way right now: I loved every single one of these openings/endings. They were all great songs that fit the point of the show they were at. As for the OST, its still great, but I really sense that they used the same tracks over more times than I'd like.\\n\r\nI watched FMA:B both subbed and dubbed, and I actually have to say that I like the dub more than the sub. Vic Mignogna  does a perfect job as Edward, and everyone else does great returning to their older Characters from FMA '03.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-10 \\n\r\nThe characters is definitely one of FMA:B's strong suits in my opinion. You feel for every character, main or side, villain or hero. All characters are fleshed out and feel real. In two different episodes, you can see Edward actually grow taller, and that's TRUE character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nI truly love this anime. It made me laugh, smile, tear up, made me full adrenaline, and all at once sometimes. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime, and probably always will be. It truly deserves everyone's enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10",

            "content": "Anyone who does not like Deus Ex Machina and plot points that seem to be hastily shoved into place should not watch this Anime. And any fans of the original FMA Anime should tread carefully. While this is still a fairly good show there are many things that just don't work.\r\nIt's always a shame to see good characters go to waste. Ed and Al are two interesting kids who will do no growing or learning over the course of 64 episodes, they began and end their journey the same as they started it albeit with a varying degree of limbs. \r\nOur story centers around ageneric good vs evil plot, where those that fall under the banner of evil show no real reasons or proper motivations for their actions aside from the authors needing a villain. Why do the homonculi want to help Father? Because a villain needs henchmen. Why does the Dwarf in the Flask want power? Because why not.  It's a shame the story is such lackluster since the world it's built in feels so vivid and inviting. \\n\\n\r\nBut even a greater shame then the villains would have to be the supporting cast of the good guys. Ed and Al don't develop or change but they are still interesting, the same can not be said for their companions. An odd medley of alchemists, soldiers, and chimera all fighting for the greater good and barely an interesting one among them. If you want to watch this series and find some good characterization, pay attention to Ling and Greed. They are the only characters that actually seem to grow, change, and have real conflict within this story.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final point I would like to say that while both FMA and FMA:B use death as a major driving force for characters FMA:B can almost be laughed at for even attempting this. Characters with no actual characterization are killed off and we are expected to see this as a shame and a reasonable excuse for a major characters actions. If your flashback scene for a character can only consist of \"Hello, I'm [Name].\" and two other boring statements with no real barring, then this character should never be used to develop major plot points.",

            "content": "Let me start by saying this: This review is only helpful if you haven't seen the first FMA. Shocking, I know, but people like this do exist.\r\nAlright, I've seen 12 episodes of FMA Brotherhood.\r\n1) The animation is stellar, the action is gorgeous, and scene arrangement ensure a smooth, liquid pacing that ensures you're never bored.\r\n2) The music, the voice actors, everything is great. I can't review sound - go watch and listen!\r\n3) The characters are fantastic.  The only character I hate is Ed, shockingly enough.  I know, how can you enjoy a series and hate the main character? As far as I cantell, Ed is the male equivalent of a Tsundere, meaning as they develop how he actually thinks and feels, I'll grow to love him.  I hope.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, and there are a lot of them, carry the show.  Someone is constantly looking to have something done or has some agenda, and characters with conflicting agendas manifest naturally.  This makes for a gorgeous multi-linked plot that is getting both hectic but staying steady and clear.\\n\\n\r\n4) Story: FMA Brotherhood is a show about two brothers making a mistake and then trying to fix it.  At least, on the surface.  It becomes rapidly clear a whole lot of other things are going on, and these things will doubtless lead our intrepid heroes down down down the rabbit hole until we find ourselves at the heart of some crazy hair brained world reaching plot.  Or at least, that is my anticipation.\\n\\n\r\nThe brotherhood dynamic, as cited in the title, actually doesn't seem like the critical plot focus to me thus far.  It plays an integral role, and parts along the way are definitely fleshing it out, but the real enjoyment from the series lies in the varied assortment of individuals you are meeting along the way.  I've read some of the other reviews, and they state these characters aren't being fleshed out enough.  Given the fact that the series hasn't ended yet, I'm desperately hoping this is true!  Good story telling is done by slowly shaving down to the core of what characters are.  Imagine my surprise in Ep. 11 to discover Roy Mustang isn't secretly a bad guy, in spite of how he is originally portrayed, and how I originally perceived him to be.  At this critical moment for him, my feelings about him completely toggled over to one where, hey, I know exactly who this guy is, and I like him a lot more for it.\\n\\n\r\n5) Enjoyment: The show makes me lose sleep waiting for it to come out to view.  That should indicate just how much I love it so far.  I will say this: As long as they keep the quick pace up and keep chipping away at the truth, Brotherhood will become a stellar classic, making people wonder why there was any doubt as to where it was going.\\n\\n\r\nI compare its pacing, and plot advancement solely to Code Geass for how quick and consistent it runs.\\n\\n\r\n***I've just now obtained FMA (the original) and started to watch it, struggled through about 12 episodes, and threw in the towel. It was boring, Brotherhood has spoiled me.  I hope this doesn't offend original viewers, but all that other stuff in there is fluff to what Brotherhood is portraying as plot critical, and since my mind is full of Brotherhood thoughts, well...",

            "content": "When the original Fullmetal Alchemist series released, it was praised as one of the greatest anime ever. This series wasn't created to replace that position, but as more people read the continuing manga version of the story, more people likely wished for an animated series featuring that original plot. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood seems to be that original story, yet I couldn't confirm it myself as I haven't read the manga and only watched the original series. Many people claim it a strong point that this is the original author's intended direction of the plot, and that may be true, but I would say this specificadaptation of the manga is likely not a good representation of the manga's fame.\\n\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is now praised ahead of the original series and is treated as one of the best anime ever created. I would personally disagree with that point, but not to the extent of calling it bad. This version of Fullmetal Alchemist stands out as one of the most complex shounen tales I have ever witnessed, while still carrying many of the shounen cliches. It has a big budget behind it, despite holding a smaller viewer base on its televised premiere than the original, and that budget shows.\\n\\n\r\nFrom mentioning budget, I'd first like to cover the audio and visuals of Brotherhood. The visuals are some of the best I've seen and you can really tell it was made by Bones. The show is overflowing with visual attentions to detail that stick between scene transitions, and you will very rarely notice something missing. There are a variety of locations with great levels of detail in their backgrounds, and the animation is always there to serve motion. Despite some of the animation being a bit wonky, the show holds a good amount of great action.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack leaves a bit more to be desired. While the tracks that do exist are very unique, there isn't enough variety in the tracks available to correctly display every emotion a story like Fullmetal Alchemist needs to convey. The original series had plenty of action-oriented tunes to play, but this version seems to only have about three available and you'll hear them in just about every fight. In a shounen, action-adventure you'd expect more of a priority in that type of soundtrack instead of quieter, less-memorable ones. The soundtrack isn't as orchestrated as the original, and the music sounds very electronic at times, but the soundtrack isn't bad in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nOn a final note towards budget: The openings/endings of this show are generally above-average, but none really express a feeling of excitement or anticipation and are usually softer, not really catching the feeling of the series. The last ending song was the most memorable by the simple notion that it fit better with what was actually going on in the series at the time. Mentioning timing, it should also be noted that there is quite a lot of odd placements and cut-offs of music in Brotherhood, and there are close to a dozen times when it will even conflict with the emotions you should be having in the story.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond budget, the \"true\" story of Fullmetal Alchemist is a long and imaginative one. With the length of the manga, I could safely assume that Brotherhood doesn't cover a large percentage of the manga's details. This is where things start to stumble from the potential this series had. In the original series of Fullmetal Alchemist, there was a variety of unconnected problems and issues to deal with that kept things interesting. In Brotherhood, however, the show puts all of its focus onto one, single plot-goal, barely ever straying from that goal. Making a series of over sixty episodes needs some variety or twists to keep things interesting, but Brotherhood severely lacks in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe first dozen episodes start with an almost episodic nature, speeding through content that correlates with the original series. That could be justified by this being a supplement to the original series, but that only makes Brotherhood less sturdy on its own feet in the process. The show strikes a point shortly where an interesting plot begins. Even at that point the entire outcome of that plot is very predictable, but it serves some intrigue through the encounters it creates. However, it soon begins to drag as characters begin to do less and plan more of how to get from point A to point B in order to head to their predictable destination. There are no twists in this time to bring another rise in interest and the show assumes that one plot is enough. What the original series did to combat that is take what is treated as a secondary plot in Brotherhood (the regaining of Ed and Al's bodies, which is learned at the beginning) and put more focus on it, bringing out more detail and development. Brotherhood even pushes that to the side and fuels itself off of character interaction between a growing list of non-developed characters.\\n\\n\r\nBrotherhood had two chances to fix this problem with the direction they chose to go. One solution could have been to make the series longer and make more side-plots and more development in other characters to make the viewers care more for them. That would also fix the huge pacing issue that can be seen in the beginning, and throughout most of the show. The second route they could've taken, still focusing on this one plot, is shortening the entire show to about half its length and cutting out unnecessary details.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, Brotherhood focuses on the technicalities of fixing a large, yet predictable, situation. Choosing that path could still bring some interest if the dialogue was top-notch, but it just isn't at that level in Brotherhood. The planning the characters do to solve obstacles in their path is generally interesting and somewhat smart with the fantasy elements it has in place, but the terminology most of the characters use (in the english dub at least) is generally simple and very particular. You'll be hearing a lot of simple and repeated phrases for describing situations, and that is a large amount of the dialogue. Character interactions don't delve too much within the pasts and minds of each character, and development is barely made. Even the main characters, Ed and Al, almost feel like side characters after the first dozen of rushed episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSo we have a problem with pacing, a lack of focus towards variety in story and plot, a lack of soundtrack elements to correctly display moods, and I may even say a lack of style. The presentation of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood feels more in tune to getting to the point and rushing the way there. It never takes the time to introduce the viewer to the story and practically acts like a slideshow of what happens here and thereafter. There's barely any clever camera angles or attentions to detail in a consistent and unique style like the original, but there are plenty of details in the technicalities of the leading plot.\\n\\n\r\nI have a great feeling that the story of the manga had great potential of creating one of the best animated series around, but this attempt just falls short on direction. While the technical aspects of the manga's main plot are likely in place, it seems the director and screenwriter forgot to take into account that they are translating the story to film, not treating the film as the manga. A manga and a show are two different things that have different opportunities to be unique. Although the director of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was involved in the creation of the acclaimed movie \"Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door\", there's a reason that he worked solely on the storyboards.",

The story seems to take place sometime before the first FMA, but it's really hard to tell.\r\nFrom what I've gathered it's sticking really closely to the manga this time around. As for the overall awesomeness of the animation, its seriously a 10. The action and the fighting are great and the animation is smooth and amazing. \r\nIt's interesting to see the voice of Urahara as Roy Mustang (one of my fav Bleach characters is ROY?! lol) and Ed and Alphonse are the sameas last time. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, based on only seeing the first episode its definitely a must watch in my opinion, but this is coming from a hardcore fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist.

            "content": "Before I get started, I should say that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime series and favorite television show in general. I prefer it over the first anime, but I did watch Brotherhood first which may bias that, though the ending of Brotherhood is definitely better and I really enjoy many of the characters that the first anime excluded.\r\nThe story of Brotherhood is one of the best ever created, following the storylineof he manga (Fullmetal Alchemist). It is the longest showI have ever watched which has practically no filler at all with just about every event in the story contributing to the overall plotin some way, even if you don't know it will at first. The story follows the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, on their journey to find a philosopher's stone so that they can get back Al's body and Ed's arm and leg which they lost several year ago when they tried to bring their deceased moher back to life with alchemy but failed. Ed becomes a state alchemist with title Fullmetal Alchemist which he uses to help his research as he and Alphonse travel around the country searching for leads. Along the way, they meet Homunculi (seeingly immortal beings named after the 7 deadly sins who are te main antagonists of the series), Scar (a man who seeks revenge on state alchemists for starting a war against his people and killing them), and friends like Ling (a prince from another country seeking imortality), and other state alchemists and officials who help him like Roy Mustang and Maes Hughes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in FMAB is exceptional and just as good in the beginning as it is in he end. The fight scenes are well designed and show an amazing amount of detail. The one thing to note is that this show has a large amount of blood (especially in the fights with the homunculi who can survive even if their bodies are cut in half many times). The sound goes along very well with tracks that fit the mood perfectly (my personal favorie being \"Pride's Theme,\" a very creepy song that fits Pride [a homunculus] very well).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in FMAB are some of the best. Edward Elric is my favorite anime character. Ed is a short, blonde boy who los his right arm and left leg which are now replaced with automail. He is the youngest state alchemist ever due to his abilit to transmute (the act of doing alchemy) without a transmuation circle (which he gained at the same timehe lost his arm an leg). Alphonse is Ed's younger brother whose soul resides in a large suit of armor which was the result of Ed's last-ditch effort to save his brother after failing t bring their mother back to life. Al is often mistaken for the Fullmetal Alchemist due to this which annoys Ed (plus Al's now taller than his shorter, older, brother). Winry Rockbell is Ed and Al's childhood friend and Ed's automail mechanic who created his leg and arm.\\n\\n\r\nSome of my other favorite characters are Envy (one of the homunculi who can shapeshift and disguise himself [his gender is never actually determined] which basially makes him the troll of this show), Roy Mustang (the Flame Alchemist who wants to become the military leader of the country in place of King Bradley one day and works with Ed and Al at times though Ed doesn't really like him much at first), Riz Hawkeye (the kin of woman who obliterates any stereoptypes about women, she is Mustang's most trustworthy soldier and helps protect him her badass-ness), Ling Yao (the prince from another country who seeks immortality, though saying much abou him would be a spoiler; accompanying Ling are Lan Fan and Fu who are his personal bodyguards and will lay their lives down to protect him [Lan Fan follows in Riza's badass, stereotype-destroying footsteps]), and Maes Hughes (a militaryman who loves his family, his friends, his family, being cheerful, and of course his faily [want to see a picture of his daughter?]).\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every second of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The ending is one of the best ever, the characters are some of the best ever, the story has many plot twists but none that seem forced and the lack of filler keeps the story moving at all times making you want more and bringing you back for each episode. I really can't any fault with show.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show for every anime fan. It is my personal favorite show frm any medium (anime or not).",

            "content": "Fascinating. When Bones announced Brotherhood, I was like \u2018You want to sell us the same story again, huh? That\u2019s really greedy, you bastards!\u2019 Well, I still think that Bones did it for money. Of course they did, because that is how industry works. But after spending about half a year of my life on watching Brotherhood, I have to admit that this show is worth every single yen it will earn.\r\nBrotherhood is a ridiculous phenomenon to me. It subverted all my criteria for choosing anime to watch. I always preferred ranobe-based shows to manga-based, and I never liked long-runners. Y\u2019see, my ideal was some 13-episodebittersweet anime based on a sci-fi novel with some cute girls or something. That doesn\u2019t resemble Brotherhood at all, right? But I cannot find a single clue to not liking the new Fullmetal Alchemist series.\\n\\n\r\nBrotherhood\u2019s plot is nearly flawless. (I still have some questions, but I always have them, so screw me.) The first anime was good, but it played out somewhere in the middle, when its plot overran the manga. There is no such problem in the second anime. Even more, its plot goes epic near the end. Well, the word \u2018epic\u2019 is not even enough here. If English had a single word for \u2018oh god, so epically epic\u2019, that would be a better choice. And plus the skilful character development\u2026 Elric brothers actually grew up throughout the series. And there are a lot more characters with their own individualities, y\u2019know. Arakawa Hiromu-shi is damn genius in this field, no kidding. Call me a sexist, but I never thought that female mangaka can create a plot so twisted, exciting and based on pure logic. Like, remember that episode when\u2026 Oh, I can\u2019t bring examples without spoiling something. Bad, but let\u2019s better proceed to next aspect.\\n\\n\r\nOnly objective issue I can bring here is that the beginning was a bit fast, but that\u2019s okay since Bones already covered that part of the story in the first show. However, if you didn\u2019t watch that, you\u2019ll find that first episodes of Brotherhood are somewhat rushed.\\n\\n\r\nAnother amazing thing here is that Bones managed to keep animation quality on a high level for the whole duration of Brotherhood. They really approached this show with all responsibility. That\u2019s praiseworthy, right?\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last aspect is music. The first anime was notable for its catchy opening and ending themes, and Brotherhood continued its tradition. Alchemist has one of the best soundtracks in anime, I think.\\n\\n\r\nOh god, I already ran out of themes to discuss. Without anything to criticize, I always have a vocabulary shortage. So, the summary: Brotherhood is a great anime. It easily overwhelms the first one in terms of enjoyment. Hell, it may be the best sh\u014dnen show about the guys with superpowers that was ever made. Some people can dislike Brotherhood for its popularity or annoying fans, but every good series receive this kind of treatment. Y\u2019know, fandom is fandom and anime is anime. It\u2019s a bad thing to mix those up.\\n\\n\r\nWell, giving Brotherhood 10 points will make me sound like a fanboy, but jeez, I already sound like one and I\u2019m okay with that. I can recommend it as an example of awesome sh\u014dnen series to all anime fans, from narutards to those carriers of eternal wisdom, who think that every show which has more than 100 fans is a hyped-up kuso for brainless masses. 10 points, that\u2019s it.",

The alchemy animations are very well done and the fighting sequences doesn't feel dull or forced.\r\nThe voices are perfect. Every character has a voice that really suits their personality which makes it more enjoyable and credible. The openings are very very good, with the music really complementing on the sequences.\r\nThe characters are simply amazing. Well thought, each one well developed, and not just focused on2 or 3 main characters, but on all of them with care. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, when you are watching this series, one or two episodes aren't enough to satisfy your hunger to know more and more, and each one is very important for the big plot.\\n\\n\r\nIt truly is a Masterpiece.",

            "content": "I prefer the first one. I'm here to say that if you don't get all the hype about Brotherhood its okay.\r\nThat said I think the ending of Brotherhood was all around put together 5x as well. In all the anime was pretty good and was pretty interesting, but I don't get why it averages such high ratings. I prefer the sad ending of the first one, but the story had already fallen apart by that point. Brotherhood on the other hand knew exactly where it was going and attempted to get there at 10x the speed of the first one and with 1/3rd the characterdevelopment.\\n\\n\r\nBelievability: I would prefer Brotherhood's composition with the first one's story. I just didn't find it that believable. What can make a break a story's believability is the action scenes. Every single antagonist that they fought in Brotherhood should have won. The only fights that could conceivably end in a win were ones with Scar and the only reason I think that is because Scar is a bamf. The biggest hit to the believability of the story was everything to do with the main antagonist. Everything about him including how he lost is hard for me to believe and made it impossible for me to immerse myself in the story. If you care less about how believable the means are and care more about the results, then Brotherhood is great for you.\\n\\n\r\n*****Spoiler Section*******\\n\r\n- For people who want specific examples of what i mean when i talk about the            fight scenes I have provided a few examples below:\\n\\n\r\n-Fight with  Pride: This is the fight I look back to when I try to recall an example. It is simply ridiculous. Why didn't Pride just stab them where they weren't blocking? There is no reason except the plot. They had to beat him therefore they did. Every time Ed blocked all of Pride's spikes with his one arm I did a facepalm. \\n\\n\r\n-Fight with Lust: She can just spear you with her \"Ultimate Spear.\"  She is unbeatable except when she needs to be beaten for the plot to progress.\\n\\n\r\n-Fight with Greed: There was actually no problem with this fight technically, but Greed supposedly had the \"Ultimate Armor\" and yet he has fairly obvious weak points all over his body? There are no huge weaknesses to the other homunculi abilities and yet his is made inferior just by that fact of him being a homunculus? When I think about him I remember how Ed beat him in the first one. His armor had no real weakness, Ed just used his brain and made the armor not armor.\\n\\n\r\n-For those who have seen the anime and wonder what I found unbelievable about Father I have provided a few things below:\\n\\n\r\nAlchemy: How did Father not know about the foreign versions of Alchemy. He was made of the stuff in the first place. That simply makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nHis Death: Talk about cliche... Ed fit into every single male protagonist cliche when he fought Father. Somehow a guy who can do above average Alchemy can beat a being made from the stuff, who can use alchemy with a thought? What!? One might make the argument that Father was out of energy during their fight. Well... isn't that convenient. He could have squashed them at any other time, but didn't because he correctly assumed they were nowhere close to his strength. It is the classic villain loses because of his own arrogance instead of any real actions taken by the heroes. It just seemed like the story could have simply been about Father and how he tried to become God and failed because it wasn't possible and have no mention of any of the main characters except to have them kick start his ritual.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\r\nFMA: Brotherhood is an anime that i enjoyed a lot, i wish i watched this before, after friends telling me to watch it, i wasn't sure because i thought it was too long, now i even feel it was short and left me wanting a little more but at the same time glad for the conclusion.\r\nStory\r\nIt starts almost predictable for me, talking about the plot, it appears a guy, an ex statal alchemist killing statal alchemists because he found out about a secret that the militia is doing something and he wants to stop them and at that part i was making mybets about what he was talking and if he was really a ''bad'' guy, (turns out i was right about it, and not just that one but a lot more) then i thought the story wasn't going to surprise me, but it was the opposite, it did surprised me a lot of times; I got to point out that the story is well made and told with little noticeable flaws, the story is not just about the adventure of Ed and Al to retrieve their bodies back but is about finding out the truth behind what they're looking and how it connects to the people, the country and the fate of all, meeting new people that will help them and some old friends too, finding about their stories. The story will make you shed some tears for unexpected people and humanoids, feel sorry for murderous guys, even if you hated them, you will feel empathy for their reasons of being like that, the ending was good, with a final scene of a photo that i liked and that's why i think the story is outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style was not amazing but it sure was very good and the animation too, with great fight scenes but sometimes those fight scenes and art style were dropping quality at certain scenes the character design is not my favorite but it was good, i think the FMA from early 2000 had a better animation and i only saw some eps. when it was aired in CN but in general it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe background music is really good the same can be said about the first OP that has beautiful vocals and reminded me of Maoyuu's OP, the first ED was good too, the rest were meh, too many OPs and EDs, for me that amount was unnecessary and they give spoilers, the VA was great, if it wasn't for that amount of OPs and EDs the sound could have been outstanding but for that it's just great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe amount of great and outstanding characters is high, everyone is interesting and great villains that are despicable but somehow the creator made you care for them.\\n\r\n-Edward Elric is the big brother of Alphonse, who may not look strong but he is despite his inmature personality and his anger at everyone who calls him little; He's good hearted and always wants to save people.\\n\r\n-Alphonse Elric is the little brother, more mature but at the same time could be more naive than Ed, he's even more kind hearted than Ed.\\n\r\n-Winry is like the little or at times big ''sister'' of the Elric brothers kicking their asses when they get in trouble or creating trouble for them.\\n\r\n-Izumi Curtis is the sensei that teached alchemy to Ed and Al and she beat the life out of them, she is a great character.\\n\r\n-Roy Mustang is the one who started the brothers to be statal alchemists and a great one of the most powerful characters but at the same time useless under water, he is a great leader aiming to be the new Fuhrer so he can help and protect people.\\n\r\n-Scar is an Ishvalith who is seeking revenge against every statal alchemist that was or wasn't involved in the Ishvalith war, a powerful character.\\n\r\n-Yao Ling is great full of ambition and at the same time determination of reaching his goal of becoming the Emperor of Xing no matter what, friendly and deadly, he will be a real friend to Ed, and a bother to him.\\n\r\n-May Chang is a little girl that is seeking for the same thing that Ling, to become the Ruler of Xing.\\n\r\n-Kimblee was a little disappointing because i thought he was going to be more dangerous than what he looked or what he did, he was the only let down of a character.\\n\r\n-Van Hohenheim is the father of the Elric's and someone with a though past and that past leads him to abandon his family, he's one great character.\\n\r\nAnd a big amount of great characters, like the Armstrong family, Hugh Maes, the various Chimeras, Greed, Hawkeye, Prof. Marcoh, Envy, Father, King Bradley, Bucaneer, Miles and the list goes and goes, is a big great cast of memorable outstanding characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis is for me a flawed masterpiece, i recognize like any other the flaws but i have to follow the enjoyment i had, it was superb, it was outstanding, i was never bored and kept watching the next eps. when i could, the ending was good but i wanted more even with a good conclusion.",

            "content": "Alright. Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. Everything about this anime was amazing and simply brilliant. The story was always keeping the 'watcher' wanting to keep watching no matter what.( I found myself staying up way later than I planned to keep watching this series) Every concept in this anime (Alchemy and Alkahestry) was simply fantastic learning about and watching it be used from creating giant flipping fists punching people in battle to saving peoples lives. Anyone who has watched this anime(or read the manga) probably agrees with me that they would give anything for our world to have Alchemy. And also,THERE ARE NO FILLERS, *laughs likea madman*\\n\\n\r\nThe Art in FMA Brotherhood was simply fantastic. Watching the magnificent view of the Resembool country side to every small detail of the tediously created alchemy circles to every fight scene; the breathtaking and epic animations were clearly shown in every episode. All the fights had more... oomph, than those in FMA. There was more fight and felt like you were actually there. They were more dramatic and more gruesome(gruesome being a good thing)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in FMA Brotherhood was fantastic as well. All the ending and beginning songs were spectacular.(as well as their animations) Much effort was put into every sound. The sound of a transmutation circle going off, the clapping of hands for Ed's alchemy, agonizing screams of people who loose limbs or are mortally wounded, well thought out speech for every character; they were all fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters were spectacular as well as everything else. Every Character was fabulous and played an important role for the overall story. The only problem I had involving characters was that the main antagonist's personality was boring. He didn't seem interesting enough. Another minor problem with one of the characters, I would have given anything for Sloth to say, \"What a drag.\" instead of, \"What a pain\" (if anyone got that reference)(hm, that may be considered copyright, I don't know)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, damn right I enjoyed this anime. Without hesitation, I put it as my top and most favorite anime. Two other things I would like to point out that I also enjoyed about this anime. The great amount of suspension and action leading up to the Promise Day and how burly men.(in Brotherhood it's Major Armstrong and Sig Curtis, forgot who it is in FMA) There was I was literally crying from how funny it was, how they compete against each other with muscles and gain each others respect. Then see them handshake. One of my most favorite things about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe first time I watched through FMA and FMA Brotherhood, I hated everything about Brotherhood but loved FMA. I don't know why. Rewatching both of them, I've found that I love Brotherhood a 100, no, a thousand times better than FMA. I hated the FMA ending but loved everything about Brotherhood. I don't know what I was thinking.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone, it's long enough where it's not as short as those 12 or 24 episode anime and then ends abruptly. FMA brotherhood has a pretty damn good ending(better than most), well I mean sure it could have gone on for another episode or two to explain some things *cough* *cough* Winry and that stuff. Anyways, if you watched FMA and wondering if you should watch Brotherhood, WATCH IT. If you've already watched both of them, I hope you agree with me that Brotherhood is superior, watch it again because it never gets old.",

            "content": "This anime is about two brothers fighting to regain their bodies after a alchemy experiment gone wrong. Along the way they uncover an evil plot and pick up many companions. \r\nPlot: Think of a very linear anime like Fist of the North Star, where Kenshiro travels from village to village, challenge to challenge, always moving forward, always exploding heads and never revisiting any of the places he\u2019s conquered. FMA is the opposite. It actually reminded me of an RPG videogame the way the characters would travel back and forth between cities and how these locations would change between visits. For example, Edward goes from theCentral city to the East, back to central to deal with new shit, visits Winry in his village, goes to central again to deal with new shit before heading to another city in the far East to deal with even more shit etc\u2026 I love this because it makes understanding the geography of Amestris important and allows the viewer to explore the country with Ed/Al.\\n\\n\r\nPacing: The series starts out doing a great job showing how characters get from point A to point B but then they get lazy. About halfway through the series characters start jumping between cities without proper explanation of how they got there. For some people it\u2019s irrelevant but to me, it gives the impression that the characters simply teleported. I mean how does a little girl magically get from the frozen tundra of the north of the country\u2019s eastern desert in between episodes? I\u2019d like to know. Now do I want them to devote \u00bd of the series\u2019 screen time to train rides? No. But it could have used smoother transitions.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, By season 3 the cast gets large enough to where the episodes switch between 4-5 different character groups in different parts of the country. In theory this is good because it adds intricacy to the plot. The problem I have with FMA is that they will leave one storyline on a cliffhanger to switch to a relatively uneventful storyline. For example, they\u2019ll leave Edward bleeding and half dead in a frozen wasteland just to switch to Al and Winry helping villagers build houses. It\u2019s one thing if you follow Game of Throne\u2019s style of switching from cliffhanger to cliffhanger but in this case I thought they could have cut out some of the fluff to make the story arc pacing a little smoother.\\n\\n\r\nAction: I always like it when anime introduces a new fighting style. FMA does this with the addition of alchemy. The fight scenes are cool, creative and diverse. I also liked how even though Ed was a badass his friends didn't become useless or obsolete (aka like Goku's friends).\\n\\n\r\nComedy: This deserves its own section. Basically it\u2019s pretty simple, if you like anime-style, slapstick, comedic moments you\u2019re going to jizz yourself every almost episode if you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t stop rolling your eyes. There\u2019s probably a Japanese term for it but it\u2019s the comedy that involves fainting/nose bleeds after embarrassing moments, extreme facial distortions when angry, sleeping snot bubbles, huge skull blisters appearing after a friendly wrench beating. I found it a little much to be honest and it gave the anime a much lighter tone. Some people will love it though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I really liked the English dubs. Great voice acting cast. I didn\u2019t care for the intros/outros, but the music sound track was solid.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Good \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great memorable characters with very vibrant personalities. I thought the concept of the homunculi was brilliant and their personalities, despite embodying single sins, were very complex and interesting\u2014especially Greed, Wrath and Envy. Oh and Scar is one of the most badass antiheroes in anime. My only complaint is that they spent a LOT of time developing smaller side characters and not a lot of time killing them off. I mean yeah it\u2019s good to develop support characters but by the end of the series the cast felt a little clunky. I mentioned this earlier but even in a 64 episode series you only have so much screen time. Instead of devoting time to exploring the thoughts, struggles and emotions of minor henchmen and tagalongs, why not spend it on the mains who are so much more interesting? Using the law of equivalent exchange, I would have liked FMA to transmute some side characters into more screen time for underdeveloped plots like Winry-Ed, backstories of Homunculi, Scar\u2019s story, Father, etc. \\n\r\nOverall: I am 90% satisfied. I think I would have been at 100% if this series could have been a little shorter or a lot longer. Basically if they had trimmed it down or spent the extra time to make everything complete. Everyone always raves about the ending but to be honest I still wanted more.\\n\r\nBlood/Gore: It\u2019s surprisingly bloody for a MA14+ anime. Severed limbs, bullet wounds, human sacrifice\u2026mixed in with slapstick comedy.\\n\r\nLove/Romance: Yes, there is a romantic subplot that develops very, very slowly over the series but it\u2019s not the main focus. The \u201cAction/Romance\u201d genre is often attempted but seldom done well. It usually turns out to be an action anime w/ a clumsy love-interest side-plot or a sappy romance story with 2nd rate action. Either way the non-dominant side just becomes a plot device for the other one. Personally, I\u2019m not really into sappy romance animes but I like it when a romantic subplot is done right and can make me care about a couple\u2019s mutual survival in the context of a larger struggle (Mirai Nikki, Gosick). Anyway FMA does that well but I thought it could have been done better. \\n\r\nSex/Nudity: Laura Bailey\u2019s voice is pure sex. \\n\r\nLook out for:\\n\r\nEpisode 42, 15:00 \u201cNow that he\u2019s taken a monster like you into his flesh\u201d\\n\r\nEpisode 54, 10:50 an unfathomably homoerotic scene.\\n",

            "content": "Let me get one thing out of the way before I start this review: \u201cFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\u201d blows its predecessor out of the water! Mind you, this is coming from a guy who found the original Fullmetal Alchemist a rather disappointing experience. That essentially means that I was skeptical when I first started watching this anime, only to be totally shocked by how good it was!\r\nWhether you enjoyed the original, or hated it, this reincarnation of Fullmetal Alchemist has completely changed my opinion of the series as a whole!\r\nBreakdown:\r\nStory (10/10) \u2013 I cannot stress enough how much better the story of \u201cBrotherhood\u201d is than theoriginal. If you\u2019re reading this review, you likely know that the original show deviated from the manga after a short while, and continued in a rather different direction. As manga tends so often to be, the story of the manga ends up being much stronger than what the creators of the original anime were able to come up with. \u201cBrotherhood\u201d follows the story of the manga quite closely, thus the anime never feels like filler, or just boring junk.\\n\\n\r\nThe first fifteen episodes or so are very similar to about the first half of the original \u201cFullmetal Alchemist\u201d. \u201cBrotherhood\u201d covers more story in less time, and doesn\u2019t drag nearly like the original did. This is especially apparent in the beginning, where some parts that were already told in the original series were more or less skipped over to save time. Purists might squawk about this, but it was probably a wise idea, in light of time constraints.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve seen the original Fullmetal Alchemist, then you\u2019ll be familiar with the first major portions of the show. It may feel like a rehash for the first several episodes, but you\u2019ll fairly quickly realize that the scale of what will eventually take place is much greater, and much more sinister than what the original Fullmetal Alchemist conveyed. The twists that Ed and Al are taken through are enough to leave you wanting more after each episode. \\n\\n\r\nBut enough rambling. If you\u2019d like a synopsis, just look one up.\\n\\n\r\n(Art 10/10) \u2013 The art in this show is simply superb! Characters and scenery are drawn with careful detail, and they also achieve a sense of realism, which is somewhat necessary in a \u201cSteam-Punk\u201d world that could almost be America a century ago. The mix of realism, combined with the fantasy of Alchemy, creates for an interesting balance that not many animes can achieve. Additionally, the art is very smooth, with each movement flowing into the next seamlessly. There were a few instances where larger or more intricate drawings were done with computer animation. These scenes are slightly choppier than the rest of the anime, but you likely won\u2019t notice unless you\u2019re looking for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only gripe I had with the animation was early on in the show, where characters would burst into silly caricatures  when they were especially emotional about something. Most notably is Ed transforming to look like a praying mantis when someone calls him short. This made it seem like the show didn\u2019t take itself very seriously at first, but such incidents gradually declined as the show progressed, and became rather scarce during the more serious parts of the show. I simply think the show would have benefitted from less outbursts of this nature early on. \\n\\n\r\n(Sound 9/10) \u2013 The voice acting in this show is some of the best you\u2019ll hear. I was pleasantly relieved to hear that there were no annoying, shrill voices that anime can be guilty of at times. There weren\u2019t any standout performances that I can think of, but each actor voiced their role marvelously.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason for a 9 instead of a 10 was that it sounded to me like some of the music had been recycled from the original Fullmetal Alchemist. The music fit the scenes very well, but I thought an update might have been helpful. Also, the music never really stuck out to me as being particularly awesome. It was good, but not quite deserving of a 10.\\n\\n\r\n(Characters 10/10) \u2013 It will be quite a struggle to keep my comments succinct on this topic! \u201cFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\u201d shines brilliantly in this area! Never before have I grown so attached to such a diverse cast of characters. There were a number of characters that I wasn\u2019t particularly attached to in the original series that I grew to love in \u201cBrotherhood\u201d.  The show does a brilliant job of making each character\u2019s motivations easy to understand, yet complex enough that they aren\u2019t totally flat.  It also has a way of forcing characters who were once enemies to work together when faced with a common enemy. \\n\\n\r\nI was especially impressed by how Ed and Al were so much easier to relate to in \u201cBrotherhood\u201d. I found myself much more emotionally attached to them, and had a much stronger desire to see them succeed. Al is much stronger and helps Ed fight much more often, which I also found to be a pleasant change of pace. I could name probably ten other characters who I grew attached to, yet wasn\u2019t terribly fond of in the original series. \u201cBrotherhood\u201d also introduces a set of new characters that blend in perfectly with that cast that I was already familiar with. \\n\\n\r\nThe long and short of it is this: the cast of \u201cBrotherhood\u201d will draw you in and leave you eagerly watching their every move until the conclusion of the series.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment 10/10) \u2013 I really don\u2019t have much to say on this topic, except I loved it! I never had to force myself to keep going, and I enjoyed every bit of the show!\\n\\n\r\n(Overall 10/10) \u2013 Definitely give this one a shot! It\u2019s well worth your time. And in my opinion, it\u2019s far superior to its  predecessor.\\n",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that this is my first review so go easy o.O\r\nI saw the first FullMetall Alchemist series and loved it. I was hooked from episode one when they aired it on Cartoon Network. Being the somewhat impatient person I am, I went online searching for the next episode one night after the tenth or eleventh episode had finished. I found what I was looking for and found that there were 52 episodes waiting to be downloaded! Yes, you can assume this anime is what made me discover fan subbing -_^. Anyway, the anime was great, I couldn't get enough whenthe series ended on that metal fist grabbing at the sun. Not too much later I discovered that a movie was coming out and it was the completion of the anime series that had finished. Needless to say, I was excited, I enjoyed the FINAL conclusion of the story. Now that I've said all this, I wanted to say that I always felt like there were \"holes\" in the story. Like, information that was there but not being told. Well...\\n\\n\r\nNot too long ago, I got bored one day, so I looked for some manga to read (FYI Manga/Anime isn't a huge hobby just a coincidence =P) and found the FMA manga. I decided to read it, to see if there was a huge difference between the manga and the anime. I cheated a little bit and started off a bit into the story and discovered that lots of stuff was there that was not in the anime. So, I had to treck back to a point where this information started. I finished the manga in a couple days and WOOOW. Not only was I correct about there being some information missing in the anime, but there was so so so so so much more that was supposed to happen.\\n\\n\r\nSo, it's my assumption that this new series is going to follow in the true story of the FMA and the two brother's journey in their alchemy filled fantasy world. So far the story that is being told in the \"Brotherhood\" series is sticking pretty true to the manga. If this is true, please, take my advice, stay tuned. Especially if you were a good fan of the first series or just love a good anime with great plot twists and a great story line. whatever your interest, if my assumption is correct, which I'm 99.9% sure it is, you're all in for a real treat! =)",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who lose possession of their bodies as a result of breaking the most important rule in alchemy, attempting to resurrect the dead, and they journey across the country of Amestria as they attempt to reclaim their former selves. Edward Elric is this anime's protagonist, the famed \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" whose legendary reputation is rivaled by his alchemical skills, the wise cracking prodigy with an unpredictable personality and a strong distaste for milk, and the height-conscious adolescent with a constant inner conflict about morality, a massive amount of confidence, and an unwavering dedication to his lovedones. If I were to make a list of the greatest anime characters, Edward Elric would be in at least the top ten. Alphonse Elric is the younger of the two brothers, a gentle and likable young boy trapped in a suit of armor that serves as Edward's mediator during Ed's explosive episodes (Al is often assumed to be the older of the two due to his height). Brotherhood ventures into a variety of places throughout Amestria, from the bustling business environment in Central City to the fear-inducing tunnels underneath the city, from the wind-driven snowflakes covering the Drachma region to the primal adobes in dust-consumed Ishval, and, in all of them, this anime crafts the setting with a razor-sharp eye for detail and an amazingly artistic flair.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of FMA Brotherhood doesn't focus on the Elric brothers but instead on the people surrounding them. Colonel Roy Mustang is my favorite character, an easygoing alchemist with the coolest power ever (He can unleash fire by \u2013 get this! \u2013 snapping his fingers!), and an ambitious leader that alternates between cracking jokes and being dangerously serious. There's Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of the Elric brothers and a gifted mechanic. There's Scar, a sunglasses-wearing Ishvalan with a reputation as a malicious murderer and a mission to destroy alchemists of the military via alchemy. Brotherhood also contains a great group of villains in the Homunculi, the seven nearly-unstoppable immortal-like beings each with their own unique personality, and their Father. The two Homunculi that stood out to me were Greed (The Homunculi are named after the seven deadly sins), a rebellious man with steel-like skin, and Pride. Born from Nightmare Fuel, Pride is this anime's most important villain excluding the main antagonist Father who I will remember most for that frightening scene with Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye. Excluding the emotionless Father, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has characters with great acting, emotion, complexity, and (above all) likability (Is this even a word?)\\n\\n\r\nThere are five main themes in Brotherhood; the final opening is by far the most emotional, but my favorite is the first, a fast-paced theme song that slowly intensifies at a pace with the opening's singer. Plotwise, there isn't a big difference in Brotherhood from the Fullmetal manga (although Isaac the Freezer never graced the FMA pages nor did Father Cornello evolve into a hulking beast), but the anime is still just as good, with more twists than a Twizzler stick and more energy than a kid on a sugar rush.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest thing about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is its appeal to all genres. If you want tons of action, if you want a show with martial arts, if you want a military-themed anime, if you want some mystery to your show, if you want some sci-fi in your show, if you want a huge focus on adventure in your show, if you want some slice-of-life aspects to your anime, if you want to see buckets of blood, if you want to watch a show with fantasy elements in it, if you want to watch a dystopia-themed show, if you want to check out an anime with depth, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the series for you.\\n\\n\r\noverall ratings:\\n\r\nstory-10\\n\r\nart-8\\n\r\nsound-9\\n\r\ncharacters-9\\n\r\nenjoyment-10\\n\r\noverall-9.6\\n\r\nrecommendation-extremely high\\n\r\ncategory-masterpiece",

            "content": "Well i know about half the world right now is about to curse at me for writing this, but I don't care. . Now for my Take on the so called \"greatest anime of all time\". IMO its pretty damn mediocre. I had watched the original, and thought it ok. Now i had to watch this. Due to my personal dislike of filler i thought id like FMABH. Yet i was sorely disappointed. I tried to go in open minded hoping to enjoy. Yet, found myself bored, I mean very bored. Like watching Bakemonogatari bored. Nothing to me stands out in this show. One ithas my least favorite character of all time in it(ok possible there are othr worse characters). Yet people treat Elric as if he was the greatest character. Hes a very very bad character for the number of episodes(more anger from everyone). Let me ask you, why is he fighting? Hes, fighting  to get him and his brother's body back. Its not as if their was some injustice, someone who stole their body. Oh no it was their own foolishness and i didn't feel sorry. Hell i didn't feel sorry during the entire series, Huges dies? who gives a !@#$. it wasn't sad. he went down swinging and he had a family, but rly? Its not like Clannad, (i hate harems but this is sad) and possibly even grave of the fireflies. Those are  sad. Now what ill say it does right sometimes is animation. even though at first i loved the alchemy mechanics,(so cool) it got very repetitive. The fights were smooth, but them, like most of the series became repetitive and i fast forwarded through to get to some plot. Let me now say though some things are great the first op was so good and it got my hopes up. the art was beautiful, and some characters were actually good. such as Hoenhiem or Rath.  Sound such as swords were amazing a true shinning point. Yet in the end what rly killed me was the predictable ending. I was expecting an epic final fight or epic final plot tiwst true Stiens;Gate or Madoka style, yet it was just final bad guy standing there, and guys saying \"FIRE EVERYTHING\". Then bad guy just takes it like a bauws. I did like that he was in it for Knowledge, at least he had a viable reason unlike elric who just lost and arm and a leg,but with automail why even give a !@#$? FMABH to me this is the greatest overrated anime of our time. The people who have this a favorite should rly try to expand out a little, and if it is your fav. well im sorry my opinion greatly differs. To me FMBA is just \"good\" no where does it excel to me, and im glad im over with it. (excuse me while i watch something good like Mushishi or Gintama)",

The original series diverged from the manga and became something truly special because of it.  Brotherhood, while being very true to the manga moves at such absurd speeds as to literally ruin it.  It leaves absolutely no room for characters to establish themselves or breathe.  The show assumes you're either a fan of the previous anime or the manga and does nothing but pander endlessly topeople who claim \"BEST EVER\" because they get to see their favorite character in their favorite scene.  It's a real shame, because there was a lot of potential here ruined by Bones pandering towards the established fans.  The series slows down to an acceptable pace at around the twentieth episode, but by then the damage is already done. \\n\\n\r\nOther than its problems with pacing, story and characterization, the art and animation are fantastic.   The voice acting in both languages is superb.  The soundtrack really works well with it as well.",

Why would they ruin an already renowned anime with what will be a likely mediocre continuation?\r\nWRONG.\r\nThe new season itself (from the sole episode I've watched so far) can be completely separated from the much loved first season. The director basically clicked the restart button on the series and we are in for a new rollercoaster of madness. This season is rumored to be working closer to the mangas storyline so no confusing other world as we witnessed in the rather -interesting- FMA movie. \r\nThe animation is very fluid and the art is also more true to HiromuArakawa's style. Eye candy at it's best, if they are starting off this well FMA The Brotherhood is truly one anime to keep your eyes on.\\n\\n\r\nI already know I won't be disappointed. :3",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a good show but to me it isn't as good as the original FMA.\r\nThe main reason for this statement is the 'changes' in the story. I know this series supposedly follows the manga but that's probably my problem. I've seen some shonen anime and the plot usually isn't the best thing about it, especially the ending. I liked the mysteries and the logic in the first FMA better.\r\nI didn't watch all the episodes in one go because I thought the first 14 episodes were really bad. Up untill those episodes the story is the same as the original and they probablyrushed through it. Wasn't that part of the story 30 episodes long in FMA?\\n\\n\r\nMy third remark is the animation. I don't exactly know what's different ( I think they didn't use as many shadows) but the art seems worse, less dark which probably fits the shonen story better.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand why a lot of people like this version of FMA better, it's probably because of the same reason why shonen anime are among the most popular, but I think some of the tragedy and consequences of equal trade that were present in the original FMA were lost in this series.",

The show presents two brothers embarking a journey with a simple goal of recovering their limbs/body. In the world of Fullmetal Alchemist, a practice called alchemy is used to obtain something in exchange for something of equal value. Alchemy is very versatile in this sense as it used healing, fixing and even fighting. \r\nFullmetal alchemist presents a very interesting and enjoyable unique story with each episode building up on one another. It is well paced and consistent with its overall goal. No episodes felt irrelevant to the plot which made every episodeworth watching. Its build up with each episode created a very satisfying ending with great twists and turns. It was unpredictable at times and had great action with the use of alchemy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Fullmetal Alchemist are very likeable with each character having an ulterior motive. The interactions with the cast provided great entertainment and depth. Character development of the cast was top notch with lots of memorable moments. There are many antagonists in the show with each being labelled as one of the deadly sins. Each one managed to live up to their name having different personalities and motives. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was completely satisfied after watching Fullmetal alchemist Brotherhood. It provided a great coherent story with characters that were very memorable. It receives a high re-watch value and recommendation. \\n",

It was like being a part of the FMA family. You knew about all the great main characters.\r\nMy only minor complaint would be that I wanted more back story about the humonculus, or the date in Ed's pocket watch. I sorta know what It means, but I dont want to go on assumptions. I wanted to know what it meant to Ed.\r\nThat being said, Full metal has aplace in my heart.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I read that it was being remade, ofcourse i was in support of it! Full metal alchemist is always welcome again and again.\\n\r\nI have no real problems with the remake, to me it just adds to the whole experience. It isnt better or worse than the \"original\" it just kepes the love alive!\\n\\n\r\nBut one thing i was really disappointed with was the animation in brotherhood.\\n\r\nThe colors looked so artificial. Like they did the whole thing on Paint or something. There were no natural shades.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, the original was beautiful. The tones and colors were perfect. \\n\r\nBrotherhood kinda let me down in that respect.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, Im also bummed out about Alphonses voice actor change.

I haven't even watched much anime, yet I could accurately predict things halfway through the story and not much really came as a surprise to me. To be honest the most surprising thing is how this anime is considered comedy, it's a story about a boy trying toresurrect his dead mother and get his and his brother's body back, I mean that is hilarious. I know what your thinking, this is the worst review ever, that is if you can even call this a review, since it's really just a rant. The anime is good and worth a try, after all your tastes are different to mine. To me this anime was just good, nothing amazing like everyone says.",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a pretty beloved show on MAL and within the anime scene in general.  Personally, while I enjoyed it, I don't necessarily think it is the best thing since sliced bread.  It kept me entertained, and even at times made me feel an emotion or two, but the slow start and sometimes dragging plot didn't necessarily keep me thinking about watching the next episode when I was busy with other activities.  That being said, it is certainly worth a watch through at least once if you have the stomach for a 60+ episode series!  Let's get into thebreakdown.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10) - I think the story was fairly well done.  It wasn't groundbreaking and it didn't necessarily have a lot of \"oh snap!\" moments, but it executed quite well.  Its exposition was usually laser focused on the characters and history that mattered, the plot was consistently moved forward to the inevitable conclusion, and you did get a sense of something grander going on.  It didn't waste your time with a ton of filler, and you could see this spiderweb of deception in every corner of the world.  The events were logical, believable, and often relateable despite being set in a fantastical world of magic, with problems often mirroring very real life scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nIt also handled flashbacks remarkably well I think.  Many shows just drag flashbacks on and on.  FMA:B kept them quick and relevant.  It actually made me enjoy them and made me curious about the backstory rather than beating me over the head with historical exposition to justify everything.  My only real complaint with the story was how it dragged at the beginning while it was setting up the spider-webbing for the over-arching grand scheme.  It took nearly 20 episodes to get going, but once it did get going, it took off at a brisk run.  It was a significant enough annoyance to me though that I can't give the story a 9 despite its pretty quality execution.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10) - The art was certainly above average, but it didn't really stand out in any particular way to me.  It was consistently solid, with no mistakes, but not beautiful.  It served its purpose and allowed you to immerse yourself in the world, but was short of being truly captivating.  There were definitely brief moments where it came close to being stunning though, and I have to give credit for the very eye-catching design of Pride (hah, I made a funny!).\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10) - I think the sound for this show was its weakest quality.  It felt to me like it was merely adequate.  It served its purpose, but nothing really was memorable to me from the soundtrack to the voicing.  My personal taste may be heavily colouring my opinion here, but I really just found the sound as action-average as any J-Pop intro to a RomCom or Ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) - Along with the story, the characters were quite well handled.  They were all very standard stereotypes, but each had their own unique quirks and motivations to keep them interesting.  I wouldn't say any were particularly deep, but there were certainly moments where I would feel for a couple characters.  I enjoyed learning about all their backstories, and I enjoyed that they all walked their own paths, or at least tried to until they were often drawn back together by fate.  Their independence was actually relateable instead of the usual excessive aloofness of \"independent\" characters in many other shows.  They genuinely felt like individuals rather than cogs in a big machine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10) - At my first foray into this series, I honestly have to say I was pretty \"meh\" about it.  Up until about episode 18 for me, the story dragged along as it tried to set everything up and introduce all the main players.  It sagged under the weight of it and I often found myself thinking of other things I could be doing while watching.   It was still enjoyable... just not really compelling.  Starting out this was a 5/10 for me.  After episode 18 though, the show finally kicked it into gear and I found my enjoyment increased *measurably*.  Middle of the show it was a 6/10 and by the end it landed a 7.  It's worth watching if you can make it to the end, especially considering the pleasant and fulfilling ending that so many action anime lack these days.  If I was my younger self, I could see myself having enjoyed it even more.  I can't say I'll rewatch it, by I'm certainly glad I've seen it.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I give \"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\" a 7/10.  It was almost an 8, but not quite.  Not because it did anything wrong, but more that it didn't try to push itself at all and stayed in its comfort-zone.  The story was interesting enough though and the characters did often elicit some compassion from me.  If you're reading this to figure out if you should watch this show, then sure, you'll probably find something in it worth your time (as long as you are good with 60+ episodes), but be careful not to go into it with too much hype in mind.",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood surpasses the original series in almost every aspect imaginable. After I had finished watching the original FMA, I felt a endless sense of dissatisfaction, as the ending didn't sit right with me at all. \r\nI'll be honest, i put off watching Brotherhood for a very long time, as i didn't think that a lot of the series would have changed dramatically. I expected a bit of enhanced animation and the addition of a few characters. God. I couldn't be more wrong. The remake shines a new light onto the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, improving all of the imperfections and errors that were inthe original series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line was healthy and straight to the point right from episode 1. No mucking about. As the plot goes on it gets hard to compare both series as the plot slowly drifts in difference directions from each other. What i was most enjoyed about was of-course, the ending. It was initiated perfectly, leaving no questions un-answered, which i feel was my main issue with Fullmetal Alchemist. It tied the entire show together neatly, the way it should have been.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was beautiful. At times it was inconsistent, but even then it was great. Given that there is roughly a 6 year gap between the FMA and brotherhood, improved animation was a defiant. A lot more detail was provided though, which was a pleasant surprise.\\n\\n\r\nAh, now for the sound. Masafumi Mima deserves a medal, because he completely nailed this. I don't think there was a single OP or ED that i didn't enjoy. It matched the concept of Fullmetal Alchemist and scenes so well. There is nothing to say other than it was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were developed a lot which was nice to see. It seemed there were at least a few episodes per main character to try to get to know them and deconstruct them as a character. This was a smart way to build the connection between viewer and character. Also bringing in a few new main characters that were not even mentioned in the original series was risky, but boy, it pull off. It gave a whole new feel to the show. With that being said, that squinty eyed guy sure knew how to annoy me at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I am so glad i finally decided to watch Brotherhood. I ask for nothing else. I am more then content now hah. For everyone that has seen Fullmetal Alchemist and is thinking about watching Brotherhood but is worried it will be a waste of time because you think you already know what will happen. Go watch it, now. Stop reading this review and go watch it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Man, I was really late to the party on this one. Every time I saw polls on the best anime shows released, this would be usually top 5, maybe top 3. I remember hearing people talking about this when I was still in school, the type of people who didn't like anime telling me \"yeah, it's pretty good\". After about 6 years of hearing about it, and doubting it, I finally gave it a shot. Holy crap, why didn't I listen to everybody before?\r\nI went into this knowing nothing about the premise, so the show itself had to tell me how everything worked and keepme interested enough to last something like 64 episodes. 64?! My sweet spot is 26, anything beyond that are a commitment I'm not willing to make.\\n\r\nThe first episode was one of the best pilots I think I've ever seen, it established so many world rules and characters and really showed off the budget and animation levels I was in store for. I remember thinking \"Woah, this really feels like Avatar: The Last Airbender\" and I grew up with that. As soon as I felt that, I knew I could last 64 episodes easy.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is relatively simple, there's a form of magic called alchemy that few possess, and there are large territories that are on very poor terms with one another. You're looking at great warriors and really detailed fight scenes. The real heart of this show is the strength of the characters, main and supporting, and the overall arcing story. It deals so well with escalation, never skipping too far ahead too fast as to lose you, but it keeps a quick pace with a lot of well explained mystery that you want to know more. Each section of the story adds foundations to the parts to come, previous pieces of intrigue combine to solve a larger piece of the puzzle. This feels so satisfying to watch, be it discovering the rules of alchemy to who the villain is and what his evil plan becomes.\\n\\n\r\nThis show can become beautifully dark, from familial deaths of main cast members, to examining how far someone will go for perfection, justice, or even life itself. The villains are wonderfully metaphorical, each being charismatic and deadly, while the heroes are very complex and quite human. Fullmetal really dissects human nature and shows you both the best and the worse of it. What pins this down is a really great soundtrack, the whole thing creates this sort of feeling that just flows into you. You name it, this show probably has it: political instability and invasions, insightful character development across the board, a good sense of humour to lighten the mood just enough that the shocking moments hurt so much worse, amazing fight choreography, a well written love story, mysterious secret societies, redemption arcs for desperate thugs...   It really has so much to offer, each piece well rounded and ready to be enjoyed. I don't know how they fit in so much without it feeling overly complicated or too stuffed, but they did!\\n\\n\r\nI was an idiot for not checking out this show when people told me about it, because it really is a near perfect piece of entertainment across the board. By the end, I wanted more than 64 episodes, something I never imagined happening. I can't recommend this show more, it's unmissable.",

            "content": "This review will be rather short.\r\nThe story is not bad in general, it is just awfully directed. The main reason which caused that I didn't enjoy this anime was pathetic humour which is ruining EVERY episode. For example, there is a situation where main characters are talking about something interesting, and unexpectedly something \"funny\" happens and main thread of their conversation (or even whole episode) is cutted, because \"funny\" situation is most important of course. It is happening in EVERY episode, sometimes few times. Yeah, that 'humour' destroyed the whole story.\r\nBut this is not the only reason of course. The next thing: main characters. Theyare boring. Typical battle shounen scheme. There were a lot episodically characters which were much better and interesting than Erlic brothers and no.1 badass - Bradley King.\\n\r\nI liked the whole idea of philosopher stones and homunculus thing (and their names taken from seven deadly sins)\\n\r\nThe plot story is way too episodic too.\\n\\n\r\nArt - I loved that backgrounds. Seriously, it was really well drawn. Animation was nice too. But in other side, almost all characters looked very bad and too simple.\\n\\n\r\nSound - voice actors were matched really good (as usual in anime). Of course I'm talking about original Japanese voices. Soundtrack is average, I don't like this type of soundtracks (symphonic ones, like from 'Murican blockbuster). It is boring as hell, I'm glad, that it is rather not usual in anime.\\n\\n\r\nSummarizing,I felt like I was watching rather a generic USA movie (trust me, I've seen plenty of them in my life, I started watching anime, because I was bored as hell by hollywood crap) than actual anime.\\n\\n\r\nFMA:B is yet another battle shounen, which are thousands. It is not bad anime, but in my opinin it doesn't deserve to be even in top 50. It would be much better, when it would be 50% shorter and without ALL that pathetic humour.\\n\r\nI watched it, and probably in next year I will totally forget about it.",

            "content": "Honestly, I only watched this at first because it was the highest rated. I thought to myself, why not just see the best since I wanna watch some anime?\r\nAnd knowing myself, I'm pretty new to anime. I've only seen the big name anime, so in no way is my opinion biased. I've never seen or heard much about this anime besides that it is \"the best\" according to many.\r\nNaturally, I came into this anime expecting something great, and it didn't fail to deliver in the slightest. At first, I was worried that this anime was a little too long for me to finish, and thatI would get bored and drop it halfway. However, as I went deeper and deeper into the series, the thought of dropping completely left my head.\\n\\n\r\nI think what really makes this anime shine is the characters. You really grow to care for them, and you get to learn all of their quirks. I personally found the jokes that the writer took to put in there hilarious- for instance, every time someone called Ed short he would turn into a live landmine- that was great. I especially liked it when the people he was fighting would point out his height. It just made everything so lighthearted, and often times I feel anime can be overly serious, to the point that you can't watch too many episodes in a day because otherwise you'll feel overloaded. FMAB did a great job of balancing serious episodes with lighthearted ones.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the moments when the animator purposefully drew Ed or Al in weird ways to convey emotion, for instance when they were embarrassed Al would be drawn with 2 dots for eyes and a gray frame, making him look meek. Its just these little details that make it so much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, since you grow to like these characters so much, it adds extra oomph to the plot, when one dies or when another feels joy. There is also so much variety. You have the hotheaded, impulsive Ed. You have the jealous, and yet caring Alphonse. You also have the calm Roy Mustang, and his faithful companion Hawkeye. And of course, you have all the homunculi, of which I thought Greed was the most interesting. There are so many characters, I would really doubt that a viewer couldn't resonate with at least one, if not more.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I highly recommend this anime to someone who is looking for something to commit to. It is long, but those hours fly by when you are watching some quality work, from one of the best anime that the genre has to offer. And previously if you told me this anime was the best, I would doubt that any anime could be better than the first anime I ever saw (One punch man). But now, I believe that this anime may just be good competition. It definitely deserves the 10 in my book. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I'd just like to point out that Roy Mustang says \"Hagane no Renkinjutsu\" the best :P\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!!!",

            "content": "Story: 6/10\r\nI had really high expectations, i mean its Number 1 in MAL. it was such a frustrating Expirience. i was like WHAT? THATS IT. I really want to like it but NO just NO. I was most of the time while watching  FMAB really  bored. i dont get it why people give it a 10/10. This Show does objectively everything right and this is where the problem lies. The Author didn\u00b4t go out of her  way to create something  that is unique. She rather went the safe route. it wasnt a thrilling expirience. every thing FMAB does, doesnt feel fresh.it feels like i have seen all this somewhere before. like the concept of the 7 deadly sins. there are shows who already used this. though i liked the use of alchemy as a combat system.\\n\\n\r\nAlphonse and Edward did use Human Transmutation to get her mother back and as this is bound by equivalent exchange they had to give something and this was alphonses whole body and edwards  right arm. And therefor they are in search of a way to get their bodys back. i could relate because they did something without knowing what the consequences would be and i myself did stuff without knowing that it will have some bad backlash.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only Character that made an impression on me was King Bradley. Every time he was on screen it  was so intense. Most of the characters felt generic and had like one quirk or so.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked most of the chracterdesigns. they were different from eachother. Animation Studio Bones delivers once again with FMAB. The visuals where really detailed and crisp. The fights were also very fluid and smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are some great OSTs. They are also really memorable pieces. Also the OPs and EDs are very good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI was bored most of the time it didnt brought something new to the table. it was a mediocre expirience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6,6=7/10",

Art is beautiful and very thematic, portraying the 1900s British/German setting perfectly. Music is lovely, with many epic soundtracks that make fights very truly epic, as well as tracks during emotional moments or important shifts in plot. Almost every episode leaves you hanging and begging for more, and if you truly pay attention, you will be very impressed at how wonderfully paced it is. The content is very powerful, portraying many ideas and problems about society. Every  scene is choreographed very well, using theideas and philosophies that were portrayed and twisting them and giving even more meaning then they already have. An example of this would be in episode 8:\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9m5R2mhlBE\\n\r\nSkip to 16:00 and watch from there and it should be very clear how the idea of the two brothers being human is quickly twisted into something more malevolent. The ending is very satisfying as it gives complete restoration and closure. Overall I enjoyed every minute of this anime and am confident in the rating I have given it. A must watch for anime mature anime fan, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a powerful anime with wonderful story that will have you at the edge of your seat until the very end.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Perfect",

            "content": "This review isn't going to be as detailed and in-depth as I feel it should be, and while I do address various things, I don't address every single thing I like or dislike about this series. Regarding that, there are some things that stood out to me within this series that definitely would leave it a 5, or maybe even a 4, out of 10 for me. I will also be trying to address things in an overall sense rather than picking out individual details and events to help explain them because if you've seen this show, you know what happens, basically, so you knowwhat I'm talking about without me needing to address every single little thing that happens. That being said, unfortunately, there are some spoilers in this review.\\n\\n\r\nThis series was very disappointing, but the fact that it's rated number one on this site honestly doesn't surprise me. First, though, I'll just go over the less significant of the flaws before addressing the deal-breakers. Keep in mind, I did watch the original 2003 anime. Immediately before having started this one. This review is not based on any amount of bias or nostalgia, because I never grew up with FMA, and I finished this last week. I try to draw as few comparisons as I can between the two different shows, as a result.\\n\\n\r\nPacing issues are a constant theme, apparently. The first season relied too heavily on you having had seen the original anime, or read the manga, which I think is a bad decision because regardless of whether or not similar things had happened, the events that did happen within the first fifth of the series are still fairly important. Season two was alright (I honestly consider it to have been the best season), and season three was good, as well, up until about halfway through, then it started getting a bit slow. Season four was bad, and oh, god, season five. I had no idea what went wrong with season five. It had all started out too fast, then it found the right speed to take things in season two. Season three started getting slow, and then four and five jumped back up to high speeds, even faster than how season one was going, it felt like. It really left out a lot of room for things to be explained, because important matters were discussed in one or two lines of dialogue, and as the series progresses, a lot of build up garners a minimal reward.\\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutely no atmosphere in this show. There is no mood at all. What is the mood? What is the tone this is trying to set? The soundtrack has literally ten songs, and the same three are used in every single episode at least once. The only moods set by the music are \"tense\" and \"action,\" and very rarely is it \"cool\". The song that plays during Hohenheim's backstory and during a majority of season five is actually really good, and one of two out of ten songs that I like, but the rest of them are severely overplayed. The present mood is predictable, as a result. The overall mood, however, feels completely nonexistent because there is no emotion in this show. Even people who praise this up and down, I've seen mention how there's no atmosphere and emotion behind anything. How are you supposed to get anything out of it, then? In addition to it having been a result of pacing issues, the backstories and reveals are just treated like nothing, because there's no emotion behind it at all. When they were at Central, I guess, and they were cheering because they thought the Fuhrer was gone but he popped up on the phone and said \"Surprise, I'm back,\" that could have been so cool! But it went immediately from an intense scene, to a slight pause, and then back to the same intensity as it had before. There was no rest at all, and as the series went on, there felt there wasn't any room for emotion because there was just too much going on, and like the emotion was a negligible feature, thus leaving the whole series rather soulless, even during the best parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is way too goddamn complex. After a certain point, there is just way too much going on to keep track of, even in the sense of the storyteller's perspective, as characters will appear for one scene and then not return until a whole season later. I honestly thought they forgot about Scar's and Riza's backstories, and characters with NO backstory end up being the most important, such as May Chang. There is so much filler with just nameless generals having gun fights, and it really feels like a completely different show once they get to Briggs. It goes from being a fascinating fantasy story with a unique set of physics taking place in a split timeline to being just a boring military show, preferring gunfights over alchemy and science which is meant to be a main theme of the series, and because of how much screen time the nameless grunts get just shooting each other and the Homunculi, it, again, leaves no time for things to actually be explained. Scar's backstory had been addressed in season two to a degree but there were still unanswered questions, and with Scar personally being a character I loved in this one and in the original anime, I was hoping his backstory would be more than two sentences given in the second to last episode that makes no real sense and removes all the magic from the series. It treats important issues like that, and like the Homunculi, the Philosopher's Stone, and like the Gate and Truth, and Father, especially, like it's just nothing, like they're not important, and after a certain point there's no mystery or any amount of credibility to any of these things because of the explanations they give that fail to really explain anything and because of how aware everyone in the world is to these things that are meant to hold an amount of mystery, thus making them interesting and having you want to get more out of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf everyone knows about something that's supposed to be mysterious and taboo and mythical, then it's not mysterious and taboo and mythical.\\n\\n\r\nThere are too many characters to focus on and even in the last season they're adding more and more people it expects you to keep track of, and it's insane. One of the few comparisons I'll draw with the original 2003 anime is that while the story did have plot holes and was far from perfect, it was concise, consistent, and every character got development, rarely diverging from the central themes even in the filler episodes. Alphonse Elric, the protagonist's brother, feels like he isn't even a character. He is the protagonist's BROTHER. He has been there the /entire time/, his goddamn body was missing and he was a skilled alchemist like his brother, most of Edward's story has to DO with his brother, and he doesn't even feel like a character because he's barely in it and you only realize that he's not in it when you stop and ask where he is. There is a severe lack of character development in this series, treating major characters like they don't mean anything and treating minor characters like the world rests on their shoulders, like with May Chang, and another thing that worsens that is when there has been a massive amount of build up to something, it just doesn't even matter because, like I said, the payoff is nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nFather had such immense potential to be an amazing villain. You see him sitting there, around all these wires and tubes, looking like a figure from Biblical theology. His voice is strong, and commanding, and he's always sitting in that chair, and there's this intense feeling of mystery around him. He looks like Hohenheim, the protagonists' father, and you ask yourself, are they the same person? Did Hohenheim leave his kids to go create the Homunculi? Is it a split personality, or is it an illusion? Who could he be, and what? You then find out his backstory, along with Hohenheim's, in about eight minutes. You learn the history they share in eight minutes. Eight whole minutes to explain the backstory of the main antagonist and one of the primary characters in the show, who have both had massive build up to be these mysterious, powerful figures, and while the explanation they give is perhaps the best in the entire series, it all comes crashing down when, without giving major spoilers, everyone in Central knows who Father is, why he's there, what he's doing, and he ends up being a generic shounen villain who stops using alchemy and starts using magical powers. If everyone knows he's there, why he's there, and what he's doing, then he's not mysterious anymore, and it takes away all credibility the story has in that sense, and he was probably the most disappointing part of the entire series. He went from intriguing and mystifying and fearsome to Sephiroth and Anubis from the Yuugiou movie.\\n\\n\r\nIt stops being about alchemy. I mentioned that already, but I still can't get over that. If you wanted to make a show that focuses on corruption in the government and in the military, then just do that. Don't give it a unique fantasy setting only to not focus on that after a certain point, and especially don't have a fantasy setting that relies on scientific fact and the legitimate physics of that world, explained by science, end up being about magical powers and plaTE TECTONICS???????????? The military in the show is way too advanced for that time period, anyway, in terms of the techniques, strategies, and even the weapons they use, but that's minor and it doesn't even fucking matter after a certain point. Nothing matters after a certain point. The show is about alchemy, and that stops mattering after a certain point. It also has less to do with real-world alchemy than the original anime did, actually, and I find that interesting seeing as how the 2003 anime diverged relatively early on and made a vast amount of changes to the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nA homunculus, in terms of real-world alchemy, is a failed attempt at creating a human being. In the 2003 anime, a homunculus is a failed attempt at human transmutation. In Brotherhood, they don't tell you what it is. Ultimately, in the end, they don't tell you what a homunculus is. It mentions that the seven deadly sins are formed from Father's emotions, but that doesn't have any effect on anything and feels like it was just shoe-horned in, as does most things; and, like I said, if you've seen the series you know that those aren't the only Homunculi I mean. The deadly sins are also a Greek concept, as is alchemy, but in the original it feels that, universally, they have more to do with alchemy as a real science than they do in Brotherhood, which is supposed to be the \"real\" story. They even go more into the actual science behind alchemy in the original anime, and in Brotherhood their explanation is\\n\\n\r\nplate tectonics. I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThere was the Gate, though, which was very loosely implied to have more to do with real alchemy, as each person who passes through the Gate has their own symbol on the door related to ideas presented by alchemists in the real world, which I actually had to look up on my own and I felt it would have definitely added to the story, but at that point I simply didn't care and at this point I just find it really cool. They never explain what the Gate is, or why it contains infinite alchemical knowledge, or why the Truth provides it for you. The Truth gets an explanation, though.\\n\\n\r\nHe's supposed to be God. Literal God, in a series where the main character is a vehement atheist and the theme of religion being a farce was made very clear in the first three goddamn episodes. Truth isn't Consciousness, or an idea of sorts. He's literally God, in a series where God isn't supposed to /exist/. Between you and me, I'd take Nazi Germany over that any day, because at least it's an explanation that makes more sense than \"it just exists, and it's controlled by God\".\\n\\n\r\nThere are things I liked more about this, though, than I did the original 2003 anime, to show that I don't think this whole thing is a complete crock of shit. Hohenheim, for example, is a much greater character. He's actually on my top list of favorite characters. It explores the world more, and Mustang and his entire crew are more likable in this one. Mustang and Riza are amazing together. I loved Wrath and Pride in this one a lot more than in the original. I liked the ideas of the Gate and of Truth, and I'm just going to pretend the last five episodes didn't happen. Scar was cooler in this one, and I loved Olivier.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do I wish they would have done differently? Aside from the pacing, lack of focus and character development and reasonable explanations, as well as a lack of consistent themes, there were some things that I wish they would have changed to have more of an impact or to make it stand out more. I wish the Homunculi were more of a collective, because then it would have made more sense regarding their origin and Greed's defecting in both instances. I wish Father's base of operations were elsewhere, and I wish all of season five was just rewritten. It starts going into the plot again completely out of nowhere partway through an episode in the last season, and ugghhh I don't want to go into all of that. I wish the Gate and Truth were more explored, I wish the lands around Amestris were more explored, I wish that Pride and Wrath got even more development than they did. I wish Envy didn't turn into a giant six-legged green hair dog lizard thing with people on it. I wish May Chang wasn't even in it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, and in conclusion, I can best describe Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as being a whole amalgamation of mystery and buildup only to have the writing in the story dismiss it with little explanation and by not addressing things that feel like they should matter. I still have a lot of unanswered questions, regarding Ishbal, Xerxes, and the dwarf in the flask. About Xing, about Drachma, about the fate of the Philosopher's Stone and about alchemy as a science. I have unanswered questions about the characters, and I'm never going to get any of those answers. Brotherhood was generic, disappointing, and while I'm aware this review isn't the best I could have written, I hope you found it useful.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does Pride become a fetus with a nipple on his forehead.",

            "content": "I should've hopped on this train years ago if I knew i'd love it this much. \r\nTl,dr; It's a show praised and glorified by Anime fans across the world, and it's safe to say that it lives up to its name. It's a well-written show that accompanies the journey the brothers take to recover their bodies, ultimately finding pieces of themselves and more along the way. You'll find most genres fit here, but Shouen comes to mind at its core. Very open minded show, and it's my belief that anyone can take something from it. \r\nIt gets a lot of hassle being a manga adaptationand all, but does a great job with it. As far as some go, there's definitely good merit to why this is #1 on MAL. Between the story, art, and characters, everything was all quite impressive, and every detail was presented in a way that felt refreshing to experience. There's a lot of love in creating this one, and you surely can tell. \\n\\n\r\nNever read the manga, so I believe my perspective is tailored for any reader. Pacing is always brilliantly timed to string you where they want you to be. FMAB is a master of weaving in plot twists and loose ends. It's also got a knack of tossing in crazy developments and ideas to make sure things stay interesting. It's good risk taking that pays off down the line, as these developments link together to deliver a phenomenal execution of an end. If you're smart enough to understand the tropes, I'm sure you can get a general outline of where the story is heading, and yet... it still retains that charming element.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is remarkable. High performing actors across the board in both dub and sub. Soundtrack has range being catchy at times and really soothing at others. Openings and endings are actually worth a listen, which I can't say stands true for all anime. Can be a bit annoying since it replays the same tracks a bit earlier on, but that problem dissolves as the show progresses. \\n\\n\r\nWasn't necessarily my cup of tea, but it's still spectacular in it's own right. Very consistent and does the job well, that much is clear. It takes a huge spike in improvement around mid-episodes due to an increase in budget. Facial expressions, backgrounds, and designs work well and mesh together. There are no fluffy and useless drawings- animation is purposeful. \\n\\n\r\nFMAB features an iconic cast of characters you won't forget that easily. If you're going to reminisce anything about this show, it's the characters that will tug at your heart the most. Each one with a story to tell, a lesson to teach, and a personality to love. It's impossible to not get attached to even some of the minor characters they present- as the Anime really does give you a reason to care. Dimensions aren't restricted either, FMBA isn't a stranger to the same faces, and they make an effort to pry into the worlds of different people- including the Xing and Ishvalan races. The only issue I can see is motive and backbone for some minor characters, as they aren't fully explored in depth. Personally would've loved to see Mustang a bit more. \\n\\n\r\nThe best case scenario in any Anime is that you fall in love with the show. It changes you and marks you in some way, and you can find something valuable to recall down the line. I'll vouch that FMBA is indeed a worthy show possible of all this. It takes you on what seems to be a straightforward journey and hits you with everything that Anime possibly can. The show takes a plethora of themes and weaves them into the show beautifully- from sacrifice, courage, bonds, integrity, race, ideology, justice, the human condition, and ultimately life, to make this \"best case scenario\" a reality. You'll be sure to pick out plenty of fond memories and learn something down the line.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed the watch as the overall production of the Anime is quite extraordinary. The search for truth, the pursuit to restore their bodies, the core of alchemy, and so on. Goes without saying, it all links together for one helluva show. El and Al really stick it to you: it's not about the destination, but the journey. That's the best part about this Anime.",

I can assure you that it definitely isn't as good as people make it out to be. This is one of the most boring anime I've ever watched in my life. After every episode I kept contemplating whether or not I should just drop this anime. That's how bad it was.\r\nFirst off, the story. The story is unbelievable bad and barely has any depth to it whatsoever. There's plot holes and inconsistencies all over the place. The first 20 episodes were especially boring. It wasso uneventful and boring I'm surprised I got through it all. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in this anime is terrible. So many episodes were uneventful and I'd just have to keep wasting my time to watch more and more of this crap. Even when I think it gets interesting, it ends up being a disappointment\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a terrible cast of characters. First we have Ed, the most stupid protagonisst I've ever seen in an anime. This anime cant go two seconds without giving some shitty joke about his height. It's extremely repetitive and annoying. Winry is a useless character that was just used as a plot device. Alphonse is another bad character and also has a terrible design. There isn't even one character in this anime that gets character development, and that's pretty pathetic. The main villain father is also one of the worst villains in anime history.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music and art aren't that great either. No memorable soundtracks in this anime at all. The art is bad. The animation is terrible for an anime that people claim to be a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't one good fight in FMA Brotherhood. Every fight scene is boring and it pains me to watch them. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, this is a bad anime",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood ? Overrated ? Absolutely not. Watching this whole series, i was thirsty, thirsty for more enjoyment, humor and character development  each time i finish an episode. Definitely worth watching. The older series, Fullmetal Alchemist is a good anime, so i had high expectations for Brotherhood. The story line of these two series are slightly different but the plot remains the same. The shocking but amazing plot twists got me taken aback and sitting on the edge of my seat to see what else is coming. \r\nI laughed, I cried, I cheered. \r\nI also learned valuable lessons.\r\nAbout loving someone unconditionally evenif you have to give up something that means the world to you, or even risking your life to the verge of death. Edward and Alphonse, the brothers, love each other to the moon and back, and even when their love reach the moon, it will come back to earth and keep itself alive. \\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood makes you question about the life they chose, about lust, wrath, sloth, pride, gluttony, greed and envy. \\n\\n\r\nHow does it feels to lose someone ? To sacrifice everything ? To watch the one you love lives in the whirlpool of despair? The answers lie within their beating hearts.\\n\\n\r\nDo i regret watching Brotherhood ? Yes because i ended up sleeping late every single night due to the undying excitement and no, simply because, it kills hours of my time watching this with love and enjoyment. \\n\r\nIf i have to choose which one of the Elric brothers that i love the most, i will have to ponder over it for a long time, and i even might not get to choose. \\n\r\nBoth of these characters equally contribute to the storyline. None takes the spotlight from the other. Both would sacrifice themselves, both would bear the pain for others' happiness, and both touched the hearts of people around them through their journey. \\n\\n\r\nIt is possible to love so many characters in one anime at once, at least that's how i feel towards them.\\n\\n\r\nWhether you like this anime or hate it, the choice is yours, but, this critically acclaimed series will slowly devour your heart and grows within you, and it feels good. \\n",

            "content": "Well, this is my first review so please tell me if you found this helpful or not so I can do a better one the next time :)\r\nI heard about Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood from a friend of mine and I really postponed watching this show... At this moment I feel like an idiot. This show was a masterpiece in all the directions it could and after finishing it I was completely astonished !\r\nStory (10/10) \r\nOK, at the first 2 or 3 episodes I was a bit confused and couldn't understand some things, but at the fourth episode I started to get what this amazing animewas about.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is said on the synopsis, it is about the Elric brothers trying to get back their bodies, after commiting the taboo of alchemy, trying to revive the dead using it. After failing and paying a heavy bill for even trying, with the older brother, Edward, losing limbs and the younger one, Alphonse, losing all his body, only for Edward to affix his soul into an armor, the story begins as Edward Elric, the older brother, becomes a State Alchemist, one who uses his alchemy for the military, in order to have a better chance of recovering their bodies. In the 3rd episode it's revealed that they are searching for the legendary Philosopher's Stone, wich is used for ignoring the basic rule of alchemy, the equivalent exchange. \\n\r\nNow let me tell you that this isn't the real story behind Fullmetal Alchemist. The recover of their bodies comes at the second place of this anime, cause there are some more important things to take care first... the safety of the world for example...\\n\r\nThis was a more detailed synopsis and a better one I think. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's move on to what I liked about the story. It is really a mind-blowing one, as the events that happened before the story started are mixed with the actual story. That combination will completely shock everybody. There are a few very important characters, everyone with his own story, amazingly explained and included in only one amazing storyline. The Elric brothers story, the Ishbal's Civil War story and the very dark story behind some unthinkable things will amaze you, but not only these, as there are some other very positive things about the story:\\n\\n\r\n- The plot and it's develop is uncomparable to any another anime I've seen;\\n\r\n- It is very unpredictable and will surprise you every now and then;\\n\r\n- It has some unforgettable funny moments, although being quite a dark anime\\n\r\n- It has some very dramatic moments that will stay in your mind for a good amount of time;\\n\r\n- The battles are fantastic, very strategic and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is also a negative side. Due to the rushed start, a death of somebody at the first 10 episodes that is a turning point in the story, didn't look that dramatic as it should have looked, but at the latter stages of the show, you'll understand the significance of that person's death.\\n\\n\r\nAt a certain point I thought that the end of this anime would ruin all, like Naruto's one, when that happy, unrealistic ending destroyed it. Luckily I was wrong, as the end not even was unfrogettable, but also at that point of the story nothing came for cheap.\\n\\n\r\nOverrall, the story is really amazing and worth a big 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs a newly made anime, unlike the version of 2003, the art is breathtaking. There is a memorable animation quality, that we even now, in 2015, do not often see. The animation in the fight scenes is amazing and very fluid. \\n\\n\r\nThe character's design is very good too, as they are completely different from each-other. \\n\\n\r\nI think 'Bones' has turned this anime into a piece of art. Even the details of every character, that I greatly observe, are just fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nThe colours are great too, as I enjoyed very much the contrast between the bright and dark colours.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nTo start with, I watched the subbed version, as I enjoy very much the japanese language. I didn' regret my choice.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's voices and their intonation was really class. This was largely due to the elite actors they hired for doing this job. But even the ones that want a dubbed version won't have problems, cause I happened to watch one episode in the dubbed version and it was nearly as good as the subbed version.\\n\\n\r\nThe first three openings were very addictive and I quite liked them. The other 2 openings were good too. The endings were great too, especially the fourth one.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the OST, there were some really fantastic ones for the tense, anxious and fight moments. Even the quiter ones were good and were played at the right moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem is that there is a lack of character's theme, even if there are some kind of instrumental music. That's the only reason that I'll give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are all very interesting and entertaining and they all have a bond with each-other in some way. They all have different powers as well as their own ambitions and to not forget, a dark past...\\n\\n\r\nAs we know the protagonists are the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric. Edward, also known as the Fullmetal Alchemist, or also as the youngest State Alchemist at only 15. He is stubborn, strong willed guy, leading the F\u00fchrer President, the highest ranked person of the country, to code-name him Fullmetal. Alphonse Elric, the youngest brother, has a more calm and kind-hearted character than his brother. \\n\\n\r\nBut this show wouldn't have been a masterpiece if there weren't some absolutely cool guys supporting them. I will write down some characters that are worth watching with details:\\n\\n\r\n- Colonel Roy Mustang, Edward's superior at the military, is a cool,  a bit arrogant (like Fullmetal) and good-looking guy, whose ambition is to become the F\u00fchrer President. He is presumably the strongest State Alchemist. In addition, he has some amazing, very reliable and funny subordinates, who make this show a damn comedy at times with the way they do things. Man, that's what I call teamwork! You should definitely take a good look at them. Roy also cares very much for his subordinates and protects them with everything he can. Have a good look at Maes Hughes, Riza Hawkeye and his other subordinates cause you're going to love them. \\n\\n\r\n- The Elric's brothers father, Van Hohenheim, abandoned his family when his kids were at a very young age. In the first episodes when he makes short appearances, he looks like a cold guy, but it turns out to be different, even though he has a very dark secret in his heart...\\n\\n\r\n- Mey Chang and Ling Yao have comed from the East in order to obtain the secret of immortality for their Emperor with the sole purpose of gaining his trust and saving their clans. Mey Chang and Ling Yao are enemies and their battle for gaining the secret is worth a good watching.\\n\\n\r\n- Solf J. Kimblee is a hero of the Ishbalan Extermination Civil War and on the first episodes frequently makes short appearences in a prison, with wood handcuffs and with two transmutation circles in his hands. Well, what can I say, he is a complete psychopath, but I really liked how the heck he acted during the show. Did I forget to tell you that he was prisoned cause he refused to give the army a Philosopher's Stone they gave him to exterminate the Ishbalans and that he ate it? Oh yes I forgot, sorry.\\n\\n\r\n- The antagonists in this show are all really badass, all immortal, very strong and part of the same \"group\". In that \"group\" are also 2 characters that I was completely shocked . That's as far as I'm allowed to tell you without spoiling everything, but they also have a very dark story and a very strange and sometimes confusing past.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's development makes this anime even better than first thought. Again a big 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime from the start till the end in the same manner. If you don't like it at the first few episodes don't drop it, just give it more time, cause I'm sure you'll love it.\\n\\n\r\nIt is very important to watch all the details carefully, cause it can confuse you sometimes if you don't watch it properly. Furthermore, it starts giving you clues of what's going on behind the scenes from the first episode !!\\n\\n\r\nWell, what can I say, I love this anime, so the enjoyment is 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I was a bit suspicious about this anime at the start, but I think I did the best thing when I started it. It's absolutely a fantastic anime that I'm sure everybody will enjoy !\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review and I'm going to finish it with a quote from the protagonist, Edward Elric:\\n\\n\r\n\"A lesson without pain is meaningless. That's because no one can gain without sacrificing something. But by enduring that pain and overcoming it, one shall obtain a powerful, unmatched heart. A FULLMETAL HEART.\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "To start off, i should clarify that the original FMA is one of my favourite anime's, so to say that brotherhood 'tops it' is not a simple statement be me. \r\nAt first i was actually reluctant to watch brotherhood simply because i felt they were down playing how good original was. So pure stubbiness kept this wonderful experience from me, but could you blame me? There was a lot of hype about brotherhood, and to me the selling point was that it was a different ending to the same story i loved, but i later released that is far too understated of what the differencesreally are.\\n\r\nSo i finally decided to watch it after a saw the first episode on t.v. and i agreed it was a much better looking anime than original and the fact that it was still the same characters i loved, so why not see the difference. So off i went and ask my older brother for his copy.\\n\\n\r\nOnce it started i noticed immediately this anime was created for the original fan base and not an alternative to original, which ups its appeal for me. All the beginning story lines are fast passed so u don't feel your just sitting through original again, plus there are surprising changes(which i shall not spoil); so if u haven't seen original it can be a bit full on and \"a lot of info in a short time\" (as my friend who i showed brotherhood too, who hadn't seen original said) but its not impossible. i still maintain to this day too see both!\\n\r\nAnyway, as the story progresses and you feel all secure knowing what's happening and (u think) you know where this is all going, until BANG! CURVE BALL, and suddenly your whisked away onto a totally amazing story completely different to original. These anime's stand alone! So it doesn't really matter which u start with or if u choose to just watch one (which is a same), but this said Brotherhood is better. And here's why:\\n\\n\r\nWell for one big point : Winry.\\n\r\nHOLY CRAP that annoyed me in original, and my brothers can vogue that my first sentence once the movie that finishes original's story ends i seriously was like \"Ummmm wtf about Winry?! They seriously (spoiler)  just leave her!!\" and i think i cried but that doesn't matter.... \\n\r\nIn brotherhood not only do u see a lot more of Winry, you get a BACK STORY, AND DEVELOPMENT! HOLLY SHIT! And its very good. In original it was always left up to inturprritaion as too what Winry was to the Elric brothers, but now we get to see her story pan out and its supper well done.^_^. \\n\\n\r\nAnother reason as to why Brotherhood is better than original is : The GATE/GOD/THINGY\\n\r\nThis part of the anime makes so much more sense and doesn't make me want to brake open my skull and pull out my brain. That's not saying original did amazing with what they had, i just think brotherhood doesn't stretch belief as unbelievably. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the previous fact leads to my last reason : THE MOTHER FUCKING BEST.ENDING.EVER!\\n\\n\r\nWhen original ended there was no sense of happily ever after. It just left off (spoiler) with that sense of the unknown, a guaranty that the story wasn't in fact over and a great big SQUID! ALL THAT SUFFERING AND THAT GREAT BIG, LONG JOURNEY AND YOU DON'T GET ANY RESOLUTION! That always bugged me but i could forgive original cause the journey was in fact amazing and i really love the beginning. But with Brotherhood, there was none of that. You know exactly were the characters stand at the end and everything is tied up with a beautiful bow! (SPOILER, not to mention babies!!! So cutttteeeeee! XD )\\n\\n\r\nSo now that i've said all this before you watch brotherhood, i still suggest watching original first. I am one of though's people who saves the best parts of her food for last, or how i really think about it, end on the best flavour :) \\n\r\nOriginal is longer too, so i feel you really can bound with the characters before starting Brotherhood, which makes the ending all the more satisfying! \\n\r\n(You don't have to by any means, i just think its the best way to experience FMA)\\n\\n\r\nSo here's my rating for this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 a wonderful beginning, middle and end. Plus it flows organically, and you're never bored. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 Fluid, better defined colours and breath taking action. All the characters look better",

But that didnt bother me very much, after all I'm a sucker for action. But character development was different compared to the 2003 version, or so it seems to me. It is good that ed and al didnt even think about harming another soul till the very end, but after all they've been through, I thought they would at least put some thought in it, if it made sense. Like they did in 2003. I understandpeople think brotherhood is canon and characters in the 2003 version is OOC, but I just thought 2003 was a little bit more realistic in some ways. Regardless I fell in love with both of them :)",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the perfect example on how a shounen series must be.\r\nFirst I have to say that I'm an avid animanga goer. I have seen quite some series with different genres, and I also have other favorite titles. But among all of those favorite titles of mine, FMA:B stands gallantly, as it was the only one with such intelligence and perfection I was completely at loss for words when finishing it.\r\nStory - The best part that shines the brightest in the series as whole. FMA:B, just like the manga, focuses on the Elric brothers as they embark upon a journey to get theiroriginal bodies back. Everything -- and by everything I mean from their backstories, the little arc, the wonderful climax and the satisfying conclusion -- is very well-thought, well-done. Everything about the alchemy thing and the (minor spoilers maybe) Homunculus thing, they completely blew my mind. The story was so brilliant and even though it started off with so many questions and so many confusions, the expanding story and the resolution answered them all for us. This story is what I would call, smart. It is complex, but not insane. The way we gradually understand the things happening inside the FMA:B universe is thanks to this anime's gratifying explanations. We are not too dumb to understand the story, and we aren't that smart to guess where the story is going either. All the ideas are very wonderful and magnificent. You don't usually find something this clever in an anime series...\\n\\n\r\nAs an additional note, I really loved the ending. It was totally 11 out of 10. No spoilers from me, though.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art is cool as well. They are the usual Hiromu Arakawa style, not too detailed but pleasant to the eyes. I especially liked the alchemy effects and the symbols, they are super cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound - WELL WELL. I have the entire opening & ending songs. From again until Rain. From Uso until Ray of Shine. I have the entire anime soundtracks, composed by the brilliant Senju Akira, the three discs of magnificence. I listen to them over and over again. I have to tell you the sound is very diverse and beautiful. The voice actors and actresses are also brilliant. Romi Paku, oh gosh, you guys know how well she voices people. Ed is no exception. The sound effects, voice acting, BGMs, and opening-ending themes are all beautiful, what else to say man?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - There are a lot of characters here. From our main characters to the enemies. The 'gray' characters as it was initially unclear where they belonged with. Suspicions and betrayals, enemies who turn allies. These characters are blessed with distinguishable characteristics and each one of them are unique. Even the characters who only appeared for little time can be very memorable to you (I'm talking about a certain character). There aren't any useless characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I TOTALLY enjoyed this show. It was astounding. Breathtakingly awesome. This is not the series you could marathon in a day as you will go insane... though I doubt you can wait for the next episode til the next day. The series is very smart, and though there are some tragedies, it's still sweet, beautiful, and heartwarming. The ending doe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, as I had stated before and I will have to state it again now, is a perfect example on how a shounen series must be. Looking for a series with depth and complexity? The perfect series for you. Looking for some laughs? This series also have it, but don't blame me if you get caught up in this marvelous series, even though you didn't mean to.\\n\\n\r\nYou will get caught up anyway.",

            "content": "What makes a show a masterpiece? How enjoyable it is? Lots of character development? A complex and interesting plot? Lots of symbolism and themes? Or maybe it's just based on the shows own hype and popularity? Well, it doesn't matter which it is because Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) has it all. As probably everyone knows, FMAB is a remake of the original Full Metal Alchemist (2003) series; A remake that does pretty much everything right and makes an already great series into one of the greatest series ever. For those of you who have not seen Brotherhood, it is not a \"sequel\" or copyof the original, it's an alternate continuity that follows the manga more accurately than the original (original was created before manga was finished). This show is a must-watch to everyone, all ages and let me tell you why:\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to get too much into the plot since it'd be useless reading since you're going to watch this masterpiece and find out about it's story anyways. The story follows 2 young brothers, Ed and Alphonse Elric, and their struggles in achieving their personal quest.  Edward and Al Elric attempted unsuccessfully to revive their mother using the power of alchemy. In the failure process, the elder brother, Ed, loses a leg, and the younger brother, Al, loses his entire body. Ed manages to attach his brother's soul to a nearby suit of armor, at the cost of his right arm. In the midst of their quest, there are political and military conflicts alongside the darkness of human nature (pandora's box stuff). Greed? Lust? Envy? Gluttony? Truth/Lies? All aspects of our reality that people have to overcome, and FMAB portrays it perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't complicated and symbolic at all yet it gives off the sense of an absolutely genius masterpiece. The show is \"mere\" 64 episodes (not enough for me). Because the show was so long, it had the opportunity to develop their plot to it's fullest potential, and oh boy do they deliver. 64 episodes, and there were absolutely no filler episodes where I was left bored. Skip parts of the show? Unthinkable. Brotherhood does a exceptional job of pacing itself into laying out the foundations of the story as a collection of pieces, and then connecting them all together throughout the series to create a cohesive, masterfully intertwined, and satisfying (tragic) ending. Starting with the very heritage of the main characters and the conspiracy behind the very formation of Amestris. Then the characters figuring out the \"truth\", having to deal with painful experiences, accepting reality/fate, and really growing as a human being. Then portraying the potential and corruption of human beings. With constant sensational battles both psychological and upfront confrontation to keep the viewers entertained... To the very ending where all the questions from the beginning/middle are answered, and the viewers are taught a valuable lesson about humanity-growing up and reality-not as dream-like as we'd like to believe as kids. Epic, Touching/Tragic, Funny, Magical, Simply Amazing. \\n\\n\r\nGreatest vast cast of characters in anime, period. There should be no debate. The main characters aren't given all the screen-time like other shows. FMAB shows the perspectives of so many characters (10+ maybe around 20? Yep--Amazing). What really touched me was that Ed and Al remained true to themselves until the very end. They don't change or learn anything that fundamentally changes them like most \"heroic characters\" They were originally innocent kids who made mistakes just like all human beings. Then they went on the journey to try and correct their mistakes, and through their journey, they learn that there are more things wrong with the world than their own follies; and to repent upon your sins in reality is something of an ambiguous thing... An interesting thing to look for is that although the Elric brothers are on their journey to find the philosopher stone and regain their body, they constantly give up on their quest for the sake of others, to help others, and that, is the true definition of heroism. The other characters aren't there to aid or prevent the Elric brothers achieve their goal, they're there with their own stories. Random characters meet together, and build friendship? Betray eachother/Fall in love? No. FMAB isn't childish like that. But of course, all of the character's pasts and stories all intertwine with one another as the show progresses in a ingeniously woven manner, which eventually leads up to an ideal conclusion that the viewers have no choice to be dazzled by. Every single character is memorable, relatable, and just so damn realistically portrayed with each to their own humanistic feelings. All of them are entertaining to watch as they development and everyone has a moment of truth, where they shine more brightly than the other characters; no one character is like \"the overpowered great heroic guy\" or \"the primary evil psychopathic villain\". To name a few characters that had their own story, had a ton of screen-time, and were highly enjoyable to watch: Roy Mustang (Such a heroic, respectable character, one of best characters ever), Riza Hawkeye, King Bradley, Maes Hughes, Alex Louis Armstrong, Olivier Mira Armstrong, Izumi Curtis, Solf J Kimblee, Winry Rockbell, Scar and the most important character of the entire series (more important than Elric brothers), Van Hohenheim. Furthermore as I've mentioned before, Truth, Envy, Greed, Lust, and Gluttony are all actual formed characters. Their presentations represent all the ominous presences of our reality and how we overcome them. Revenge? Defeating a villain? What does that truly mean? Killing/Getting revenge on your enemy isn't the end of anything. A purpose is never all consuming; and in fact it'll probably make you even more lonely and unfortunate. That they went out on their own again, trying to stick to a promise they made to themselves, to not be helpless, that something that is so simple and grand is the true aim of their life, a life that all of us lead, is inspiring. Beautiful~ And the most amazing aspect of the show is truly Von Hohenheim's character. The ending of the anime is one of the most satisfying and sad/happy at the same time endings to any show ever. The moment we realize that Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood wasn't about mere alchemy, and action, but themes far beyond the interpretation of many viewers that teach us a lesson about life/reality. The moment we realize, that the story was truly about Von Hohenheim and his humanity.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about the art in this show is colorful, magical and fantastic. The art is designed by different people, so the animation in Brotherhood is different from the original; imo, Brotherhood's art is much much better. The superb quality for action/battles and alchemy portrayed: There's sword/hand-to-hand combat to guns/tanks to explosions/fire to shadow attacks to alchemy magic such as earth control. The characters were portrayed a little bit differently and uniquely as well, it's something you have to watch to notice (hard to explain). They especially did a wondrous job showing the various locales of Amestris, a country that absorbed many of its neighbors to reach its current state. The sound of the show? The Full Metal Alchemist series is known for it's great music, and FMAB doesn't disappoint; no, it impresses. The openings and endings of FMAB are the greatest I've ever heard. There are 5 openings to the show and they're all addicting and great. Opening 1- Again? Beautiful~ Opening 2 - Hologram? Great~ Opening 3 - Golden Time Lover? Catchy~ Opening 4 - Period? Epic~ Opening 5 - Rain? Sad/Satisfying end~ But the openings/endings aren't the only good thing, other great soundtracks that enhance the mood for specific scenes? Check (Listen to Brothers). Good voice cast? Check. \\n\\n\r\nFull Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is a literature masterpiece. Often in great literature pieces there are symbolic objects and characters (next paragraph), and the use of color symbolism. Black, Edward Elric wears a lot of it. Black usually represents death, and the dark aspect of one's nature--often one's own shadow. Ed wearing black represents his mourning for his dead mother, and his self-depression that is stemmed from dissolution and conflict/hardships. The darkness that precedes the spiritual light--reflection of death and destruction of old--rebirth into new/realization. Edward's hair color--yellow often represents the sun/divine light. In Islam it represents wisdom and happiness. But in some places such as Egypt, that color of yellow represents envy and disgrace. The color of yellow in FMAB often mixes together multiple cultures from the world--seen from the philosopher stone. The color green often is associated with life, hope, and happiness. However the portrayal of the color green is ironically used, for in FMAB people who are jealous and hateful towards others usually are associated with green. This may be far-fetched, but I believe that this symbolizes that in reality, with life, hope and happiness, follows death, jealousy, and hatred; one cannot exist without the other. And finally, the color of white: purity (obvious). The philosopher stone's shining of white towards the end marks the beginning of ascent from the abyss-darkness, purification of sins. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore when I mentioned how FMAB has lots of symbolism and themes about life and reality, I truly meant it. The antagonist of FMAB's name is \"Father\" and he dresses entirely in white. He fulfills the role of an almighty and divine creator; he creates 7 homonculus' and names them: Wrath, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, and Lust; the 7 deadly sins. He's supposed to represent Jesus/or a Godlike figure. Also, the marking held by each of the Homunculi are called ouroboros (picture of a circling serpent) that symbolize endless circle of life: birth, death, rebirth. Going back to the Jesus references, Von Hohenheim seeks \"Father\" at a church (duh...) and Hohenheim walks right over the water that's flooding the path (Jesus-Philosopher stone-Divine Being). But an even more symbolic scene representing the same concept was when \"Pride\" claims that \"God is only a figure created by humans; that's all there is to it. If you want to bring an iron hammer down on me, do it yourself without having to rely on God, human!\" Iron-hammer down? Ring any bells? Interestingly enough, King Bradley pins down Colonel Mustang, and he chooses to impale both of Mustang's palms (Jesus-crucification). And, my favorite: Flemel's Cross-- the one that Edward Elric has on his jacket and Al Elric has on his armor. Nicholas Flemel was the creator of this cross, and he was a devout christian that had spent his entire life studying the concept of \"alchemy\". The image of the Flemel's Cross is one where there's a serpent on the cross. There are multiple interpretations of this portrayal, but I think that it signifies the most obvious thing: crucification of a serpent (Satan). This most likely reflects the characters in FMAB overcoming the darkness of reality. All in all, probably the most important symbolism in FMAB was \"The Gate\" which was the connection between our reality, and the world of FMAB. The gate represents the phase of life, and the light illuminating from it represents spiritual growth (of all the characters). The gate closed when Elric lost his mother-- his loss of innocence. Then later once again the gate closed when ____ died in our own reality: a gateway that symbolizes problems with those that open it to see the other side, having no choice but to deal with whatever lies beyond it (temptation). Elric opening the gate to see the \"truth\". Elric's journey began because he opened that gate. \\n\\n\r\nGo watch the show now if you haven't already seen it. It is truly masterpiece that anybody, all ages, all genre preferences can enjoy. #1 rated in this site for a reason.",

            "content": "This is the last anime that needs another review, but I couldn\u2019t resist. The Fullmetal Alchemist franchise\u2019s significance to anime is rivaled only by shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop. The original version from 2003 stands as one of my favourite series of all time, as it is one of the most well rounded shows that I\u2019ve seen in the anime medium, and I believe it\u2019s a must watch for all anime fans. \r\nFast forward to 2009, when Bones released Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, a faithful remake to the manga, which was still being written while the 2003 version was being released (which ledto the overall plot diverging from the manga). Brotherhood has been critically acclaimed, and has often been considered superior to its 2003 counterpart. While I believe that it\u2019s a fantastic show (and believe me \u2013 if the million fanboys/girls squealing isn\u2019t enough, let me tell you that Brotherhood is AMAZING), and it does indeed do a few things better than the 2003 version, it does fall short in a few areas.\\n\\n\r\n(Note that comparisons to the 2003 version will be present, because hey, it\u2019s inevitable.) \\n\\n\r\nPlot/Presentation\\n\r\nSo Brotherhood follows the source material more faithfully. Does that automatically mean it\u2019s better? Well, yes and no. One of the main criticisms against 2003 is that it diverged from the original plotline of the manga. While the original source material had some magnificent content, the mere fact that Brotherhood is more faithful doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s better. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the flaws first. The first 10 or so episodes are extremely rushed, and, to be frank, shitty. Pivotal moments that build not only the foundation of the entire plot, but also key moments in the development for a few main characters, felt hurried, and I couldn\u2019t feel the dramatic tension of the situations at all. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly hated Brotherhood at that point, but it eventually got better. The director eventually found a consistent pace that worked for the show. It was still fast paced and incredibly engaging, but it slowed down just enough for the show the flow naturally.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with the entirety of the show is the comedy. The manga had lots of comedy, and though I haven\u2019t read all of the series, the comedy worked decently well to an extent. The show tries to copy the manga\u2019s humour, and it just doesn\u2019t work when brought to life on the screen. A lot of the tender and dramatic moments of the show are completely destroyed by characters suddenly jumping into chibi form for a quick laugh. The transitions between the drama and comedy in Brotherhood is horrendous and above all, inappropriate. Plus, the recurring jokes get way too old way too fast (e.g. people teasing Ed about his height is funny at first, but loses its effect). \\n\\n\r\nThe world of FMA can be rather\u2026 dark, and it\u2019s beyond me why such inappropriate comedy is placed in the most out of place situations. Luckily, like my issue with the pacing, the humour eventually became a bit tamer, but it still irked me at times.\\n\\n\r\nRemember how I said that the mere fact that the show follows the manga more faithfully doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s better? \\n\\n\r\nThe 2003 version saw this, and it did its best to tone down the humour just enough for the show to feel more genuine. It still had the wacky FMA slapstick that everyone loves, but unlike Brotherhood, it was saved for when it wouldn\u2019t interrupt with pivotal dramatic/emotional moments. \\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s not to say Brotherhood does a bad job with its tender bits either. When it\u2019s done right, it\u2019s done well. \\n\\n\r\nNow before you rage on me and rate my review \u2018not helpful\u2019, keep in mind that I still gave this show an 8/10. This show has much redeeming value, hell, plenty of it. \\n\\n\r\nThe entirety of the story revolves around the theme of \u2018Brotherhood\u2019, like the title suggests. You see this with both the protagonists and the antagonists. You see this bond with the Elric brothers, the military, with Fort Briggs, and even with the homunculi. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself, while having some issues with its presentation, has the word \u2018epic\u2019 written all over it. The world of FMA is a grand one, and so are the rules of alchemy, which is what makes this show special in the fantasy genre. Alchemy is not magic \u2013 to obtain, one must give something of equal value (The Law of Equivalent Exchange). There are many rules of alchemy, and as the show progresses, you learn more about alchemy itself and its effect on other people, both positively and negatively. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the most daring shows I\u2019ve seen in any medium ever, as it goes beyond what the fantasy genre is usually capable of. Brotherhood has a monster of a plot, and somehow it manages to handle its many plot threads with care without seeming convoluted. Each and every subplot receives closure (for the most part) and they all have their impact on the story at large. This is hands down the best part about and so this show deserves praise for that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plot has it all. It\u2019s complex, fascinating, fun, and engaging. Unfortunately, the few but major flaws took a toll on my rating. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nFor me, what I love most about the world of FMA is the characters. The story begins with the tragic tale of the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, two of my favourite characters in anime.  \\n\\n\r\nEdward is the daring brother, the taker of chances, and the intuitive genius of alchemy for his age. He\u2019s strong, he\u2019s flawed, and he is the famous Fullmetal Alchemist. Alphonse is the one who stops and thinks, and throughout the story, he wishes to prove his worth and be more useful to everyone. He can be considered as the moral compass in the entire cast. What I absolutely adore about their relationship is how much they want to save each other before themselves. Edward has lost an arm and a leg, and Alphonse has lost his entire body and is forced to live in a suit of armour, yet all they care about is each other. You can\u2019t ask for better leads like these two. They develop and flesh out nicely as the story goes on. Few relationships can be so tragic, beautiful, and touching. \\n\\n\r\nBrotherhood has a huge cast of side characters, and somehow manages to give the majority of them enough screentime for each of them to leave an impact on me. All the characters have their own motives, relationships, and place in the story at large, and you get to see it all. \\n\\n\r\nCertain characters\u2019 roles and relationships were enlarged in Brotherhood, making their presence far more significant then in the 2003 version. For example, Winry is not only bigger a character in Brotherhood, but her relationship with Edward in particular is far more fleshed out. Winry keeps him grounded. You see her take care of his injuries, scold him, tease him, and most importantly, fall in love with him. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about the characters, but I\u2019ll let you learn about them yourselves. Overall, Brotherhood has a memorable, fantastic, and well used cast\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nBones, you beast of a studio. It\u2019s a wonder how consistent the animation is from Episode 1 to 64. Most long running anime tend to lose its steam when it comes to production values as the show goes on. \\n\r\nNot Brotherhood. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation is not always perfect, it\u2019s still crisp, clear, and consistent. Considering the show\u2019s length, its consistency is an achievement in itself. Equal time and care is also put in the character designs. All of the characters are definable, vivid, and full of life. The background scenery can be absolutely stunning to boot. \\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes range from boring to extremely mind blowing (particularly fights involving Mustang and the final showdown). However, FMA was never about the action, so I can\u2019t really complain, as I feel that it would\u2019ve let the show down if it were more action-oriented. \\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I have, albeit a minor one, is the use of lighting. It can seem a bit flat at times, but overall, this show is very visually pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Voice Acting\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the music, the openings and endings are where Brotherhood shines. I\u2019ve yet to see OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s so memorable, gripping, and energetic. I loved each and every one of them except for the 3rd OP and ED. Even though I don\u2019t usually listen to Japanese music, I loved the songs. Plus, when the songs are also used as inserts during any given episode, it brings the biggest smile to my face. Standouts go to OP 1 and 4 and ED 2, which is a touching pop ballad called \u2018Let it Out\u2019. Even though I couldn\u2019t understand the lyrics without translation, it still brought a few tears to my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself is very solid one. There is a wide range in this soundtrack, from upbeat to suspenseful, and the soundtrack is used well. I\u2019ve no complaints. \\n\\n\r\nFMA has been considered to be among the shows that have superior dubs than most in anime, and honestly, I could see why. There isn\u2019t a single miscast here, and every one of the VA\u2019s played their role amazingly well. For example, I was a little hesitant to hear that Alphonse\u2019s VA was replaced, but all that hesitation withered away after I heard Maxey Whitehead\u2019s portrayal of him. Her performance came of just as genuine as Aaron Dismuke\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to pick out standouts, mainly because every VA went beyond the call of duty with these characters. I loved this dub that much. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nAfter a rather disappointing start, Brotherhood more than makes up for it, as it becomes a huge rollercoaster ride until its epic finale and touching conclusion. With a plot that screams epic, fantastic characters, masterful production values, and an eargasmic dub, I wish I could rate this show higher. I really do. However, the few flaws were unfortunately major ones, and they took a huge toll on the show as a whole. Consistent pacing and tone are two important building blocks that form a solid story, and unfortunately Brotherhood lacks in both areas. Nevertheless, don\u2019t let these flaws stop you from watching this show, as it more than makes up for it. If you haven\u2019t watched anything from the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, I suggest watching the 2003 version first and then watching Brotherhood. \\n\\n\r\nNow before I close the longest review I\u2019ve ever written, I\u2019d like to address one commonly asked question in the anime community: is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood worthy enough to be ranked #1 on MAL? While I do not believe Brotherhood is THE BEST ANIME EVER, I will say it\u2019s among the greats, and its universal appeal is undeniable. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood captures what anime is and the great heights of which this medium is capable of. I couldn\u2019t think of another show that is more worthy than Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to be the face of anime.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, me being a FMA fanboy, this gigantic review only scrapes the surface of all my thoughts and feelings. Am I being overly positive? Am I being unfair? If you want to take this discussion further, feel free to leave feedback/comments on my profile! This is StillSwingin007, and thanks for reading my review!\\n",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood took all the impressive qualities from the first series and simply polished them. In the process of doing so, it practically eliminated all weaknesses from the first series and created a true work of art. The misplaced comedy was removed. Nearly no scenes which are intended to be dramatic are accompanied by slapstick humor. Brotherhood\u2018s visuals are of a considerably higher caliber and so are its action scenes. What truly separates FMA: Brotherhood from its original counterpart however is the way in which it explores profound philosophical themes. The level of depth in Brotherhood\u2018s story is astounding. It avoids any form offillers, unlike the original, and uses every single one of its episodes effectively. Take any episode out of FMA: Brotherhood and it will be missing a vital organ in its body.",

            "content": "I held out on watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood for a long time, watching other series as I kept the show on my plan to watch list. Now as I finally recently embarked on to watch FMA:B and finished it, I regret not watching it earlier.\r\nThis is my first review and english is not my native language, so do forgive my rambling about..\r\n- Story -\r\nFMA:B's story is truly one of the most unique stories I have seen. Everything at first is so shrouded in mystery and the story is set into motion as the brothers set out on their journey to get their bodies back. Youare introduced to many events of the series early on, and all of these are explained as the show goes on. This is where FMA's pacing shines. The story is mostly a very continuous story with flashbacks to the past presented occasionally to further explain the underlying factors that make the show's world what it is in the present. Also character development is very well executed in FMA:B, and it's honestly fun to see Ed growing up as the show progresses. I was also very glad to find that for it's whole run time of 64 episodes, FMA has no filler episodes at all. \\n\r\n         10/10\\n\\n\r\n- Art - \\n\\n\r\nThe art in FMA:B is very good, but it's not the best. The animation is certainly fluid in the action scenes, and even though I was not the biggest fan of the realistic (though well drawn) backgrounds and the at times grey color palette. But it does fit the show. I had a few issues with the very simplified chibi-art joke moments especially at the beginning of the show but, as the show goes on, you get used to them and they appear less often.\\n\r\n              9/10\\n\\n\r\n- Sound - \\n\\n\r\nI have only watched the sub version of FMA:B, so I cannot judge the series from the dub. The voice actors did a great job at portraying the characters and their emotions, and I especially liked Mustang's performance. Edward can sound a little bit annoying at times, and I found it a bit disturbing that their voices had not matured nearly at all towards the end of the series, but that doesn't matter too much. I have to say that FMA:B excelled with its classical OST and outstanding openings. Two of the openings, Again and Period especially stood out for me, Period with it's catchy tune and appealing visuals, and Again with Yui's wonderful voice and maybe some of the best directing in openings to be seen. You will definitely find yourself remembering some of the music used in the show for a long time.\\n\r\n               9/10\\n\\n\r\n- Character - \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are perhaps the best part about FMA:B. Pretty much all the characters are so well written, with distinctive personalities and their own struggles and pasts. None of the main characters are too strong, and we will see them succeed and suffer as much. The main characters', Ed's and Al's arcs are so well rounded that it's just a pleasure to watch unveil. And the rest of the supporting cast was also portrayed in a spectacular fashion, they weren't there just to support the main characters. Also, I find it rare for shows to make such good villains as there are in FMA:B. I'm not sure if I've ever actually felt for a villain as they die, but it happened here. It was interesting to like the villains and hate them as much at the same time.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment - \\n\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a show even non-anime fans would like. It avoids the usual cliches some anime shows tend to use and it will keep you enthralled during its whole run time. FMA:B probably loses some of its enjoyment if one rewatches it, as learning about the world and its events as the show progresses is one of the most enjoyable things about it, but I still wouldn't mind rewatching it. It's a story hard to forget about, and you will find yourself feeling empty after watching it, because it is that fulfilling. \\n\r\n             10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is a 10/10 for me. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Cartoon Network isn\u2019t what it used to be. As a kid, I watched CN because it had shows that appealed to tons of people, shows that had meaning, and shows that deserved to be labeled classics. Those shows are gone. Teen Titans, Samurai Jack, The Batman, Chowder, Kids Next Door, and more have been dismissed for garbage cartoons like Teen Titans Go! , Adventure Time, Ninjago, and Uncle Grandpa (No comment on those new Pok\u00e9mon incarnations). With the exception of Clarence and Steven Universe, Cartoon Network is a joke. CN\u2019s lone redeeming factor is Toonami, a late-night segment form Saturday evening to Sunday morning wherevarious anime are featured, and one of them used to be Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\\n\\n\r\nI never liked Brotherhood; I love it. An avid reader of the FMA manga, I stumbled upon Brotherhood on Toonami and, form there, I was hooked. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who lose possession of their bodies as a result of breaking the most important rule in alchemy, attempting to resurrect the dead, and they journey across the country of Amestria as they attempt to reclaim their former selves. Edward Elric is this anime\u2019s protagonist, the famed \u201cFullmetal Alchemist\u201d whose legendary reputation is rivaled by his alchemical skills, the wise cracking prodigy with an unpredictable personality and a strong distaste for milk, and the height-conscious adolescent with a constant inner conflict about morality, a massive amount of confidence, and an unwavering dedication to his loved ones. If I were to make a list of the greatest anime characters, Edward Elric would be in at least the top ten. Alphonse Elric is the younger of the two brothers, a gentle and likable young boy trapped in a suit of armor that serves as Edward\u2019s mediator during Ed\u2019s explosive episodes (Al is often assumed to be the older of the two due to his height). Brotherhood ventures into a variety of places throughout Amestria, from the bustling business environment in Central City to the fear-inducing tunnels underneath the city, from the wind-driven snowflakes covering the Drachma region to the primal adobes in dust-consumed Ishval, and, in all of them, this anime crafts the setting with a razor-sharp eye for detail and an amazingly artistic flair.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of FMA Brotherhood doesn\u2019t focus on the Elric brothers but instead on the people surrounding them. Colonel Roy Mustang is my favorite character, an easygoing alchemist with the coolest power ever (He can unleash fire by \u2013 get this! \u2013 snapping his fingers!), and an ambitious leader that alternates between cracking jokes and being dangerously serious. There\u2019s Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of the Elric brothers and a gifted mechanic. There\u2019s Scar, a sunglasses-wearing Ishvalan with a reputation as a malicious murderer and a mission to destroy alchemists of the military via alchemy. Brotherhood also contains a great group of villains in the Homunculi, the seven nearly-unstoppable immortal-like beings each with their own unique personality, and their Father. The two Homunculi that stood out to me were Greed (The Homunculi are named after the seven deadly sins), a rebellious man with steel-like skin, and Pride. Born from Nightmare Fuel, Pride is this anime\u2019s most important villain excluding the main antagonist Father who I will remember most for that frightening scene with Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye. Excluding the emotionless Father, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has characters with great acting, emotion, complexity, and (above all) likability (Is this even a word?)\\n\\n\r\nThere are five main themes in Brotherhood; the final opening is by far the most emotional, but my favorite is the first, a fast-paced theme song that slowly intensifies at a pace with the opening\u2019s singer. Plotwise, there isn\u2019t a big difference in Brotherhood from the Fullmetal manga (although Isaac the Freezer never graced the FMA pages nor did Father Cornello evolve into a hulking beast), but the anime is still just as good, with more twists than a Twizzler stick and more energy than a kid on a sugar rush.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest thing about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is its appeal to all genres. If you want tons of action, if you want a show with martial arts, if you want a military-themed anime, if you want some mystery to your show, if you want some sci-fi in your show, if you want a huge focus on adventure in your show, if you want some slice-of-life aspects to your anime, if you want to see buckets of blood, if you want to watch a show with fantasy elements in it, if you want to watch a dystopia-themed show, if you want to check out an anime with depth, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the series for you.\\n",

            "content": "The art and action scenes are great. The writing is terrible and the \"expansion pack\" of characters (saying this having watched the 2003 anime) is annoying.\r\nSome side characters are too dramatic and have more story than they need to, well other more important characters lack story and depth. With really got me with the comparison between a certain character's death scene. In the first anime he's happening slow motion and there are flashbacks, and another character sees them again, and it's powerful how this character effected the other characters. It's beautiful. It's art. I cry everytime. In the second anime that character just dies. Theothers are affected by it, but it's not as meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that way most of the events that went on. They were hardcore action, but they lacked emotion, and the lackluster writing really didn't help.",

            "content": "The adaptation of manga, intead of original work. Shame really. The second part fails to capture awesomness of first part opting to do everything as differently as possible from first part. Which is a shame - charecter development is just poor (and some charecters such as Mustang are just boring opposing the brilliant and loved Mustang from first part), the speed of story doesn't leave any time for good plot, idiotic deforming of animation, poor animation in general (despite huge budjet), good OST, that nevertheless fails to shine in comparison to first part and most importantly it fails to use brilliant findings of original anime(such as comparison of Winry-Ed's mother with ligh shining through the hills). The originally very touching story of two brothers became just a humorous story. No drama, crying, cruelty of the world, no life-problem questions, no interesting and philosophical monologues, etc\\n\\n\r\nVery many points where it could do better, but doesn't. Insted of formula \"excelent manga + ecelent anime prequel\" we only get so-so mainstream anime. \\n\\n\r\nThough with soon to depart original series story it could still be prooved to be good anime. However, after dissapointing Soul Eater and Xam'd faith into Bones is very weak.",

            "content": "Many have seen FMAb series and consider it one of the best anime. I watched it in having doubt of \u201cHmm... What could be so special about just some fight-kill shounen anime?\u201d and at the end...I was at loss for words. Because it is VERY WELL DONE. There is some debate about \u201cWhich series is better? 2003 or 2009\u201d But I will get to that later. \r\nStory 10/10\r\nOverall: Slow buildup nonetheless very coherent and strong story\r\nminus point: first 15 episodes\u2019 pacing problem and its comedy. \r\nThe story itself is VERY coherent and complete. It follows the original manga from start to end, so no fillersand every episode has some meaning and connection to its end. Brotherhood series is comparable to jigsaw puzzle that you get pieces from here and there and at the end, everything comes together as a beautiful picture conveying one message. But. there are few irritations mainly based on pacing and comedy placement. This is what original fullmetal alchemist attack most on its brother and it is true. The first 15 episodes or so is very rushed and comedy is a bit uncontrolled. But after that, pacing problem gets settled and comedy.... you kind of get used to it. Also another problem is that although finale proportion more than makes up for the wait, you have to get through first tens of episodes to get to the most intense part which is the last 10-20 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: Top notch quality. Unique character design and beautiful scenary. Rare deformed art. \\n\r\nminus point: Those who have seen original might not like it. Not to standard \u201cMOE\u201d art too. Well.. I could sum it up as personal preference(Although I prefer brotherhood, I like original art style)\\n\\n\r\nAnother point that originals point out about brotherhood. Personally I prefer original style because it just has more slimmer, cuter character design. But, once again, not much of a problem- the art itself is very clear, scenary well described and overall well-done too. Although it does stand apart from the standard \u201cMOE\u201d art. Quality is once again very top-notch and character design.. need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: Well going along ops, eds and some memorable ones too. Great bgm.\\n\r\n......maybe not as memorable as original though...\\n\\n\r\n Once again in comparison to the original series. First op-YUI \u201cAgain\u201d, First ed- Sid \u201cUso\u201d/ Second op-NICO touches the wall \u201cHologram\u201d, Second ed- \u201cLet it out\u201d/ Third op-Sukima Switch \u201cGolden time lover\u201d, Third ed Tsunaida \u2013 Lil'B/ Fourth op Chemistry \u201cPeriod\u201d, Fourth ed Scandal \u201cShunkan Sentimental/ Fifth op Sid \u201dRain, Fifth ed \u201cRay of light\u201d/ The op and ed are pretty well placed, especially second ending which had many episodes which literally needed some \u201cletting out\u201d and fourth op and ed. The most preferred op in brotherhood generally in western fandom is \u201cPeriod\u201d. I am from Asian country which also has many, MANY brotherhood fans and the best song of the whole series is considered to be Sid\u2019s \u201cRain\u201d. Not only good ops and eds, It has some amazing bgms too. The best example would be \u201cTrisha\u2019s lullaby\u201d or \u201cMain theme\u201d from soundtracks. Especially, FANTASTIC JOB with placing \u201cMain Theme\u201d. If you watched it, you will know what I mean and if you haven\u2019t why don\u2019t you check it out yourself?\\n\r\nThough... there are lots of fans that in terms of soundtrack, original series did better.. and I kinda agree. Still top-notch though. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10(maybe even more)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Right kind of growth to each and every character. 3d character that is independent of the show\u2019s main protagonist and has his or her own goals. \\n\\n\r\nI have seen many reviews that point out good character development, but usually they don\u2019t point out \u201chow\u201d Because original series did a superb job on thinking about humanity and deep ptsds and mother complexes and such, the character development of brotherhood is considered to be shallow but if you really think that, you may have to rethink the meaning of \u201ccharacter development\u201d\\n\r\nThe main viewpoint is that how main protagonist \u201cEdward Elric\u201d who is child prodigy, goes on to learn what he believed to be the strongest merit of human being is actually not and learns what makes human really great. To further elaborate would be spoiler but after finishing the series, if you compare some of the attitudes he showed and some lines he blurted out from the start and the end of the series, you will see the distinct difference. And what protagonist gets to realize is actually the main point of the story. \\n\r\nNot only the main protagonist, Scar, Ling, Roy are the main characters that get very coherent and well character development throughout the story. It is very easy to miss how they grew and developed but if you pay attention to it, you\u2019ll see how author gave them the right kind of hardship and epiphany in order for them to move foreward. I am actually going to elaborate on that point down below, but its gonna contain some major spoilers so you\u2019ll just have to watch it if you want to see it. \\n\r\nAlso, another main character gets highlighted but saying who it is may also be spoiler for you.....Let\u2019s just say he just so strived to become human, and makes a nice contrast to another major antagonist. \\n\r\nNot only that, many characters, down to one-episode character has a chance to shine its value. While many shows highlights main character too much that other character\u2019s fight and struggle becomes appetizer for the main fight, there is none of that. \\n\r\nAlso, what I would like to point out is that many characters that plays major role to the story is not dependent on the main character\u2019s main goal. All the major characters have different goals but in order to achieve there separate goals, they have to overcome something together, and that\u2019s why although fullmetal alchemist brotherhood series is a series for Elric brothers, it could easily be another series seen from other character\u2019s point of view... which is kind of realistic because well, all people are protagonist of their own life and has different individual goals right?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Brotherhood is the series I preferred and many agree that plot-wise it is a bit more coherent and well constructed, but some of the elements are superior in original.. It all comes down to personal preferrences I suppose. Solely on its evaluation, it is great, in comparison to original, I believe it is superior too.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, this is the part where I get to the core point of the review. Will you like it? The answer is, if you like shounen, well-told coherent plot, opitimistic, a bit idealistic views, you will like it. \\n\\n\r\nNow then, what is the difference between brotherhood and original series?\\n\\n\r\nBrotherhood is a greater scale of story which focuses on not only the Elric brothers but other character\u2019s development to convey a message about humanity as a whole. Its basically about seeking answers to \u201cWhat makes human great\u201d and it the process you will see many weaknesses of human itself and how each character overcomes it. Basically, much more oriented towards \u201cwhat the anime tried to convey\u201d I\u2019ll get to that more specifically on spoiler zone. \\n\r\nOriginal story is a smaller scale of story which focuses more on Elric brothers and drives to the core question of humanity \u201cIs human great?\u201d And by which means, the atmosphere is uncomparably darker, and because it focuses more on side story and each character\u2019s tragedy, although its shounen, it closely goes in area or Seinen. \\n\\n\r\nNow what to watch?\\n\\n\r\nIf you like heartbreaking sorrowful story that focuses more on characters, I recommend original. If you like story that has greater scale and has fights and like hopeful atmosphere, I recommend brotherhood. While original has some fillers, it does has its own coherent storyline, so I have no intention of counting that down. Actually, it is one of the best original storyline animes ever had that deviates from the manga. But, despite the excellent job of original, I prefer brotherhood. Plot wise and the wrap-up of the brotherhood is more clean, and all wrapped up. Also, how the brotherhood places each and every elements and characters are poetic to the point you get to doubt \u201cIs this really an anime?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nAnd now.. the highlight of the review- \\n\\n\r\nSpoiler Zone- \\n\r\nWhat is this show trying to say and how it was conveyed. \\n\r\n The main point of the show is, as I have said repeatedly \u201cWhat makes human great?\u201d This is actually shown by so many symbolism and character development. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development\\n\r\n  First, let\u2019s think about Edward Elric, the main protagonist of the series. His father left the house when he was very young and his mother died too. Combined that with brilliance in alchemy, he became a person who was fiercely independent as to not relying on anybody to the point he was arrogant. He thought alchemy was the key to everything, even to the point he thought he could bring his mother back with his alchemy skills. Some might disagree with me, but although it was out of desperation it was also an utter, undeniable arrogance. Who does he think he is that he could bring a human being back solely out of its ingredient? \\n\r\n  He has seen atrocity of alchemy at the start point of the show, but still at that point, he thought alchemy was answer to all and still was fiercely independent. \\n\r\n  He slowly realized alchemy could not be answer to all by realizing the atrocity of it. He seems homunculus, he finds out philosopher\u2019s stone, hell, he sees a small girl turned into a chimera with no solution whatsoever to turn her back. Experiencing all this, he sees, \u201cAlchemy cannot possibly be answer to everything.\u201d \\n\r\n  Also, not relying on others and trying to solve everything by himself could be seen in the act of going to Lab 5 alone which he gets scolded from Ross \u201cWhy don\u2019t you trust adults more?\u201d He refuses to listen to Greed just because he was angered which also he was reprimanded by greed \u201cSuccumbing to anger, will you lose valuable information and your brother?\u201d This makes a nice contrast when he agrees to go under homunculus greed to fight against father saying \u2018he can\u2019t lost valuable information just because of his pride.\u201c Also, at Liore he just said to the priest \u201dI\u2019ll teach you the difference between you and me\u201c to facing father which come the same line replacing \u2018I\u2019 to \u2018we\u2019. This also relates to the final confrontation to the Truth which Edward says \u201dI was from the beginning a mere human, who couldn\u2019t even save a little girl.\u201c After that he says \u201dIt is okay because there are everyone\u201c He has found his answer that what makes human great is not alchemy but interaction between the human beings which is one of the important message of the story. Note that Ed was the one who killed homunculus Pride-creepy symbolism there\\n\r\nSummed up: An arrogant child who thought alchemy was the answer to everything killed pride, and had to give up his source of pride(alchemy) to bring back what he lost from pride. \\n\r\n  Moving on to other characters, Scar is also a notable character. Consumed by vengeance, he just becomes nothing but a serial killer. But while doing that, what made him doubt his path was Winry and his memory of his brother. Although there were many instances that led Scar to turn to protagonist\u2019s side, the most shocking moment was the dejavuu which he was in the position of Kimblee and Ed and Winry was in the position of he and his brother. It could be seen that what caused Scar to get out of the never ending circle of vengeance to the rightful anger was job of both his deceased brother and Winry. This is what I mean by what human makes human great is interaction between humans. After overcoming the blind anger, he was truly able to revenge the true culprit of his tragedy-King Bradley\\n\r\nSummed up : A human consumed by blind vengeance has to learn to swallow and control his anger and cooperate whom he hated so much(Amestrians) to really kill the source of his wrath-King Bradley(homunculus wrath)\\n\r\n  Next is Ling. Ling although is portrayed almost constantly good character was one the verge of line which he could have been consumed by greed. At the first appearance, he demanded philosopher\u2019s stone and questioned the secret to binding a soul. When he did receive homunculus greed, he was actually overwhelmed by it except when Ed mentioned Lan Fang and Fuu. He learned not to succumbed or consumed by greed, but rather work with it towards the end to achieve his goal- a rightful growth considering he had no experience of dealing with greed (unlike mustang who was controlling his greed on the path of careerist) and if he got to be a ruler of a country, a trait he must have. \\n\r\nSummed up: A prince consumed by greed had to learn to work with it than rather being consumed by it lost Greed and got what he had greed for(throne).\\n\r\n  Next is Alex Armstrong. A big softy with no heart of steel to stay in the military to fight against it, nor rebel against it nor accept the duty \u2018ran away\u2019 from the cruel reality of Ishval war. Quite indolent compared to Roy, Riza or even his own sister. But after he chose not to be indolent, he stands together with his sister who reprimanded his indolency most to defeat Sloth and contributed to changing the military\u2019s reality-something which made he indolent in the past. \\n\r\nSummed up: A soldier caught with indolency faced with cruel reality, overcomes it and defeats Sloth with his sister and contributed to changing the reality. \\n\r\n  Finally, Roy Mustang, who was also in the line of succumbing to blind wrath and vengeance which was prevented by Riza Hawkeye. \\n\\n\r\nHomunculus death\\n\\n\r\n Wrath is killed by human(Scar) wrath and god(sun) wrath combined\\n\r\n Greed sacrifices himself to his greed(for companion)\\n\r\n Lust is killed by womanizer\u2019s(Roy's) care(perhaps love) for his subordinate(perhaps lover)(Riza)\\n\r\n Envy is kills himself out of self loathe after his envy is exposed\\n\r\n Sloth gets killed fighting too hard. \\n\r\n Pride is diminished by Edward\u2019s pride\\n\r\n Gluttony is eaten.\\n\\n\r\nMain Theme\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWe humans may be weak, but because we don\u2019t give up and go forward, because we have other people to support us, because we know our weaknesses and struggle to overcome them, we are able to become great.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n  Humans may be weak- it is told throughout the story borrowing homunculi\u2019s lines, and the atrocity of humans. A child(Edward) consumed by arrogance was let down by his failure. A soldier(Roy Mustang) who tried to serve country had to massacre hundreds of people. Another soldier(Armstrong) ran away from cruel reality. Brilliant mind(Dr. Marcoh) was forced to commit human experiments. A priest(Scar) upon seeing his brother and people\u2019s death became blind with vengeance. Humans were caught is some experiment and became something they didn\u2019t want(Ling, Hohenheim.)\\n\r\n  A weak human was just a mere human with no power to change anything. \\n\r\n  But, amidst that, they couldn\u2019t give up and went on. (Ed, Roy, Alex Armstrong, Ling, Hohenheim...etc.) In the process, they had many support. The child gained new arm and leg to walk with his own feet(Support from Winry). When succumbed by anger, there was someone to stop him from going rampant(Roy-Riza) The soldier caught with indolence had someone to reprimand him for it(Olivier Armstrong) The priest blinded by rage came to senses by his memory of his brother and a small girl(Scar-his brother and Winry) A man who became philosopher\u2019s stone had the courage to go for journey to become human because he had support of his wife(Trisha) and power to go up against father by support by millions of souls(Xerxesians) The prince was able to keep himself being consumed because of his people(Yao clan and his people) \\n\r\n  Final fight which Father is alone with no whatsoever back up and all humans go up against him and Edward\u2019s statement toward god is a great confirmation to to message it was willing to deliver - Humans become great because despite many shortcomings, we do not give up and go on with people to support our backs. That is the core theme of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Simple but coherently delivered huh.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I love this anime.",

Our shared obsession and rituals of swapping theories and weeping and laughing made the original one of my favorite shows ever. I feared (especially after watching the abhorrent Conqueror of Shamballa movie) that watching this one would only cheapen that. \r\nBut, to be honest, I had been through some sub par anime and was in the mood for something epic. So I toughed through the first half season or so that just seemed likea lame imitation of my favorite show, and finally got to enjoy this new adventures. I did really like most of the characters this show added and I loved that it kept the same blend of lighthearted humor with intense action and some drama. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending had a lot of stuff I felt like was a Deus ex Machina cheap shot so they could have the final boss be as OP as possible while still being defeatable. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked this one.

            "content": "Well, I finished this anime awhile ago, and I was looking through the reviews and I was actually surprised that some people rated it a 5 or below. (obviously not many people did, but still) So I decided to write a review for this(:\r\nLet me start off saying, I did not read the manga except the very last vol after completing both series. With that said, I did watch the original made back in 2003. I was IN LOVE with it. I loved the ending and I just thought it had so much depth. But I was well aware that Brotherhood was the remake tobetter fit the manga, so I decided to watch it afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nNow, since I really loved the first one, I was very hesitant to watch the remake. And for those who watched the original, the first 12 or so episodes is pretty much the exact same beginning of FMA. And it was a little annoying just trying get past that, but I did watch it just in case there was a plot difference. I will say, the first episode of FMA:B is pretty much irrelevant to the entire plot. It's pretty much just a \"get the feel of the characters\" episode. But once I hit episode 13, that's where everything got very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10- This anime had so much depth and emotion, that I found myself crying so hard in one episode & then laughing my butt off in the next episode. I will say, this is a dark tale of two brothers trying to restore their bodies. The plot twists that take place is just beautiful. The ending will leave you breathless. I think this anime is perfect for anyone. It has humor, action, suspense, tragedy, and a hint of romance(: Only real downfall was the beginning; I feel as if everything went a lil too fast. And in which one of the character dies (won't say which one) it's not as emotional because of the faster pace and the viewer couldn't get as attached. Only complaint about the plot! \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10- I will admit this anime doesn't have 100% outstanding animation compared some anime of their time or newer ones from today. FMA:B was done in 2009. With that being mentioned, it was fairly decent for when it came out and it's better than its original. Everything has a deep tone yet a delightful brightness. It's admirable. This is a somber toned anime and the animation reflect that~!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10- Some of my favorite Openings & Endings come from this anime. They tell their own little story based on the storyline itself. Not to mention the animation for the EDs & OPs is head-on with the songs! The music they even play throughout the show is just flawless. You'll find yourself loving everything about the soundtracks that they play.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10- The development is just perfect. If you're like me, you'll actually find yourself liking and even growing attached to some the deadly sins(: (They are the bad guys in the anime in case you're new to this anime) They don't over-analyze too much on a particular one, but just enough to make them either relate-able, hated, or lovable. If you've seen the original, you need to just have an open mind with a new take on the characters. Edward's dad would be one of them along  with Scar. I also really love how they introduced new characters that weren't in the original. Also, the females in this anime are strong and can hold their own, which as a young women like myself, I can really appreciate. Personally, my fav characters will always by Greed, Alphonse, Roy, & Winry. Who's yours? :3\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10- This is my favorite anime of all time and nothing has change my mind about that. It's actually funny, my friend even gave me a list of anime to watch and said \"this will surely think differently.\" And y'know? They didn't(: This is one of the few animes where it left me stunned. Brotherhood made me cry, laugh, cry some more, laugh even harder, and left me in suspense. This is an anime that will touch your heart & never leave! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10- I enjoyed it 100% Except maybe the beginning, but I promise all of you that it is worth it. The amount of episodes tends to put people off, but it IS WORTH ALL YOUR TIME. This anime is beautiful. And I want all of you to know that this anime isn't just ranked #1 on this site because it's well known. It is because over 100,000 people all over the world rated this anime a perfect 10. ^.^\\n\\n\r\nI do recommend watching the original first just to compare the two! \\n\\n\r\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Wow so this story was definitly written by a woman, there is so much that makes that true. It was downfall of Claymore, I mean it tries too much femenism agenda. Let me tell you about this girly show:\r\nStory started way fast and then receives no real develop or shock moments that other great anime like Bleach have. The only mystery from this series is the back story because you will basically knows everything from episode 20 it just a huge manner of ending it. You can tell woman wrote it because they have stupid pregnancy episode where they worship woman all day.\r\nArt now thisis crazy stuff, and it's crazy how crazy it is. It must have taken decades for the people to draw and animate this because there is so much details and motion. It worth watching just for the pictures.\\n\\n\r\nSound makes the same music over and over again and you'll get sick of it a lot. The japanese people also don't have as good as voices as American language speakers so we already know that Vick Mononogo is the better Edward.\\n\\n\r\nMost characters you can tell which side their on before they even introduce themself and if the author care about them enough to die or not. There no real development here, nobody really changes or anything you just learn more and it takes forever to end. Strong women which never happens in real life, happens all the time in this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is okay, but you can just realize how author tries to pat the femininest agenda into the show. If you tolerate that, Full Metal Alchemist is a good substitute for Harry Potter.\\n",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist is an action, comedy, romance and drama. The anime is Kingdom Hearts 2, Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core and Bioshock Infinite put together, if you want to know why, I suggest you play or watch the games. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the anime that people can understand the story more and the plot; it is a better adaption to the manga. In this anime many support characters die, I mean a many. This anime is awesome; I enjoyed every minute of it, the sadness, the drama and the funny moments. I assure you to watch this anime; it is worth your time. Ifyou are interested into anime that have action in them, this is perfect for you.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nStory is awesome, the \u201cElric brothers\u201d Al and Edward are on a quest to find their bodies because they lost it because they were trying to resurrect their mother, which was clearly impossible to do and they would punish for it. The story is set in 1914 even though people wear clothes that were in the modern day in 2000s. Edward lost his arm and his leg and Al lost his entire body and his soul was put into a metal armour. Later on the \u201cElric brothers\u201d gets help from the military, their teacher, the emperor\u2019s son and the lady mechanic Winry. So Edward and Al started to train for their journey because they will fight tough enemies, I mean tough. To be honest I like how they wrote this story into a well ordered fashion and you can feel the emotion and tremor in this anime, and the epic battles. To be honest I have never witness a weak character at all or terrible dialogues, thank god for that or this anime would have gotten a little lower rating. But the bad thing about it is how predictable the story was. You can tell that something was bad to happen to the characters, for example if you see a happy moment between somebody, something bad happens to them. Can you believe they made 64 episodes! OMG 64! I thought it was going to be those anime that had a maximum of 25 episodes, there are no fillers.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Art\\n\r\nIn my opinion the character design sucks, the people in the anime look like characters from the 1990s, I mean look at the characters! To be honest, the characters look chibi and you comparing a three year old to a 35 year-old man there\u2019s no fucking differences! But the art was nice and the animation was fluid, the environment look beautiful and the fights do not look like Naruto Shippuden that the animation sucks balls when they are fighting. Sound there are not much songs in the anime to be honest, I heard about ten which was depressing. Voice acting was great even in the English Dub, but think about this. Hellsing Ultimate\u2019s voice acting of the English Dub was fucking terrible, we all know that, but when compared it to Fullmetal Alchemist, is like comparing the game Last of Us to the game Ride to Hell: Retribution.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThere are no weak or terrible character roles in this anime but I knew that the characters that were going to die, it was very predictable. Edward is a short little guy that can be very hot tempered and he can be very funny at times, overall he is a very good older brother to Al and he tries his best to protect him. Al his not so as \u201ccool\u201d brother, deeply cares for Edward and he wants to get body back as much as Edward. Winry is a love interest to Edward, she was friends with him since they were little and cares for him as well. Roy Mustang is one of my favourite characters in the anime because he is badass. He has fire power which cannot work when it is raining, \u201cphysics.\u201d He partners with his lover Hawkeye which has no ability but she an excellent marksman, even though she is so serious and yet her character design is so unserious. The bad guys in this anime are pretty cool because they are not those bad guys that are just bad for no explanation, they do very evil stuff. The main antagonist Father aka \u201cThe bearded bastard\u201d he is like a Xemnas from Kingdom Hearts, he wants the power of God and he is required to sacrifice souls to do that. The bad guys you will hate them because how evil they are, well no shit there the bad guys. I thought the characters were great and the makers put a lot of effort on them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are awesome, they have characters using strategies to find ways to beat their opponent and they have to go through a pretty bloody battle and crazy bloodshed. There was important conversation that made me understand the story more. The characters are pretty amazing. I enjoy almost every bit of the anime, but some points of it was shallow, a bit boring causing me to skip some episodes. I like the characters they keep the show going and make it less boring and dull. The funny moments are hilarious and they will make you laugh. Edward becomes depress and angry when people call him short, but he grows in many episodes later. I love the enjoyment in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score\\n\r\nAn 9 (Awesome)\\n\r\nThe reason I put a 9 because it had bad things to it. I thought it was better than the original because it had a better adaptation. They weren't enough songs to the anime and I wish they made the characters look less chibi. Some points of the story were predictable but I did love it.  I give praise to the creators for making an awesome anime. I recommend you watch this anime, thank god that they made it. I can\u2019t give 10 out of 10 because no anime is perfect; every anime has a bad point. \\n",

            "content": "If you're looking for a good action, shounen and adventure type of anime, then you have to watch FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Even if you're not a big shounen fan I guarantee that this will change your perspective about these types of anime. Overall it is an outstanding anime well worth watching all of the 64 episodes. \r\n     First of all, the story of this anime was amazing. The plot is developed in such a way that makes you more interested in it the more you watch it. It's absolutely incredible how much thought went into themain story as well as how they made it in order to trigger the viewers interest and make him enjoy what he is watching. The fight scenes may not be the best but they're certaintly intense. Moreover, this anime has an epic plotline that bounds to keep the viewer attached to the screen their watching it in.\\n\\n\r\n     Another reason why is this anime great is because of the art, sound and the characters. The art isn't really something special, its just typical animation you see in most anime but it was so carefully made and absolutely perfect that made it well worth mentioning in this review. The producers have done an amazing job with the soundtrack as well, from the opening and ending theme songs to the music playing while the story develops in each episode that just matches the situation completely. I am sure that you will love the music playing as much as I did. Moving on, the characters, generally the characters were very interesting due to the fact that each one of them had a different personality the good guys and the villains as well. There wasn't much of a character development but im sure you can overlook that flaw comparing it to the fact that everyone was different from each other.\\n\\n\r\n     Concluding, I really liked this anime due to its amazing story and plot development, its animation, its soundtrack and its characters. There isn't really anything else to say about why I enjoyed watching this show, I mentioned everything above. If you're a shounen fan then you probably have already watched it and if not then I suggest 100% to go see by yourself, also if you're not a shounen fan give it a shot it might even change your opinion. For all the above reasons FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets a final score of 10/10\\n",

            "content": "This is my first and probably my last review, but I really just have to write a view on this goddamn hell of a masterpiece. \r\nFor a while, I didn't really want to fully watch this because the animation style looked poor, and I did drop it after 2 episodes. I picked it back up and rewatched episode 2, and then I proceeded to watch all 62 more episodes in just 7 days just because I was already hooked. It really blew away all of my expectations because it was #1 on MAL, but I didn't like the storyline or art at the time. Obviously,that stuff was outshined by the other aspects and became my favorite anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters truly were shown so great compared to many other characters I've seen. Almost all of them were very damn likable and they were so different. I only didn't really like 2 or 3 characters, but the rest of them I loved. Pride, King Bradley, Greed, Alex, Edward and Envy were my favorites, and probably most peoples' favorites because of how likable and great they were.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't really think this was a compelling main storyline, but I seriously loved all of the small parts along their journey. The people they encountered, the objectives they had to overcome, the ways they achieved their small goals all to reach their main intent. It was not the most unique plotline, but it surely made me keep watching it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI was really not a fan of the animation style just because it didn't really look like anything I've seen before. It looked pretty ugly when I first started anime, but now it's actually pretty nice. I got used to it from watching those 64 episodes and I'm pleased because it will help me overcome my disliking for old animation styles. The fight scenes were also pretty damn good, while even the regular walking around scenes had a nice feel to them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHoly shit, of those 10 OPs and EDs, 7 of them are superior to a lot of the songs I've heard, and 3 of them are top tier. The OSTs were also pretty nice, but not very memorable. I also really enjoyed the voice acting. Greed's VA was one of my favorites and Edward's was annoying for a little bit, but I eventually began to like it. Overall, I actually didn't not like any of the characters voices because it's pretty hard to have a character with an annoying voice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLiterally a 10/10. I was instantly hooked on the second episode, and just binged all of it in one week as I said before. At around episode 40, I made it my #7 favorite just 'cause it was progressing perfectly. I think near episode 50 it reached my top 5, and at episode 60 it got to my #1. I thoroughly loved all of this, because it really flew past all of my expectations and presented a nice and long shounen adventure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLiterally a 10/10. I honestly don't believe anything can top this. I said this about Hunter x Hunter and Bungou Stray Dogs, but this, just, is too damn spectacular. I loved it so damn much even though they don't have my favorite characters. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood really does deserve the rating it has right now, and I believe it should stay that way.",

            "content": "This is my review of FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Or rather, it's my opinion on why FMAB is the greatest anime ever made.\r\nNote though that I have not seen the 2003 anime nor have I read the manga ; I bring this up because a lot of people who are fans of the 2003 anime bash on Brotherhood for either being a rehash of the mythos and not having as much 'impact' as the 2003 one. I don't exactly know what they are going on about as I'm not a fan of the 2003 version but I respectfully disagree with them. That aside, why do Ithink FMAB is one of the greatest anime of all time? Because it gets literally everything that a good story should have right and more.\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, it is an epic, epic story. A lot goes on in every episode and the scale of the journey is big, spanning a whole continent plus some of its neighbors. Its one of the few modern works of fiction that deserves to be called a saga (saga means heroic journey of great length) and its world is really unique, original and actually pretty believable. Sure, alchemy is unrealistic. Sure, it does not exist. No, that doesn't really make 'realistic' anime better than FMAB. Haven\u2019t you guys heard of suspension of disbelief?! As long as a world sticks to its own rules and FMAB does just this, I devour a work and its world.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever I search out any work of fiction, the first thing I look for are great and compelling characters and when it comes to character, FMAB hit it right out of the park; it has some of the most inspiring, unique, compelling and relatable characters ever, be they villains, heroes, allies or even minor characters. Edward Elric never gives up no matter how much crap he goes through (yeah, sound familiar? kenshinhimuragutskenzotenmagokuetc... hey, that\u2019s not a bad thing, it's actually a very good thing). He is a bit whiny when it comes to his pride and height but not when he goes through actual bad stuff. No, when he does you can be sure he'll try to fix it by any means possible. Al is also a very great character; looking up to his brother and helping him out with his quest to gain their bodies back and honestly, can you imagine FullMetal Alchemist without Alphonse? The two complete each other with their brotherly love and companionship and this companionship helps them out a ton in their journey.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the Elric allies, I will not mention as there are too flipping many. However, they are all very fun, likable and when some of them do die, it's heartbreaking and haunting. Yes, even the death of THAT character that died in episode 20 or so of the 2003 FMA but died in episode 10 of FMAB was very tragic and haunting. I could not believe it and the rest of the series became really suspenseful because of that.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains are also great. Scar is mysterious and interesting, the Homunculi are for the most part fun and even scary and Father who turns out to be the big bad is a fascinating, horrifying and a really effective villain. One thing that did bother me though and the next sentence is a minor spoiler for a character death, was that the homunculus Lust was killed off too quickly whereas according to the stuff I read, she was a much more interesting character in the 2003 version. It did bother me a little but not by much because the Homunculi Wrath, Pride and of course, Greed more than made up for any loss of her character. I think my most favorite villain in Brotherhood ha to be Wrath. He's just really scary and a very real threat to our heroes and I won't spoil who he is but it's really surprising. And then there is Envy. Biggest. Bastard. Ever. Well, except for Griffith. And Johann. And Dan'Ichiro Sanka. And Hitler. What, only fictional characters count?\\n\\n\r\nFMAB also has without a doubt the best depiction of women in all of fiction. Sure, there are the usual tsunderes in this anime like Winry and Izumi Curtis but they still come out as fully fledged characters and despite Winry being an engineering nerd and Izumi and Riza always moving and being utterly badass, THEY STILL COME OFF AS FEMININE. Finally, a work of fiction where a (relatively) well adjusted woman can actually be herself and acts all girly but at the same is still very competent instead of always needing to be rescued. No women pretending to be like men as if their femminity was a disease needing to be wiped out, nor are there any dumb blondes who get themselves captures or whine about being rescued!\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is the Father of the Elric Brothers. I won't spoil his character but trust me he's really compelling and great.\\n\\n\r\nDoes FMAB have flaws? Well yes, but some of these 'flaws' aren't really flaws. A criticism I often heard for Brotherhood was that it didn't pack as much punch as the 2003 version. I disagree so much with this reasoning because FMAB is one of those very rare anime that brought put all of my feelings: it made me cry (those war scenes, oh my gosh...), it made me think (war is bad but can it be used to do good?), it made me angry (Envy you bastarded son of a...), it even made me happy and elated. I, an 18 year old man at the time, found myself cheering for the characters out loud when they were doing something awesome as if I was watching my favorite football team scoring a goal. No other anime or manga, not even Berserk made me do such things. Then there were the times where I was really disturbed. I think Brotherhood is one of the most violent anime out there. It's not Berserk levels in its blood and gore but it's fairly graphic especially when the Homunculi themselves are getting beaten up. However, those scenes weren't really disturbing and to me, episode 4 of the anime was one of the saddest moments I've ever seen. I did not see that moment coming and when it did, I was speechless and felt really empty inside. So to me, the idea that Brotherhood didn't pack a big punch is a non-sensical argument as it really did get a lot of different feelings from me.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was also pretty nice. Edward despite being such a badass is hysterical when he's all angry about his own height (IF YOU PRAY, YOU'LL DEFINITELY BECOME TALLER!) and the funniest joke involved Winry actually KILLING Edward with her wrench. That scene came out of nowhere and the fact it was never mentioned again made it all the more hilarious. The comedy never takes away from the mood though and like the Higurashi anime, the comedy made the characters seem closer to us and friendly; comedy when done well can actually give characters a ton of depth. Edward may never give up and he's still really smart but he's still impulsive and stubborn.\\n\\n\r\nSomeone else told me that FMAB doesn't stand on its own, meaning you have to watch it from the beginning in order to understand the plot instead of picking it up 20 episodes or so in and starting from there. While I am someone who thinks that works of fiction like books or films in a series should stand on their own, to me it doesn't count for TV series animated or not. TV series have a huge advantage over films, animated or not, in that they have much more time and narrative devices to explain their story and in my opinion, this should be taken advantage of. Not every series has to have an episodic format (like Cowboy Bebop which I didn't like) especially if the story doesn't call for it and why would anyone watch any series with only 64 episodes 20 episodes or so in? While it's true that episodic anime are more mainstream and probably bring in a bigger audience, the fandom that you bring in with a non-episodic anime will still be big and it will be a dedicated fandom always analyzing and dissecting your work.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to name a real flaw Brotherhood had, I do think the first 10 episodes were a bit rushed. Oh they were still deep, well written and compelling but compared to the rest of the anime I agree that they were rather rushed. Sometimes the animation does look a bit off model and a character in the last episode does look a much older than he really is due to off-model animation. However, none of these flaws took away from my enjoyment of the anime and I find the story to have very little flaws. There was really only one moment where I didn't quite buy that a character would do such a thing because I always thought that this character was way smarter than she really is. Also, what on earth happened to my dear Sheska?! I want to know more about her even though she is as minor as you can get with a character!\\n\\n\r\n Either way, the plot is as close to perfect as you can get. Hell, for such a complex system of fantastic science (alchemy is not magic. Even the Catholic Church studied alchemy in the middle ages, look it up), I understood and believed everything so that when the characters did search and discuss the different forms of alchemy, I understood what they were saying and was never confused.\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict for FMAB is a 10/10 for masterpiece. It is a definite must watch and while fans who saw the 2003 version may dislike Brotherhood's early episodes, I've seen just as many fans love both equally so it's highly, highly recommended. It has something for everybody, is relatively free from fanservice and it's really fun and awesome in the end.\\n\\n\r\nPS: About FMAB being the greatest anime ever. Lets be realistic now, while it certainly is one of the best, no anime or manga that is truly great is better than another. FMAB is part of the pantheon of great anime, those anime that have alot of  influence on the world and are also very well written.  I won't name them but FMAB is definitely one of the greatest ever.",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is without any hesitation one of the most serious shounen series. Beside of the good fights it has a very good plot with lots of psychological aspects about life and power.\r\nThe story is about two brothers (Edward and Alphonse Elric) that know alchemy (to manipulate objects and transform one object into another. They are bounded by the basic law of alchemy: in order to gain something you have to sacrifice something of the same value). But they have made one horrible mistake in the past. They have done the taboo of alchemy, they have done alchemy with human lives. Trying to resurrectsomeone who is very precious to them. Alphonse (the younger brother) lost his entire body while Edward only lost his leg. Edward was able to replace the soul of his brother to an armor in the neighbourhood. But needed to sacrifice one of his arms for that. Then the two brothers joined the army in order to get their bodies back. From here the real story begins. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is unbelievable if you think about what they all handle. The main question of the story is \u201cwhat is the value of life?\u201d. This is the question where the protagonist had problems with during the whole series. Actually the main reason why that I find this is a very serious shonen is because the way they let you see politics. It is unbelievable how good and detailed it is. You see things like corruption, racism, religion, terrorism, people with a god complex, \u2026 . The way you see everybodys thoughts and however you can completely disagree with them you understand what they think and why. The way everybody from different sectors thinks about the value of life is probably one of the most interesting things about the serie since it is combined with all the other thoughs of them. What does people do to get power/succes?, how do people change once they get it? are some other interesting questions that will be answered as well. You can really make endless compares to history. Par example the way the regime attacks a certain religion is comparable with hitler\u2019s regime that attacked the jewish, the one from that religion that wanted revenge and became a terrorist is comparable with al qaida, ... . Thats why I think this serie explains politics even better than Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nThen I haven\u2019t even talked about the homunculi yet. There even more interesting than politics. It are creatures that thinks they are the evolution of mankind since they are kinda superior to humans. But the most interesting part is that they all have one emotion. Such as lust, envy, greedy, pride, \u2026 .It basically shows what these are and what people do if they're obsessed with that emotion.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings/endings are very good however the rest of the OST isn\u2019t that good or special. The art isn\u2019t anything special either. The characters are very good not that they are such special themselve but there just plenty of original and interesting ones. The amusement was okay but I wasn\u2019t that exciting while watching it in the first 40 episodes. The other 24 where good of excitement but again nothing special. The fights are very original with all that alchemy shit so these where very exciting to watch. In my opinion that serie had to do it with the story and didn\u2019t had anything too special for the rest however the story makes up for everything and makes it a absolutely a need to watch anime for every shounen lover. So don\u2019t think it is or I find this not worthful to watch just cause I gave it only a eight. Eight is considered as very good and I don\u2019t like to give all good shows tens cause then my favorites won\u2019t come out my list anymore.",

            "content": "This really is an outstanding piece of anime and artwork in every regard, the music score is exceptional as well and very memorable.  So MANY things in Brotherhood are all memorable that you really will not be able to just select one thing first, nor will you be able to pick just one item either.  This is an anime that is hitting on all cylinders and scoring on all marks, there is little else they could've done to make this better other than expanding the story and length to increase the character depth; but, to be honest that may have been overboard.\\n\\n\r\nDeeper characters are really the only area were they could've improved a bit, but not by much as all the main characters are hashed out very well.  It is in fact many of the evil characters that could've used some extra storytelling, but that is a hard thing to accomplish in almost any show for the bad guy(s).  Overall there is no real lack of background or dimensionality to these characters other than perhaps their personal or love relationships, which were always handled for the most part at an arm's length.  Winry and Ed's relationship out of all of them really could have used an extra bit of elbow grease, so that when the end finally arrives it really would've meant that much more to Ed, to THEM, and to US!  Adding in some fireworks for other characters would've been nice, but this WAS realistically a show based in a VERY heavily militaristic city and community.  So fraternization, much like army life in almost any country in the world, is basically forbidden until you are off-duty AND off base.  This is why Ed's relationship COULD'VE been helped as we follow them and they DO get off base and they DO go around Winry, specifically.  But, I'm complaining about nothing to be honest...the show is more than fine as it stands.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is wonderful and rich.  The combat especially is always great and for some reason, with this anime specifically, it has left a very unique mark on the anime landscape.  When I think of how the animation runs together and the battles there is no other anime I can think of that is remotely like it.  So far it IS a unique and one-of-kind creation.  It is definitely a anime series worth a re-watch and a re-watch after that!  It is that good and evokes so many great memories of adventure, danger, wonder, intrigue, and with that comes the fun of cheering Ed and Al on (and many of their compatriots as well)!  Getting people that have never watched this together to give it a run through is more than worth it so that they can do exactly what I just said in the sentence before and with that you can relive that experience vicariously through them; it really does make it almost just as fun as seeing it the first time...  \\n\\n\r\nBeyond the animation you have the wonderful music.  The music CANNOT be left out here...  It is just as important I truly believe as the characters, the story, the animation, and anything else that has gone into the production of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.  This will be some of the most memorable music you will ever listen to in anime.  You may find yourself when done with the series seriously considering buying all of the music for the series.  The orchestral music for the main portion of the show is wonderful and while I may not like all of the ending or opening theme songs, you will more than likely find a few you do like as Brotherhood will have a lot for you to pick from when all is said and done.  The music had to be mentioned in it's own right as a separate issue, as it's so well done it deserves a lot of merit and needs to be mentioned as a reason to watch the series as well.  It IS that good!\\n\\n\r\nBeyond everything I've mentioned, some small details that I should go ahead and say is that the English dubbed version of Brotherhood is more than worth your time.  Not only is all the voice acting done VERY well, but all of the miscellaneous noises have been changed as well as things that typically are not like small text on screen (though not having to do with dubbing, it does have to do with the overall \"English adaptation\" that has been created.  The English dubbing, plus the fact that they have gone to the trouble of replacing ALL of the text (everywhere!) to English as well shows the high level of commitment they had in making sure that not only did Japanese audiences get a great version, but so did English audiences!  I will be forever thankful for that as this is easily one of my most favorite anime--it just got so many things RIGHT!  The re-watchability of this anime is very high.  Not only because it's good, but to catch the small things you may have missed the first go around; especially, if you are not someone that grabs all of the more complicated details right off the bat as this show definitely has some, the farther into the show the more that will pop-up (and more for you to pay attention for IN THE PAST)...   \\n\\n\r\nThe story is epic, how else can I put it.  It is amazing how far you go from where you start and finally where you end at.  This IS an adventure; an adventure of two brothers that have suffered from a grievous wound, both mentally, emotionally, and physically...and to some extent it has even taken a toll on their souls...  We follow these brothers as they figure out how to repair this horrible damage they've inflicted upon themselves and in the process they make a lot of friends, they make a lot of enemies, they learn A LOT, and that simple promise they made to each other to heal each other and to free themselves of their self-made curse might be just enough to get them through anything.  They learn in the end what matters and what doesn't and they realize those that are evil simply just never learn that lesson.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 10/10.  The weakest areas I think are characters at 9/10; but trust me this isn't a big decrease, it's more that I wish they would have added more onto characters that were already there or spent even more time on specific development areas on the main characters (I always want more character back-story...).  The next negative is the art area at 9/10.  Again this isn't a big decrease and in certain areas, like combat, it doesn't apply as they've done a spectacular job here.  Really all they could have done is added more team members and gotten a bigger budget with a bigger studio/editing crew.  Without that I'm not exactly sure how they would hit 10/10.  BUT, they have far more positives than they ever could have in the negative department.  While I don't really like all the opening or ending thematic music for Brotherhood, the actual music for the show is beautiful and basically puts a large amount of the anime produced in the garbage bin when comparing music score.  If you want an idea of what I'm talking about, just head over to Youtube and do a search for FMA: Brotherhood OST music score (CD track; I think the one you buy has 84 tracks, I could be wrong though).  Then you can listen to a LARGE chunk of Brotherhood's music--it's worth your time. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy anime, you can watch the first few episodes of Brotherhood easily around on the net; either on Youtube or many other places, but try to give Brotherhood atleast till episode ten if for some reason you don't like it off the bat.  Brotherhood is a \"little\" slow at the start; by \"slow\" I mean it hasn't gotten into the \"swing\" of it's main story arc.  Once THAT starts up, that is when Brotherhood turns into a roller-coaster and you are stuck in the seat until the ride comes to a complete stop!  This is easily a show I recommend to get on Blu-Ray as a blind buy!  WHAT A RIDE!\\n\\n\r\nJust like a roller-coaster, you get right back in line, again, and again...",

            "content": "This is a short review of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. I have seen many of the episodes, but not all of them in order and do not consider this a proper judgement of the series.\r\nStory - 4: The story of Full Metal Alchemist is supposed to be about two tragic brothers going to search for the Philosopher's Stone that their father disappeared looking for. The laws of equivalent exchange are supposed to be really gruesome. Going out into the world and making discoveries is something really important to the Elric brothers. This impression was what made me love Full Metal Alchemist in the 2003 version.In Brotherhood, you do not get a big sense of any of this happening with the main characters because the first episodes that deal with these issues are terrible. They did this to save time, but it does not make sense considering that the beginning of an adventure is always the most important part to immersing yourself in the world.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, the majority of Brotherhood is based in creating its world while it somehow feels like just adding China to the equation made it a lot bigger. The oriental theme always feels disconnected from world-building and this was the same with Brotherhood even though it was detailed greatly and central to our two Asian characters. Ling was almost a decent character. It is definitely easy to like him, but his rather flat and plain character was simply hidden behind emotional storytelling cliches.\\n\\n\r\nWar seems far too encompassing in the story. It seems too mundane compared to what we should expect with alchemy. There are so few alchemy users that it is ridiculous and they do not know how to use their alchemy in new ways most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nToward the final battles of the series, everyone seems shallow and it would have been fine for most of the characters to die.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5: The art is good mainly because it is grounded in proper details and good lighting and such. The colors are done almost true to reality, which they were going for. The characters usually do not take up as much of the screen as your average anime and I felt that it was both effective and alienating. At worst, the environments are a bunch of empty, hallway-like rooms and darkness in much of the later parts of the anime. Cannon firing is over-used to make things look exciting. Expositions and waiting scenes are very common to allow for more cheaper art.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the stupid rectangle effect with things getting obliterated or disappearing. It is quite detailed, but also not effective to conveying anything. Another annoying effect is Edward's alchemy, which is always spraying electricity and gray pillars rising out of the ground.\\n\\n\r\nWith the openings, the art was always annoyingly cliche-looking and it did not vary between seasons. Not only were they animated in an annoying or stereotypical way, but they conceptually did not form any good themes. \\n\\n\r\nThe first ending almost worked. The drawings were done nicely, but it thematically was pretty stupid to show as a children's drawing because no kid would think to draw these things except the Megaman-esque platform jumping part. The other endings were drawn very annoyingly, much more so than the openings.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 4: People love stupid orchestral music. A lot of this music was made to stay in the background and it sounds very dull and monochromatic. I honestly thought that there might have been only 6 songs. There actually are probably six songs they reuse in every episode because I remember getting really annoyed at hearing a few songs that were supposed to be sinister, but just sounded idiotically simple. The music department was just bare bones.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the openings and endings, some of them could be considered the worst of all anime, but nobody would admit that. They all sound like Bleach or Naruto songs, but without half as many strong points. Anyway, \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound effects, they are rather comprehensive. I would have rated the sound a 2 if the sound effects were just average, but they are definitely a step above almost any anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4: The characters are not explored enough to give you a sense of attachment. It feels like the war is the entire story most of the time. However, the developed characters are amazing. The villains are pretty terrible. This new (or orignail) rendition of Scar was one of the few awful protagonists compared to the 2003 anime. There is also Alphonse, who supposed to made deeper just because he finds a love interest. And, Edward is just a hopeless character. He has the same personality almost the whole time despite any supposed developments. This is mainly because the comedy feels like the only time Al and Ed could have shown what their personalities are, but everyone knows how bad the comedy is here. They are simply mired in conflict after conflict without being able to loosen up in a genuine way.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the sins are pretty bad, even Greed and Envy who get the most development. They pretty much fight and do not represent themselves with their simple to write personality traits. All that defines them as characters is combat skills and maybe some grief over what they have been doing. The Father is without character except in his background. He is pretty much a stereotypical bad guy. The somewhat tragic past of Alphonse and Edward seems to be the only thing that is supposed to carry deep negative emotion in this show, and they blew that part of the story off.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are mismatched, making characters sound too stereotypical or too gruff (the Colonel definitely sounds too gruff) or just stupid (Lang and Greed to name two). However, I am basing it on an English dub and it is hard to really judge on voice acting because the Japanese could be loads better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7: Despite many, many faults, it is possible to get engaged in this show and love it to some extent. Unlike other shows where you might compromise your beliefs and see bad aspects as good, you are prone to gloss over the bad aspects of this show because it is very enjoyable at times. As mentioned earlier, the storytelling can beat out the bland characters, which is very much like a movie. Despite the anime openings being weak and extremely generic, they are action-packed enough that you will be bound to enjoy them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is still the terrible comedy which always falls flat (and would even without so much repetition of the same junk). There are still lengthy scenes that seem to be going over the same details again or showing seemingly the same scenes you saw in other flashbacks and expositions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5: I wish it could be lower considering how annoyed I was by this show.",

            "content": "Directed by Yasuhiro Irie and produced by studio BONES, \u2018Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\u2018 is a 64 episode adaptation of  Hiromu Arakawa\u2018s original manga and a tangential successor to 2003\u2019s \u2018Fullmetal Alchemist\u2018. Heralded by many to be one of the greatest anime of all time, \u2018Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\u2018 (hereupon referenced simply as \u2018Brotherhood\u2018) could be considered a \u2018rite of passage\u2019 into the depths of anime fandom and/or the anime \u2018sphere\u2019 in general by many an anime fan. Thus, three years following my traipse into the world of anime, I approached this beast tenuously and left with my emotions and opinions varied. Did I like \u2018Brotherhood\u2018? Yes,quite a lot in fact. Is it the greatest anime of all time? Not by a long shot. The following review will take into account the factors of story, animation, sound and characters, each component ultimately attributing to a final score. Note that this review is entirely subjective (thought it attempts on the whole to be as objective as possible) and I welcome  open discussion in the comments below\u2026\\n\\n\r\n[Story \u2013 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe initial story of 'Brotherhood' is by and large very simple: two brothers set out on a journey to fulfil their goal(s) and encounter many obstacles along the way. Indeed, everything that occurs during the course of the 64 episodes could be seen as 'yet another' obstacle preventing the Elric brothers from achieving their goals and I believe this is where 'Brotherhood's story shines: a typical shounen presents the viewer  with the main character and their goal(s), e.g. Naruto and his ambition to be Hokage, Luffy and his search for the One Piece, etc. A good or great  shounen presents the viewer with the latter whilst proffering a story that doesn't feel like a buffer and content that doesn't appear a preventative measure taken in order to elongate the shounen (an issue that to this day has prevented me from finishing 'Dragon Ball Z'). In this sense 'Brotherhood' is an astounding success: everything that occurs - every arc, every character introduction, every seemingly misplaced scene - contributes in some way to the shows larger, overarching story, blending into a whirlwind final set of episodes that leave the viewer in awe of the anime's scope and the writers vision. Coherence and a fulfilling culmination in a series longer than 50 episodes is a feat in and of itself, never mind the fact that said story is both gripping and enthralling. For 64 episodes, the viewer and the characters alike are left to follow a trail of breadcrumbs, minor story details that are just enough to keep the viewer satisfied till the next 'big' expository plot-point, leading to a conclusion that delivers on its promise of a full loaf (my apologies, time to stop with bread analogies...) and then some! Even the chemistry, physics and biology of the 'Brotherhood' world were interesting, alchemy being a well developed concept in its own right, bar a few 'it's an anime' misgivings...\\n\\n\r\nAll that taken into account, I suppose a question must then arise: why only an 8? 'Brotherhood' is 'deep', philosophical, waxes and wanes poetic and hell - it even resolves battle sequences in the 21 minutes within which they begin (I'm glaring at you, 'Dragon Ball Z'...)! But there are several issues - minor niggles - that mire an attempt at otherwise cohesive storytelling: the presentation of thematic issues, the inconsistent tone and a flat, uninspired ending. 'Show don't tell' is a literary technique employed to allow experience through subjective observation rather than objective exposition: one of the minor issues I had with 'Brotherhood' stemmed from it's presentation of it's thematic issues, it's almost dogmatic preaching of them and it's over reliance on a didactic formula, harbouring no trust in the audience to draw their own conclusions - an irksome 'flaw' that cropped up on occasion and left me rolling my eyes once too often. 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' was and is the epitome of 'show don't tell' done well and all too often 'Brotherhood', in spite of it's 17+ rating, falls into the rut of 'typical shounen' and speaks to its audience as though they are children, leaving an unsavoury taste once the initial digest in complete.\\n\\n\r\nMy second issue - and the most 'distasteful' - is that of the show's inconsistent tone. From the offset, 'Brotherhood' is dark and gritty and whilst humour on occasion is not at all unwelcome (and is often done well within the shows 64 episodes), the constant inundation of poorly timed 'jokes' and attempts at humour draws the audience out of any semblance of immersion they may once have had. For example - and a minor spoiler here for those of you who want to go in completely unspoiled - there is a female character in the show who, like the Elric brothers, has committed alchemical taboo. She loses her ability to have children and other organs as a result and during the course of the show - for comedic effect - constantly and consistently vomits blood, a running gag that is neither funny nor appropriate given that this happens only moments after her immersive 'back-story' is presented to the audience. This level of inconsistency is strange and spoils an otherwise totally immersive experience, again, leaving me only to roll my eyes as yet another serious moment is concluded with yet another clich\u00e9 gag... That said, the constant mocking of Mustang's inability to use fire alchemy when it rained was never unwelcome, poor wet matchstick that he was.\\n\\n\r\nMy final gripe - and it is a minor one - is that of the ending which is at once fulfilling and yet leaves something to be desired. I can't obviously divulge too much without meandering into spoiler territory, however I can say that - on a positive note - all of the major and minor plot points are tied up: nothing is really left to the imagination (minor romantic interests aside). My problem however, was its simplicity - a level of happiness that did not entirely befit the shows thematic aspirations. I'll leave it at that and to you, the viewers discretion to decide whether or not the ending was entirely satisfactory, but I digress...\\n\\n\r\n[Characters - 7.5/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another major selling point in 'Brotherhood' the quality and development of even some of the minor characters leaving me in amazement. Each character is more than a clich\u00e9 or a trope; the dynamics between them leaves a lasting impression on the audiences that causes the latter to care for each individual far more than in most anime, leading to a roller-coaster of thrills and frights as each character edges closer to and overcomes various threats, both seen and unseen. I think it's also important to note that characters do die in 'Brotherhood', that 'Game of Thrones', 'Attack on Titan'-esk quality that makes them so popular and so addictive. Even the various antagonists are developed enough that, when/if they die, the viewer is left feeling emotionally conflicted, contrary to the expected feelings of overwhelming satisfaction. I do feel however - and this is my only gripe, major though it is - that some characters are more developed than others (one word away from an 'Animal Farm' reference there...): characters who are developed to a greater extent in 2003's rendition are often times less so in 2009's adaptation and this unbalanced approach to character development has multiplex effects on an anime that would have otherwise flawless characters.\\n\\n\r\nTake the character Major General Olivier Mira Armstrong (a full title awarded here for emphasis): what purpose does she serve other than to be the 'bad-ass female'? She's angry, she's broody, she hates her wimpy brother...and that, dear viewers, is all the show has to offer from the good Major. Compare her to Mustang or even Winry and one begins to see that a character who is prevalent for at least most of the shows latter half pales in comparison to even the main characters love interest! Lust, whose character development truly pales in comparison to her 2003 counterpart, is relegated to the role of the mere and simple villain, a character development crime if I've ever seen one. The main villain(!) who is seen only fleetingly throughout the show till his back-story is fully divulged elicits no greater reaction than acknowledgement and at worst negligible sympathy, paling again in comparison to the shows other, 'minor', antagonists... It's a shame, really, one the deducted from my enjoyment of the show and one the forces me to give the shows characters a good, but borderline average rating... And don't even get me started of Alfonse and his good damn apple pie (which, might I add, we never see him eat!).\\n\\n\r\n[Animation - 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nIn any anime over 24 episodes there are going to be animation issues. Don't misunderstand me, 'Brotherhood's animation is at almost all times 'good', edging towards at the very least 'very good', but I was never truly impressed. Colours are often flat and uninteresting and character designs somewhat strange (e.g. Edward's telly-tubby-esk strand of hair and Mustang's overly-round head...) and on occasion the background details leave something to be desired. That said, 'Brotherhood's animation is almost always crisp and battle sequences are vibrant, detailed and enthralling - fundamental necessities when one considers that we are dealing with alchemy (i.e. magic). As the show progresses and the scale of battles increases, not only does the animation remain as detailed above, it actually increases in quality, giving those final battles the extra umph required to making them that much more interesting and that much more intense. There's not much more to be said of the animation other than that its quality stand on par with the shows quality - and there's not much more you can ask for from a shounen now, is there?\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest: a part from a few select tracks, I didn't entirely notice 'Brotherhood's soundtrack... It was satisfying and valuable, don't misunderstand what I'm saying, however, in moments without tension or on such an epic scale, 'Brotherhood's soundtrack becomes simply ambient noise. 'Sound' quality is of course one of the more difficult categories to rate as ones enjoyment of an anime's soundtrack is fundamentally and entirely subjective: my favourite opening was the first and my favourite ending was the fourth, however, that said, I've spoken with others who've watch this anime and whose opinions differed entirely from my own to both extremes. Ultimately, in my opinion, it was good, however I leave it for you, the reader, to decide whether or not you enjoy it. If at this point the story and characters alone are enough to interest you, then I suggest you go and watch 'Brotherhood' now; the soundtrack is complimentary and will only add to your enjoyment of the show. That said, it's not one that I would personally go out and buy...\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\n\u2018Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\u2018 is a great anime, one that anyone who calls themselves an anime \u2018fan\u2019 must watch at least once in their life and one that will be spoken about for years to come. A compelling and cohesive story, with excellent characters, impressive thematic breadth and crisp, clean animation that is pleasant to the eye, \u2018Brotherhood\u2018 excels as one of the greatest shounen offerings to date and \u2013 best of all \u2013 it has no filler! A miracle if I ever did see one. In all honesty, I\u2019d recommended \u2013 if you have the time/the patience \u2013 watching the original 2003 anime first, if only to see character development in characters who severely lacked it in this rendition. And to my overall enjoyment\u2026 Despite several flaws in the presentation of an otherwise wonderful story and lopsided character development\u2026 I loved almost every minute with this complicated and personable cast whose stories (bar a few\u2026) ended beautifully and whose presence is still felt, long after having finished the show \u2013 and if that\u2019s not the sign of a good anime, I don\u2019t know what is\u2026\\n\\n\r\n- Chris.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: This review is going to be more between both series.\r\nThis anime is one of the best series out there. I've seen a lot of other people's reviews and I'm constantly seeing the same pattern, which is that everyone is comparing Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to the first series, Fullmetal Alchemist. I'm here to break that pattern and say I love them both equally. I feel that one can't compare them, because both series are very different.\r\nStory:\r\nThe frist series story was great. I liked how although it used the same characters and the bases of the storyline, they created something very different from the manga. UsuallyI don't like when animes don't follow mangas, but the first series wasn't suppose to follow the manga and it took a totally different turn that was amazing in it's own way. For the brotherhood series (which went just like the manga), was also an amazing story. The brotherhood version focused more on the corruption in the world, while the first version still did as well, but more emotional. The first series made me cry more, because almost everything died in the series (while the second series I still cried, but got more pissed at all the corruption in their world). In other words, one isn't better than the other, because both series have their perks and fill in the gabs that each one had.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is great in both of them. Obviously the first version had an older art, and the brotherhood version's art was more crisp and vibrant (but that's just because one came out in 2003 while the other in 2009...big time leap).\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI like all the openings and endings in both series, because they all fit the arc that they are introduced in. All the sounds played during the episodes also fit the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI remeber hearing on one form that Ed and Al's relationship was stronger in the first series, but that's not true...in both series there put to similar and different situations that test there brotherhood. And without fail, those two always stick together. There bond is just as strong in both series. For other characters, some didn't exists in the first series that existed in brotherhood. Some characters were more important/less important in brotherhood than they were in the first series, which didn't effect either stories. In both series, one either hates a character, loves them, or has no opinion on...but it's mostly love or hate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOne series isn't better than the other, one was meant to go by the manga and one wasn't. Both stories were amazing, truthful, and brought tears to one's eyes. I love and appreciate both series, and I hope you do too. I suggest people to watch both  series (but to watch Fullmetal Alchemist then Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, because if you watch Brotherhood first you will just find yourself constantly critiquing how the first series doesn't follow the manga...so you won't enjoy the messages each series has to offer you.) I watched the first version when I was like seven years ago and I just finished Brotherhood, and not once did I compare.",

            "content": "I don't know what to say about this. I love this franchise so much. The manga and the first anime were the things that got me into Japanese animation. Hell, I'd even go as far to say it's the first time I've seen animation used for more serious storytelling. It had a big impact on me growing up, and I've seen both iterations of the series too many times. While I'd say watch the first anime before this one, if you wanna watch only one, go with brotherhood. Brotherhood has incredible animation, perfect pacing, a well woven story and great characters. However, the adaptation isn'tperfect. I don't like how brotherhood handles it's humor. It's not so much it cuts over a serious moment, it's more like it disrupts the story a little too much to do a gag that usually doesn't land. This isn't a problem for the first anime or the manga. I also found the first season to be pretty rough at adapting the stuff that was told in the first anime. It went by stuff too quickly and didn't handle things as elegantly as the first anime did, but it picks the hell up in the later seasons where it's telling newer stuff. Honestly those are my only two gripes and I dont think they ruin my overall enjoyment of the adaptation. It's one hell of a ride and I think anyone with an interest in anime should give this a shot.",

            "content": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood shows beautiful depth in its narrative as it depicts two brothers that are both morally compromised and broken, the story follows their redemption quest as well as their coming of age in a world that is truly flawed and not too dissimilar from our reality. \r\nwhat seemed as a slow start with the first few episodes quickly was abolished as you the viewer is sucked into a story of political corruption, world domination and endless sacrifice. FMAB essentially questions the true value of human life and the sheer cost and ramifications of sacrificing human souls. Hiromu Arakawa has created something truly inspiredby real life events, the connection to the first and second world war is prevalent as she depicts campaigns of carnage orchestrated by human military and organisations from our past, particularity since the anime's setting mirrors a country similar to 20th century Germany. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the heavy political undertones Ed and Alphonse (Al) resemble the light of hope in a world destined for damnation, they represent the potential of youth and the power of innocence and determination. Both of them are equally as serious as they are unique and hilarious. Ed is insecure and hot tempered but loyal as well as focused. Al is the opposite he resembles happiness and serenity he favours calm tactics to overcome enemies and achieve his goals. Essentially they are a metaphor for the lore of equivalent exchange, they are Ying and Yang, neither of them can exist without the other and that's what makes them and their journey so special and unique. \\n\\n\r\nAside from our protagonist's the supporting cast are truly suburb and most importantly likable. they all serve their purposes perfectly, whether it is the hope and determination that Col. Mustang shows, the loyalty of Major. Armstrong and Riza Hawkeye or the love and compassion Winry shows. These supporting characters along with the countless others have satisfying development and never feel underwhelming or worthless. \\n\\n\r\nEven the Villains are superb, Although the primary antagonists motives may seem a little black and white they are justified in the stories conclusion and what made me love the writing of this anime even more was how much damn empathy I felt for the villains, they had moments in the story where I utterly hated them, however, I always felt somewhat hollow and sad upon their departure, This is a rare feeling not many stories I follow capture, you truly realize that the villains are all missing something they want and that's where you feel empathy for them. \\n\\n\r\nTo round things up FMAB is a surprisingly heavy and dark journey, Sure the over the top and silly animated moments that are purely Japanese can feel out of place initially, but upon reflecting back they are what help to break up the seriousness of this anime bringing in needed moments of humor and they remind you this is a narrative that can not take itself so seriously when necessary.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a fantasy anime with hard magic systems great plot and character development this is a must watch, its dark shonen worth you time.\\n\\n\r\nI don't hand out 10/10 scores regularly and even though there are a few things a little bit off in this anime its overall execution is brilliant and worth a perfect score. Critically it would sit at a 9/10, however, this story left me feeling truly changed and for that it is a masterwork.",

            "content": "The description of \u201cMaster piece \u201c, this anime is perfect, almost flawless, I can\u00b4t  even remember a single time I doubt of anything of the action made by the MC, this anime has an excellent begging, an amazing plot and the most satisfactory ending ever. I always have problems with anime ending (well not all of them) but FMA is heart breaking in a good way. The correct amount of drama, the correct among of humor, just like life it\u2019s not an emotion at a time, it\u2019s a mix of emotions, fully entertainment piece of art.  This anime is one, if not thegreatest anime ever.   \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to point out is that this adaptation is true to the manga in everything, so I was really pleased with that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nAt least the first 20 episodes of the anime made me cry, I mean you have to make a really heart breaking story full of emotions to make an adult cry so easily, I was trying to be strong but I couldn\u2019t lol . Anyway the point is that the story is a solid, well made, well thing huge plot that start decades before the original story, which I love since now every anime has that formula where bad guys decide to control over the world and they do it like the next minute they decide it, in FMA it\u2019s clear that every goal (from good guys or bad guys) take a lot of effort, hard work and elaborate thinking/planning. \\n\\n\r\nThis story has everything, mysterious plan, military problems and corruption, amazing fight scenes\u2026 and all of this without feeling heavy.  An unpredictable Story full of plot-twists that link everything in the grand finale, leaving you a huge satisfaction!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 \\n\r\n(The strongest point of the series) \\n\r\n The whole FMA characters are really strong, full of emotions beings, here we talk about MC that their actions are based on the situation, sometimes they are sad, sometimes they are angry, sometimes they are really motivated, in other word Complex like human beings. \\n\r\nMost important they are not almighty, not even the bad guys, they have the powerfull side and their weak side, the character development is exquisite in this series. I really like that female characters are so strong and independent, clever and fast thinking, so good at fighting (Riza is so badass), in other words, as interesting as the male ones. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation is timeless, I re-watched FMA this year (2015) and found it better that a lot of animes of this year or last year, the fight sequences are fluid and remarkable, face expressions are one of the strong points of the anime.  Backgrounds are amazing and funny parts are cute also. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime has an outstanding soundtrack that make every episode better than it is, sad music, cool music and epic OP/ED that are impossible to forget. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWithout using cliffhangers, you will experience with this anime the need to watch next episode and the next one, and even is 64 episodes long, at the end will seem short. \\n\\n\r\nThe re watch value in FMA Brotherhood is super high, you will find it as refreshing and interesting as the first time, but I recommend to al at least wait a whole year. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to people who want to experience a deep emotional journey with characters that grow over time and unpredictable story that leave you a lesson at the end, I mean to everyone, no one should miss FMA ;) \\n\\n\r\nCons: you will find hard to find another anime that fill the void that FMA left hahaha \u2026 really, I have heard of so many people, as well as me, that rise their standards of anime after watching FMA Brotherhood. \\n\\n\r\nEnglish is not my native language so please ignore grammatical errors :3 \\n",

Then after a few years came the fullmetal alchemist brotherhood and i was really looking forward to it but damn i had no idea what i was getting my self into.\r\nThis series made me laugh out loud, cry and bring up pretty much every part of human emotion possible. The characters and story are pretty much flawless and there islittle to none loose ends. There isn't a \"stormy\" story curve as many series suffer from - where the intro - mid part or ending is to short , to long or rushed. The pace through the entire anime is good. The series does not suffer either from things like to slow riddles-to-answers rate or to fast story. Every single one of the characters are developed in a brilliant way, you will feel sorry for some, you will cry for others, you will get mad at many, and you will laugh with a bunch of them, one thing is for sure there is no boring character in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that was a major concern early on was that this show would be to childish and silly. Don't be deceived, it is very mature and some elements are even horrifying. This is not some kids show since it contains lots of violence.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe strongest element of this anime i feel its the story. Like i stated previously the story is amazing and it progresses with the right passe in order to keep you entertained and to make you want to watch more more! I give it a 10 which i truly believe that it deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is also great. Not much i need to say, i give it a 9\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound throughout the anime was simply amazing. I loved almost every single one of the openings and most of the endings, Plus the battle music was also good and it doesn't distract you from the actual battle. I give it a 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe second strongest element in FMA is the characters. I loved the all a 10+ here no question about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nYou will enjoy this anime there is no doubt about it. It doesnt matter if you are into this kind of anime or not, It simply is so amazing that you will like it nevertheless. 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I find this anime to be exceptional and i will give it the 10 that it deserves.\\n\\n\r\nPure Perfection. If you haven't already you should definitely give it a try! It completely changed my view about it anime since it was my first. I hope you enjoy it as much as i did :D\\n\\n",

For the classic story parts that became the backbone of the manga the representation is more accurate than the first series was, offering a literal different flavor on the same thing -- in some cases leading to better dialogue.  There is also a CLEAR throughline that thecreators are taking it up a notch from previous installments - the antagonist fights thus far (3 eps out when this was written) have had a very good feel to them and allowed a vivid color representation of a fun tale.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the other incarnations of this series, you can easily overlook any redundancies here and have a good time with this show.",

I really enjoy watching it, but there is just something that really disappoints me every time I watch another episode: The pacing is too damn fast!  The only thing they accomplished with this series is to tell the story of the manga as fast as they could...Like a heroine shot straight in the veins...\r\n I loved the first series: FMA. Even though the plot was different there were so many more moments that really captivated me emotionally! But I couldn't feel any of this in FMAB...They could easily have made 100 episodes without one single filler, but somehowthey chose to create a lite version of the manga... That's why I would rank FMA higher than FMAB...\\n\r\n Although I can't wait to know how the story ends (I'm currently at 51), I know that the \"magic\" that really captivated me has long been gone in this anime....\\n\\n\r\nSomehow I have a feeling that not a lot of people seem to have issues with the fast pacing, so it may be some little whinig of a veteran FMA fan :P",

            "content": "Have you ever seen that show where everything clicked? \r\nWhere it felt like that all of the puzzle pieces fit perfectly into place?\r\nWhere everything felt so elaborate and intelligently done that you can't help but shimmer in its shining glory?\r\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is that series, expanding on its original adaption with more action. more story, more characters and an ending that just gives off the feeling of a long journey coming to a close. Whether you agree with my opinion is up to you, but even though it currently sits as the best ranked anime, I feel the need to explain why I love thisseries so much.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one that, like many journey stories, sounds simple. Two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are searching for a Philosopher's Stone in an attempt to take their bodies back following a failed experiment to revive their mother. \\n\\n\r\nThis simple setup is all the story really needs to engage you, and from there, you watch as the show will continually introduce more characters, more world building, heavier plot elements, without ever deviating from that simple setup. \\n\r\nAs the show goes on it becomes more and more apparent in what everything is leading up to, and you're able to appreciate the show even more for themes of obsession, moving on, wondering if revenge is really worth it, human potential for creation or destruction, how science can benefit or harm the world and ultimately, working around the theme of Equivalent Exchange. \\n\r\nI would go into more but to avoid spoilers, let's just say these themes are expertly woven into the narrative so that it still keeps its core focus. They don't make aspects up on the spot, it feels like the story was planned to be this way from the start\\n\\n\r\nThe main power system, Alchemy, is very well explained in how intricate it is, how there are different types, different methods to it, what it means for different people and how it affects what happens in front of the Elric brothers.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does a great job of building suspense, although this element is not as strong as in the 2003 series. Still, the villains are intimidating to really make their presence known, and what they have in store for our heroes never failed to surprise me. You'll see plenty of twists and turns, but the show doesn't solely rely on that.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also comedy thrown into the mix, which occasionally distracts from the overall tone, but is often put in, basically rest spots separated from drama. These jokes tend to hit bull-eyes most of the time, can be creative while also tying well to the established personality of its cast, and since you aren't always expecting a joke, it makes it more surprising when you're slammed with a punchline.\\n\\n\r\nThe show follows the full story of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, in which the narrative had a lot more of a Shonen feel to it. This isn't a bad thing at all, as while the original was a more suspense-filled psychological show, this one is a Shonen in style and appropriately epic action, but you'll never feel like the narrative doesn't know how to get smart. The show dabbles in its mythos enough for viewers to sink their teeth into, but not so much to lose the audience in technical terms. It's an expertly crafted story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect that definitely improved over the last series was the artwork and animation. The original series already had fantastic artwork for 2003, with the style trying to replicate the manga in basics but still looking appealing. Every character didn't feel like the same design, even background ones looked different in some way. The action scenes were usually more limited to reflect the more psychological tone but were still pretty good. Studio BONES took Brotherhood's animation to a whole other level.  The Action scenes are consistently fantastic, with loads of detail put into every power, whether it be earth alchemy, lightning alchemy, Bradley's sword fighting, the untapped power of a transmutation circle,  or my personal favorite, Roy Mustang's Flame Alchemy. All of these powers flow beautifully into the action, and with the edition of Xing and Briggs to the narrative, there are even more standout designs to incorporate.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere was not a single opening or ending I disliked in this show. All of them perfectly replicated what was happening in the show at the time, and the background music is also solid. Not QUITE as good as 03 for some of the background OST, but the tracks very much pull their weight. The dub, seen by many as one of anime's best, is actually an overall improvement. Despite a few recastings, most of the original series cast returned for the reboot, and with the added energy and intensity offered from the source material, they get to showcase their talents better than ever before.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe best aspect of both Fullmetal Alchemist series was easily the characters. Despite their simple journey setup, both are incredibly character driven shows, introducing many characters and giving almost all of them an arc or relevance in the story at some point. Although some characters like Nina, Hughes, Lust and Izumi get less time here compared to the original 2003 series, most of the others either maintain their excellent characters such as the engaging and incredibly well resolved Elric brothers themselves, the dutiful/sisterly but with a tinge of vulnerability Riza Hawkeye, the incredibly buffed and pompous Alex Armstrong, the rough and energetic Winry Rockbell, and my obvious favorite Colonel Roy Mustang, for being both super awesome, and super professional, doing a lot of important maneuvering and achieving an excellent catharsis, yet still going higher. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it is true certain characters like Izumi, Lust and Hughes have less screentime to develop them than previously, many other characters get even better characterizations than before such as Scar, Kimblee, Greed, Bradley, Dr. Marcoh, and especially Hohenheim, who not only gets a full character arc in this series, but also ties directly into the scheme of the main villain, as opposed to being a non-character shown very briefly at the end of the previous series with little impact. The introduction of the country Xing and Fort Briggs adds even more characters to the mix. Ling Yao, despite not being the most lovable at first, became my eventual favorite among them for having a very fulfilling development arc. The villains too, despite being less personal than previously, still have interesting characterizations, intentions, and elaborate roles to play in this puzzle piece set up.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every character has an important role to play, with proper setup on who they are, why they are, and how they are. So many get their own arcs in the narrative that it adds a lot to the overall impact. Unlike the previous series, where a lot of the side arcs felt too periphery from the intended personal conflict, here, they add to a cohesive whole, which I think is the stronger approach. Overall, a fantastically quirky and memorable cast with captivating character depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjyoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis series did not have a dull moment. It continuously kept me engaged with a fantastic and brilliant story that never fails to disappoint, incredible animation, and many three dimensional characters. I highly recommend giving this series a watch, maybe even buying it as well. If for some reason you cannot watch 03, watch this one first but if you can, watch it second. Despite a rushed beginning, its more consistent style, scope, epicness and catharsis will hopefully satisfy.",

            "content": "As a manga, Fullmetal Alchemist was met with resounding popularity right from the start, and after only two years of it\u2019s ten year run, the demand for an anime adaptation was overwhelming. Studio Bones took up the production, but with the manga not even a quarter of the way finished, they were left with a pretty big lemon to deal with. Fortunately, they were able to make lemonade by writing an entirely new story using the material they were given. The resulting anime was an immediate success, among fans and critics alike, winding up on more than it\u2019s fair share of top ten lists sincethen. And yet, despite the fact that it was universally loved and critically acclaimed across the board, there was still heavy demand for a more faithful adaptation. Thus, in 2009, only one year away from the manga\u2019s end, Brotherhood was born.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an animation standpoint, this show was working with a relatively low budget. This is nothing new, of course... Japanese animation has always used a lower frame rate than American animation, and often look cheaper as a result. Low budgets are fairly common, but what really differentiates is how different shows manage their budgets. By using key frames, speed lines and other useful tricks, you can cut corners where it won\u2019t be noticed, and save your money for the moments that need to move more fluidly. If you do this well, most audiences will never notice the difference. The original series was incredibly good at this, but unfortunately, Brotherhood is not. The key frames are a lot more blatant, as frozen heads can move their lips for several seconds at a time while people in the background just sort of freeze into bluish blobs.\\n\\n\r\nI rarely ever complain about an anime\u2018s artwork, as it\u2019s rarely ever a problem for me, but it has to be said... Brotherhood\u2019s artwork is lazy. It is plagued by choppy, jagged outlines. You may not notice it in far shots, but whenever any character has a close-up, it can\u2019t be avoided. The only exception, that I\u2019ve seen, is with it\u2019s openings.\\n\\n\r\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of openings, me gusta.  They are all spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the English dub, let\u2019s keep this brief. It is every bit as good as the original\u2019s. There are a few changes made, but none of them are bad, and yes, Maxey Whitehead deserves to have a statue built in her honor.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with all that out of the way, let\u2019s talk about what really matters... The story.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first decided to try out this series, a friend of mine warned me that the first few episodes were basically a rehash of the material from the first anime. What she failed to mention is that by a few episodes, she meant the first thirteen, and by rehash, she basically meant cliff notes. Brotherhood gets off to a horrible start, pushing out a pointless Ice-Alchemist episode purely for the sake of fan-service before moving onto the rest of the rushed material. 26 episodes are crammed into thirteen episodes, and by god it feels like it. The pacing is jarringly terrible, the stories are rushed, we get barely any background material devoted to the Elric brothers\u2019 childhood, and key moments of their past are told to us rather than shown to us.\\n\\n\r\nExample:  Remember how a certain piece of Winry\u2019s backstory was revealed to us in FMA? We opened on Winry, as a child, crying her eyes out at the table while taking her anger out on the boys. Not only were her actions genuinely and believably child like, but it gave serious insight into Pinako\u2019s distaste for the military, and foreshadowed the fate of Trisha Elric. How was this key plot point revealed in Brotherhood? Winry sat next to Hawkeye and told her about it. No emotional impact, just exposition. And that\u2019s just one example. Show, don\u2019t tell, people. This is basic stuff here.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems with the anime is shown right off the bat during these episodes, and never really goes away. From a dramatic standpoint, Brotherhood suffers greatly at the hands of it\u2019s own poorly timed gag humor. Some of the most deep, emotional moments of the series get their serious tone blown away by ugly, unfunny super-deformed moments. Even when the boys are lying on the ground in pieces after an encounter with Scar, they still can\u2019t escape this.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, once this little catch-up session is over, the story starts to get a lot better. The pacing finally becomes bearable, as bold new ideas... At least they\u2019re new to those of us who haven\u2019t read that far into the manga... Are introduced. Familiar characters like Kimblee, Scar and Dr. Marco wear out their welcome, but at the same time, a flurry of compelling characters are introduced. Ling Yao, Lan Fan, and May Chang are outstanding, and their arrival placed a stamp of individuality on the show that it frankly didn\u2019t have until then. We\u2019re introduced to the country of Xing and the practice of alkahestry, two concepts that never stop being interesting.\\n\\n\r\nCertain characters sorely missed, but not so much that we can\u2019t appreciate the presence of Olivier Armstrong, one of the most captivating characters in the entire franchise. A small selection of characters are actually handled and developed better than they were in the original show, with a few examples being Riza Hawkeye and Envy. Some interesting ideas are explored through Gluttony, but I still miss his puppy-dog loyalty to Lust.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a high point that goes on for a very long time.  To be honest, for a very long stretch of episodes in the middle, I was seriously considering giving this series a solid 8, but then there's the ending... An ending went so far over the top with it's sickeningly happy Disney resolutions that I had to knock it down a point.  I can't really talk about it without giving away spoilers, but this show goes so far to have all good guys win and all bad guys lose that some of the resolutions are just insultingly stupid.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series was quite disappointing. The first thing anybody says to promote it is that it's faithful to the original manga, but that often feels like more of a restriction than an advantage. With fans world-wide clamoring about it being a masterpiece, I had high expectations for it. It\u2019s not better... Not by a long shot. It never reaches the depth or complexity of the original, but as a stand-alone, it\u2019s still a pretty decent show. It\u2019s got some serious, jarring flaws, but it still brings to life an exciting fantasy adventure that fans of all ages can enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nI give Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood a 7/10.",

            "content": "Through heartache and hope, two brothers set out to achieve the impossible and reverse an event that seems futile to take back. Through equivalent exchange, something of equal value must always be lost. That is the rule of alchemy. \r\nWords cannot describe what I just watched. I can see why it's still number one after all these years. I've seen some impressive plots, but this has to be the top of the line, the best of the best, it doesn't get better than this. It only took me around a week to complete both series, but I can't describe in words how inspiring and heartwarmingthis story was. \\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\n I know for a fact a manga plot lines are super long and can be as long as 600+ chapters, but this plot, from watching the anime, was the perfect length. The pace flowed perfectly throughout each episode, adding both drama, suspense, comedy, and even some hidden romance. The theme was clearly stated at the beginning as \"Brotherhood\", of course, but also love, family, friendship, acceptance, and even sacrifice. There were no fillers unlike the original, and everything connected perfectly like a puzzle piece. I found no cliche bits, and felt they established the \"normal\" very early on this time. I felt very satisfied with the ending, and agree it was a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae with milk on the side! \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThere are many different styles throughout the anime/manga world, and each artist has their own unique style, but this art work felt more original than any other anime I've seen. There were no giant anime eyes or rainbow hair. I got the feeling of realism with the simple look. And even throughout the anime, I found the character's appearances changed throughout the 64 episodes, then they would with another anime with over 300 episodes. Even Al changed with his little hair piece was enough.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I also liked about the art was the background. I've only seen a few anime shows where the animator will put effort into a background instead of throwing in one that looks like a crappy painting. FMA Brotherhood had detail, composition, and realism. The world was created perfectly and beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with music. Every scene, every event, was filled with the most beautiful music. It fit so well with every single thing that happened. The angst, the dramatic, the suspenseful, happy, sad, and every other moments created such a great emotion to each episode, and they had a tune for each unique one. I felt the tension flow through my veins every time some kind of music came on. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects hit the ball right out of the park as well. The booming, the rain, the explosions, even the flickering of a small fire, it all tied in perfectly to set the mood. \\n\\n\r\nNow voice of each character. I'm a dubbed person, because one, I'm constantly multitask-er, so subbed doesn't work for me as much. I don't care if subbed is better, because I'm pretty sure I would've gotten the same experience. But it doesn't matter, because compared to the original dubbed, this one sounded the same. I do think Vic did a better job on this one then the last because he knew the character more the second time around. Maxey was perfect for Al, even though at time I could hear a girlish tone, but it did set the character very well. And the rest of them, each character had a distinct voice and attitude. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nTwo words: No stereotypes. One of my biggest pet peeves when I watch an anime series is stereotypical characters. And this series had none. The creator of this story did very well on making sure the characters were original as ever. The character development, as well, was so clearly made. All the characters grew up (for Ed, literally), and accepted what was happening, what had happened, and knew their goals and how they had to change to achieve them.  \\n\\n\r\nLoved the humour added in each character as well...like Ed's hatred of milk and being called short. As well as the strong willed and toughness for Ed and Al. Anything is possible even if you have two auto mail limbs or become a soul in a large suit of armour. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, words cannot describe the enjoyment I felt when I watched this. There was a reason why I finished both in little over a week. No anime can ever level up to the amount of happiness I am with this anime. I cried, laughed, got angry, and clapped at the very end. \\n\\n\r\nThis story has led up to it's reputation and popularity years after the completion, and I doubt it'll be going down anytime soon.  I recommend it to anyone who...heck just watch it if you haven't seen it. You'll be crazy if you haven't.",

Not to mention the stunning animation that is pretty incomparable to many other anime with its crisp and polished fighting scenes all well choreographed and meaningful in some way. The OST is beautiful (*plays* 'Requiem for the Brigadier General') and fits in with every mood portrayed in every scene and the opening and ending songs were all varied and amazing. Talking about sound, voice acting is near perfect by the Japanese cast.\\n\\n\r\nI found no episode to be boring whatsoever and even the filler episode had me reflect on previous episodes that I have partly forgotten since this is a long ass anime but in those 64 episodes, I weren't bored? Yep, this is an anime that I have rated to be absolutely perfect and if you have not watched this anime yet, I suggest you watch it right now in 1080p or higher because it's totally worth your time and stop yourself from searching this anime on google and avoid spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy the show and have some fun because this is an experience you're about to ride on the biggest emotionally and enjoyable rollercoaster of your entire life. This anime is very popular and high rated for a very good reason and take my review in consideration too, there's no reason for you to hesitate if you're looking for the greatest TV show of all time. \\n\\n\r\nThank you.\\n\r\ni miss this show already",

I do not consider myself to be a critic in any way, and I just rate my series depending on how much I appreciate them. Just so you know. I have watched hundreds of anime series ever since I was a kid, starting with Dragon Ball Z all the way up to (to date Aug 25th, 2017) Owarimonogatari second season (which is getting extremely high ratings, too!). \r\nBetween those two shows I have seen what manypeople consider to be the elite series ever (Evangelion, Death Note, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, Gintama, Attack on Titan and so forth). Furthermore, I have seen excellent, great, good, decent, and bad shows too, so I do consider myself to have some kind of experience in measuring the greatness of series. This is why, with my experience, I consider Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to be the best show that I have seen as of today.\\n\\n\r\nI have my favorite shows that I absolutely love and this show is not on that list. But I know those, within their greatness, have their flaws. And although Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not perfect, I have to admit that nothing has come closer to perfection quite like it. \\n\\n\r\nThis show made me understand that regardless of one's bias, greatness has to be applauded like it should. \\n\\n\r\nEvery single aspect of it was perfectly executed: story, characters, animation (Wrath's fighting always looked sick), themes, writing, soundtracks, openings, endings, creativity, depth, heck even the previews were perfectly narrated to match the tension of each episode. Lead role is excellent, supporting characters are as good as (probably better) most main characters from other series. The way the story unfolds and ends is genius, and the diversity that this series brings allows each viewer to take different messages from it, which is why we fans (at least I!) watch. \\n\\n\r\nOpening/Ending theme songs are top class, specially during the episodes leading to the \"Promised Day\" (this is no spoiler, btw) where you feel like you want to just get inside the TV screen and support whoever it is you like (just listen to \"Rain\" during those episodes, and you will see what I'm talking about). \\n\\n\r\nThe show had an ending that most people would not expect while watching the series, however, it felt just perfect again. It shut the door to an inspiring, thrilling, long, agonizing, fun, and perfectly executed story, that, until you've seen it, you have not seen it all. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the best anime series that I have seen. \\n\\n\r\nScore: The Anime Standard. \\n\r\n08/25/2017",

But I didn't give it a perfect score because I find it clich\u00e8-ish for a story to begin because of a sad/tragic experience.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nThe art meets the standard quality of the animes of that time. The fights are usually exciting. I love the characters' design but I didn't appreciate the mangaka's style. Maybe just my personal taste\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nVoice acting is excellent. The voice actors fit their characters. Roy's and Ed's are just heh!\\n\r\nThe music is amazing. To start it off, YUI-Again and Tsunaida te are some of my favorites. But every op and ed are really likeable even though some needs time. Even the most hated op (golden time lover I think). The themes are awesome. They will really leave an impact to you, most of the time I had goosebumps (more goosebumps, for some reason, now that I'm rewatching it). Lapis philosophorum, Trisha's and Resembool's lullaby, and the main theme are the best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9\\n\r\nCharacter development and hardships are shown and explained perfectly. For example, a mass murderer full of hatred is now trying his best to reform the country without a war or a revolution. The relationship between the brothers is so strong. Seeing for the first time, I thought the main female would be an annoying and weak girl; I was wrong. Okay, she cried and was weak a couple of times but because of that she stood up, became Ed, Al and many other people could rely on. Villains did a great job pissing me off except Lust, I loved her.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment:10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime not only enjoyed but adored it. Good thing I watched it long after my cousin recommended it, because I was young and I'm sure i'm not gonna understand a thing (Having a sort of mystery genre). The negative thing is I watched the 1st series and it became a kind of spoiler at beginning. And I missed the Kyoudai soundtrack. \\n\r\n---------- Spoilers-------\\n\\n\r\nBest scenes I totally enjoyed: the way they passed the note for the promised day, hawkeye and Roy's communications, main protagonist's last transmutation and many others that if I were to list it, Boom. Ps. The death of those two q.q\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"You cannot gain anything without sacrificing something. In this world it's called Equivalent exchange.\"\r\nWhen I first learned that the Brotherhood is being prepared I felt chills. The first series was mostly great, with some weaker elements. The epicness spilled from it no matter which approach you took. However, what really got me into the topic of Elric brothers was not the anime, but the manga. The manga which, to some extend, changed the way I perceive things today. The manga which taught me a lot about life, friendship, priorities. The manga which showed that if you wish for something strong enough - you will receiveit, albeit after a long and harsh journey. After all, nothing in this world comes without a price. Equivalent exchange works there indefinitely. \\n\r\nOk, I may sound like a damn brat at the moment, corellating human's life to a fabricated reality. Whatever. I \\n\r\nalways believed that animes have this something that we lack in our everyday struggle - they name things, without second thought, no questions asked.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Elric brothers is well known to about everyone who's interested in anime. The siblings lose their limbs and bodies due to a foolish act of human transmutation. From this moment, Ed with automail leg and arm and his younger brother Al, an armor with soul attached to it, go on a long and depriving journey to retrieve what they lost and are afraid will never grasp back. As simple as it sounds, it can be quite amusing.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough to some it may appear cliche, the story in FMA:B is in fact quite original. First and foremost it mixes many completely various characters in several settings. Those characters somehow resemble their homeplaces in terms of nature, feelings and appearance so when the things go hectic and the Elrics travel from one place to another it's not a hassle to distinguish who doesn't really fit the image. Thus we have Ishbalans, Northerners (Briggs), Southerners (Rush Valley), Westerners in Liore and people from Central. The power of the setting is what makes the place differ completely one from the other. People are different and so are their homes, beliefs, approaches to life. It's all there to entertain you, sure, but if you look deep enough all those people exist for the sole purpouse of making the story believable and the Elrics progress enough to overcome their childish beliefs, behaviors and trusts for something that lays far beyond - A Truth. \"A\" is used here for a reason. In FMA:B 'Truth' exists in everyone and it's individual for all people. There's no universal truth, you create your own with your blood, sweat and tears.\\n\r\nBeyond that is the approach to the siblings, the way  those two change and evolve into the people who will overthrow their own goal for a common one - the protection of Amestris. It is also frightening when you notice how much they had to sacrifice to reach to that final moment, the moment of glory, retribution, stepping back and unfolding their whole way to that very moment. Throughout the story they learn that All is the World, but the World consists of singularities, of humans; thus All is One, One is All. It's a masterpiece in its own kind to see how this universal idea reflects all the decisions that the brothers make during the show. Some will lead to further complications and some will become tragic in the end.\\n\r\nA great deal of epicness is ensured by splendid character development in the series. It is refreshing to see how much people progress in this show. Humans are cunning, symphatetic, intelligent and dumb. They're evil and good, direct and retracted, they tell lies and are truthful to their bones. They Envy, they are Greedy but also Sloth and driven by Lust. Their Gluttony for power gives birth to overthrowing Wrath if something goes wrong, but in the end it is their Pride that keeps them going. What about the others? Those perfect? Those who deprived themselves of these Seven Sins? Are they better, perfect? God a-like? Or maybe they are a puny little entities hidden within their own flasks longing for escape, freedom.\\n\r\nThe creation of Elrics is perfect. They are like the two sides of the same coin: Ed is decisive, outgoing and operative, Al is his counterpart - depending, self-aware and perhaps to impressionable. Other characters shine too: Alex is as entertaining as always, Mustang as cunning as he could be and kindness flowing from Hawkeye or Winry is sometimes just too much. You will cry many times during the show, it's a given.\\n\\n\r\nART.\\n\\n\r\nArt is nearly perfect. The animation is splendid, with very little flaws, very little recaps and no stupid mistakes. The way the world is potrayed stands out practically all the time. On one hand we have beatifully painted backgrounds, with delicate fresque and detailed texture which endulge one's mind to further concentration. Places are different, stunning, memorable. The very same idea sticks to the presentation of characters. There's no denying that women are somehow neglected in the show, but this is due to the manga artist and his style, not the anime itself. It simply follows the pattern as accurately as possible. On the other hand, hardly will you see a situation when recognising a particular character is impossible due to a bad drawing. In this show it does not happen. \\n\r\nPeriod.\\n\\n\r\nAll the details of using alchemy, ground reformation, CGI effects are simply perfect and I cannot imagine what the show would be like without them. Rarely will you notice that something is wrong or our of ordinary and this becomes even more important by the end of the show, because the level of animation does not drop! Not one bit! It's constant throughout all 64 episodes. Even today it's astounding, escpecially for such long show.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and audio is something I would write an entire book about if I had time and means to do so. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful Japanese creations in the history of the anime market. It can be depicted by: when it is time to cry, go cry, when you laugh, go laugh and when there's fighting, well, go kick ass! Nothing is out of place, nothing is missing. The background, most of the time, is very lyrical. There are moments when you would stop with Ed and Al for a second to contemplate, but the action will not let you. Music is such a strong reinforcement in FMA:B, that sometimes a scene when there's a deafening silence leaves no quarter and distinguishes among many other. Nothing bad will I say about opening and ending sequences - those are splendid. \"Let it out\", \"Period\", \"Rain\" - are only a few examples of how great the soundtrack is. I didn't like how the producers included major spoilers in those sequences though, but that's an entirely different thing altogether.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu's work also requires a few words of praise - people voice acting Ed and Al are one of the best creations I have ever seen in anime. The same goes for General Armstrong and Roy Mustang. Greed/Lin has also had some great voice acting as well as all the Homonculi and 'Our Father'. All in all, one of the very best in the industry. Great job altogether. At this point it is worth mentioning that the moment when Ed shouts 'You idiot!' in final but one episode is the scene when not one 100% man will shed some tears.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT.\\n\\n\r\nSome may say that it's fraud because I do not mention alchemy in this review. Well, it is because most of know what alchemy in FMA series is, and besides that, alchemy plays only the second role in FMA:B. Sure, it is important (especially Alkahestry) plotwise, but as you will reach the end of the show you will learn how insignificant it was throughout the whole series from the characters' point of view.\\n\r\nBut hey, this was supposed to be enjoyment section... Although, most of you have already noticed that I described how enjoyable the series is/was in the STORY segment. I watched the series three times so far and I'm sure that the fourth and fifth will come about in the nearest future. No matter how many times you watch the series you will enjoy it even more than before, and the comedy parts never get old!\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS.\\n\\n\r\nAt first I did not really like the story in the original FMA. It was dumb, slow paced, sometimes much too self-centered. FMA:B is a greater alternative story. It uses the same characters in the same settings, adds something from itself, makes a great use of fabulous comedy elements to create a complete anime which will definitely transcend its time. The FMA, despite all flaws, did overthrow much of the industry. People lowed Ed and Al from the moment they learned their back story. It is no different with this title. Some reluctant will say, that sometimes manga does things in a better manner than the anime. OK, their right to complain. I, having watched so many titles in my life, have no words of complain in this one. FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is by far the best anime show that has been released and I assume nothing will change that in the upcoming months. In my personal list it overtook shows like NGE, RaXhephon or Rurouni Kenshin: Romantan.\\n\\n\r\nA week out of your life well-spent.\\n\\n\r\n\"All is One. One is All!\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hiromu Arakawa's Fullmetal Alchemist is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. It is larger than life yet deeply personal. It touches on loss, the meaning of life, cultural diversity, the dangers of science, Nazism, the Iraq war, and the list goes on. Arakawa seamlessly weaves so coherent a story from such divergent threads that it mirrors the skill of a first-rate novelist. She is a brilliant world-builder and her characters are exceptional.\r\nFor instance, Arakawa's representation of women breaks with convention. There are strong, independent women like Izumi Curtis, Riza Hawkeyes, and Olivia Armstrong. These characters are complex and unique, as one cannotice from each character's distinct source of independence \u2013 confidence (Izumi), resolve (Hawkeyes), and leadership (Armstrong). There are tenderhearted mothers like Gracia Hughes and Trisha Elric; and those who cannot be captured by such umbrella terms like Winry Rockbell, Maria Ross, and May Chang. I suppose it's only natural for Japan's most successful female mangaka to embody such an ambitious project \u2013 to portray the totality of womanhood: th\u00e8se, antith\u00e8se, et synth\u00e8se. Furthermore, she gives plenty of time and space to include the backstory of every character. None of them has an uninteresting backstory and they all somehow play key roles in this mysterious world.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the presence of alchemy, the world of Fullmetal Alchemist is very similar to ours. It is full of racism, hatred, war, greed, love, compassion, and courage. Alchemy is used as a metaphor for power, knowledge, and science. It seems magical at first, but one soon realizes that its rules cannot be bended much like the laws of nature. Even though they have such a powerful tool, we keep encountering those who wish to go beyond its limits. Alchemy is, arguably, a reflection of our weakness. As the philosopher Julian Savulescu noted, humans are much better at solving abstract problems than learning how to work together as a whole. Edward's final decision in the show alludes to Arakawa's message that we do not need to rely on knowledge and science to lead a meaningful life. Instead, we need to accept the human condition. Similar to Aristotle's notion of the Good Life, Ed and Al choose to pursue virtues like friendship, altruism, humility, and compassion. Humanity was not meant to know everything, and the human condition bids us to focus on the Good rather than the Truth. It appears that Arakawa is a pragmatist\u2013 knowledge is useful insofar as it is practical.\\n\\n\r\nThe anim\u00e9-adaptation successfully captures the strengths of its illustrious source through fast-pace, quality animation, and stellar opening and ending themes. This anim\u00e9 is one of my favorites, and I absolutely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good work of art.",

I literally loved this anime, first time when I went to watch it I dropped it because I felt it isn't anything special, but trust me all the sad and happy heart fullfilling emotions make you want to marathon it. I finished it in 4 daysand I can officially say it's in my top 3 animes. I can't say too much because it will somewhat spoil the anime, but story is around Edward and Alphonse who are brothers, they go on through their adventure fighting many villians who are all creative and trust me I even liked some of the villians as they all had creative and beautiful back story and development. Story has sweet romance aswell, I would've literally killed for a kiss at the end atleast but oh well, still trust me you will love it, it will make you blush :3. It has tons of comedy moments aswell and heart breaking moments aswell, in the end I'm going to rate the story/plot of this anime as outsanding 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is quite decent, it isn't anything outstanding and unique but is really nice, pretty well done effects and nicely made characters and surroundings. I will rate it 8/10, as it's very good but nothing that makes your mouth go WOW.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Characters all have lovable sounds that really go with their art and all the moments are very nicely acted, first opening scene soundtrack literally is Amazing for me, others are nice aswell too. Sounds of suroundings and effects are very nicely done aswell, in the end I'll rate it 9/10 because it isn't perfect as story is for me but is really well made.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I loved all the characters, not even one was boring, all unique well acted,good art, nice character development and really nice back stories, making all main/supporting characters feel real and having their own persona in the whole story, making everyone of them like puzzle part of a puzzle. I gotta rate 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I can't say too much, but all the sad/happy/romantic/badass/rage moments all were entertaining, story never got repetative and it only evolved into a better and better show, I never even once got bored. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all that I have to say my score has to be 10/10, I suggest everyone to watch it, it isn't perfect, no anime is perfect but truly, it is one of the best and deserves it's spot on MAL for a reason. Longest show I ever watched that  I loved so much and never got bored. FMA:B is love, FMA:B is life. lel, hopefully this review will help some of you and you will find this anime as great as I did.\\n\\n\r\nP.S sorry for spelling mistakes and such, I'm on phone :r see ya all",

However, the interesting thing is that the story develops in a spectacular way, creating several interesting mysteries, including involving politics. The character development is great.All the characters are developed in a unique and exciting way, so much so that the maturation not only of personality but also of ideals is perceived, which makes us feel appreciated by the majority. The fights and animation are spectacular. The ending is also fantastic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a great journey. An amazing history with shocking plot twists. There is no coiling between arcs and loose ends. Therefore, It can be said that FMAB is perfect, an anime highly recommended for everyone. \\n\\n",

Not only Within the anime itself, but also in the extra official media like the OST, the OVAs, and some of the dvd extras (like the outtakes from the dub, which continues to be one of the funniest officially made anime videos I've seen). The anime itself is engaging and rewarding, meaning it builds up suspense or mystery in one episode and delivers on it really well in the next. The characters feel really human and one of my favorite things is that they age, not only mentally, but physically aswell. It's clear by the end of this series they they are not the same people that the story started with. The world building is great, but because the laws of alchemy aren't known too well many things can be written off as being because of it, which I would say is the shows biggest flaw. The soundtrack is phenomenal and has many recognizable melodies along with masterfully composed tracks to set the mood really well. It also has my favorite anime opening of all time (OP 1).",

            "content": "I have watched the original FMA series and I have to say this reboot of the 2003 FullMetal Alchemist is much better than its predecessor. The story takes place in a world where a select few individuals are blessed with the power of Alchemy : The power to deconstruct and reconstruct matter. The story follows 2 brother Edward and Alphonse Elric who stumbled across the power of alchemy. After their mother's death, they try to use their power to bring her back since she was their only family. Their attempt in human transmutation(resurrection) was a failure resulting in Edward losing his right hand and leftleg while Alphonse losing his body. The two set out on a journey to find a Philosopher's Stone : an object that can overcome the rules of Alchemy, which will help them restore their bodies.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing more to say because this show is a must watch. Everything is just perfect. The first opening of the anime is considered to be one of the best openings ever made.\\n",

            "content": "Story: THe story of FMA is probably one of the most fleshed-out and fluid stories I've come across. The story of two brothers trying to regain their lost bodies in a world where alchemy is one of the greatest scientific methods is made both very creative and believable. \r\nArt: The original art of the manga is a style that is made very original from the first page, and that style is put into animation very well. The colors and designs all look great, and the action and motion is all a great complement to Bones. If there's one gripe I have, it's that the super-deformedfaces and poses the characters make in Brotherhood are inferior to the funny reactions they made in the first series, but that's all water under the bridge.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is good and all, but when asked about sound for this series, I think of the dub, and this dub has all of the trademark Funimation greatness. All of the actors give such good performances as their respective characters that if I were to run into these characters walking down the street, they would sound exactly like this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I love how the range of characters represent the highs and lows of humanity, and how they can actually represent real people. Also, I was much more satisfied with the way the characters ended up in Brotherhood than in the first series, since the first series didn't end on a particularly happy note.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: After completing a couple of episodes, I would wait and chew my nails to the bone for Funimation to release the next batch of episodes, and once I'd watch those, I'd do the same thing until the next batch was released.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This isn't a series to be missed by anyone. Great characters, fantastic setting, flawless art, a fantastic dub (in case you're a dub hater, disregard that part) and just enough for anyone to enjoy. For full enjoyment of this show, I'd recommend seeing the first series before this one, as it handles some parts better than Brotherhood, but in the end, both are stellar series.",

            "content": "I thought that after watching the first Full Metal Alchemist series nothing could surpass it's greatness but then after watching Brotherhood there were very different thoughts buzzing about my mind!\r\n~Animation~\r\nI liked this anime because it follows the manga more closely than the first FMA series. The animation in this series far surpassed the previous series as well. The shading and deep colors added a rich feel to the environments.\r\n~Sound~\r\nWhile I personally am not a fan of dubbed anime, the dubbing on this was alright. I watched most of it in Japanese, and Paku Romi Sensei's performance as Edward was one of the most passionate thatI've heard. I don't want to give anything away but if you're near the end of the series I would encourage you to watch in Japanese ^.- !!\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\r\nLemme just address the elephant in the room: Greed. I LOVE Greed! There is not much I can give away about it but let's just say you'll be seeing a lot of him ^.^. The characters have a lot of added depth from the first FMA series and it is definitely quite the task keeping up with all of their back stories (though this is a welcome task ^.~ ). All of the favourites from the first series are back for this action! I know my youngest is partial to Gluttony and her sister is a Scar fangirl.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\r\nThis is where the series shines through. There were many points during the series where I had to pause the DVD to grab tissues. Those who have seen the first FMA series could guess how sad the loss of a beloved character can be. Besides the heartbreaking stuff the story delves deep in to the workings of alchemy in ways that the first series didn't come close to emulating. The series climax is action packed and emotionally charged (might I remind you to watch this in Japanese again? ^-^ ) like the first series but the end to this series is on a more epic scale.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this series really did feel rewarding for me, as I watched the characters develop, I felt like I was becoming friends with them and was sharing in their triumphs and folleys. I felt like I had been on an adventure myself by the time I was through, and if you have yet to see this I wish you well on your adventure!",

Body Edward (brother) lost hands and legs, in Conducting human transmutation and Alphonse (younger brother) so Edward loses his sister Spirit Entering into armor, including the story of their struggle is not easy to Edwardwho had the title of Alchemy Youngest Countries must work as a military dog under the rule President Fuhrer King Bradley, who wish to menumbalksan all his people to desire someone who is called father\\n\\n\r\n1.Story / plot \\n\r\nIn the 64 episodes which is quite long for the anime today, given the story happens very clear and quite difficult to understand where the tone aka chemical elements here (according to the title), the plot is unique and made \u200b\u200bvery epic, with very fantastic ending, grooved mix so even though already in the middle of the plot aka tone flashback made \u200b\u200bto clarify that the story was more dispersed there mystery began to be solved by carefully \\n\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\n2.Genre \\n\r\nWrapped in a genre of comedy that is fairly common, but the entire action genre there is shown the remarkable elements of comedy in every action that is displayed is really funny, and not damage other existing genres, action given panel is also fairly cool which makes the rendered image the action is much more alive, besides action and comedy, there is also a genre Drama, military, Super natural, perhaps somewhat rare to see the military genre in anime, but in the genre of military tactics given very supportive action genre, and if combined properly it will create action that hone not just attack-attack alone, given the drama genre is extraordinary, perhaps this is what makes this anime more slick, funny and action in addition to cool it can drain every audience terlbih mind again, an additional story that has a groove mix so that the drama will be supporting the plot, and genre super natural / additional power is common in the genre of action given based on the strength of science, so it must be clever to understand what is discussed in this anme \\n\\n\r\nScore 10/10 \\n\\n\r\n3.OST OP / ED \\n\r\nWell maybe builders skip-skip OST may rarely listen but for those who are willing to listen to the OST of this anime guaranteed addiction, Song settings and frame was fused, can even feel 1 cour anime in 1 OST alone, but I do not remember the title and singer but my favorite Nico toucher In The Wall - Hologram and Chesmitry - Period \\n\r\nScore 10/10 \\n\r\n4.Backgroud and Music \\n\r\nBGM took the 20th century where technological development in the past, music was made to follow events there, to be honest my years of background is very fitting combined with the story of alchemy where in the same year in the world is also in the development of science \\n\r\nScore 9/10 \\n\r\n5. Character Design \\n\r\nThe design character of the manga beginning of the 21st century certainly is predictable, mediocre and lacking design accentuate knowing I was poor chara moe anime and panserpis, desainya somewhat different from the anime anime contemporaries so somewhat when compared remakannya not thrown I seem to Bones as the Main Art The Anime want a better impression \\n\\n\r\nScore 8/10",

However, although there may be a different opinion among those who have taken the time to watch both of the series, but I personally believe that enrichment in the FMAB series of 64 episodes is superior to the older dramatized FMA series. In my full understanding I can say that my opinion won't change for the simple fact I have enjoyed watching Brotherhood twice over with subtitles and once again in dubbed version for a full story in mind. All in all, the basis of the show is inmy interest to place it in the highest respect towards rating. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed this series does have a repetition in its theoretical story and action, but the character life seems all too real. This show definitely is my favorite at this point, but even in that light, I still have just one issue. Characters take quick risks and life changing actions for emotions of past beloved people or wish it so, but never do they feel to me that they are attached until the rap up of the story. So if you are for swift feels, then you should realize that you need to complete the entirety of the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course besides the fact, you should indefinitely take the time to watch this series just for an amazing series sake.",

The voice acting is fantastic and veryrarely falters.\\n\\n\r\nBut where I believe Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood really shines is in it's characters and the character development. Protagonist and antagonist alike are easy to fall in love with, each and every character feels unique and has there own strengths and weaknesses, no two characters are alike. The people in this show have there own original personalities and these all evolve beautifully over the span of the show, the like of which I have never seen before. The characters and the development of them cannot be understated in FMA:B\\n\\n\r\nOverall Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is amazing and well rounded a fantastic story mixed with beautiful art and fantastic characters and development. I would highly recommend this anime.",

The art quality could have been more distinct and original... the music could have been improved a bit to give it more presence... The fighting could have been more Hunter X Hunter style and focus moreon good tactics and detailed strategy rather than just a slice and dice until someone wins... \\n\\n\r\nBut really, FMA:B didn't need any of these things, it would have just made it a little better...",

Its  because it doesn't do anything bad, but nothing IMO to stand out. Its just god in all Categories, but never Amazing. Personally i like shows to be lob sided, not so well rounded i could play billiards with it. Normally i want a showto have something amazing, but with  flaws, that as whole don't effect the enjoyment, but latter you see them. But then you realize  how amazing the show was because you didn't notice the flaws. Full metal alchemist: Brotherhood does nothing like this.All it does is stay safe, never trying for Greatness, but just sticking with\"good\". Thus Full metal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an 8/10",

I see shounen as being just non-stop action and hype with main characters generically and always striving to be the best like this or the best like that, while this show isn\u2019t just about a story of an underdog trying to attain something. And hell nor it may have overpowered protagonist where every female bitches is falling inlove with them. And yes, I see thisshow great as well because its not just about the story of the main characters itself, but as the camera takes you away from the protagonist which are the Elric Brothers, you can see that every character lines on this show is being progressed as if it in a very realistic manner. When one moves, also everyone does. AND I ALSO FORGOT, THIS SHOW HAS THE LEAST BIT OF PLOTHOLES ON IT SO YOU WILL NOT BE TROUBLING YOURSELF FROM ANALYZING EACH BITS OF IT. IN FACT IT\u2019S CLOSE TO BEING FLAWLESS.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nNow the story basically takes place on two brothers, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric committing a forbidden action in alchemy which one must not act, also called as \u201chuman transmutation\u201d or reviving someone from the dead. They want to revive their mother, Trisha Elric, who overworked herself because of solitude. They basically tried to commit this taboo and seemingly they receive nothing but a painful punishment; from Edward being taken his legs off and Alphone his whole body. And now the overall goal of the main characters is to basically find the philosopher\u2019s stone which is capable of returning both of their bodies back. Little does they know that this stones has a lot of mysterious components in that makes the story captivating and amazing. From the first episode you can already tell that the story is going somewhere deep and mysterious that every viewer may have not been predicting. The shows starts of a little bit lighthearted and comedic because some of its scenes are animated cartoonishly but as you pass halfway through the series the comedies are being reduced, not abruptly but with ease, and you\u2019ll be starting to wander the world of alchemy. The story is well written not just because of how it transitions its lightheartedness, but also because of its fast paced plotline, the mysteries, the emotions, the satisfaction and most of all, the action. Its just one of those shows blended with other genres as well but staying consistent on its roots.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nHow do you make a nice plot? Well develop a good and consistent character. And FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood exactly does that. If its a villain,then its a villain. If the character is like this, then it won\u2019t change from insignificant reasons. This show does that well that every characters in this show is somewhat significant and engaging with the plot and not a single one of them can be considered as \u2018trash\u2019. Not the trash I mean that has poor character but trash as in being disposed. You see one problem of fiction stories here is that they introduce a character and after they fulfill their respective roles on the show they will just be forgotten and disappear like they never exist, you see \u201cTRASH\u201d. While on the other hand, instead of just being forgotten this show made it so that every character is still engaging with one another and not being completely forgotten about. And with that its a big advantage on the show because it made the plot a lot more realistic and lessen a lot of plot holes. And also the bad guys here are very well written. The 6 sins (excluding greed) made it so that every viewer needs to be fulfilled with various kinds of bad guys. And of course the main antagonist was well-written as well clearly stating his ambitions within the show. All in all the characters here were all just great and fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nOhh.. Here are may favorite characters on the shows.\\n\r\n-Well of course I\u2019ll consider the protagonists, the Elric Brothers, I don\u2019t think I need some explanation in that or some clarification.\\n\r\n-Roy Mustang: Because he has this genius side on him staying true to his dream as the Fuhrer President even though holding immense amount of capabilities he still didn\u2019t use it for something evil.\\n\r\n-Lin Yao and Greed: They made it seem so that being greedy isn\u2019t really a sin.\\n\r\n- Van Hohenheim- who doesn\u2019t like a bad ass father?\\n\\n\r\nSound 9.7/10\\n\r\nThe sounds in this show were clearly also a masterpiece. I\u2019ll divide it into three parts though so that it\u2019s organize, the OST, OP and ED and the voice acting and usage of Sound Effects.\\n\r\nOpening And Ending (10/10)\\n\r\nThe 5 Openings was really great and unique that it hit every viewer hard so that they couldn\u2019t forget the show just like that. Each opening has their unique sounds and all were not just generic JPOP Rock, but also something emotional and sad that it can pierce through my heart when watching emotional portions of the show. I love how they made the 5th Opening more soft and not rock as the show is really engaging not just actions and hype but also something more emotional as the show seems to be ending and every character who just suffered in the show will have an end to it. The first opening also has a soft touch to it introducing each characters while rapping but with no flashy instruments used, the rap was intense, but the production was made more like an acoustic and with no EDM beats or something which is really fantastic. The Ending songs was all average to me but they do the job perfectly so I wouldn\u2019t mind it specifically and just give a 10.\\n\r\nOST 9/10\\n\r\nPerfect tracks on perfect moments although nothings new is grabbing me though since all were just doing the job fine but not exceeding my expectations. But I think they were great pieces its just they\u2019re a little bit too bland. But still as I said, perfect timing on perfect tracks.\\n\r\nVoice Acting and Usage of Sound Effects 9.8/10\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t mind the Japanese if they made  minor mistakes on voice acting the show, hell even if they do made some mistakes I\u2019ll still be grateful that they\u2019re working hard on this Japanese Cartoons. Well pretty much I don\u2019t see some problem in voice acting in particular but I see some minor flaws on the usage of SFX. The sounds were nicely pick its just the timing sometimes could be a little off. Its just subtle, but I do notice some of it. Many of it particularly the animation of walking not matching the footstep sound effects. But still it didn\u2019t affect the show int the fullest but still I\u2019ll reduce the score for it a little bit.\\n\r\nAnimation 10/10\\n\r\nAhhhhhh! S A K U G A\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nDo you expect me not to enjoy a well-written action and adventure show incorporated with blending genres and different kinds of emotions with well written characters? Well to be true there may be some point you\u2019ll be bored in the series. Especially some of the flashbacks, but it doesn\u2019t really matter because those are all significant to the plot, its just anybody would always anticipate action on this show and sometimes they don\u2019t give a fuck about the details on how a particular event occured. But still you\u2019ll enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10\\n\r\n - WATCH THIS WHEN YOU DON\u2019T HAVE ANY HOMEWORK FOR FIVE WEEKS",

            "content": "Well, before watching this anime, I always had a prejudice, because people always say, \"This is a perfect anime, it's the best anime.\" It bothered me, until I stopped that prejudice and watched the play completely.\r\nHistory: Absurdly incredible and well detailed. The anime has a story well explored and what makes it even better, the world is explored in more than one dimension. When watching, you follow the map and the locations where the protagonists pass. This makes the work rich, as it is concerned with exploring and explaining the world where the story takes place.\r\nArt: To be honest, I do not really like theart of FMAB, it bothers me a bit the absence of traits and details, even though I know it's a rather old manga. My grade is 10, regardless of my taste, I do not think the bad trait, but if it were for my taste, it would not be so.\\n\r\nI am obliged to praise the animation, for an anime of 2010, the production of Bones Inc is to be congratulated by the excellent quality!\\n\r\nSound Production: I've never emphasized this, but I think it's worth mentioning the wonderful and well-produced openings. I do not see much of anything on the soundtracks. Of my favorite \"battle shounens\" anime, maybe that's the least I think about when it comes to OST's. The soundtrack is cool, it works, it has some epics, but nothing different.\\n\r\nCharacters: Well, I think 10 is more than faint, but only one character bothers me: \"Al\", for being with the protagonist all the time, I expected more of him, even though he had good moments of development, but were few and unique to just one character. It was almost unimportant to him during 90% of the anime.\\n\r\nThe other characters, wonderful, the Sins, in this case the homunculi, are perfect, with the exception of some like Lust. All of them, including Mustang and Ed, have great developments!\\n\r\nOne thing I have not seen in almost any other work, was something that FMAB did, which is to put the secondary characters as one, including the protagonist. This makes them all important and part of the plot, having a beautiful connection between them, in the technical part!\\n\r\nFMAB may not be very nice at first, the fact that it is too rushed and almost does not present the characters ends up bothering much, but still, as of episode 10, the anime changes and shows its potential!\\n\r\nThe author of FMAB is not one of my favorite mangakas, even so, she has my full respect. He managed to do a fantastic work from beginning to end, with ecellent characters and a wonderful story!",

            "content": "While I don't think this is amazing, I do think that it is a very good show with some noticeable flaws.\r\nThe biggest flaw with this show is the tone. For example, when SPOILER is turning into a SPOILER and it should be a very sad scene for Edward, Shao May shows up and is sad about how short Edward is. This really takes you out of the experience.\r\nAnother flaw is the characters. Now, please don't get mad at me, but I only found a few characters to be truly great: Ling, Greed, Wrath, Scar, and Hohenheim. Edward and Alphonse, along with the other Homunculi (maybeexcluding Pride), Winry, Pinako, etc. just got a little predictable. They were still good characters, but I didn't think they were amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is serviceable, but not exactly great or anything. Just sorta... there.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is my one of my favorite parts of this anime though. It keeps throwing twists and turns at you that you never saw coming.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is serviceable as well.\\n\\n\r\nBesides a slow start, after episode 3 I was hooked. I thoroughly enjoyed this series.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the series was Ling and Greed though. Honestly some of my favorite characters in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this show if you just wanna have some good fun and some light takes on faith, science, ideology, and sacrifice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2/10",

With everyone seemingly labeling every above average show as a \"masterpiece.\" But when you actually find one that is, suddenly, that word isn't nearly enough of a praise. This is the first, and only show to date. That I've given a perfect score of 10/10 across the board. \r\nIn every aspect, from the story, to the openings/ending, the characters, to the attention to detail, and art. Everything is classic. I remember 2012, being a 14 year old.And seeing this show for the first time. This was one of the first anime i'd ever watched. I'd have 3 tabs open, each with the next episode. Just so I wouldn't need to press the next episode button. Watching this show is one of the best memories of my childhood I have. That in itself says more than any words ever could about the quality of this show.",
