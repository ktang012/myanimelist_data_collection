            "content": "I went into viewing Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd without a great deal of expectations.  Having read through many of the reviews and hearing some firsthand accounts on it I got the impression that it was going to be an average at best experience.  However this was a show that I had been very interested in seeing since it started airing.  For me it\u2019s a great example of not believing everything you hear.\r\nThe story starts out as a pretty interesting mystery involving a number of grisly murders and a high school boy who believes he has witnessed one of them and is being fed information aboutfuture killings before they happen.  The boy is Takumi, a severely disturbed and socially awkward individual who is terrorized by delusions and paranoia.  The plot feels genuinely creepy at times but doesn\u2019t manage to sustain this over the course of the entire series.  Because of Takumi's delusions the viewer is not always sure what is real or what isn\u2019t.  It does take some significant detours and while it\u2019s not the smartest thing I have ever seen, in my opinion it managed to be interesting through the end.  However one might feel about how the story changed focus over the course of the show, I did feel that it ended very nicely with most of the loose ends tied off.\\n\\n\r\nTakumi's character for me was extremely interesting.  Sure he is a stereotype of a socially awkward otaku, but what makes him a great character is his personality.  He is an extremely disturbed person.  His inability at times to know what is real or what isn\u2019t made him fascinating.  I enjoyed how he coped with his fear of others by imagining his favorite anime character as a companion.  I felt the story did a great job in developing him and having him overcome his fears and questions about his own existence.\\n\\n\r\nSadly as good as I felt Takumi was as a character, the rest of the cast is quite uninspired.  The girls all fall into the usual patterns that we see in every anime, from the moe sugar sweet best girlfriend to the brainy and to the cold hearted swordsman.  Still despite this I still enjoyed most of them, particularly Yua and even though they weren\u2019t that groundbreaking.  The villains are equally stale from an originality standpoint.  Their motivations are 2-dimensional and boring and really were a poor foil overall for the heroes to overcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is good for the most part but a little inconsistent at times.  I felt the colors were kind of flat and the styles seemed awfully dated looking.  In addition the character models felt.. familiar.  It didn\u2019t seem like there was any originality in designing them and some of them actually looked like they were ripped directly out of other anime.  I did like the music, the opening was good and I felt set the tone, but the ending while a good song felt out of place considering the subject matter of many of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDespite a number of faults I just can\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t like this show.  It\u2019s not great at anything it does.  The thriller elements of the plot fall a bit flat and the action scenes really aren\u2019t that interesting either.  My interest in the main character and a decent storyline made this an enjoyable experience for me.  I would recommend it, however if you looking for a superb suspense thriller or a great action you\u2019re probably going to be disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "Chaos;Head is a prime example of an anime that collapsed under the weight of its own ambition. In trying so desperately to separate itself from a myriad of other suspenseful thrillers while catering to a pre-selected audience, Chaos;Head spreads itself all of the place, so much so that everything about it is thin, flimsy, and overall disappointing. The end result, however, is stuff of unintended comic gold.\r\nChaos;Head starts fantastic with a very adventurous first episode brimming with possibilities. The play on otaku falling victim to their own delusions, coupled with a series of bizarre homicides was intriguing enough to keep me watching it repeatedly, butthen trouble began to surface. The series began to breach the mysteries it had established with theoretical existentialism, leading into discussions using made-up terminology that goes entirely unexplained and becomes even more convoluted as its short but utterly incomprehensible run comes closer to a finish.\\n\\n\r\nEven more irritating, all of the mysteries and delusions established in the first episode are cast aside as convenient attention-getters. Nothing established in the first episode even matters to the big picture. Also, plot twists, while numerous, are established without any prior knowledge as to what they entail for the cast and revelations do not have any gravitas. The only reason I give the story any points is for the first few episodes alone, before it careened into self-destruction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a little better, but only in certain instances. Main character Takumi is entrancing throughout the first half. His reactions to the mania around him are painfully crafted with a sense of realism so as to have Takumi's reaction become the mirror of the viewer, and it works very well. However, he betrays this reality of self when the series enters into its convoluted style of existentialism and he becomes a living deus ex machina.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls of the series are handled just as carelessly, often with vain attempts at giving them personality quirks but failing to capitalize on them. The only real exception to this is Kozue, but her traits are so forced and intruding, that by &quot;cutesyfing&quot; her the staff made her more off-putting than any other girl. Moreso, the series can only focus on one or two girls at a time, meaning that all the other girls suddenly disappear from the picture. This would be fine, except they often return with a wealth of new information we are forced to assume they learned off-scene.\\n\\n\r\nTechnical aspects are far better than anything the series offers otherwise, but not exceedingly so. The art is fairly average of the typical series these days. Madhouse obviously didn't break the bank, but the looks is acceptable. Takumi's character design, especially his face, is often hard to look at, but the girls all look acceptable. The animation flows well-enough but it's nothing to write home about. An all around average job.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good too, but only in some parts. Namely the theme songs; the first being a catchy Kanako Itou number with lyrics that make no sense but are befitting of the series' storyline, and the closer being an impossibly upbeat tune with lyrics that resemble bad stalker poetry. Sound effects and vocal performances also highlight various sequences. The prior are easily arguable, but the BGM is horribly composed. Not ear-bleedingly so, but still quite bad.\\n\\n\r\nYet for as sharp and horrible a nosedive as Chaos;Head took, I reveled in it. I wanted to see how bad the story got and how awful the characterization became. It may have been a poor series, but it reaches on &quot;so bad its good&quot; territory in the same way a handful of cult classics and B-movies do. It's not for everyone, but you can definitely have a lot of fun laughing at just how awful this series becomes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Chaos;Head a 5 out of 10.",

            "content": "Ever since Neon Genesis Evangelion's debut in the late 90's philosophically charged mind-frags have been a staple of anime. Many of these mind-twisting series are pretty brilliant, despite being exceedingly obtuse. Chaos;HEAd is definitely not one of these. Filled with nonsensical metaphysical babble, flimsy internal logic, and clearly not as smart as it thinks it is; this show is the perfect example of what happens when a psychological thriller goes completely wrong.\r\nThe show follows a socially inept (to put it VERY lightly) and barely sane anime obsessed recluse named Takumi Nishijou as he is pulled into a reality bending battle with the fate of theworld at stake. Grisly murders and suicides are taking place around the city, throwing it into confusion and fear. Takumi witnesses one murder being committed by a pink haired girl; a girl who appears to him at his school claiming to be his friend and classmate, something that all his acquaintances affirm even though Takumi has no recollection of her. This drives the already unstable Takumi into a paranoid panic, but the more he struggles to get back to his hermit lifestyle, the further he is sucked into a world of conspiracy theories and horrific happenings; as well as running into more cute yet strange girls.\\n\\n\r\nThis animated adaptation of a visual novel seems to be trying to do a lot of things. It tries to deconstruct or at least put a dark twist on the harem trend by giving its gaggle of girls twisted or scarred personalities. It tries to bring forth existential ideas with theories of how the mind perceives things and mind-powered reality bending abilities. It tries to be an intricately plotted suspense thriller, filled with hallucinatory imagery and cryptic ominousness concerning a prophesy, an evil organization, and a mysterious man in a wheelchair. The problem here is not a lack of ambition, the problem is that the show fails to execute well on anything it attempts.\\n\\n\r\nDespite giving most of the cast damaged and twisted psyches, the story fails to make any of its characters compelling because they are just not believable. To put it simply, the characters do not act or behave like actual people. Takunm is so far gone that it pretty much impossible to relate to him. Imagine taking Satou from Welcome to the NHK and stripping him of the humanity which made him a compelling character, leaving only his extreme dysfunctions. Now imagine the show playing his insane ineptness as straight drama, rather than dark comedy; and you have Takumi. Takumi is a one dimensional caricature of a crazy otaku rather than a complex fleshed out character; so his turmoil and insecurities ring hollow. The rest of the cast pretty much follows suit. The gaggle of girls that surrounds Takumi is a collection of graphic novel stereotypes, devoid of much personality besides their strange mental dispositions. The main antagonist, who is revealed later in the series, lacks any kind of understandable motive; he's evil and wants to rule the world because the plot needed some kind of bad guy, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also tries way too hard to build tension. To be fair, the techniques it uses are pretty commonplace in psychological thrillers. Strange camera angles and hallucinatory are very useful tools to create an effective chiller. Unfortunately, the staff of Chaos;HEAd lacks the skill to use them effectively. There is no subtly to the suspense in the series, and as a result it is often ends up being unintentionally funny. Moments of high tension and sinister revelations happen sporadically with no rhyme or reason, making the plot unfold very unnaturally. \\n\\n\r\nJust as bad is all the meta-physical babble in the series, in fact, that is probably the worst part. The shows has some 'interesting' concepts about the world, and how the mind can perceive and influence it, which are so far from reality they barely make sense at all. Unfortunately, the show is intent on trying pass off this confused jumble of ideas as something poignant. Worse yet, some of the concepts in the show are so implausible that the show spends a good amount of time with exposition to explain the convoluted logic behind them. Underneath all of this is a rather basic plot involving an evil organization bent on taking over the world and the unlikely heroes who must stop them that is over-complicated by all the nonsense the show puts us through.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Chaos;HEAd doesn't look bad, just woefully uninspired. The character designs are the placid moe-fied girls and plain looking guys; they are neither particularly appealing or hideous, but just kind of boring to look at because we see characters that look like this all the time. Backgrounds are fairly well detailed, but just like the characters, there is just nothing eye catching. The animation is standard quality for TV anime, nothing flashy with moments of choppiness, but nothing horrendous. Obscure camera angles and other effects are used quite frequently, but seldom effectively. The show does such a poor job at properly setting the mood that the effects come across as an obnoxious, failed attempt to be artsy. The soundtrack is sparingly used and when it is used, it hits a lukewarm semi-successful at best. There are many scenes in the show without music, but even in scenes with a track playing, the music just kind of fades away in the back ground, or is played at a blurring high volume. There are moments when the soundtrack is used to good effect, but they are rare and far between.\\n\\n\r\nChaos;HEAd is an exceptionally bad waste of 12 episodes. It is a show that takes half-baked ideas and tries to present them as something intelligent with endless psychological babble. Behind all the quasi-philosophical mumbo jumbo is a generic, and honestly, rather dull plot. Despite all the pretense of depth, Chaos;HEAd is poorly conceived creation devoid of believable characters, compelling storytelling, and worst of all, intelligence.",

            "content": "If you ever want to see something crappier than a Port-o-Potty outside a football stadium, then by all means, go ahead and watch Chaos;Head. \r\nThis anime is a pathetic excuse of art and it will definitely only appeal to people who think they're smart or something. \r\nPompous Sheep #1: \"Snoot snoot, I must say this is a rather wonderful addition to the murder suspense anime world, don't you think?\"\r\nPompous Sheep #324: \"I dare say it is, on the level of Higurashi no Kaka de no Crappy ni.\"\r\nStupid!\r\nThe storyline is moronic to to nth degree. A loser boy who can only...have fantasies about his...*yawns*...make-believe girlfriend issuddenly thrown into...a battle with people who are linked in a string of...zzz....oh wait, what?? Story is lame and the plot twists are so convoluted, unbelievable, and are just awful. \\n\\n\r\nEvery character looked like they were ripped off some other anime, and the fights scenes were short and pointless. I mean, couldn't you shell out a little more money on this? It seems they decided to do like other anime and impress the viewer with the excellent story and great characters, so they didn't pay up for the technical aspects. Unfabulous, isn't it? Sound was terrible. Those voices were graty and annoying, and the music was bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were pathetic, as I am not surprised based off the crap story. The main character is a wuss who doesn't even know how to interact with humans. While this could be all right, people TALK to him, like they WANT to be around him when clearly he doesn't give a cow's ass about them. I mean, take Welcome to the NHK. That guy didn't want to be around anyone, but when someone reached out to him, he took their hand. And he's not a bad guy. The guy of Chaos;Head has no personality, nothing likeable about him, so why do all these girls wanna be around him?? All the girls were like talking Barbie dolls. Instead of getting a comb along with the package, you get a sword. Whoop-de-doo.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this. Although I know most people will since they think it's an anime that will make them smarter. If you're dumb enough to think this anime is intelligent...that's sad.",

            "content": "This review is biased, because I read the VN. I thought about writing a review that does not mention the VN at all, but I that I'd rather write one that does, one that mentions the VN throughout the whole review.\r\nIt's also a long-ass review. Did I mention that I'm rambling on the game?\r\nCh\u00e4oS;HEAd is an adaptation of a popular Visual Novel of the same name, spanning 12 episodes.\r\nJust from the idea of a 30-40+ hours Visual Novel adapted into a 12 episode anime (about 5-6 hours) you already know that many segments will be shortened or cut off completely, unless it is only thefirst season out of few, which is not.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first read the synopsis of the game: \"Takumi is withdrawn and is not interested in 3D things\" I already had a great interest in playing the game.\\n\r\nMixed with a mysterious serial murder case and Takumi chatting with people in the internet, staying in his room most of the time... it sounded like an excellent idea.\\n\\n\r\nI installed the game and started to play it (without knowing Japanese) and just from the beginning I was hooked. The menu music and design, the atmosphere in the beginning of the game.. it has blown me away.\\n\r\nAnd when I knew that a translation project has just started and is progressing fast, only a few months after the game came out.. I looked forward to this real bad.\\n\\n\r\nA few months later, Right when the before the anime started, finally a decent beta patch came out (playable with pretty much the whole game, unlike the patches that came out before that).\\n\\n\r\nI started playing the game and in the next day, I watched the first episode of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlready, I noticed a few differences between the anime and the game, but overall, the differences were not that great, and the anime had a good start.\\n\\n\r\nI finished the game after some time, and while it had mixed reviews from other people, personally, I enjoyed playing the game very much - even if it suffered from some problems which I overlooked because it was thoroughly an enjoyable experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nWhile progressing in the anime I felt that the anime lacked the emotion that was present in the game, but overall it did a nice job following the main storyline without any problems up until episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't wait to watch episode 7, because the most interesting stuff are about to begin from here, if it had followed the game.\\n\\n\r\nTo my surprise and disappointment, episode 7 had some significant changes , emitting one of the best parts of the game, and made the anime lose all the horror and suspense parts it had up until now (even if they were few in number).\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 8 was an episode that was not present in the game at all.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 9 followed the game, but rendered episode 8 unneeded completely. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 10 emitted all the best parts from the game, completely, and was censored as hell, more than others, and was not enjoyable for me at all.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 11 was bad, and censored as well.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 12, the final episode,was good, considering that the previous episodes were a trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\nWow, that was a long introduction. So lets get to the technical details:\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10: Rushed, best segments from the game were not present in the anime, lacked feeling, lacked almost all of the horror and suspense elements.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 6/10: Character designs were simplistic, and while the animation was really good in some scenes, it was choppy as hell in others.\\n\r\nWhile some backgrounds were done beautifully, most of the background characters were done so badly, really badly.\\n\\n\r\nSo in one word... inconsistent. In Two words, very inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: I think I'm one of the few people that liked the anime OP more than the game OP. The ED was great too, I never skipped the OP or the ED not even once.\\n\r\nThe background music was really nice.\\n\r\nAll the voice actors did a great job, and overall in the sound department it gets a 9/10. Why not 10/10? because the anime was rushed and the script was rushed , the voice actors had to rush it too, and it's a shame. Because of that, many scenes lacked the feelings that were presented in a much more superior way in the game.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: While in the game, some of the characters were stereotypical and undeveloped, I liked pretty much all the characters, and especially Takumi.\\n\\n\r\nTakumi is a stereotype of a withdrawn person that is not interested in 3D things.\\n\r\nHe's pretty much the biggest stereotype of an anime Otaku almost Hikki  that barely goes to school just to graduate), collecting figurines, shuts himself in his room all day, playing MMO's, living on a container on the roof, has an imaginary anime character WAIFU (He likes her more than all of his other WAIFUS) that he faps and fantasizes about all day up until the point that he talks to her when he's alone and her voice is served as his inner voice giving him the ideal advices for him when he's in a pinch... getting to the shoes of a guy like that can't get more interesting for me. It was so awesome for me to know what Takumi thinks about, the fact that he barely talks in the game, the fact that he doesn't trust anyone.... the way that his characters was developed and was faced with all the crap he has to go through it was amazing. I found myself agreeing with him, being amused by him... I just really like his character.\\n\\n\r\nNow the anime... take his character, make him less pathetic, make him more talkative, and the fact that you barely hear him thinking... suddenly I didn't care what happens to him as I did in the game. He was much more flat, and it goes to almost all the characters in the anime compared to the game, mainly because of the changes in the anime and the fact that it was rushed. I didn't like the Imouto because she wasn't as moe in the game... the same goes to pretty much all the other characters (Rimi, Sena, Ayase, Yua , detective Ban, Shogun, Suwa, Hazuki, even Daisuke... and so on).\\n\\n\r\nI liked  Kozu-Pii just like I liked her in the game... maybe I liked Kozu-Pii a little more in the anime. I'm not sure about this. It's just that I didn't care what happens to the characters as I did in the game, because it was rushed, and the new mediocre story segments made things only worse in the development of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: The most important factor for me. Did I enjoy the anime? Most of the time? yes. Did I did not enjoy the anime at other parts? yes.\\n\r\nI had some mixed feelings, really. But I guess the reason I'm giving this a 7 in not a 6 as I planned because to my surprise... I enjoyed the last episode. No other hidden meanings here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was a:\\n\\n\r\n In one world: Trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\nIn four words ( I think..):Trainwreck that I enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nIn eight words (Wait.. I'm not sure here): Trainwreck that I enjoyed most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this anime? You should decide for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat is all for this long ass ramble first review. To my surprise, it didn't take me long to write this. I guess that I wrote what I thought, simple as that. Sorry for the spelling mistakes and all other shit. \\n\\n\r\nSayonara.",

            "content": "Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd is a Supernatural, Psychological, Mystery, whatever that literally gives a new meaning to the term \u201cmind-f**k\u201d. Whichever way you feel about this series, whether you like its intriguing set-up or detest its absurdity, there\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s a complete mess.\r\nFollowing the life of some loser otaku, Takumi Nishijou is a high school student living life in his own little world of online gaming, anime and perverse fantasies. Then one fateful day he wonders into some gruesome murder scene, changing his current life dramatically, as extreme paranoia sets in. Well that\u2019s the introduction, in a nutshell and like most people I struggled to makesense of this absurd anime that felt like watching the Matrix on crack, whilst also watching Scanner Darkly of LSD. But we are not alone as the main character struggles to make sense of what\u2019s going on as well and it isn\u2019t until halfway into the series that some light is finally shed on our confused minds; with some much needed plot exposition. It\u2019s just a shame that whatever explanations into what the series is about will go over most people\u2019s heads and I\u2019ll be wasting my time trying to explain it myself.\\n\\n\r\nHowever what can be explored are the characters, as this series is full of a weird bunch. As stated before the main protagonist is some loser otaku Takumi, who\u2019s pretty much like a more freakishly annoying version of Tatsuhiro Satou from Welcome to the NHK. What more can be said about this deluded kid, except that it\u2019s weird how this series became a bit of a harem when all of a sudden his surrounded by bishoujo. Naming all of them would be a pain, so just think of all the character types found in your typical visual novel/eroge and give them weird psychological complexes.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the animation and music was great, with a credible amount of effort put in by studio Madhouse clearly evident in this area. The character designs and action moments are plain rubbish but the scenery and objects are certainly portrayed incredibly well. Also the music is pretty fascinating, since it has some eerie tunes to set a weird tone for this weird series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd was a fairly interesting anime as it was more like a homage to a portion of the otaku world, whilst trying to give a serious story. About halfway into the series it certainly piqued my interest, with all the weird theories they were throwing about but for the most part it made little sense.\\n",

            "content": "I know a lot of people hate Chaos;Head for some reason or another, but damnit, I thought it was good. I originally watched it in July of 2010 and gave it a 10/10. Was that score deserved? What did I like about it so much before? It'd been so long I figured I'd re-watch it and give it a proper rating and review. \r\nPeople criticize Chaos;Head as a convoluted mess, but I disagree. There were some times that complicated points in the storyline were explained at a rather fast pace; perhaps not exactly \"easy\" to follow, but I don't think it was hard either. Foranyone who didn't get it, this series is a lot like an anime version of The Matrix. \\n\\n\r\n- - - S T O R Y - - - \\n\r\nThroughout the entire show, I found the story to be quite intriguing. The show is filled with mysterious identities and mysterious happenings, which unravel over time with a natural flow. Nothing felt forced or tacked on to me. Perhaps getting a lecture about electromagnetic waves and human senses out of the blue felt \"forced\" to some, but I think the timing was appropriate and the characters explaining obviously did so intentionally, planning it out ahead of time. \\n\\n\r\nChaos;Head has a few \"reveals\", the main one being something personal about Takumi. I found all of them to be decently executed. Takumi's big reveal was led up to more and I felt it was quite well done. Some anime series will just randomly throw plot twists at you without being convincing at all, just expecting you to accept any changes it brings. Takumi's character development was smooth and believable. Some may argue otherwise, but it's not like he just did a 180 outta nowhere. The confidence the Di-Sword would bring, the relationship he built, the immense power and understanding he acquired, etc. I think is more than enough reason to give him a little bit of courage. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two minor plot holes in this series. The first is Rimi's involvement with the New Gen incident from the first episode. There is never any explanation as to why she was there. However, it honestly feels like it doesn't matter. We can assume she was there for any number of reasons, even that it was just a delusion attack on Takumi. The answer has no bearing on the story, really. \\n\r\nThe second is how all the female characters acted like friends and as if they all knew each other in the final episode. This was a little silly since most of them have never met before, but also not a huge deal, and it can also be explained away as a result of Takumi's delusions. They all go to the same school, anyway, so it wouldn't be too unusual to be slightly familiar with each other.\\n\\n\r\n- - - A R T - - - \\n\r\nThe art is average for the most part. There's the rare inconsistency with Takumi's hairstyle, but it's really not a big deal. Cutesy anime girls with outrageous hairstyles, the usual. The art and animation is as good as any other average anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe part I really liked about the art is the effects that were used at certain tense moments. A desolate world where there is only Takumi and Shogun... A place where you must absolutely not be, where you can feel your very existence is at stake... A dark hallway that is clearly off limits... It just added so much more feeling to the scenario, as if you were right there with the characters. \\n\\n\r\n- - - S O U N D - - - \\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are among my favourites from all the anime I've seen. They've got a good sound and good singers. The opening theme's intensity doesn't feel like it's all there since the show's full of cutesy anime girls and some parts of the opening animation aren't exactly exciting. Still, it's a very good song. The ending is one of two songs I've heard from Seira Kagami; I feel like I really gotta check out more of her stuff, she definitely sings better than your average idol or squeamish high pitched girl. I'm sure people would think the song is just gay since she says \"super special\", but you gotta remember English isn't her first language, there's bound to be some poorly phrased sentences. Still, I think it's a very good j-pop song. It may not fit the whole series' mood, but it fits the ending. Make of that what you will.\\n\\n\r\nTakumi's voice actor does the job great. I love how Takumi creepily/uneasily laughs to himself and how he sounds uneasy and troubled. The rest of the cast is just average roles, and they do that fine. \\n\\n\r\nI find the music in Chaos;Head to be pretty interesting and to fit the mood perfectly. It's common for anime to have overly silly and upbeat songs whenever the character does something silly or to just have boring music that you don't even really notice. Instead, Chaos;Head opts for simple piano pieces to gently give you the right feeling. The tense moments have incredible distorted piano pieces and awkward, creeping, noisy tracks. Most anime will just give you some exciting \"action\" music at the heated moments, but Chaos;Head gives you something chilling - a taste of insanity itself. I love it. \\n\\n\r\n- - - C H A R A C T E R S - - - \\n\r\nTakumi - He is an awesome character. He's a weak, cowardly otaku who daydreams of a life with his 2D waifu and tries his hardest to not be the main character. That part is okay, but what's really great about him is his extreme negativity, paranoia, and his general attitude and reactions to events. His uneasy smile and weak little laugh, averting his eyes from other people, walking ahead of people who are talking to him... Overall, he's just a hilarious character, and his otaku references are a bonus for anime fans. It's also cool that he hangs out on the computer, plays MMORPGs all day, and uses Google and Wikipedia to solve his life problems, much like the rest of us. \\n\\n\r\nShogun - I thought it was interesting how they presented a harmless, shriveled up old man in a wheelchair as some mysterious and cryptic being with unknown allegiances. The fact that they made a character like that interesting in any way is impressive, especially in a sub-culture where people only care about cute girls. \\n\\n\r\nRimi - Just another anime girl throwing herself at the main character? Not really, she has a good reason for it. All of her actions make sense at the end, which I think is great. I'd say they should've developed her character more, but it's hard to imagine how they could've; she was fine. \\n\\n\r\nYua - Like Rimi, there are also good reasons for her actions. Her character development is generic at first, but her first plot twist makes her pretty interesting. \\n\\n\r\nKishimoto - Also has reasons behind her actions and how she gets close to Takumi. I know that's pretty bland to keep saying, but I don't wanna spoil things. \\n\\n\r\nSena - It was kinda silly how she literally carried her sword at all times. I mean, even if no one else can see it, she would be looking pretty stupid walking around in public as if she's holding a sword resting on her shoulder. Her backstory gave her a fine motive for the story, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls overall - Not exactly interesting by themselves, but not as typical as you'd think at first glance. If you think you'll be seeing \"the down to earth one\", \"the sporty one\", \"the shy one\", etc. like in other harems, you're mistaken. In fact, this isn't even really a harem. The girls don't flirt with the main character or try to start relationships, they don't blush at him, they don't accidentally show him panties, etc. They're mainly just there for the sake of the plot and allowing Takumi's character to develop. Maybe they could've been more intricate like Takumi himself if there were fewer girls, but I guess I'm not really complaining. The story was fine as it was, whether they were necessary or not. This would've been better if they weren't flaunted as the representatives of this anime for general otaku appeal, though.\\n\\n\r\n- - - E N J O Y M E N T - - -\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy when Takumi had delusions about the girls playing out some hentai scenario or when he accidentally touched Rimi's breast (though his dating sim references were funny). These kinda things (the ecchi) are just way too overdone and boring to be any remote point of interest. However, I can respect that Chaos;Head didn't make any effort to actually make it erotic. It felt more like silly anime shenanigans, not like \"I can't tell if I'm watching anime or porn\". \\n\\n\r\nI also respect that Chaos;Head didn't bother with bloody violence/gore. I mean, there were some little visions of horror, but they didn't emphasize on it much - they left things more to your imagination. It's not that I'm afraid of a little blood or anything, I liked seeing that in Hellsing Ultimate before. The reason I respect Chaos;Head for not doing the same is because gore has become a simple little trick anime producers use for shock value. They insert it when it isn't even really appropriate and people just gobble it up. Chaos;Head simply didn't need it, and I think it's good that they acknowledged that. \\n\\n\r\nI found this series to be enjoyable the whole way through, though I think the ending and final battle felt a little... I dunno, lacking for a climax. I think it's because the villain had a very good and valid reason for his schemes, whereas our heroes didn't have very solid grounds to oppose him. If it were a debate, the good guys would lose hands down - they only won by using force, like brutes. They did rationalize it a bit better afterwards, but it felt kinda hard to get into that battle while it was happening. \\n\\n\r\nFor anyone complaining about how things don't make enough scientific sense to apply to the real world, c'mon... it's just a sci-fi story. Of course they're gonna stretch the truth a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, it's funny how \"Wikipedia\" in this series is \"Wiki-pedophilia\". \\n\\n\r\n- - - O V E R A L L - - -\\n\r\nWell, I suppose I can't recommend Chaos;Head to everyone since it's evident that a ton of people hate it. It's just 12 episodes and starts off really exciting, though, so you don't have much to lose. It's more creative and original than the majority of anime you'll come across, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nI dunno, I think people are just missing the point and getting hung up on how they didn't understand the concept of the delusions. Chaos;Head literally asks you if you can really be sure that what you see is reality, and tells you that the only way you can know for sure is if other people confirm it. Say one person is colour blind and thinks something is gray, but 10 other people think that same object is yellow. It is yellow because everyone else says it's yellow, even if you can't comprehend that. They take it to an extreme that some people believe and some people do not. There are many ways you can interpret this line of thinking. Is God real, or does he only exist because so many people believe he does? Is history the truth, or is it fabricated? If your brain can send signals to increase or decrease your body temperature (such as when you're sick or sleeping), could it go so far as to give you physical burns or let you freeze to death? Can you say a rainbow exists, or is it only there because you perceive it to be there?\\n\\n\r\nI think it's interesting that an anime series based itself on perceptions and \"belief\" itself. This anime isn't extremely deep, and I really don't think the plot was that complicated to understand, but it is somewhat thought provoking. Apparently too much for some people, I suppose.",

            "content": "I haven't played the game, nor have I read the visual novel, so I cannot compare and point out about differences or things left out. Thus, this review is about the anime only.\r\nChaos;Head... I'm going to be honest, and say that Chaos;Head was a real disappointment. The concept is fairly original. I give points for that. If you were like me, I was expecting a fairly elaborate plot with twists and suspense, but Chaos;Head severely lacked that, and thus, it turned out having a really mediocre and a down right uninteresting result. To fit this kind of a story-line, into such a short space oftime, obviously was not a very good idea, and the result of this is of huge disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nAn Otaku called Takumi lives by himself and excludes himself from the rest of the world. One day, he receives a message from a mysterious &quot;Shougun&quot; with a link to a highly disturbing image of a person staked onto a wall. The next day, after walking through Shibuya, he runs into an alleyway, and accidentally stumbles into a man having been staked to a wall, exactly that in which he saw in the image. As it turns out, these are a series of mysterious seemingly supernatural events referred to, as the &quot;New Generation&quot;. Eventually, Takumi gets caught-up with the events of &quot;New Generation&quot; and becomes paranoid of things around him and starts having delusions. He becomes troubled as to who he can trust, what aren't delusions, and who is this mysterious &quot;Shougun&quot; who seems to be around him all the time?\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series was rather strong. It was very well set up, and had a lot of potential in becoming &quot;one of the greats&quot;. Elements of being a very well thought out psychological thriller were present, with small bits of science mixed in with the mythology of the story. Slowly released questions and answers: Good! Although, once it hit around the half way mark, the storyline and plot just began to fall apart, and once it hit the final straight, it basically just blew up on itself. Things became way too obvious. Some scenes became almost pointless. Even when things were still mysterious in some sort of way, the answer was just thrown at you. There are too many times where you could say &quot;Why didn't you do that in the first place!?&quot; and &quot;Isn't it obvious?&quot;. They seemed way too rushed, and definitely were not very well thought out. The small amount of romance in the story didn't help at all and it really all seemed a little tacky. As far as I could tell, they just made the story lamer than what it had already become. Where were the twists? Where was the unexpected? Where was the &quot;I want more!&quot; feeling?\\n\\n\r\nOne guy surrounded by a whole lot of girls? Fine, if you can pull it off well, then sure. I'd have no objections to that. However, each girl did not play a large enough role. A lot of the times, it was as if they were &quot;just there&quot; without much purpose. Takumi was just way too wimpy and cowardly in the beginning. Good ol' brother-sister personalities are fun, and Kozue added a little more fun into the storyline.  Overly obnoxious villain? How original... I'll give points to Takumi's and Sena's past as they're history is certainly interesting, along with Shougun's true identity. Although these played a fairly direct role in the plot, really, the characters were all rather dull and not complex enough.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and character design were rather standard. The character's weren't elaborate, but it worked. There were really no inconsistencies in animation, and the sword designs were certainly interesting and nicely detailed. There really isn't anything outstanding in the OP and ED. They didn't quite fit along with the storyline that well either. The musical score seemed to have trouble in deciding how it wants to fit. I mean, the score wasn't bad as such. It just seemed... well... unfitting with the mood and tone of the scene. In some aspects of the story, the soundtrack was fitting, while most of the time, it just didn't help the scene. All the voices seemed to match fairly well with the characters, although there aren't any real standouts, but nothing to complain about either.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap it all up, Chaos;Head really was just a messy, rushed and not very well thought out anime. It just didn't have that suspense, and nor did it have that much complexity. It certainly had huge potential, however the series just couldn't pull it off. Perhaps if the ending weren't as rushed, and things not so obvious and pointless, I'd be able to give it a better score. I feel I'm being a little generous here, and I've given it an overall 6.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nStein's Gate is the 2nd highest rated anime on this entire site. It is universally beloved by anime fans everywhere. However, what about its sister series Chaos Head that takes place in the same world and had the same writer? It is universally disliked! How is this possible? What could have gone so terribly wrong here? Lets take a look.\r\nPlot and Characters: 4/10\r\nThe main character is the boring Hikikomori that we have seen so many times before it is getting old. Unlike Rozen Maiden or Welcome to the NHK, this series doesn't really try to challenge our view of otaku or do a good jobmaking the viewer sympathize with them. He is simply there. A series of gruesome murders begins and you would think that the series would start to get interesting. You thought wrong! Chaos Head is one of the slowest and most boring anime ever made. That isn't really an effective criticism by itself, but if a film is going to be really slow it better do something right to make the effort worthwhile. Chaos Head does NOT deliver in this regard. A kid with a short attention span may complain that a classic film by Bergman or Kurosawa is slow and dull, but the wise adult can point out the philosophy, cinematography, and all the amazing things that the film does well. Chaos Head on the other hand tries to introduce mind blowing ideas with helpful animations, but completely falls on its face. It isn't nearly as intelligent as it clearly thinks it is, and this is quite obvious to the audience. Stein's Gate didn't just rely on \"mind blowing\" time travel theories, but also had solid characters and writing. This is what people actually liked it for! Chaos Head has the ideas, but shitty characters, poor writing, and terrible execution.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack really wasn't that enjoyable or memorable for me. The art is fine, but hardly groundbreaking for the year in which it was made. The production budget is decent, but honestly comes across as lacklustre across the board.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI actually dropped this series halfway through, and it is only 13 episodes. I just had zero desire to waste another minute of my life watching Chaos Head!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series did have some potential and clearly could have done better. I believe it was based on a visual novel, but I haven't read it. Perhaps the original source material was better and this was just a really bad adaptation. If you liked the writing of Chaos Head, but want to see a series that actually has good characters and executes its ideals MUCH better, I would hop on the bandwagon and watch Stein's Gate, which as I mentioned is by the same author.",

I don't know what they were thinking when they squeezed a 30+ hour plot in a ~6 hour animation. Many details are completely gone and some important plot elements were reduced to a minimum. I don't want to spoil so I keep this section rather short.\r\nArt: Oh my god, droopy the animation. The art is horrible in every possible way. One word for this -> QUALITY\r\nSound: Can't complain here but I do like the original OST more.\r\nCharacter: Side character development comes rathershort due to -&gt; squeezing the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As you can obviously see I don't enjoy this anime very much and to put it bluntly I'm biased. I'm just watching this to see which ending they're going for but I can probably guess.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: For me it is a 4~5. For the average guy who didn't read the Novel it ould be 7~8 probably.",

            "content": "It should be noted that this is my first review on this website.\r\nMy friend recommended this series to me because of the interesting premise. I looked it up (on here, actually), saw that it got some decent reviews, and started watching it almost right away.\r\nThis series had a lot of potential. It could have gone the distance. It could have gotten an 8 of 10 from me.\r\nNeedless to say, it didn't...\r\nI'll start with Takumi Nishijou, the male lead. I used to think Shinji Ikari was the most annoying anime character, but Takumi jumped up and nabbed the crown. He's the main reason why I loathethis show.\\n\r\nTakumi spends the majority of the measly twelve episodes whining about the events around him instead of becoming involved in them. Other annoying anime characters tend to have some kind of involvement in the story.Takumi just sat back and cried as his harem took care of everything.\\n\r\nGreat job, Takumi! In my opinion, you're the worst leading character in any of the anime I've seen!\\n\r\nThe only character that held my interest when he wasn't on screen was the police inspector on the murder case. I'm not even going to bother to remember his name, because I have the aching feeling that he's just a bad rip-off of police inspectors in past series (the police inspector in Noein, for example).\\n\r\nThe villains and Takumi's harem girls got little or no development. In fact, I'd venture so far as to say that some of them got less than Takumi.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this show such a low rating because the characters destroy anything that could have been accomplished. I forced myself to watch the last episode just so I could tell people how horrible it was, and I only got that far because the suspense made me want to see some manner of resolution. I would have said a bit about the horrible explanations provided for the powers, except that the basic idea is understandable if you can get past the tech-jargon and some people like to listen to tech-jargon.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, stay away from Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd unless you think the story is worth putting up with the characters. You have been warned.",

            "content": "Takumi is a high school student. He is withdrawn and is not interested in 3D things. In his town, a mysterious serial murder case happens and people get panicked. One day, when he chats on the internet, a man suddenly contacts him and gives him an URL. He goes to the website and finds a blog image that suggests a next murder case.... On the next day, it really happens....\r\nTakumi suffers from intense delusions as a result of his apparent schizophrenia and the extremely secluded lifestyle he lives as a hikkikomori. One day he accidentally stumbles upon a gruesome murder scene, a part of achain of events called \"New Generation.\" After this, his life gets caught up in these events, and he meets a bunch of increasingly insane anime girls with swords.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters\\n\r\nAlright, admitedly, looking at the first couple of lines, my first impression was, \"This sounds like a rehashing of 'Welcome to the NHK',\" with some crazy NEET at its center that I could quite easily not give a dang about. Well, alright, I watched it anyway. My first impressions from the first few lines, part right and part wrong. To those of you that are NEET-allergic, sorry to dissappoint you, but that was spot on. To those of you that didn't like NHK or are hoping for something different, you should be happy that it's nothing like NHK.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story progression was spot on to make a great show. They always provided enough information in one episode to get you to start thinking it would go one way, then out of the other side of the field throw you off next episode. (At least, they really landed that home on me and my roommate.)\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of shock factor behind the characters, they did everything spot on. And as I have said earlier they kept me (and my roommate) guessing right up until the end, even about the characters and their motives. The complex nature of entangling affairs that brought everyone to together prior to the final episodes was carefully concealed until the rise into the climatic final battle.\\n\\n\r\nBut the real kicker of Chao;Head, for me, was the use of perspective in the beginning of the series to create this very intimate feeling of who Nishijou Takumi was as a person, and ultimately, how they used that initial feeling and plunged the viewer into a very dark and disturbing story of the different sides of the human heart and both the conscious and unconsious minds we all have.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, alas, we all have to admire the use of Takumi's delusions as both a story device at cementing our understanding of Takumi and his character and the create venue it created for fan service for all audiences and preferences.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the harshness and splendor of this show with the sheer power of its story and implications for our world, throw in some originality, and I can find no better way to have told this modern day scifi mystery thriller with a little spice of ecchi and romance. There was enough of everything. Eat the 10!\\n\\n\r\nAnd on a side note, with a fair backing in modern science, one only realizes that all those spiels that the characters gave throughout the story were pretty accurate and were well depicted. Side note now over, kudos to the staff who added those in to that detail. Power to them!\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nAs an exercise to grading whether the art work style was appropriate for the series, I often think about if other studios had been in charge of everything. And I also compare it to, in cases like this, to the game. I can think of no better studio to have done this and the anime images are on par to those of the game, so they not only did the story justice with them, but they also did the game justice.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that the use of line art style artwork on the Di-swords when normal peopel weren't supposed to see them was quite good, although I tend to think that there must have been some better way of doing it. Yet, for my talk, I can think of no better way to show their presence and maintain the aura that they aren't visible to normal people. Ah! Gotta love conflictions such as these.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the most powerful images in the series came from Takumi's delusions, thankfully, and they should be more memorable than the normal day in the area around Shibuya.\\n\\n\r\nSo...Go 9!\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe vocal cast was diverse and talented and really played up their parts well. Those that were weak-kneed (aka Takumi) and those that sounded strong (aka one of the girls at one time or another) sounded their respective parts. And I didn't sense any inappropriate tone-age that sometimes comes across in some shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe insert song \"Haritsuke no Misa\" is perhaps one of the most memorable songs in the world of anime. And has the sound of a metal song that would get even the most avid Rammstein fan's attention while it's playing. A great song, by a great artist. And...as a bonus, the lyrics are as disturbing as some parts of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM is just that BGM. It's not meant to stand on its own, but as an enhancement to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a note on the OP/ED, absolutely wonderful songs that really, and I mean really, match the series' intents and mood. Although, at first, one's eyebrow will reach for the sky when hearing Seira Kagami's \"Super Special\" (ED). And one's eyebrows will have no ready made expression for the lyrics of the Itou Kanako's \"F.D.D.\" (OP). Eyebrows excluded from the initial stage, they are great songs.\\n\\n\r\nThat kind of leads us with an 8 in this area.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nAs you can tell, I love the way they told this story. If they had a 20 in this section, I would give it. Now, I will tell my reasons.\\n\\n\r\nYou already know that this was a great thriller, as it keeps one guessing right up until the end. And your interpretations of the characters change on a pretty constant basis as the story progresses. Here's an example: I first hated Takumi, but at the end of the series, one could only feel jealous of the ------- with a certifiable harem of great women and the powers of a god. Perhaps this is all a little exagerated, but I think my point was made rather readily with that.\\n\\n\r\nThriller anime are either great or they suck. This was one of the great ones that came with a few bonuses, including some pretty good backstory and backworkings within the story. Another bonus not often seen. So in all due fairness. I recommend this anime.",

Of course, I should have known from the first episode that it would suck. But anyway, on with the review.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nNormally, I wouldn't give the story such a low score. After all, the story is the heart of the anime, isn't it? But, if it weren't for the fact that I am highly interested in murder/mystery/thriller plots, I would have given this story a 1 out of 10. The story itself was the most rushed story I hadever seen, even more so than another 12 episode anime I had seen. It was a nice attempt, but it didn't really cut it for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nOkay. Sue me. I liked the art. In fact, I loved it. Not really much else to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nLoved the opening and ending theme. And I liked the music they played in the beginning of the episodes. It sets the mood for the anime itself. In fact, I think the sound was the best part. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nMeh. Characters were pretty decent for an anime like this, though I didn't like most of them. And the development for one of them was like the story line: Way too rushed. Plus the relationship between characters is REALLY poor.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoy this series? Most of the time, I just wanted to put this anime on my \"Dropped Anime\" list. But, I kept with it because I liked the feeling of having finished an anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nI would recommend this series only if you like rushed development and story. This anime was sheer disappointment in my eyes, when I thought it would be decent.",

            "content": "Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd is a prime example of why most one-cour shows have linear and simple plots. Imagine a box being stuffed so full that it explodes --- this is a perfect metaphor for the show. A combination of a plot that tries way too hard, characters that are as intriguing as a piece of printer paper, and perhaps the most obnoxious main character in all of animation history lead Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd to be one of the worst shows I've watched. \r\nStory: 2/10\r\nCharacters: 1/10\r\nArt: 4/10\r\nSound: 5/10\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\r\nOverall: 3/10\r\nCh\u00e4oS;HEAd introduces mysteries and plot points nearly every episode, yet these plot points are barely ever expanded on. You'll get introducedto a murder one episode, and then it'll barely even get brought up again. Most things in the earlier parts of the show don't even contribute to the end. Instead of contributing to the plot, these mysteries are used to... uhhh... build tension? Nearly every episode has some sort of plot-twist, and the plot becomes incredibly convoluted and bizarre. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot by itself is already confusing and dreadful, it is made even worse by the \"scientific terminology\" used to explain the Sci-Fi elements of the show. \"Wait, so, there's an evil organization that has world domination in sights, and they're... projecting brain waves into the real world?\" A combination of unexplained, bogus terminology and an even more confusing basic plot structure only serve to confuse and disappoint the watcher.\\n\\n\r\nThe appalling plot is not even the worst aspect of the show. Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd features perhaps the worst cast of main characters to ever appear in animation. Unsurprisingly, with 7 main characters in a one-cour show, most of them either get close to no character development, or get the most forced character development possible. Each girl is focused on for about 2 episodes, and then effectively becomes a side character in the show. This creates 6 different heroines with two-dimensional and bland personalities. In fact, a lot of the time, the characters in the show are used simply to inject more information or terminology to create a more convoluted story. \\n\\n\r\nThe only non-heroine main character, the protagonist of the show, is nearly impossible to bear with. Takumi is an anime-obsessed hikikomori that sounds like he has some sort of combination of asthma and crippling anxiety whenever he speaks. His levels of paranoia and extreme social awkwardness make it nearly impossible to sympathize with him, or even understand what he's thinking at any given moment. Throughout the show, Takumi transitions from his already bad form, the asthmatic paranoiac otaku, into an even worse character: a suicidal Soren Kierkegaard. He just kind of walks around and spouts existentialist rubbish. Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd would honestly be a more enjoyable show had Takumi been replaced with a wooden board.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get on to the non-appalling parts of the show: art and music.\\n\r\nLet's start with art. For 2008 standards, the animation style is average at best. Madhouse probably didnt get a very high budget for the series, since the source material, the Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd visual novel, is nothing to write home about. The characters all look decent.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is easily the best part of the show. An above average opening theme by Kanako Ito, and an alright ending theme were about the only times that I enjoyed watching Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd. The background music is absolutely horrid; however, it is quite fitting for how bad the show is. The background music and sound effects manage to create more suspense than the plot itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend anyone who decides to watch Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd to first look up their nearest suicide hotline, and then save that number into their phone for easy access.",

He is an Otaku that has failed at life basically, living in a container with his computer and anime figures totally isolated from the world excluding the few occasions he goes to school on. The thing that will catch your attention right of the start is that Takumi is having severe delusions that alter his reality. Right after the first episode we get throwninto a murder case, which Takumi is somehow connected to. It is hinted that he is suffering from Scizophrenia and/or other pshycological issues. This makes one want to know more. Who is the murder? Can it be Takumi himself, doing it with another personality? Anyhow, a lot of questions pop up leaving you in despair once the episode is over and you realize you don\u2019t have the next episode downloaded.  So what does the anime make out of all this? Ill make it short: Nothing. The pshycological feel is totally crushed in episode 4 when we get to know a little of the truth about everything and the anime here derails into some sort of bad fantasy adventure with swords and what-not. oh, did I forget to mention that Takumis harem also steadily arrives as the show progresses? That\u2019s right, weird girls keep coming up all the time, and all but one of them likes takumi. I was going to score the story a 6, but while I was writing this I remembered how I had trouble finishing the show, so it gets a 5. \\n\\n\r\n[7]Art:  Well, it is Madhouse, so I cant say anything other than its good. The only thing lacking was the characters, and especially the girls. They just felt to.. animated! I don\u2019t know, they just felt lifeless to me. The backgrounds and such we\u2019re good though.  So the art gets a 7, had the characters been better it would have gotten an 8. \\n\\n\r\n[7]Sound: I have nothing to complain on about the sound, but im not going to praise it either. Its mediocre, perhaps even a little better than that. The good thing about the sound is that they used the appropriate sound at the right moments, which gives a better feel to the show as a whole. \\n\r\n  As for the voice acting, I think that Takumis VA did a great job. He expressed Takumis feelings really good, and it made him come to live, unlike the other characters. That said, I don\u2019t think that the other voice actors did a bad job, but it wasn\u2019t really memorable in any way.  So the sound gets a 7, much like the art, it could have gotten an 8 had it just been a little better. \\n\\n\r\n[5]Characters: ok, so what to say about the characters. I already introduced Takumi to you, but ill just rant a little more about him anyway. So as I said he is a looser otaku with delusions bla bla, and he is perhaps, the best characters in the whole show. To be more exact, I think that he is the best character. His life situation is pictured pretty well, he is an otaku that doesn\u2019t know that much about life, have a hard time socializing with people etc. it all makes him feel alive. This said its not like I think that he\u2019s a VERY good characters, he\u2019s fine, that\u2019s all. All the other characters are stereotypes you\u2019ll hate as soon as you see them, or else you\u2019ll learn to hate them as the show progresses. There really isn\u2019t anything to say about them, they are just uninteresting and have no real personality nor feel to them. I was a little unsure if I should give it a 5 or a 6 as a score, but in the end it got a 5. Takumi just wasn\u2019t enough to cover the fact that all the other characters sucked. \\n\\n\r\n[5]Enjoument: The first episodes was great, then it derailed. After having watched around half the show I had it on \u201con-hold\u201d for some weeks before finishing it. Even now I don\u2019t really know why I just didn\u2019t drop it there. This should speak for itself as for how much I enjoyed the ride. The show tries to be serious, but fails. Its just like how Death note tries to be to serious sometimes, just that you don\u2019t laugh at Death note on those occasions\u2026 Imagine Light throwing the death note away, then he buys a sword and goes around killing criminals with it. Still trying to be as serious as before. That\u2019s kind of how Chaos head is/was. Anyway, it gets a 5, and this goes for the overall score aswell. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n",

            "content": "A show where the name itself, Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd, is meant to be taken literally. Your head will be filled with chaos as you attempt to understand what is going on.\r\nThe beauty of Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd is that the show itself is a mystery. The rushed pacing of the show in combination with the intentional mysterious plot made it difficult to keep a handle on what was going on. I cannot count the number of times I said, out loud, \"What the hell is going on?\" I feel like the writers were trying to make this something unique that stood out as a gem among the crowd. They didmanage to make Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd unique, but not necessarily in the way they intended.\\n\\n\r\nBefore watching this, I did take a peek at other reviews to see what the general consensus on the show was, or lack thereof. Some outright call the show a flop, while others appreciated the uniqueness of it. I decided to give it a go and make my own opinion on it. The first episode had some interesting lead-ins, places where a highly interesting story would have developed. I was looking forward to something special, though I figured I was setting myself up for disappointment. Oh boy did I set myself up. Like a bat out of hell, the story jumped off a cliff. Or so it seemed. For the vast majority of the show, the viewer is left confounded by \"technobabble\", unsound science, and plot twists, all of which were bundled up into a mysterious burrito for you to eat. It is not until episodes 10 and 11 that answers to the many questions brought up since the beginning receive answers. As a mystery genre anime, the show excels at keeping the viewer thinking about the possibilities of what could have happened. The mystery aspect aside, the plot line itself is rather iffy. While the lead up to the finale seemed to fit, a sudden deus ex machina sent thing astray. Had this anime been 24 episodes instead of 12, I think things would have been able to develop at a more appropriate pace and it likely would have been a far better series.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the story itself, Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd follows the life of Takumi Nishijou, a shut-in otaku who is so out of touch with reality at times that his mind synthesizes his favorite game character into being his wife. His quiet life is suddenly cast into disarray as a series of gruesome murders and suicides, known as the New Generation Madness, spring up in his home city of Shibuya, Tokyo. His distaste for the \"three dimensional world\" leads him to initially brush this off as not important to him; however, as fate would have it, he is thrown into the mix as he witnesses one of the murders first hand. His already fragile mind is snapped and he (and by extension the viewer) gradually becomes unable to differentiate his delusions from reality. The way he reacts to his distorting situation mirrors how the viewer reacts to this show - immense confusion, accompanied by a lack of words. \"Errors,\" as they are called by Sena Aoi (one of the main characters), are causing the world to collapse and it is up to those who can see them to prevent them and \"save the world.\" Scientifically unproven concepts are also brought up, especially from episode 5 onwards. What are known as lunar-biorhythms, the effect of the moon on our body, are an example of such. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I wont go any further with the story aspect.\\n\\n\r\nGoing on to the cast, there is an overload of \"main\" characters present in Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd. For a 12 episode anime, seven characters to focus on is too many. I found myself confused for the first several episodes as to the purpose of these characters, especially as to why they were being given mixed personalities. With many characters present, many \"magically\" disappeared for periods of time, only to return with details that would advance the story in a confusing, and somewhat forced, manner. That said, they all had a purpose and each had their necessary roles. Sadly though, their personalities remained mostly static, especially the MC who was consistently annoying to me. Though development of the characters is lacking, their portrayal improved the show and I would consider this part of the show \"mediocre\" overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork proved to be par for the course, I think. The main characters are all high school students, so it's generic dress code galore! But seriously, who the hell makes students wear PLAID pants/skirts!? The Di-Swords (those giant purple things in the cover picture) are pretty cool looking, in both forms they are depicted in, though. Aside from that, there's nothing that really makes the show stand out from the artwork perspective, in my opinion, but there's nothing bad about it either. This is a different story when looking at the audio. The series' opening and ending themes are \"F.D.D.\" and \"Super Special\" (performed by J-pop artists Kanako It\u014d and Seira Kagami, respectively). While \"F.D.D.\" felt appropriate as the opening, I was woefully displeased by \"Super Special.\" Initially, I found myself laughing hysterically when the words \"You're always super special...\" were uttered. For a non-romcom show, \"Super Special\" felt completely out of place. Within the actual show, there isn't much to speak of with the audio. Most of the time it was appropriate and enhanced the situation, while sometimes it fell short of expectations.\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to see why Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd has received such mixed reviews. Due to the confusing and rushed nature of the story, one can quickly become disinterested in it and fail to appreciate the mystery portrayed. I wouldn't recommend this as a light watch, though it's not something deep either. It's more of a mentally stimulating show, getting you to think about things in a different way. If you are one who enjoys mystery, I definitely would give this show a go. You'll appreciate the many twists and turns this show takes in attempts to throw the viewer off from where the truth lies.",

            "content": "So- to begin, I enjoyed this series.  Yes it was interesting and slightly difficult to get into and wrap around the whole concept but once into the anime it gets more understandable.\r\nStory-8: Reason-again with most 12 episode anime they had a lot of ideas and fewer episodes to get them all in. But they manage to pull it off. They added multiple characters that are delicately intertwined and revolve around one another in some way. The concept of the mind is always present in the anime and must always be included when making decisions about it- because not all is what it appears andone can be fooled. I would suggest watching the anime in maybe one full go or maybe over 2-3 days without missing, because you will have some difficultly putting loose ends together.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8-Reason: I'll be honest, since I'm not an artist, and I didn't want to say that this anime's art-style is like every other anime, that's just not good enough. This anime had great art work, especially in the form of the weapons used. Again because this anime focused around what the mind could do and create the artwork to assist that idea along was detailed, and colorful. I would suggest focusing more on the Di-swords since their designs and the main thing. The character's designs are I suppose common but they do have their individual styles. Ranging from long-haired to short, colors from pink to silver, black, and blonde. The eye colors all matching and added to the characters. At some points feathers, and sparkling of the Di-swords happens(won't give too much) but it usually symbolizes something within the anime and it was rather beautiful how it was done. The background is decent. The city scenes again depict what Tokyo looks like(most part, not making too generalized statements), and when it comes to certain scenes for example the first scene you see in the anime- will change your mood. It's dark, you're curious as to how it happened, and this is where the artwork gets /very/ into things.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7-Reason:Not alot to go on when it comes to the sound. Depending on if you watch subbed or dubbed the voices are amazing. Some characters have their switch-moments where they sound one way then another. On average really for background sounds, yeah you get the delusion sounds-which are kinda creepy, and the rain in the beginning of the anime- the fighting with the swords does sound like it looks. The series keeps one opening and one ending all throughout-  and I personally loved them. The beat is something you can rock or nod your head to, and the female lead has such a strong voice, for both songs. The ending has a little English sung(opening does too but around the end) and both songs fits the plot of the anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7-Reason: They added a lot of characters in a short amount of time. And because the anime deals with delusions and false things, what you see in a character may change or not be real at all. There was no extensive background for all the characters- just bits and pieces, but only enough to progress the story and why the characters need to fight. The most detailed of the characters wold possibly be the main one since his comes out of the blue.(Won't reveal more than that). The villains within the anime do a heck of a good job masking themselves until later- but if one can put the pieces together then it is fairly simple. Oh and look out for a guy that looks like a homeless person. ^^\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed it fully which is why I gave it an 8. Yes the only reason it didn't get a 10 was because of the confusion it causes at the beginning and the way all the characters come together. Not saying it's a full on rush just to get them all in, but they were delightful with their own personalities and had meanings. They added some Mythology into it as well which I thought was a good touch since it connected with the plot as well. You'll enjoy the ending, you may even cry.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-8: Reason- the characters-good enough to be their own and progress the story. Artwork and sound- decent to great depending on the scenes, and what was going on. Story and plot over all-confusing, mysterious, but a well-defined one that would give any mystery goer a run for their money. \\n\r\nMy suggestion is if you watch this series, go and watch it first- then watch Stein's;Gate. It has a connection to it.",

            "content": "I went into viewing Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd without a great deal of expectations.  Having read through many of the reviews and hearing some firsthand accounts on it I got the impression that it was going to be an average at best experience.  However this was a show that I had been very interested in seeing since it started airing.  For me it\u2019s a great example of not believing everything you hear.\r\nThe story starts out as a pretty interesting mystery involving a number of grisly murders and a high school boy who believes he has witnessed one of them and is being fed information aboutfuture killings before they happen.  The boy is Takumi, a severely disturbed and socially awkward individual who is terrorized by delusions and paranoia.  The plot feels genuinely creepy at times but doesn\u2019t manage to sustain this over the course of the entire series.  Because of Takumi's delusions the viewer is not always sure what is real or what isn\u2019t.  It does take some significant detours and while it\u2019s not the smartest thing I have ever seen, in my opinion it managed to be interesting through the end.  However one might feel about how the story changed focus over the course of the show, I did feel that it ended very nicely with most of the loose ends tied off.\\n\\n\r\nTakumi's character for me was extremely interesting.  Sure he is a stereotype of a socially awkward otaku, but what makes him a great character is his personality.  He is an extremely disturbed person.  His inability at times to know what is real or what isn\u2019t made him fascinating.  I enjoyed how he coped with his fear of others by imagining his favorite anime character as a companion.  I felt the story did a great job in developing him and having him overcome his fears and questions about his own existence.\\n\\n\r\nSadly as good as I felt Takumi was as a character, the rest of the cast is quite uninspired.  The girls all fall into the usual patterns that we see in every anime, from the moe sugar sweet best girlfriend to the brainy and to the cold hearted swordsman.  Still despite this I still enjoyed most of them, particularly Yua and even though they weren\u2019t that groundbreaking.  The villains are equally stale from an originality standpoint.  Their motivations are 2-dimensional and boring and really were a poor foil overall for the heroes to overcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is good for the most part but a little inconsistent at times.  I felt the colors were kind of flat and the styles seemed awfully dated looking.  In addition the character models felt.. familiar.  It didn\u2019t seem like there was any originality in designing them and some of them actually looked like they were ripped directly out of other anime.  I did like the music, the opening was good and I felt set the tone, but the ending while a good song felt out of place considering the subject matter of many of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDespite a number of faults I just can\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t like this show.  It\u2019s not great at anything it does.  The thriller elements of the plot fall a bit flat and the action scenes really aren\u2019t that interesting either.  My interest in the main character and a decent storyline made this an enjoyable experience for me.  I would recommend it, however if you looking for a superb suspense thriller or a great action you\u2019re probably going to be disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "Chaos;Head is a prime example of an anime that collapsed under the weight of its own ambition. In trying so desperately to separate itself from a myriad of other suspenseful thrillers while catering to a pre-selected audience, Chaos;Head spreads itself all of the place, so much so that everything about it is thin, flimsy, and overall disappointing. The end result, however, is stuff of unintended comic gold.\r\nChaos;Head starts fantastic with a very adventurous first episode brimming with possibilities. The play on otaku falling victim to their own delusions, coupled with a series of bizarre homicides was intriguing enough to keep me watching it repeatedly, butthen trouble began to surface. The series began to breach the mysteries it had established with theoretical existentialism, leading into discussions using made-up terminology that goes entirely unexplained and becomes even more convoluted as its short but utterly incomprehensible run comes closer to a finish.\\n\\n\r\nEven more irritating, all of the mysteries and delusions established in the first episode are cast aside as convenient attention-getters. Nothing established in the first episode even matters to the big picture. Also, plot twists, while numerous, are established without any prior knowledge as to what they entail for the cast and revelations do not have any gravitas. The only reason I give the story any points is for the first few episodes alone, before it careened into self-destruction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a little better, but only in certain instances. Main character Takumi is entrancing throughout the first half. His reactions to the mania around him are painfully crafted with a sense of realism so as to have Takumi's reaction become the mirror of the viewer, and it works very well. However, he betrays this reality of self when the series enters into its convoluted style of existentialism and he becomes a living deus ex machina.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls of the series are handled just as carelessly, often with vain attempts at giving them personality quirks but failing to capitalize on them. The only real exception to this is Kozue, but her traits are so forced and intruding, that by &quot;cutesyfing&quot; her the staff made her more off-putting than any other girl. Moreso, the series can only focus on one or two girls at a time, meaning that all the other girls suddenly disappear from the picture. This would be fine, except they often return with a wealth of new information we are forced to assume they learned off-scene.\\n\\n\r\nTechnical aspects are far better than anything the series offers otherwise, but not exceedingly so. The art is fairly average of the typical series these days. Madhouse obviously didn't break the bank, but the looks is acceptable. Takumi's character design, especially his face, is often hard to look at, but the girls all look acceptable. The animation flows well-enough but it's nothing to write home about. An all around average job.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good too, but only in some parts. Namely the theme songs; the first being a catchy Kanako Itou number with lyrics that make no sense but are befitting of the series' storyline, and the closer being an impossibly upbeat tune with lyrics that resemble bad stalker poetry. Sound effects and vocal performances also highlight various sequences. The prior are easily arguable, but the BGM is horribly composed. Not ear-bleedingly so, but still quite bad.\\n\\n\r\nYet for as sharp and horrible a nosedive as Chaos;Head took, I reveled in it. I wanted to see how bad the story got and how awful the characterization became. It may have been a poor series, but it reaches on &quot;so bad its good&quot; territory in the same way a handful of cult classics and B-movies do. It's not for everyone, but you can definitely have a lot of fun laughing at just how awful this series becomes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Chaos;Head a 5 out of 10.",

Many of these mind-twisting series are pretty brilliant, despite being exceedingly obtuse. Chaos;HEAd is definitely not one of these. Filled with nonsensical metaphysical babble, flimsy internal logic, and clearly not as smart as it thinks it is; this show is the perfect example of what happens when a psychological thriller goes completely wrong.\r\nThe show follows a socially inept (to put it VERY lightly) and barely sane anime obsessed recluse named Takumi Nishijou as he is pulled into a reality bending battle with the fate of theworld at stake. Grisly murders and suicides are taking place around the city, throwing it into confusion and fear. Takumi witnesses one murder being committed by a pink haired girl; a girl who appears to him at his school claiming to be his friend and classmate, something that all his acquaintances affirm even though Takumi has no recollection of her. This drives the already unstable Takumi into a paranoid panic, but the more he struggles to get back to his hermit lifestyle, the further he is sucked into a world of conspiracy theories and horrific happenings; as well as running into more cute yet strange girls.\\n\\n\r\nThis animated adaptation of a visual novel seems to be trying to do a lot of things. It tries to deconstruct or at least put a dark twist on the harem trend by giving its gaggle of girls twisted or scarred personalities. It tries to bring forth existential ideas with theories of how the mind perceives things and mind-powered reality bending abilities. It tries to be an intricately plotted suspense thriller, filled with hallucinatory imagery and cryptic ominousness concerning a prophesy, an evil organization, and a mysterious man in a wheelchair. The problem here is not a lack of ambition, the problem is that the show fails to execute well on anything it attempts.\\n\\n\r\nDespite giving most of the cast damaged and twisted psyches, the story fails to make any of its characters compelling because they are just not believable. To put it simply, the characters do not act or behave like actual people. Takunm is so far gone that it pretty much impossible to relate to him. Imagine taking Satou from Welcome to the NHK and stripping him of the humanity which made him a compelling character, leaving only his extreme dysfunctions. Now imagine the show playing his insane ineptness as straight drama, rather than dark comedy; and you have Takumi. Takumi is a one dimensional caricature of a crazy otaku rather than a complex fleshed out character; so his turmoil and insecurities ring hollow. The rest of the cast pretty much follows suit. The gaggle of girls that surrounds Takumi is a collection of graphic novel stereotypes, devoid of much personality besides their strange mental dispositions. The main antagonist, who is revealed later in the series, lacks any kind of understandable motive; he's evil and wants to rule the world because the plot needed some kind of bad guy, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also tries way too hard to build tension. To be fair, the techniques it uses are pretty commonplace in psychological thrillers. Strange camera angles and hallucinatory are very useful tools to create an effective chiller. Unfortunately, the staff of Chaos;HEAd lacks the skill to use them effectively. There is no subtly to the suspense in the series, and as a result it is often ends up being unintentionally funny. Moments of high tension and sinister revelations happen sporadically with no rhyme or reason, making the plot unfold very unnaturally. \\n\\n\r\nJust as bad is all the meta-physical babble in the series, in fact, that is probably the worst part. The shows has some 'interesting' concepts about the world, and how the mind can perceive and influence it, which are so far from reality they barely make sense at all. Unfortunately, the show is intent on trying pass off this confused jumble of ideas as something poignant. Worse yet, some of the concepts in the show are so implausible that the show spends a good amount of time with exposition to explain the convoluted logic behind them. Underneath all of this is a rather basic plot involving an evil organization bent on taking over the world and the unlikely heroes who must stop them that is over-complicated by all the nonsense the show puts us through.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Chaos;HEAd doesn't look bad, just woefully uninspired. The character designs are the placid moe-fied girls and plain looking guys; they are neither particularly appealing or hideous, but just kind of boring to look at because we see characters that look like this all the time. Backgrounds are fairly well detailed, but just like the characters, there is just nothing eye catching. The animation is standard quality for TV anime, nothing flashy with moments of choppiness, but nothing horrendous. Obscure camera angles and other effects are used quite frequently, but seldom effectively. The show does such a poor job at properly setting the mood that the effects come across as an obnoxious, failed attempt to be artsy. The soundtrack is sparingly used and when it is used, it hits a lukewarm semi-successful at best. There are many scenes in the show without music, but even in scenes with a track playing, the music just kind of fades away in the back ground, or is played at a blurring high volume. There are moments when the soundtrack is used to good effect, but they are rare and far between.\\n\\n\r\nChaos;HEAd is an exceptionally bad waste of 12 episodes. It is a show that takes half-baked ideas and tries to present them as something intelligent with endless psychological babble. Behind all the quasi-philosophical mumbo jumbo is a generic, and honestly, rather dull plot. Despite all the pretense of depth, Chaos;HEAd is poorly conceived creation devoid of believable characters, compelling storytelling, and worst of all, intelligence.",

A loser boy who can only...have fantasies about his...*yawns*...make-believe girlfriend issuddenly thrown into...a battle with people who are linked in a string of...zzz....oh wait, what?? Story is lame and the plot twists are so convoluted, unbelievable, and are just awful. \\n\\n\r\nEvery character looked like they were ripped off some other anime, and the fights scenes were short and pointless. I mean, couldn't you shell out a little more money on this? It seems they decided to do like other anime and impress the viewer with the excellent story and great characters, so they didn't pay up for the technical aspects. Unfabulous, isn't it? Sound was terrible. Those voices were graty and annoying, and the music was bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were pathetic, as I am not surprised based off the crap story. The main character is a wuss who doesn't even know how to interact with humans. While this could be all right, people TALK to him, like they WANT to be around him when clearly he doesn't give a cow's ass about them. I mean, take Welcome to the NHK. That guy didn't want to be around anyone, but when someone reached out to him, he took their hand. And he's not a bad guy. The guy of Chaos;Head has no personality, nothing likeable about him, so why do all these girls wanna be around him?? All the girls were like talking Barbie dolls. Instead of getting a comb along with the package, you get a sword. Whoop-de-doo.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this. Although I know most people will since they think it's an anime that will make them smarter. If you're dumb enough to think this anime is intelligent...that's sad.",

            "content": "This review is biased, because I read the VN. I thought about writing a review that does not mention the VN at all, but I that I'd rather write one that does, one that mentions the VN throughout the whole review.\r\nIt's also a long-ass review. Did I mention that I'm rambling on the game?\r\nCh\u00e4oS;HEAd is an adaptation of a popular Visual Novel of the same name, spanning 12 episodes.\r\nJust from the idea of a 30-40+ hours Visual Novel adapted into a 12 episode anime (about 5-6 hours) you already know that many segments will be shortened or cut off completely, unless it is only thefirst season out of few, which is not.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first read the synopsis of the game: \"Takumi is withdrawn and is not interested in 3D things\" I already had a great interest in playing the game.\\n\r\nMixed with a mysterious serial murder case and Takumi chatting with people in the internet, staying in his room most of the time... it sounded like an excellent idea.\\n\\n\r\nI installed the game and started to play it (without knowing Japanese) and just from the beginning I was hooked. The menu music and design, the atmosphere in the beginning of the game.. it has blown me away.\\n\r\nAnd when I knew that a translation project has just started and is progressing fast, only a few months after the game came out.. I looked forward to this real bad.\\n\\n\r\nA few months later, Right when the before the anime started, finally a decent beta patch came out (playable with pretty much the whole game, unlike the patches that came out before that).\\n\\n\r\nI started playing the game and in the next day, I watched the first episode of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlready, I noticed a few differences between the anime and the game, but overall, the differences were not that great, and the anime had a good start.\\n\\n\r\nI finished the game after some time, and while it had mixed reviews from other people, personally, I enjoyed playing the game very much - even if it suffered from some problems which I overlooked because it was thoroughly an enjoyable experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nWhile progressing in the anime I felt that the anime lacked the emotion that was present in the game, but overall it did a nice job following the main storyline without any problems up until episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't wait to watch episode 7, because the most interesting stuff are about to begin from here, if it had followed the game.\\n\\n\r\nTo my surprise and disappointment, episode 7 had some significant changes , emitting one of the best parts of the game, and made the anime lose all the horror and suspense parts it had up until now (even if they were few in number).\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 8 was an episode that was not present in the game at all.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 9 followed the game, but rendered episode 8 unneeded completely. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 10 emitted all the best parts from the game, completely, and was censored as hell, more than others, and was not enjoyable for me at all.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 11 was bad, and censored as well.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 12, the final episode,was good, considering that the previous episodes were a trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\nWow, that was a long introduction. So lets get to the technical details:\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10: Rushed, best segments from the game were not present in the anime, lacked feeling, lacked almost all of the horror and suspense elements.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 6/10: Character designs were simplistic, and while the animation was really good in some scenes, it was choppy as hell in others.\\n\r\nWhile some backgrounds were done beautifully, most of the background characters were done so badly, really badly.\\n\\n\r\nSo in one word... inconsistent. In Two words, very inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: I think I'm one of the few people that liked the anime OP more than the game OP. The ED was great too, I never skipped the OP or the ED not even once.\\n\r\nThe background music was really nice.\\n\r\nAll the voice actors did a great job, and overall in the sound department it gets a 9/10. Why not 10/10? because the anime was rushed and the script was rushed , the voice actors had to rush it too, and it's a shame. Because of that, many scenes lacked the feelings that were presented in a much more superior way in the game.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: While in the game, some of the characters were stereotypical and undeveloped, I liked pretty much all the characters, and especially Takumi.\\n\\n\r\nTakumi is a stereotype of a withdrawn person that is not interested in 3D things.\\n\r\nHe's pretty much the biggest stereotype of an anime Otaku almost Hikki  that barely goes to school just to graduate), collecting figurines, shuts himself in his room all day, playing MMO's, living on a container on the roof, has an imaginary anime character WAIFU (He likes her more than all of his other WAIFUS) that he faps and fantasizes about all day up until the point that he talks to her when he's alone and her voice is served as his inner voice giving him the ideal advices for him when he's in a pinch... getting to the shoes of a guy like that can't get more interesting for me. It was so awesome for me to know what Takumi thinks about, the fact that he barely talks in the game, the fact that he doesn't trust anyone.... the way that his characters was developed and was faced with all the crap he has to go through it was amazing. I found myself agreeing with him, being amused by him... I just really like his character.\\n\\n\r\nNow the anime... take his character, make him less pathetic, make him more talkative, and the fact that you barely hear him thinking... suddenly I didn't care what happens to him as I did in the game. He was much more flat, and it goes to almost all the characters in the anime compared to the game, mainly because of the changes in the anime and the fact that it was rushed. I didn't like the Imouto because she wasn't as moe in the game... the same goes to pretty much all the other characters (Rimi, Sena, Ayase, Yua , detective Ban, Shogun, Suwa, Hazuki, even Daisuke... and so on).\\n\\n\r\nI liked  Kozu-Pii just like I liked her in the game... maybe I liked Kozu-Pii a little more in the anime. I'm not sure about this. It's just that I didn't care what happens to the characters as I did in the game, because it was rushed, and the new mediocre story segments made things only worse in the development of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: The most important factor for me. Did I enjoy the anime? Most of the time? yes. Did I did not enjoy the anime at other parts? yes.\\n\r\nI had some mixed feelings, really. But I guess the reason I'm giving this a 7 in not a 6 as I planned because to my surprise... I enjoyed the last episode. No other hidden meanings here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was a:\\n\\n\r\n In one world: Trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\nIn four words ( I think..):Trainwreck that I enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nIn eight words (Wait.. I'm not sure here): Trainwreck that I enjoyed most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this anime? You should decide for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat is all for this long ass ramble first review. To my surprise, it didn't take me long to write this. I guess that I wrote what I thought, simple as that. Sorry for the spelling mistakes and all other shit. \\n\\n\r\nSayonara.",

            "content": "Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd is a Supernatural, Psychological, Mystery, whatever that literally gives a new meaning to the term \u201cmind-f**k\u201d. Whichever way you feel about this series, whether you like its intriguing set-up or detest its absurdity, there\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s a complete mess.\r\nFollowing the life of some loser otaku, Takumi Nishijou is a high school student living life in his own little world of online gaming, anime and perverse fantasies. Then one fateful day he wonders into some gruesome murder scene, changing his current life dramatically, as extreme paranoia sets in. Well that\u2019s the introduction, in a nutshell and like most people I struggled to makesense of this absurd anime that felt like watching the Matrix on crack, whilst also watching Scanner Darkly of LSD. But we are not alone as the main character struggles to make sense of what\u2019s going on as well and it isn\u2019t until halfway into the series that some light is finally shed on our confused minds; with some much needed plot exposition. It\u2019s just a shame that whatever explanations into what the series is about will go over most people\u2019s heads and I\u2019ll be wasting my time trying to explain it myself.\\n\\n\r\nHowever what can be explored are the characters, as this series is full of a weird bunch. As stated before the main protagonist is some loser otaku Takumi, who\u2019s pretty much like a more freakishly annoying version of Tatsuhiro Satou from Welcome to the NHK. What more can be said about this deluded kid, except that it\u2019s weird how this series became a bit of a harem when all of a sudden his surrounded by bishoujo. Naming all of them would be a pain, so just think of all the character types found in your typical visual novel/eroge and give them weird psychological complexes.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the animation and music was great, with a credible amount of effort put in by studio Madhouse clearly evident in this area. The character designs and action moments are plain rubbish but the scenery and objects are certainly portrayed incredibly well. Also the music is pretty fascinating, since it has some eerie tunes to set a weird tone for this weird series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd was a fairly interesting anime as it was more like a homage to a portion of the otaku world, whilst trying to give a serious story. About halfway into the series it certainly piqued my interest, with all the weird theories they were throwing about but for the most part it made little sense.\\n",

            "content": "I know a lot of people hate Chaos;Head for some reason or another, but damnit, I thought it was good. I originally watched it in July of 2010 and gave it a 10/10. Was that score deserved? What did I like about it so much before? It'd been so long I figured I'd re-watch it and give it a proper rating and review. \r\nPeople criticize Chaos;Head as a convoluted mess, but I disagree. There were some times that complicated points in the storyline were explained at a rather fast pace; perhaps not exactly \"easy\" to follow, but I don't think it was hard either. Foranyone who didn't get it, this series is a lot like an anime version of The Matrix. \\n\\n\r\n- - - S T O R Y - - - \\n\r\nThroughout the entire show, I found the story to be quite intriguing. The show is filled with mysterious identities and mysterious happenings, which unravel over time with a natural flow. Nothing felt forced or tacked on to me. Perhaps getting a lecture about electromagnetic waves and human senses out of the blue felt \"forced\" to some, but I think the timing was appropriate and the characters explaining obviously did so intentionally, planning it out ahead of time. \\n\\n\r\nChaos;Head has a few \"reveals\", the main one being something personal about Takumi. I found all of them to be decently executed. Takumi's big reveal was led up to more and I felt it was quite well done. Some anime series will just randomly throw plot twists at you without being convincing at all, just expecting you to accept any changes it brings. Takumi's character development was smooth and believable. Some may argue otherwise, but it's not like he just did a 180 outta nowhere. The confidence the Di-Sword would bring, the relationship he built, the immense power and understanding he acquired, etc. I think is more than enough reason to give him a little bit of courage. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two minor plot holes in this series. The first is Rimi's involvement with the New Gen incident from the first episode. There is never any explanation as to why she was there. However, it honestly feels like it doesn't matter. We can assume she was there for any number of reasons, even that it was just a delusion attack on Takumi. The answer has no bearing on the story, really. \\n\r\nThe second is how all the female characters acted like friends and as if they all knew each other in the final episode. This was a little silly since most of them have never met before, but also not a huge deal, and it can also be explained away as a result of Takumi's delusions. They all go to the same school, anyway, so it wouldn't be too unusual to be slightly familiar with each other.\\n\\n\r\n- - - A R T - - - \\n\r\nThe art is average for the most part. There's the rare inconsistency with Takumi's hairstyle, but it's really not a big deal. Cutesy anime girls with outrageous hairstyles, the usual. The art and animation is as good as any other average anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe part I really liked about the art is the effects that were used at certain tense moments. A desolate world where there is only Takumi and Shogun... A place where you must absolutely not be, where you can feel your very existence is at stake... A dark hallway that is clearly off limits... It just added so much more feeling to the scenario, as if you were right there with the characters. \\n\\n\r\n- - - S O U N D - - - \\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are among my favourites from all the anime I've seen. They've got a good sound and good singers. The opening theme's intensity doesn't feel like it's all there since the show's full of cutesy anime girls and some parts of the opening animation aren't exactly exciting. Still, it's a very good song. The ending is one of two songs I've heard from Seira Kagami; I feel like I really gotta check out more of her stuff, she definitely sings better than your average idol or squeamish high pitched girl. I'm sure people would think the song is just gay since she says \"super special\", but you gotta remember English isn't her first language, there's bound to be some poorly phrased sentences. Still, I think it's a very good j-pop song. It may not fit the whole series' mood, but it fits the ending. Make of that what you will.\\n\\n\r\nTakumi's voice actor does the job great. I love how Takumi creepily/uneasily laughs to himself and how he sounds uneasy and troubled. The rest of the cast is just average roles, and they do that fine. \\n\\n\r\nI find the music in Chaos;Head to be pretty interesting and to fit the mood perfectly. It's common for anime to have overly silly and upbeat songs whenever the character does something silly or to just have boring music that you don't even really notice. Instead, Chaos;Head opts for simple piano pieces to gently give you the right feeling. The tense moments have incredible distorted piano pieces and awkward, creeping, noisy tracks. Most anime will just give you some exciting \"action\" music at the heated moments, but Chaos;Head gives you something chilling - a taste of insanity itself. I love it. \\n\\n\r\n- - - C H A R A C T E R S - - - \\n\r\nTakumi - He is an awesome character. He's a weak, cowardly otaku who daydreams of a life with his 2D waifu and tries his hardest to not be the main character. That part is okay, but what's really great about him is his extreme negativity, paranoia, and his general attitude and reactions to events. His uneasy smile and weak little laugh, averting his eyes from other people, walking ahead of people who are talking to him... Overall, he's just a hilarious character, and his otaku references are a bonus for anime fans. It's also cool that he hangs out on the computer, plays MMORPGs all day, and uses Google and Wikipedia to solve his life problems, much like the rest of us. \\n\\n\r\nShogun - I thought it was interesting how they presented a harmless, shriveled up old man in a wheelchair as some mysterious and cryptic being with unknown allegiances. The fact that they made a character like that interesting in any way is impressive, especially in a sub-culture where people only care about cute girls. \\n\\n\r\nRimi - Just another anime girl throwing herself at the main character? Not really, she has a good reason for it. All of her actions make sense at the end, which I think is great. I'd say they should've developed her character more, but it's hard to imagine how they could've; she was fine. \\n\\n\r\nYua - Like Rimi, there are also good reasons for her actions. Her character development is generic at first, but her first plot twist makes her pretty interesting. \\n\\n\r\nKishimoto - Also has reasons behind her actions and how she gets close to Takumi. I know that's pretty bland to keep saying, but I don't wanna spoil things. \\n\\n\r\nSena - It was kinda silly how she literally carried her sword at all times. I mean, even if no one else can see it, she would be looking pretty stupid walking around in public as if she's holding a sword resting on her shoulder. Her backstory gave her a fine motive for the story, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls overall - Not exactly interesting by themselves, but not as typical as you'd think at first glance. If you think you'll be seeing \"the down to earth one\", \"the sporty one\", \"the shy one\", etc. like in other harems, you're mistaken. In fact, this isn't even really a harem. The girls don't flirt with the main character or try to start relationships, they don't blush at him, they don't accidentally show him panties, etc. They're mainly just there for the sake of the plot and allowing Takumi's character to develop. Maybe they could've been more intricate like Takumi himself if there were fewer girls, but I guess I'm not really complaining. The story was fine as it was, whether they were necessary or not. This would've been better if they weren't flaunted as the representatives of this anime for general otaku appeal, though.\\n\\n\r\n- - - E N J O Y M E N T - - -\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy when Takumi had delusions about the girls playing out some hentai scenario or when he accidentally touched Rimi's breast (though his dating sim references were funny). These kinda things (the ecchi) are just way too overdone and boring to be any remote point of interest. However, I can respect that Chaos;Head didn't make any effort to actually make it erotic. It felt more like silly anime shenanigans, not like \"I can't tell if I'm watching anime or porn\". \\n\\n\r\nI also respect that Chaos;Head didn't bother with bloody violence/gore. I mean, there were some little visions of horror, but they didn't emphasize on it much - they left things more to your imagination. It's not that I'm afraid of a little blood or anything, I liked seeing that in Hellsing Ultimate before. The reason I respect Chaos;Head for not doing the same is because gore has become a simple little trick anime producers use for shock value. They insert it when it isn't even really appropriate and people just gobble it up. Chaos;Head simply didn't need it, and I think it's good that they acknowledged that. \\n\\n\r\nI found this series to be enjoyable the whole way through, though I think the ending and final battle felt a little... I dunno, lacking for a climax. I think it's because the villain had a very good and valid reason for his schemes, whereas our heroes didn't have very solid grounds to oppose him. If it were a debate, the good guys would lose hands down - they only won by using force, like brutes. They did rationalize it a bit better afterwards, but it felt kinda hard to get into that battle while it was happening. \\n\\n\r\nFor anyone complaining about how things don't make enough scientific sense to apply to the real world, c'mon... it's just a sci-fi story. Of course they're gonna stretch the truth a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, it's funny how \"Wikipedia\" in this series is \"Wiki-pedophilia\". \\n\\n\r\n- - - O V E R A L L - - -\\n\r\nWell, I suppose I can't recommend Chaos;Head to everyone since it's evident that a ton of people hate it. It's just 12 episodes and starts off really exciting, though, so you don't have much to lose. It's more creative and original than the majority of anime you'll come across, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nI dunno, I think people are just missing the point and getting hung up on how they didn't understand the concept of the delusions. Chaos;Head literally asks you if you can really be sure that what you see is reality, and tells you that the only way you can know for sure is if other people confirm it. Say one person is colour blind and thinks something is gray, but 10 other people think that same object is yellow. It is yellow because everyone else says it's yellow, even if you can't comprehend that. They take it to an extreme that some people believe and some people do not. There are many ways you can interpret this line of thinking. Is God real, or does he only exist because so many people believe he does? Is history the truth, or is it fabricated? If your brain can send signals to increase or decrease your body temperature (such as when you're sick or sleeping), could it go so far as to give you physical burns or let you freeze to death? Can you say a rainbow exists, or is it only there because you perceive it to be there?\\n\\n\r\nI think it's interesting that an anime series based itself on perceptions and \"belief\" itself. This anime isn't extremely deep, and I really don't think the plot was that complicated to understand, but it is somewhat thought provoking. Apparently too much for some people, I suppose.",

            "content": "I haven't played the game, nor have I read the visual novel, so I cannot compare and point out about differences or things left out. Thus, this review is about the anime only.\r\nChaos;Head... I'm going to be honest, and say that Chaos;Head was a real disappointment. The concept is fairly original. I give points for that. If you were like me, I was expecting a fairly elaborate plot with twists and suspense, but Chaos;Head severely lacked that, and thus, it turned out having a really mediocre and a down right uninteresting result. To fit this kind of a story-line, into such a short space oftime, obviously was not a very good idea, and the result of this is of huge disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nAn Otaku called Takumi lives by himself and excludes himself from the rest of the world. One day, he receives a message from a mysterious &quot;Shougun&quot; with a link to a highly disturbing image of a person staked onto a wall. The next day, after walking through Shibuya, he runs into an alleyway, and accidentally stumbles into a man having been staked to a wall, exactly that in which he saw in the image. As it turns out, these are a series of mysterious seemingly supernatural events referred to, as the &quot;New Generation&quot;. Eventually, Takumi gets caught-up with the events of &quot;New Generation&quot; and becomes paranoid of things around him and starts having delusions. He becomes troubled as to who he can trust, what aren't delusions, and who is this mysterious &quot;Shougun&quot; who seems to be around him all the time?\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series was rather strong. It was very well set up, and had a lot of potential in becoming &quot;one of the greats&quot;. Elements of being a very well thought out psychological thriller were present, with small bits of science mixed in with the mythology of the story. Slowly released questions and answers: Good! Although, once it hit around the half way mark, the storyline and plot just began to fall apart, and once it hit the final straight, it basically just blew up on itself. Things became way too obvious. Some scenes became almost pointless. Even when things were still mysterious in some sort of way, the answer was just thrown at you. There are too many times where you could say &quot;Why didn't you do that in the first place!?&quot; and &quot;Isn't it obvious?&quot;. They seemed way too rushed, and definitely were not very well thought out. The small amount of romance in the story didn't help at all and it really all seemed a little tacky. As far as I could tell, they just made the story lamer than what it had already become. Where were the twists? Where was the unexpected? Where was the &quot;I want more!&quot; feeling?\\n\\n\r\nOne guy surrounded by a whole lot of girls? Fine, if you can pull it off well, then sure. I'd have no objections to that. However, each girl did not play a large enough role. A lot of the times, it was as if they were &quot;just there&quot; without much purpose. Takumi was just way too wimpy and cowardly in the beginning. Good ol' brother-sister personalities are fun, and Kozue added a little more fun into the storyline.  Overly obnoxious villain? How original... I'll give points to Takumi's and Sena's past as they're history is certainly interesting, along with Shougun's true identity. Although these played a fairly direct role in the plot, really, the characters were all rather dull and not complex enough.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and character design were rather standard. The character's weren't elaborate, but it worked. There were really no inconsistencies in animation, and the sword designs were certainly interesting and nicely detailed. There really isn't anything outstanding in the OP and ED. They didn't quite fit along with the storyline that well either. The musical score seemed to have trouble in deciding how it wants to fit. I mean, the score wasn't bad as such. It just seemed... well... unfitting with the mood and tone of the scene. In some aspects of the story, the soundtrack was fitting, while most of the time, it just didn't help the scene. All the voices seemed to match fairly well with the characters, although there aren't any real standouts, but nothing to complain about either.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap it all up, Chaos;Head really was just a messy, rushed and not very well thought out anime. It just didn't have that suspense, and nor did it have that much complexity. It certainly had huge potential, however the series just couldn't pull it off. Perhaps if the ending weren't as rushed, and things not so obvious and pointless, I'd be able to give it a better score. I feel I'm being a little generous here, and I've given it an overall 6.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nStein's Gate is the 2nd highest rated anime on this entire site. It is universally beloved by anime fans everywhere. However, what about its sister series Chaos Head that takes place in the same world and had the same writer? It is universally disliked! How is this possible? What could have gone so terribly wrong here? Lets take a look.\r\nPlot and Characters: 4/10\r\nThe main character is the boring Hikikomori that we have seen so many times before it is getting old. Unlike Rozen Maiden or Welcome to the NHK, this series doesn't really try to challenge our view of otaku or do a good jobmaking the viewer sympathize with them. He is simply there. A series of gruesome murders begins and you would think that the series would start to get interesting. You thought wrong! Chaos Head is one of the slowest and most boring anime ever made. That isn't really an effective criticism by itself, but if a film is going to be really slow it better do something right to make the effort worthwhile. Chaos Head does NOT deliver in this regard. A kid with a short attention span may complain that a classic film by Bergman or Kurosawa is slow and dull, but the wise adult can point out the philosophy, cinematography, and all the amazing things that the film does well. Chaos Head on the other hand tries to introduce mind blowing ideas with helpful animations, but completely falls on its face. It isn't nearly as intelligent as it clearly thinks it is, and this is quite obvious to the audience. Stein's Gate didn't just rely on \"mind blowing\" time travel theories, but also had solid characters and writing. This is what people actually liked it for! Chaos Head has the ideas, but shitty characters, poor writing, and terrible execution.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack really wasn't that enjoyable or memorable for me. The art is fine, but hardly groundbreaking for the year in which it was made. The production budget is decent, but honestly comes across as lacklustre across the board.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI actually dropped this series halfway through, and it is only 13 episodes. I just had zero desire to waste another minute of my life watching Chaos Head!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series did have some potential and clearly could have done better. I believe it was based on a visual novel, but I haven't read it. Perhaps the original source material was better and this was just a really bad adaptation. If you liked the writing of Chaos Head, but want to see a series that actually has good characters and executes its ideals MUCH better, I would hop on the bandwagon and watch Stein's Gate, which as I mentioned is by the same author.",

I looked it up (on here, actually), saw that it got some decent reviews, and started watching it almost right away.\r\nThis series had a lot of potential. It could have gone the distance. It could have gotten an 8 of 10 from me.\r\nNeedless to say, it didn't...\r\nI'll start with Takumi Nishijou, the male lead. I used to think Shinji Ikari was the most annoying anime character, but Takumi jumped up and nabbed the crown. He's the main reason why I loathethis show.\\n\r\nTakumi spends the majority of the measly twelve episodes whining about the events around him instead of becoming involved in them. Other annoying anime characters tend to have some kind of involvement in the story.Takumi just sat back and cried as his harem took care of everything.\\n\r\nGreat job, Takumi! In my opinion, you're the worst leading character in any of the anime I've seen!\\n\r\nThe only character that held my interest when he wasn't on screen was the police inspector on the murder case. I'm not even going to bother to remember his name, because I have the aching feeling that he's just a bad rip-off of police inspectors in past series (the police inspector in Noein, for example).\\n\r\nThe villains and Takumi's harem girls got little or no development. In fact, I'd venture so far as to say that some of them got less than Takumi.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this show such a low rating because the characters destroy anything that could have been accomplished. I forced myself to watch the last episode just so I could tell people how horrible it was, and I only got that far because the suspense made me want to see some manner of resolution. I would have said a bit about the horrible explanations provided for the powers, except that the basic idea is understandable if you can get past the tech-jargon and some people like to listen to tech-jargon.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, stay away from Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd unless you think the story is worth putting up with the characters.

            "content": "Takumi is a high school student. He is withdrawn and is not interested in 3D things. In his town, a mysterious serial murder case happens and people get panicked. One day, when he chats on the internet, a man suddenly contacts him and gives him an URL. He goes to the website and finds a blog image that suggests a next murder case.... On the next day, it really happens....\r\nTakumi suffers from intense delusions as a result of his apparent schizophrenia and the extremely secluded lifestyle he lives as a hikkikomori. One day he accidentally stumbles upon a gruesome murder scene, a part of achain of events called \"New Generation.\" After this, his life gets caught up in these events, and he meets a bunch of increasingly insane anime girls with swords.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters\\n\r\nAlright, admitedly, looking at the first couple of lines, my first impression was, \"This sounds like a rehashing of 'Welcome to the NHK',\" with some crazy NEET at its center that I could quite easily not give a dang about. Well, alright, I watched it anyway. My first impressions from the first few lines, part right and part wrong. To those of you that are NEET-allergic, sorry to dissappoint you, but that was spot on. To those of you that didn't like NHK or are hoping for something different, you should be happy that it's nothing like NHK.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story progression was spot on to make a great show. They always provided enough information in one episode to get you to start thinking it would go one way, then out of the other side of the field throw you off next episode. (At least, they really landed that home on me and my roommate.)\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of shock factor behind the characters, they did everything spot on. And as I have said earlier they kept me (and my roommate) guessing right up until the end, even about the characters and their motives. The complex nature of entangling affairs that brought everyone to together prior to the final episodes was carefully concealed until the rise into the climatic final battle.\\n\\n\r\nBut the real kicker of Chao;Head, for me, was the use of perspective in the beginning of the series to create this very intimate feeling of who Nishijou Takumi was as a person, and ultimately, how they used that initial feeling and plunged the viewer into a very dark and disturbing story of the different sides of the human heart and both the conscious and unconsious minds we all have.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, alas, we all have to admire the use of Takumi's delusions as both a story device at cementing our understanding of Takumi and his character and the create venue it created for fan service for all audiences and preferences.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the harshness and splendor of this show with the sheer power of its story and implications for our world, throw in some originality, and I can find no better way to have told this modern day scifi mystery thriller with a little spice of ecchi and romance. There was enough of everything. Eat the 10!\\n\\n\r\nAnd on a side note, with a fair backing in modern science, one only realizes that all those spiels that the characters gave throughout the story were pretty accurate and were well depicted. Side note now over, kudos to the staff who added those in to that detail. Power to them!\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nAs an exercise to grading whether the art work style was appropriate for the series, I often think about if other studios had been in charge of everything. And I also compare it to, in cases like this, to the game. I can think of no better studio to have done this and the anime images are on par to those of the game, so they not only did the story justice with them, but they also did the game justice.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that the use of line art style artwork on the Di-swords when normal peopel weren't supposed to see them was quite good, although I tend to think that there must have been some better way of doing it. Yet, for my talk, I can think of no better way to show their presence and maintain the aura that they aren't visible to normal people. Ah! Gotta love conflictions such as these.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the most powerful images in the series came from Takumi's delusions, thankfully, and they should be more memorable than the normal day in the area around Shibuya.\\n\\n\r\nSo...Go 9!\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe vocal cast was diverse and talented and really played up their parts well. Those that were weak-kneed (aka Takumi) and those that sounded strong (aka one of the girls at one time or another) sounded their respective parts. And I didn't sense any inappropriate tone-age that sometimes comes across in some shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe insert song \"Haritsuke no Misa\" is perhaps one of the most memorable songs in the world of anime. And has the sound of a metal song that would get even the most avid Rammstein fan's attention while it's playing. A great song, by a great artist. And...as a bonus, the lyrics are as disturbing as some parts of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM is just that BGM. It's not meant to stand on its own, but as an enhancement to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a note on the OP/ED, absolutely wonderful songs that really, and I mean really, match the series' intents and mood. Although, at first, one's eyebrow will reach for the sky when hearing Seira Kagami's \"Super Special\" (ED). And one's eyebrows will have no ready made expression for the lyrics of the Itou Kanako's \"F.D.D.\" (OP). Eyebrows excluded from the initial stage, they are great songs.\\n\\n\r\nThat kind of leads us with an 8 in this area.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nAs you can tell, I love the way they told this story. If they had a 20 in this section, I would give it. Now, I will tell my reasons.\\n\\n\r\nYou already know that this was a great thriller, as it keeps one guessing right up until the end. And your interpretations of the characters change on a pretty constant basis as the story progresses. Here's an example: I first hated Takumi, but at the end of the series, one could only feel jealous of the ------- with a certifiable harem of great women and the powers of a god. Perhaps this is all a little exagerated, but I think my point was made rather readily with that.\\n\\n\r\nThriller anime are either great or they suck. This was one of the great ones that came with a few bonuses, including some pretty good backstory and backworkings within the story. Another bonus not often seen. So in all due fairness. I recommend this anime.",

            "content": "Ah. The infamous Chaos;Head. To be honest, I thought this series was going to be a great one, one that will make it to my faves list. Of course, I should have known from the first episode that it would suck. But anyway, on with the review.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nNormally, I wouldn't give the story such a low score. After all, the story is the heart of the anime, isn't it? But, if it weren't for the fact that I am highly interested in murder/mystery/thriller plots, I would have given this story a 1 out of 10. The story itself was the most rushed story I hadever seen, even more so than another 12 episode anime I had seen. It was a nice attempt, but it didn't really cut it for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nOkay. Sue me. I liked the art. In fact, I loved it. Not really much else to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nLoved the opening and ending theme. And I liked the music they played in the beginning of the episodes. It sets the mood for the anime itself. In fact, I think the sound was the best part. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nMeh. Characters were pretty decent for an anime like this, though I didn't like most of them. And the development for one of them was like the story line: Way too rushed. Plus the relationship between characters is REALLY poor.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoy this series? Most of the time, I just wanted to put this anime on my \"Dropped Anime\" list. But, I kept with it because I liked the feeling of having finished an anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nI would recommend this series only if you like rushed development and story. This anime was sheer disappointment in my eyes, when I thought it would be decent.",

            "content": "Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd is a prime example of why most one-cour shows have linear and simple plots. Imagine a box being stuffed so full that it explodes --- this is a perfect metaphor for the show. A combination of a plot that tries way too hard, characters that are as intriguing as a piece of printer paper, and perhaps the most obnoxious main character in all of animation history lead Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd to be one of the worst shows I've watched. \r\nStory: 2/10\r\nCharacters: 1/10\r\nArt: 4/10\r\nSound: 5/10\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\r\nOverall: 3/10\r\nCh\u00e4oS;HEAd introduces mysteries and plot points nearly every episode, yet these plot points are barely ever expanded on. You'll get introducedto a murder one episode, and then it'll barely even get brought up again. Most things in the earlier parts of the show don't even contribute to the end. Instead of contributing to the plot, these mysteries are used to... uhhh... build tension? Nearly every episode has some sort of plot-twist, and the plot becomes incredibly convoluted and bizarre. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot by itself is already confusing and dreadful, it is made even worse by the \"scientific terminology\" used to explain the Sci-Fi elements of the show. \"Wait, so, there's an evil organization that has world domination in sights, and they're... projecting brain waves into the real world?\" A combination of unexplained, bogus terminology and an even more confusing basic plot structure only serve to confuse and disappoint the watcher.\\n\\n\r\nThe appalling plot is not even the worst aspect of the show. Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd features perhaps the worst cast of main characters to ever appear in animation. Unsurprisingly, with 7 main characters in a one-cour show, most of them either get close to no character development, or get the most forced character development possible. Each girl is focused on for about 2 episodes, and then effectively becomes a side character in the show. This creates 6 different heroines with two-dimensional and bland personalities. In fact, a lot of the time, the characters in the show are used simply to inject more information or terminology to create a more convoluted story. \\n\\n\r\nThe only non-heroine main character, the protagonist of the show, is nearly impossible to bear with. Takumi is an anime-obsessed hikikomori that sounds like he has some sort of combination of asthma and crippling anxiety whenever he speaks. His levels of paranoia and extreme social awkwardness make it nearly impossible to sympathize with him, or even understand what he's thinking at any given moment. Throughout the show, Takumi transitions from his already bad form, the asthmatic paranoiac otaku, into an even worse character: a suicidal Soren Kierkegaard. He just kind of walks around and spouts existentialist rubbish. Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd would honestly be a more enjoyable show had Takumi been replaced with a wooden board.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get on to the non-appalling parts of the show: art and music.\\n\r\nLet's start with art. For 2008 standards, the animation style is average at best. Madhouse probably didnt get a very high budget for the series, since the source material, the Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd visual novel, is nothing to write home about. The characters all look decent.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is easily the best part of the show. An above average opening theme by Kanako Ito, and an alright ending theme were about the only times that I enjoyed watching Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd. The background music is absolutely horrid; however, it is quite fitting for how bad the show is. The background music and sound effects manage to create more suspense than the plot itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend anyone who decides to watch Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd to first look up their nearest suicide hotline, and then save that number into their phone for easy access.",

            "content": "This is one of those shows that i really looked forward to, and the first 2-3 episodes almost got me feel I was high on something, but then \u2026 \r\n[5]Story: Alright, so the story begins with introducing the main character, Takumi. He is an Otaku that has failed at life basically, living in a container with his computer and anime figures totally isolated from the world excluding the few occasions he goes to school on. The thing that will catch your attention right of the start is that Takumi is having severe delusions that alter his reality. Right after the first episode we get throwninto a murder case, which Takumi is somehow connected to. It is hinted that he is suffering from Scizophrenia and/or other pshycological issues. This makes one want to know more. Who is the murder? Can it be Takumi himself, doing it with another personality? Anyhow, a lot of questions pop up leaving you in despair once the episode is over and you realize you don\u2019t have the next episode downloaded.  So what does the anime make out of all this? Ill make it short: Nothing. The pshycological feel is totally crushed in episode 4 when we get to know a little of the truth about everything and the anime here derails into some sort of bad fantasy adventure with swords and what-not. oh, did I forget to mention that Takumis harem also steadily arrives as the show progresses? That\u2019s right, weird girls keep coming up all the time, and all but one of them likes takumi. I was going to score the story a 6, but while I was writing this I remembered how I had trouble finishing the show, so it gets a 5. \\n\\n\r\n[7]Art:  Well, it is Madhouse, so I cant say anything other than its good. The only thing lacking was the characters, and especially the girls. They just felt to.. animated! I don\u2019t know, they just felt lifeless to me. The backgrounds and such we\u2019re good though.  So the art gets a 7, had the characters been better it would have gotten an 8. \\n\\n\r\n[7]Sound: I have nothing to complain on about the sound, but im not going to praise it either. Its mediocre, perhaps even a little better than that. The good thing about the sound is that they used the appropriate sound at the right moments, which gives a better feel to the show as a whole. \\n\r\n  As for the voice acting, I think that Takumis VA did a great job. He expressed Takumis feelings really good, and it made him come to live, unlike the other characters. That said, I don\u2019t think that the other voice actors did a bad job, but it wasn\u2019t really memorable in any way.  So the sound gets a 7, much like the art, it could have gotten an 8 had it just been a little better. \\n\\n\r\n[5]Characters: ok, so what to say about the characters. I already introduced Takumi to you, but ill just rant a little more about him anyway. So as I said he is a looser otaku with delusions bla bla, and he is perhaps, the best characters in the whole show. To be more exact, I think that he is the best character. His life situation is pictured pretty well, he is an otaku that doesn\u2019t know that much about life, have a hard time socializing with people etc. it all makes him feel alive. This said its not like I think that he\u2019s a VERY good characters, he\u2019s fine, that\u2019s all. All the other characters are stereotypes you\u2019ll hate as soon as you see them, or else you\u2019ll learn to hate them as the show progresses. There really isn\u2019t anything to say about them, they are just uninteresting and have no real personality nor feel to them. I was a little unsure if I should give it a 5 or a 6 as a score, but in the end it got a 5. Takumi just wasn\u2019t enough to cover the fact that all the other characters sucked. \\n\\n\r\n[5]Enjoument: The first episodes was great, then it derailed. After having watched around half the show I had it on \u201con-hold\u201d for some weeks before finishing it. Even now I don\u2019t really know why I just didn\u2019t drop it there. This should speak for itself as for how much I enjoyed the ride. The show tries to be serious, but fails. Its just like how Death note tries to be to serious sometimes, just that you don\u2019t laugh at Death note on those occasions\u2026 Imagine Light throwing the death note away, then he buys a sword and goes around killing criminals with it. Still trying to be as serious as before. That\u2019s kind of how Chaos head is/was. Anyway, it gets a 5, and this goes for the overall score aswell. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n",

            "content": "A show where the name itself, Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd, is meant to be taken literally. Your head will be filled with chaos as you attempt to understand what is going on.\r\nThe beauty of Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd is that the show itself is a mystery. The rushed pacing of the show in combination with the intentional mysterious plot made it difficult to keep a handle on what was going on. I cannot count the number of times I said, out loud, \"What the hell is going on?\" I feel like the writers were trying to make this something unique that stood out as a gem among the crowd. They didmanage to make Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd unique, but not necessarily in the way they intended.\\n\\n\r\nBefore watching this, I did take a peek at other reviews to see what the general consensus on the show was, or lack thereof. Some outright call the show a flop, while others appreciated the uniqueness of it. I decided to give it a go and make my own opinion on it. The first episode had some interesting lead-ins, places where a highly interesting story would have developed. I was looking forward to something special, though I figured I was setting myself up for disappointment. Oh boy did I set myself up. Like a bat out of hell, the story jumped off a cliff. Or so it seemed. For the vast majority of the show, the viewer is left confounded by \"technobabble\", unsound science, and plot twists, all of which were bundled up into a mysterious burrito for you to eat. It is not until episodes 10 and 11 that answers to the many questions brought up since the beginning receive answers. As a mystery genre anime, the show excels at keeping the viewer thinking about the possibilities of what could have happened. The mystery aspect aside, the plot line itself is rather iffy. While the lead up to the finale seemed to fit, a sudden deus ex machina sent thing astray. Had this anime been 24 episodes instead of 12, I think things would have been able to develop at a more appropriate pace and it likely would have been a far better series.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the story itself, Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd follows the life of Takumi Nishijou, a shut-in otaku who is so out of touch with reality at times that his mind synthesizes his favorite game character into being his wife. His quiet life is suddenly cast into disarray as a series of gruesome murders and suicides, known as the New Generation Madness, spring up in his home city of Shibuya, Tokyo. His distaste for the \"three dimensional world\" leads him to initially brush this off as not important to him; however, as fate would have it, he is thrown into the mix as he witnesses one of the murders first hand. His already fragile mind is snapped and he (and by extension the viewer) gradually becomes unable to differentiate his delusions from reality. The way he reacts to his distorting situation mirrors how the viewer reacts to this show - immense confusion, accompanied by a lack of words. \"Errors,\" as they are called by Sena Aoi (one of the main characters), are causing the world to collapse and it is up to those who can see them to prevent them and \"save the world.\" Scientifically unproven concepts are also brought up, especially from episode 5 onwards. What are known as lunar-biorhythms, the effect of the moon on our body, are an example of such. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I wont go any further with the story aspect.\\n\\n\r\nGoing on to the cast, there is an overload of \"main\" characters present in Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd. For a 12 episode anime, seven characters to focus on is too many. I found myself confused for the first several episodes as to the purpose of these characters, especially as to why they were being given mixed personalities. With many characters present, many \"magically\" disappeared for periods of time, only to return with details that would advance the story in a confusing, and somewhat forced, manner. That said, they all had a purpose and each had their necessary roles. Sadly though, their personalities remained mostly static, especially the MC who was consistently annoying to me. Though development of the characters is lacking, their portrayal improved the show and I would consider this part of the show \"mediocre\" overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork proved to be par for the course, I think. The main characters are all high school students, so it's generic dress code galore! But seriously, who the hell makes students wear PLAID pants/skirts!? The Di-Swords (those giant purple things in the cover picture) are pretty cool looking, in both forms they are depicted in, though. Aside from that, there's nothing that really makes the show stand out from the artwork perspective, in my opinion, but there's nothing bad about it either. This is a different story when looking at the audio. The series' opening and ending themes are \"F.D.D.\" and \"Super Special\" (performed by J-pop artists Kanako It\u014d and Seira Kagami, respectively). While \"F.D.D.\" felt appropriate as the opening, I was woefully displeased by \"Super Special.\" Initially, I found myself laughing hysterically when the words \"You're always super special...\" were uttered. For a non-romcom show, \"Super Special\" felt completely out of place. Within the actual show, there isn't much to speak of with the audio. Most of the time it was appropriate and enhanced the situation, while sometimes it fell short of expectations.\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to see why Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd has received such mixed reviews. Due to the confusing and rushed nature of the story, one can quickly become disinterested in it and fail to appreciate the mystery portrayed. I wouldn't recommend this as a light watch, though it's not something deep either. It's more of a mentally stimulating show, getting you to think about things in a different way. If you are one who enjoys mystery, I definitely would give this show a go. You'll appreciate the many twists and turns this show takes in attempts to throw the viewer off from where the truth lies.",

            "content": "So- to begin, I enjoyed this series.  Yes it was interesting and slightly difficult to get into and wrap around the whole concept but once into the anime it gets more understandable.\r\nStory-8: Reason-again with most 12 episode anime they had a lot of ideas and fewer episodes to get them all in. But they manage to pull it off. They added multiple characters that are delicately intertwined and revolve around one another in some way. The concept of the mind is always present in the anime and must always be included when making decisions about it- because not all is what it appears andone can be fooled. I would suggest watching the anime in maybe one full go or maybe over 2-3 days without missing, because you will have some difficultly putting loose ends together.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8-Reason: I'll be honest, since I'm not an artist, and I didn't want to say that this anime's art-style is like every other anime, that's just not good enough. This anime had great art work, especially in the form of the weapons used. Again because this anime focused around what the mind could do and create the artwork to assist that idea along was detailed, and colorful. I would suggest focusing more on the Di-swords since their designs and the main thing. The character's designs are I suppose common but they do have their individual styles. Ranging from long-haired to short, colors from pink to silver, black, and blonde. The eye colors all matching and added to the characters. At some points feathers, and sparkling of the Di-swords happens(won't give too much) but it usually symbolizes something within the anime and it was rather beautiful how it was done. The background is decent. The city scenes again depict what Tokyo looks like(most part, not making too generalized statements), and when it comes to certain scenes for example the first scene you see in the anime- will change your mood. It's dark, you're curious as to how it happened, and this is where the artwork gets /very/ into things.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7-Reason:Not alot to go on when it comes to the sound. Depending on if you watch subbed or dubbed the voices are amazing. Some characters have their switch-moments where they sound one way then another. On average really for background sounds, yeah you get the delusion sounds-which are kinda creepy, and the rain in the beginning of the anime- the fighting with the swords does sound like it looks. The series keeps one opening and one ending all throughout-  and I personally loved them. The beat is something you can rock or nod your head to, and the female lead has such a strong voice, for both songs. The ending has a little English sung(opening does too but around the end) and both songs fits the plot of the anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7-Reason: They added a lot of characters in a short amount of time. And because the anime deals with delusions and false things, what you see in a character may change or not be real at all. There was no extensive background for all the characters- just bits and pieces, but only enough to progress the story and why the characters need to fight. The most detailed of the characters wold possibly be the main one since his comes out of the blue.(Won't reveal more than that). The villains within the anime do a heck of a good job masking themselves until later- but if one can put the pieces together then it is fairly simple. Oh and look out for a guy that looks like a homeless person. ^^\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed it fully which is why I gave it an 8. Yes the only reason it didn't get a 10 was because of the confusion it causes at the beginning and the way all the characters come together. Not saying it's a full on rush just to get them all in, but they were delightful with their own personalities and had meanings. They added some Mythology into it as well which I thought was a good touch since it connected with the plot as well. You'll enjoy the ending, you may even cry.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-8: Reason- the characters-good enough to be their own and progress the story. Artwork and sound- decent to great depending on the scenes, and what was going on. Story and plot over all-confusing, mysterious, but a well-defined one that would give any mystery goer a run for their money. \\n\r\nMy suggestion is if you watch this series, go and watch it first- then watch Stein's;Gate. It has a connection to it.",

            "content": "Firstly I apologize to fans of the show for what is about to be said, but remember that this is my humble opinion and should not be taken as fact. However, for those who read this and decide to check how I usually rate shows, you will certainly see that I am incredibly lenient in my rankings and will often give shows higher than deserving scores based on the fact that I had a blast watching it. So for me to give such a negative score is quite uncommon.\r\nWith that out of the way, the review may begin.\r\nFirstly, the characters are bland, cliche and incrediblyboring. And the worst part is that the main character is extremely unlikeable, and to be completely honest I could care less for the fates of any of the characters. There is little to no character development. Overall I just disliked the characters of this show, they had no appeal.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was your typical  boy has powers, doesn't know it and then discovers and uses them to save the world. Unfortunately the powers or 'Di-swords' were incredibly lame and uninteresting. The show also had aspects of romance in it, although they were both poorly developed and implemented so that you couldn't really attach yourself to any of the romantic entanglements. Overall I found the story to be incredibly boring and it really was a struggle for me to finish this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt was for the most part good, although incredibly inconsistent. Some of the animations of movements and characters were outright horrendous. It's not often that my eyes are aware to the fact that the characters are in fact 2d. Backgrounds were nice but nothing noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for sound, what little of it there was was good. The music suited the show and the voice actors for the most part were competent, although I really couldn't stand the main character by the end of the show, or his voice. Again, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really did not enjoy this show, which is unusual for me as I will almost always find something to keep me interested. For a show with so much potential, it really did fall flat on its face in mediocrity. Whilst I haven't played the visual novel, I can only hope that this was an incredibly crappy adaptation.",

            "content": "\"Can a work of art be objectively bad?\"\r\nThroughout the history of humanity, many have attempted to answer this question, often with subjectively collected conclusions. I myself promulgate the idea of subjectivity in art, trying to poke as little fun as possible at things like One Direction or Transformers because hey, everyone has their own tastes.\r\nCh\u00e4oS;HEAd, however, loudly grants evidence to why the opposite is true.\r\nThe most unfortunate thing about this mutilated mess of a show is that I actually enjoyed it at first. There was an air of intense mystery about it, and while the characters (dear god, the characters) were underwhelming from the start,it had piqued my interest. This interest manifested mostly from not having idea what was going on, and wanting to know, as is the usual for psychological stories.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time I was less than halfway through with the series, it was readily apparent that its creators had no idea what was going on either. I haven't read the source material, but if there is any evidence that the VN is followed with scrutiny by this anime, then I will stay well clear of it. These are the folks who made Steins;Gate? They must have been in quite the slump when writing this...\\n\\n\r\nWhere should I even start? I suppose I'll start with what I was thought was the best part of the show: the animation. I really only say that because the artwork is absolutely and completely average. There is nothing technically wrong with it, it is simply that there is nothing to catch the eye. None of the characters have memorable designs, and the backgrounds are dark and ambient with little detail or notable precision. The fight scenes, few as they are, are fairly straightforward and lifeless. I cannot say that the art and animation is bad, as much as I'd like to, but at the least it leaves a bad taste in one's mouth and is, again, utterly average.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the animation comes the whole ... semantics of the series. As I said before, I was drawn in by having no idea what was going on and desiring answers (the show starts off by showing the end, a writing style that I am fond of, since one knows to an extent how something ended but has no clue how things became that way), and this initial appeal was quickly wiped away. There were vague attempts at describing the world in terms of solipsism, metaphysics, and fatalism, but they fall flat and seem like something an angsty, partially-illiterate teenager may come up with, failing entirely at being the world-view-changer that it was clearly trying to be. \\n\\n\r\nThen they started introducing technical supernatural jargon: \"Di-Sword\"? \"Gigalomaniac\"? Who is this \"Shogun,\" and what is \"Gladios\"? \"Well,\" they (the show) responded, proceeding into a 12-episode long description of things filled with plot holes and mediocrity that turned my attention into despondence, and my despondence into irritation. By the end, it turns out that a socially retarded weeaboo has this power to wield a Di-Sword, a sword with the ability to alter time and space or something, and this makes him a Gigalomaniac, Shogun is nothing more than a dying old man with a similar power that he somehow possesses, and Gladios is just another word for \"fate\" made by a Gothic teenage girl, I think. Notice how I say \"somehow\" and \"I think\" and \"or something\"? Yeah, that's because I still don't understand. Not the cool, The Usual Suspects-esque \"don't understand\", where you have to watch it again to catch everything and end up going \"Oh, cool, that was even better the second time through because everything leading up to the end game makes sense,\" but the \"seriously, what are you trying to say\" kind of \"don't understand\". Everything that is at first thought provoking is in retrospect a dysfunctional essay on fate and reality endeavoring to manufacture a couple of unique buzzwords before concluding unimpressively.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be wondering why I gave the story a four as I deride this sadly farcical depiction of incompetence, and that is just for the first episode, first two episodes at most. There are the interesting concepts ushered in in a marvelous flurry, but they swiftly fall to shambles. This is the same reason why my enjoyment was anything above a two: I had to hand it to the exposition in the first episode. The music was unmemorable, so alone I would have given it a four, but due to the voice actors (which I will expand upon later on) I had to bump it down to two.\\n\\n\r\nJust wait, I haven't even gotten to the characters yet. Oh boy, the characters...\\n\\n\r\nOur lead protagonist is Nishijou Takumi, who, as stated previously, is a shut-in truant otaku that does nothing but play one video game and watch one anime show. There is no reason whatsoever why we, the viewers, should like him or dislike him, as he does nothing. By the time we see him a little more, we realize that, really, guys, all he does is watch one anime show and play one game. He also has hallucinations, but only one hallucination is an actual, mental-disorder-having hallucination, all the others are revealed to be some distortion of space-time by the supporting cast that also has no definitive (or, at the least, purposeful) reason for occurring. By the time we see yet more of Takumi, one should hate him because all he does is whine and complain with no development at all. Literally all he wants to do is shut himself back in; the more he learns about the Gigalomaniacs, the more whiny he becomes, but then all of the sudden he sees two people he barely knows get into a telepathic fight with the main villain and almost die (after, at this point, already seeing many people die throughout the city, but only through the Internet because he doesn't go outside except for supplies) and he decides he's gotta save the ... world? City? I didn't know and I didn't care.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like harem anime? Then you'll despise this show, because it shits all over the harem, and not in a parodical, \"ha ha\" way. The girls that randomly start to hover around Takumi are either annoying or one-dimensional or both. They all seem to like Takumi somehow, despite him having zero redeemable qualities, let alone engaging qualities, and all of them turn into disgustingly stereotypical damsels in distress for our belovedly useless Takumi to rescue, kind of. None of their backstories give them credible motive for their actions or personalities. I think one of the girls was a tsundere, and she only had one goal (revenge), and once that goal was fulfilled (the villain gets defeated; the villain, by the way, has less motive and credence than all the other characters combined ... he's just a greedy corporate guy, that's about it) there's nothing else to know about her. The same can essentially be said for the rest of the side characters. Honestly, the characters I liked the most (such as Takumi's sister or Shogun) were shown the least, and right when they're shown I began to instinctively dislike them again because they were devoid of use. The voice actors merely amplify the disdainful cast. Takumi's was the most likable because he made the most sense, since all he had to do was be awkward and stammer periodically. All the others were annoying, squeakily-pitched, Japanese high school girl voices, and if they weren't that, then it was soap opera-y melodramatic facades with no substance behind them as well as on their surface.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nSound: 2\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\\n\r\nFinal word: Do you like harem or psychological thriller anime? Do you like ANY anime? Do you like even the simplest of creative stories? Then don't watch this show. If you're at all curious, do NOT watch more than the first episode (the first episode is actually good, it is the complete nosedive I've described from there). I don't even know why I finished it, because this is by far the worst anime I have ever seen.",

            "content": "__NO SPOILERS__\r\nThought seemingly at first this anime concerns a delusional otaku-hikomori quickly the plot has a supernatural twist with mind games and possible conspiracies. Personally it reminds me a bit of the plot of The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya but in a more paranoid and \"bloody\" way.\r\nStory 8: The plot is really intriguing but has some anime-cliches that i find annoying such as the protagonist's \"harem\" and the fan service. Other than that minor drawback this anime really draws you in with the suspense and the \"i don't know who i can trust\" mood.\r\nArt 7: The art is solid, plain and common. Most of thetimes the characters remind me of other charas from other popular anime, and that's annoying. The backgrounds are really well drawn and detailed though.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: The opening theme is catchy and fun while the ending theme is simply annoying. The seiyus have done a very good job, especially Takumi's seiyu is amazing and his performance really brings the character to life. The mood setting &quot;background&quot; music themes are pretty good and manage to give an eerie feeling but i feel they're starting to get a bit repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: When i started this series i thought that every character nicely fitted a popular anime-cliche but i'm glad to say that i was proven wrong (well maybe except in the case of Takumi's sister). The characters are well written and have background motives and issues that explain their actions. Again i think Takumi is the most solid character, mostly acts as an anti-hero and his reactions are really unique and unexpected (although i must admit that there were times when he vividly reminded me of Ikari Shinji..)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: I watched at once all the 6 episodes and it felt like less than 10 minutes, this series really draws you in. I will be waiting in anticipation for the next episode, to see if my theories about the &quot;mysteries&quot; were right and to get new &quot;clues&quot;! I suggest you grab a coke (like Takumi does every time he sits in front of his pc) and enjoy Chaos;Head.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: I might give it a higher rating once it's finished. It all depends on whether it'll have a well written, solid ending. I really recommend you delve into this series!",

            "content": "Story: The story is good. It seems to follow the Visual Novel closely (except for a few points) and for the most part is the exact same only in condensed format (chapters 1-2 of the VN are 1 episode, etc. etc.).There are some MAJOR differences like  introducing characters earlier than they would have in the VN. Another fault of the anime is the fact the VN had \"Delusion triggers\" which would make Takumi go into a delusion and see something that wasn't happening, making him space out and confuse other characters. So instead, you have to deal with the pre determined triggers which mostlyconsisted of Seira-tan, one of the most annoying supporting characters in an anime ever.  I can't really comment much more on the story because I haven't finished the anime and don't plan to. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Chaos;Head is terrible, honestly I don't even know what to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The characters sound like they do in the Visual Novel. Probably because they used the same voice actors. My only complain is Yoshino's voice for Takumi, he is the most annoying character I have EVER heard. The same stands for the visual novel as well. Second worst would have to be Takumi's delusion \"Seira-tan\" who is almost equally annoying in both sound and character personality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Ignoring Takumi's TERRIBLE voice, he is a fairly interesting character. Although sometimes I cringed at how stupid he could be, albeit he had good reason. Most, if not all characters had some sort of secret that would be explained later and made it interesting at least in the Visual Novel. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Basing it on the anime, the enjoyment factor here is 1. The art mixed with the story inconsistencies of the anime really screwed this rating big time. I do not recommend you watch the anime, it is a waste of time. Read the visual novel instead, I can guarantee a solid 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Don't watch the anime. Read the visual novel.",

            "content": "Part 1 of the Science Adventure trilogy\r\nThis has all the makings of a great psychological thriller, and it does accomplish most of what it sets out to do, however, there are a few things it falters in. It's biggest problem is that it often mixes up being confusing with being clever. In most stories like this, things start out not making sense. However, things line up when the audience is told this universe's rules. In ChaoS;HEAd, right when some questions are answered, something happens that make about twenty new ones appear. The audience is never given a break until the 11th or 12th episode. Still,for the most part this is still an interesting and thought provoking story, if a little clumsy at times. The voice acting in the dub is also noteworthy, particularly for Todd Haberkorn. I liked it.",

            "content": "Ahh Chaos;head, such a sour affair we've had. Of course, like any passionate fling, it would be unfair to say that we were set off with a spark. No, to be more accurate, I was seared alive by a Nazi-era flamethrower with a love for this show when it first began. The early episodes contained all the elements of my other favorite series. We had a Hikikomori on par with Tatsu of NHK ni Youkoso, we had psychotic murdering high school girls akin to the killer lolis of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and all the intrigue of Monster combined with the polygamous romances foundin nearly every anime over the last five years. I only grew more and more passionate about the series as Taku dove headlong into his delusions, and as the invisible horrors of the outside world pressed down harder upon his shipping containers doors. However, at episode seven, the enjoyment i found in the series threw itself full force against a wall of disbelief. Granted, nearly every anime &quot;jumps the shark&quot; sooner or later (just look at H2O ~Footprints In The Sand~ episode eight, it took a rocket-boosted double jump over said shark). However, when Chaos;Head began trying to wed a logical explanation to a concept that by it's nature defies common logic, it leaves the watcher in a tizzy. While the technological jargon invented to try and explain the vast loneliness of the human condition and the vast conspiracy to justify the illogical nature philosophy of the mind do offer an explanation, they offer no solutions. Right now at episode ten, I can't help but feel dismal depression as even if &quot;the bad guys&quot; are defeated in the show, Takumi will still be unable to prove any facet of existence. Frankly, at this point the series has nowhere to go. While I admit that I have two episodes to come, I view their eventual arrival with a weary heart, knowing that the show can never retract the new technobabble it's branched into, and return to it's murder mystery roots.",

            "content": "ChaoS;HEAd is a psychological anime with some action and a good plot behind it. Overall, it was pretty enjoyable, and something that is definitely worth watching; however, it isn't one of those extremely memorable anime like Death Note or Code Geass that everybody just loves. Actually, it doesn't reach those heights in the slightest, but that's not to say it was terrible either. Definitely watch it if you like short, psychological anime series, but if you're a casual anime watcher, ChaoS;HEAd should be watched after you've watched the Tops.\r\nStory\r\nRead the synopsis for more details. Basically, you have your generic \"I hate human greed/selfishness and I'mgoing to destroy/remake everything to make a point&quot; anime villain. Then you also have the generic male anime protagonist who attempts to save mankind. Sounds boring, but ChaoS;HEAd adds to this generic plot with its own unique recipes that makes the story worthwhile. There are unexplained points in the story for minor details that are never answered, but most are sci-fi related. It does make the story unsatisfying, but doesn't ruin the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI watched ChaoS;HEAd subbed by m33w fansubs, which were 400 mb per episode, so the quality of the anime was great. Everything was sleek and clear. Besides that, the art style is also notable. It is drawn with seriousness in mind, so you won't be seeing any MOE characters or out-of-proportion body parts (besides the eyes, lol) that are common in comedy anime. The motions are very sleek and smooth, so you can just appreciate how many drawings came together to piece ChaoS;HEAd up. I haven't noticed any obvious reused background scenery, so that's a plus as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI'm not a big person on sound, unless it was noticeably awful. The sound in ChaoS;HEAd seems fine  to me. The opening song really fit the anime. I personally didn't like the peaceful, pacific ending song, seeing as how it just didn't quite in with the psychological element of ChaoS;HEAd. Generally, the background music was pretty good and fitted with the various situations. The sound effects were satisfying as well. The effects for bodies .. &quot;being damaged&quot; were especially realistic *shudders*\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nCharacters were very unique in ChaoS;HEAd. Every main character has their own traits, from the queer Ayase to Yua with her extremely notable repetitions in speech. The protagonist, Takumi Nishijo, was especially interesting and quite different from generic characters, to say the least. His character development was also done very well. Most watchers will likely hate his personality at the beginning, and most will change their opinions ;)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIn the beginning, I didn't expect much. The first few episodes presented an interesting story and Nishijo's personality, albeit irritating, was noticeably different that most other anime characters. However, everything felt a little bland. But as I continue watching, it became quite enjoyable, as more characters were introduced, and more mysteries presented themselves, waiting for explanations in further episodes. The ending was especially good and is probably the highlight of this entire series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, ChaoS;HEAd was good, enjoyable, satisfying, but definitely not an epic/memorable anime. I recommend watching the first episode or two, and then take it from there: if you are interested, keep going and if not, hold it for later.",

            "content": "Chaos; head can sure be a confusing show at times.  It's an anime that throw lots of questions at you without giving many answers, there are so many delusions seen throughout the show so sometimes you think you know something and later you find out you don't have the right answer.  Even with all the confusion, I really did enjoy the anime.  I have not played the visual novel so I can't compare the two.\r\nThe story was pretty interesting, starting with another incident that's classified under their society is calling, \"The New Gen Murders\".  Takumi is basically a shut in whoseems to have the ability to predict the future.  Yua, Rimi, Kosue, Ayase, Sena, and Nanami are the 6 girls who he interacts the most with throughout the show.  Each one of them has their own struggles to deal with and all 6 of them help Takumi along the way in someway or another.  I won't say which girl does which, but between them all, the  try to help Takumi disperse his own illusions, awaken as his true self, or they try to shelter him and keep out of harms way.  Many bizarre events occur as Takumi is trying to figure everything out with the help of the girls.  Surprisingly for having a harem tag, the show barely had any harem like scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation style was sometimes really weird, but it was perfect for the type of atmosphere Chaos; Head was trying to make.   The same goes for the music.\\n\\n\r\nI already mentioned all the main characters so that's done.  Takumi fit his role really well despite being a weak main character; a strong protagonist would not have fit the show.  Unfortunately, there was much time to give a lot of development to any of the girls since so many things were happening.  Most of them get a little development at least.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I really enjoyed the show and the experience it gave me.  Chaos; Head sure was bizarre, but I'd rather a bizarre psychological show rather than one filled with pointless still shots, piles of scenes that just seem to be unnecessary tension builders, and unlikable characters.  I'd suggest giving Chaos; Head a chance even though most reviews and many rating give it a low score.\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first started to watch Chaos Head the whole show seemed slow and awkward. Meaning that everything was poorly put together and did not really seem to go anywhere. The only thing that kept me watching was the increasing mystery and the fact that it was highly recommended for those who liked Higurashi.\r\nThis is one of those shows where the main character is ignorant, cowardly, and terribly unstable all at the same time. Having the main character be an otaku not only made him pathetic and cowardly, but also it resulted in him making stupid decisions. I do not understand why the guy whomade this story thought it right to make the main character, Takumi, really easy to hate. The rest of the characters made enough sense, although at first I did not understand why all these girls were somehow attached to Takumi, but it all made sense down the line.\\n\\n\r\nChaos Head, being so close to Higurashi, was a very dark and mysterious show. At first things sort of happens without explanation, but then more and more is revealed to make a highly complicated and satisfactory plot. After awhile I was hooked on this gory and disturbing plot.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that Chaos Head is highly underrated and can be very enjoyable once one gets into it. I am glad that this show did not turn out to be some corny romance or end in a big battle with no meaning, because although Chaos did have romance and a final battle, both of these were not comparable to the typical anime. So watch Chaos Head because it will not disappoint (I think).\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah! I forgot to mention the background sound(s) in this show is so perfect it was scary (literally).",

I've read somewhere (I do not recall the web site) that these animes have in common the scientific approach. So, if I find Stein's Gate a very interesting anime, why wouldn't I try watching Chaos;Head?\r\nAnd I wasn't wrong: Chaos Head was a delightful experience for me. I like very much the story, but, I am enthusiastic about the concept that built up that beautiful story.\r\nThe power to materialize a delusion- it's the power that is possed by Gigalomaniacs. They can bring weapons (usually swords) from a different dimensionand materialize in this reality. But, beside fighting with peculiar swords, they can use delusions to fulfill their wishes;except one person, they do not have the power to materialize those delusions, but, they can manipulate minds.The events are related to how a person discovers this ability and how this power is perceived by a normal mind or a large group of normal human beings.\\n\\n\r\nMy thoughts after seeing this anime were: delusions have many ways of working; they can destroy a person, but also, can be very useful. Delusions can be dreams of a pure and brave soul that wants to grow stronger, stronger and stronger.\\n\\n\r\nSo, give Chaos;Head a try! \\n",

I can understand why they call it Chaos;HEAd, his head is all screwed up. The guy seriously thinks a anime character is real and his girlfriend, he lives in a strange box on top of a roof, and just keeps being a whiny little prick for almost the whole show. \r\nI got confused easily in the beginning, it was odd and out of place almost. I do have a question though, a lot of shows seem to have the maincharacter that\u2019s really off and then he ends up being the center of attention for all the girls. And of course, they all aren\u2019t what people call normal. This is the base of all Harems and yet I still cannot get into it with the character. The strange thing is, Takumi sounds a bit like a couple people on DesuDes in his love for anime and such. He even talks about studying the director and writers which is pretty awesome. I like the fact that they really seem to add that part to the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhen they say Psychological Thriller, they really mean it. It\u2019s been making me wonder why a lot of these types are being dubbed now. I found this one on the Funimation Youtube account or I would of probably not heard about it until one of DesuDes looked into it. The whole show if a mind fuck, seriously. I watched with I had no sleep so I might be making it worse then it is on that account but really\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is really good, very crisp like normal shows in this time. While looking at all these shows, it\u2019s hard to say anything about artwork that looks almost exactly the same as every other show that\u2019s out there at around the same time. \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the ending is a little odd, and I don\u2019t get it even if it\u2019s a good beat. The opening is much better sounding then the ending and seems to give a better feel to the show. The English dub is pretty good and the girls don\u2019t seem bothersome except for his sister. She is just plain annoying, like Eimi Ohba from Comic Party.",

            "content": "Oh, ChaoS;HEAd a show as stupid as its capitalization. It sucks here's why.\r\nStory 1/10\r\nThe story, if you can call it that, is a pathetic jumble of messy delusions. If you hate scenarios where it ends with, \"it was all a dream\", then steer clear of this series because it happens like every 5 minutes. I mean it's not like it's too confusing or anything, just frustratingly stupid. It hurts to watch and then there's no pay off in the end whatsoever.\r\nArt 6/10\r\nI mean it's Madhouse, so it wasn't bad. It was even pretty good for 2008. Not much else to say, so moving on.\r\nMusic 7/10\r\nThemusic was good. Very out of place in such a terrible anime. The opening is sung by the queen Kanako Itou herself. The ending was meme bad, but check it out if you want a laugh. I found myself enjoying the soundtrack and thinking it would be so much better if used in a better anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10\\n\r\nThe characters suck. I didn't like a single one. Not a single one! Nishijou Takumi is one of my least favourite protagonists in all of anime, and none of the other characters are any better or more likeable. I feel like everyone likes an anime with character development and this anime has it... but it's all abrupt, happens for no reason, and is never explained. This anime has absolutely no redeeming qualities in terms of characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\r\nI didn't squeeze an ounce of enjoyment out of this anime. It was bad and not even \"fun bad\" just boring, hard-to-watch bad.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of this being said, I give this show 3/10. If you're here for a harem anime then just... no. I'm hard-pressed to even call this a harem anime. I would call it a shit anime with harem elements shoehorned in like a couple of times instead. It isn't so much a mystery as it's just an assortment of confusing, unexplained plot points, only some of which, get explained and none are interesting or satisfying. Psychological? I guess. Sci-fi? For sure, but not a good one in either genre. I would call it supernatural before I would call it sci-fi, but it's stupid more than it is fun or interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nIf I haven't turned you away from watching ChaoS;HEAd by this point, then either stop reading here and watch it to avoid spoilers or read on if you don't care about spoilers or if you've already seen the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo like every character in the show is a Gigalomaniac, which I found to be stupid and I feel it takes away the uniqueness of being a Gigalomaniac. \"And when everyone is super, no one will be.\" To quote Syndrome.  I also want to take this spoiler section to further elaborate on all the characters I hate (ie all of them). Is Rimi a murder? Turns out no, but I feel Takumi puts his faith in her way too quickly and with no justifiable reason. Ayase becomes suicidal somewhere in the middle of the series for some reason, but after jumping off a building and being saved by Takumi, because boom he can make flowers, she's fine just as easily and inexplicably as she became suicidal. I feel like Sena had the potential to be my favourite character, but the shit with her dad was just annoying. She killed him out of revenge in a delusion and regretted it. Then she went to kill him in real life, but he ended up saving her from being shot and she was sad that he died. Make up your mind woman. Nanami was pretty inconsequential and annoying as well, so other than those two huge factors no complaints about her. Kozue (or Piipii or whatever they called her) couldn't talk normally for some reason, which I didn't even know until she started talking normally, again with no explanation. Yua isn't memorable enough to talk about and Seira doesn't exist, but don't let that fool you, she's still annoying. That just leaves two more characters I want to talk about. The girl who ended up being the killer who was written off minutes after the reveal, which is inexcusable no matter what you say to me. And lastly, Genichi. Genichi had the making of a good villain. His motives seemed interesting and almost just in a twisted way. Too bad they weren't explored at all and he got like 10 minutes of screen time. With that, I am done complaining about this terrible anime. If anyone reads all this, thanks for reading. :)",

            "content": "Chaos;Head is a psychological anime that starts out really well but then turns into a generic and rushed shounen after the halfway point.\r\nThe first half of the anime is easily the best part of it. The main character Takumi struggles with constant delusions throughout the anime. They even get to the point where both Takumi and the viewer are constantly trying to figure out if what\u2019s happening is real or just a delusion. Takumi also meets several girls throughout the anime, who each have their own advice on what he should do, and has to decide who to trust so he can save himself fromthe delusions. One of the most interesting parts about the first half of the anime for the viewer is trying to figure out what\u2019s the reason behind Takumi\u2019s delusions and what\u2019s the correct course of action he should take to deal with the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime almost feels like a completely different show. It starts out by explaining everything behind the events that have happened so far, completely getting rid of the aspect of mystery the first half of the show had. After that, the show turns into a generic shounen where the characters have to fight to save the world. The show tries to incorporate elements from the first half, such as the delusions, into its fights but overall they end up feeling really out of place for a show that started off as something completely different. On top of that the second half has constant twists that happen at such a fast pace where it gets rid of any impact the reveals would have and just end up leaving the viewer confused. The ending of the anime also feels like a confusing mess. It can be really hard to follow at times and is resolved in a way that feels like it was written in out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nTakumi is easily the most interesting character out of the cast. The whole anime follows him struggling through his delusions and trying to stay sane in the process. His reactions to all the events happening around him are also quite realistic compared to how your typical strong-minded protagonist might react. The girls however, seem to be there just to support Takumi and don\u2019t get nearly enough development or screen time to stand out properly on their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good enough for the most part but is certainly below the quality of the other shows Madhouse has done. The soundtrack is also pretty good and supports most of the scenes quite well. I especially liked the opening and ending tracks of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nChaos;Head ends up feeling like an anime that needed more than 12 episodes to tell its story properly. The overall story is interesting but gets way too rushed in the second half, making it quite hard to follow in the end. Still, I really enjoyed the first half of the show and would recommend it to anyone who likes psychological anime that keep you guessing about what\u2019s happening and why. The rest of it however, I can\u2019t really recommend to anyone.",

            "content": "The anime that first got me into the medium was Steins;Gate. I had never imagined before that such a crazy premise would have that much to offer. Very few TV Shows had combined such quirky humor with strong characters and a fascinating plot. It took me very little time to realize that it was part of a series. Only a week after finishing Steins;Gate, I dived into Chaos;Head with high expectations. I knew that some of the reviews had fairly low scores for it, but I kept being optimistic.\r\nI should have listened.\r\nThe first few episodes are incredibly strong. The plot begins with several mysteries thatare very compelling, questions that give plenty of reason to continue watching. Takumi acts believably and the various girls each have their own distinct personality about them. However, this strength does not last for long. \\n\\n\r\nSeveral of the female characters periodically show up to either provide slightly more detail into the plot or to say pretty much the same thing to Takumi. It works for a little while, since there's a sense in how important Takumi's sword is. However, it seems to get dropped as more of the female characters become important to the overall plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime falls short in two primary areas. First, the primary cast is entirely too large and spaced out to be characterized effectively in thirteen episodes. This is incredibly apparent in the second half where two or three of seemingly minor characters are forced into the spotlight. It looks very out of place and seems tacked on. It also has this weird idea that the best way to go about a subplot is to solve it at the same time it's introduced. It definitely felt that way, as any hints of those subplots beforehand are either incredibly small or easily forgettable. Second, the complete change in the premise from mystery and paranoia into full on action just doesn't fit or flow well. The initial premise is basically thrown to the side, as most of the initial questions that got me interested in continuing got an incredibly shallow answer. For example, one of the mysteries involved a seemingly minor character who is suddenly thrust into the spotlight and similarly brought back into obscurity several minutes later. This character has been showing up in several past episodes, but only in passing. There's no reason before that point to ever pay attention to their presence.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters overall aren't great either. Takumi is a strong character in the first half of the series, but the giant plot twist involving The General and everything afterwards does a lot to destroy that credibility. Some of the other characters are strong, but others are incredibly weak. I still don't see what true purpose Takumi's sister has in the entire anime. There's not much purpose in having so many female characters in the spotlight. If they had combined some of them so that there were four instead of six, they would likely have been able to solve some of these issues.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the antagonists, there's no real contest. There's only one primary antagonist in the entire anime, and he gets increasingly shallow as time goes on. He's a generic villain, a character that doesn't really stand out from the rest of the cast even though he plays a major role in the story's climax.\\n\\n\r\nI feel this anime would have been much better if it was spaced out to 26 episodes instead of condensed into 13. With a cast as big as this and so many subplots being thrown around, it's incredibly difficult to avoid rushing through various things. If they had more time to flesh out all the characters and give a compelling answer to all the mysteries at the beginning, this would have been a much more satisfying experience. However, the way it is, I can't recommend anyone I know to watch this.\\n\\n",

Throughout the entire anime, Takumi is a little whiny bitch. He is weak, emotionally fragile, and is an absolute asshole that only cares about himself. He spends his time running away and when he can't run, begging the random girls that show up to save his sorry little bitch ass. When he becomes momentarily suicidal, he can't even do THAT for himself. He just begs his little sister to kill him. The female characters of this anime legitimately haveno reason to like the MC, but they do so anyway. Super weak sauce. The plot moves way too slow to keep me interested. If you're thinking about watching this because you're into the Harem genre, don't bother. This anime BARELY has elements of Harem in it.",

            "content": "Do you ever wonder why you\u2019re rarely if ever in the situations found in Anime? It\u2019s likely because you have common sense. Just as you cannot have a hero without evil, you cannot have these adventures without stupidity; a whole lot of stupidity.\r\nIn essence that\u2019s what drives the plot of Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd. The frustrating story can be somewhat attributed to our demented otaku protagonist but more so to the writers for burning through 10 episodes before any semblance of character development occurred.\r\nThank goodness the staff that made Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd was mostly scrapped for Steins;Gate. \r\nOn MAL Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd is listed as an alternative setting to Steins;Gate but there\u2019sno real relationship between the series; it\u2019s like the equivalent to that retarded cousin that you won\u2019t admit as family. If Steins;Gate is the reason you\u2019ve come to this series you\u2019ll be awfully disappointed as I have been.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd is that delusions and reality are not so different from one another and that through beings called \u201cGigalomaniacs\u201d who are capable of projecting their delusions to other people; reality can be morphed.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cFor example, if you sent a mental image of what person A is thinking to a hard disk recorder and turned it into a video recording and then somehow transmitted that information to person B\u2019s brain. That would mean person A\u2019s mental delusion would become person B\u2019s reality; your thoughts become part of the world.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs explained by the protagonist Takumi Nishij\u014d in episode six.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all incredibly interesting if not flawed for the amount of plot holes this generated throughout the series. You see changing one\u2019s perception of reality and changing reality itself are two things all together.\\n\\n\r\nIf for example a speeding car is heading towards person A and person B sends the delusion that there is no car, what would happen? Of course person A will still be hit by the car and sent flying even if in their mind there is no car. See the properties of reality (i.e the force of impact) cannot be altered just because you believe otherwise. This same reason is why believing you can fly doesn't mean you can fly or that when your buddy sneaks up behind you and smacks the back of your head it still hurts like hell; no matter what happens in your mind and that whether you\u2019re aware or not, reality still occurs.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, just because you perceive reality does not mean reality is only that of what you perceive.\\n\\n\r\nIf you understand that then you\u2019ll understand that Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd is nonsensical and flawed. That and you\u2019re also a stable person; congratulations you\u2019re sane.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more absurd is that they spent the majority of the episodes explaining this phony theory and expecting viewers to buy into it. They even created the formula Fun^10 X int^40 = lr2 to justify the anomalies that occurs in the series. I was actually tempted to ask my math prof about this but then again I do want to succeed in the course.\\n\\n\r\nCh\u00e4oS;HEAd wasn't scientific and by no means deserved the Sci-Fi label. It\u2019s alright for anime to be absurd but not when they've committed so much to be otherwise. If Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd had just skipped the redundant explanation by saying that it was magic and progressed the story, the series would have been far more enjoyable. There was clearly a lot more that could have been included as Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd the visual novel was far more expansive and has fared far better than the anime series.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a harem, expectations for character depth was low at best and this series did not disappoint. As always each girl follows a generic archetype with very few characteristics that would warrant your attention. Every heroine is simple in nature and has an uninteresting issue which amazingly resolves itself with no direct involvement from the protagonist. Throughout the series it is often difficult to see the need for so many heroines as most of them barely contribute to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist however was certainly different. Takumi Nishij\u014d is one of the worst written characters I've experienced to date. He could be described as an idiotic socially awkward high school otaku bordering becoming a NEET with no sense of realism or values to speak of. Also being a delusional pervert, Takumi often confuses reality with his fantasies which is often abused by the producers to insert fan service. These poor characteristics managed to drag the series out for 10 episodes as Takumi continually denied his responsibilities and preferred to live in his delusions. Even when his friends are threatened and his life is constantly in danger he ignores it and continues his day by saying \u201cThis has nothing to do with me.\u201d Indeed, his common sense is lacking to point where he can\u2019t contemplate that if people want to kill you there has to be something to do with you. This is a weak character that does nothing but panics in just about every scene with an issue and always waits for other characters to resolve it for him. Worst of all Takumi\u2019s character development was also practically non-existent with the extent of it occurring in five minutes of episode 11 whereby he accepts his role in the story and through unknown means suddenly knows how to fight and utilize his powers perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is actually thin enough to expect you to accept that kind of nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nAnother flaw is giving girls swords. Is this the sexist in me speaking? Well if you watched any of the action sequences or even the OP you\u2019ll notice how bad they are. The ridiculous stances the girls take are clearly otaku bait and no one knows how to fight in this series. The action sequences are incredibly flimsy and slow as the writers felt that they had to pause all action and explain every occurrence on screen otherwise we wouldn't understand. This all leads to some of the worst action sequences I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe animators were also very lazy. They seemed to have tried hard to cut down on the amount of work by blanking backgrounds with speed lines during action sequences and abusing zoom ins and outs of still frames. Characters and background components seem to try very hard not to move at all. Often only one thing moves at a time during each scene as if they were taking turns. Motion of characters and objects were often rigid and unnatural. The animation style was decent and acceptable but ultimately the animation was poor overall.\\n\\n\r\nAs for genres the mystery component is lacking and is quickly forgotten after the first few episodes. The protagonist doesn't investigate each mystery preferring far more to ignore reality and dive into his delusions and games. By the end of the series the mystery component resolves itself and ends anticlimactically all without any deductive work by the protagonist. This inevitably leaves bundles of questions unanswered and many mysteries unresolved all the while with the sense that it was all pointless. This was especially insulting as the draw of the first episode was the mystery and for it to go completely underdeveloped only leaves a bitter taste.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing decent enough to speak of in this series was the sound. The voice actors were okay with the exception of the voice of Takumi who did a splendid job capturing the essence of creeping terror. The sound effects were decent; sounding realistic but often weren't matched perfectly with the animation. The soundtrack choices were okay as they did represent the feelings of each scene but weren't strong enough to instill it into the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nCh\u00e4oS;HEAd started out promising with a great pilot episode. By utilizing the end as the start, a relatable character (assuming you\u2019re an otaku) and the lure of a mysterious killing it certainly managed to do everything right in drawing you into the story. However as the story progresses seemingly unending flaws and plot holes become apparent, destroying what expectations that you have established. As the series continues you become more frustrated with the direction it has taken and each episode becomes less enjoyable. By the end you realize this is another series that has tried to do too much yet did nothing right at all.\\n\\n\r\nYou will perceive this series to be bad because in reality it is bad. Not even a Gigalomaniac will be able to change your mind.",

            "content": "I watched Chaos;Head not expecting much. I've read a lot of reviews that do not look favourably on it, but I wanted to make my own judgement.\r\nThe show starts out fairly well, actually. For the first few episodes, we get a nice look at the delusional insanity of the main character, Takumi Nishijou. The show actually does really well, creating an oppressive and slightly hostile atmosphere, which really helps to justify the character of Takumi. Takumi, in short, is a fairly pathetic and unpleasant character, but because we see the story through his eyes, his actions don't seem entirely unreasonable, which makes for an interestingfirst few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis set up is promising. Shows that explore insanity can be really really good if done well. Chaos;Head should have stuck with the feeling it had in the beginning. We should have been lead through a maze Takumi's delusions and made to wonder about how much of the plot was actually happening and how much it was being distorted by Takumi's mind.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, the show devolves into a loser hero and his harem battling against a stereotypical villain. Delusions, which should have been the trump card of the show, is effectively relegated to being a plot device (basically magic with a different name), and to being the subject of flawed and shallow philosophical musings. The big problem is that the show tries to be two things at once: on the one hand, a philosophical and psychological thought-experiment; on the other hand, a harem mystery/action show about saving the world from an evil man. These two sides of the show interfere with each other and ruin the show. The detachment from reality that is necessary for the psychological aspect conflicts with the need for a definite reality to ground the conflict of the action side. This results in a disappointing halfway compromise which fulfills neither need.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this review hasn't been nice to Chaos;Head. However, I will say this: I don't regret watching it. Sure, it was disappointing, and sure, nothing in it is particularly well done, but the actual experience of watching it wasn't bad. I don't hate this show. So I will end with this: while I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, if you think it sounds interesting then it's probably worth a watch.",

            "content": "There\u2019s this anime called Steins;Gate that I watched a few months back. I really liked it. In fact, I gave it a near perfect score and rambled on about it for longer than I ever have any anime. But I discovered something whilst searching for a new show to watch: there was a precursor to Steins;Gate, a lesser known anime set in the same world. Lo and behold, I snagged a copy and started watching with expectations high and nothing less than elation at the fact I was about to embark on another journey with the people behind one of my favorite anime\u2026\r\nWHAT THE FUCKIS THIS?\\n\\n\r\nHey, it starts off generic enough. There\u2019s a murderer on the loose, and I shouldn\u2019t have to explain what this murderer is doing as it should be readily apparent. Our main character, Takumi, lives out of a storage crate where he collects anime action figures, plays MMO\u2019s, and is constantly harassed by his waifu who doesn\u2019t seem to have any redeeming qualities or personality beside the fact she wears enough clothes to cover an ant and has large tits. So um, he\u2019s our hero.\\n\\n\r\nTakumi.\\n\\n\r\nYeah.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I have no problem with the portrayal of an otaku with a waifu (sounds familiar to me) I do have a problem with the fact that this character is so batshit insane and delusional that any sort of shits I give for him are thrown out the window by his overly dramatic everything. And on top of that, he\u2019s just an all-around prick. His sister may be annoying, but you\u2019d think he would give a bit of a damn about her, especially considering how scared he is for himself as these murders happen. But nope, not gonna walk my sister home, just gonna let her walk alone and be possibly murdered. Brother of the Year!\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway Takumi sees a pink haired girl murder some guy and picks up a weapon and runs away and meets another girl with glasses and she\u2019s looking into these murders and thinks Takumi is the killer and wants to turn him in and\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIT\u2019S FUCKING BORING! What the hell is going on? Why am I not excited? Seriously, you have this big plot concerning murders and a mysterious killer and the most exciting thing happening is going on a trip to the FUCKING ANIME STORE! Woop-dee-fucking-doo! But later when glasses (her name\u2019s Yua, and while I typically remember names of characters without looking at the Wiki, I had to for this. It shows how much I cared) confronts Takumi about being the murderer, she threatens him with one of the stakes used in the murder he saw. Then she apologizes for threatening to murder him, saying she went a little \u201coverboard\u201d. Oh, are you sure about that? Last time I checked it was okay to threaten to murder someone and point a weapon at his chest.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and guess what happens? Bet you can\u2019t?\\n\\n\r\nDid you guess the pink haired girl goes to Takumi\u2019s school, is in his class, sits right next to him, and claims to be his childhood friend? DING DING DING! You are right!\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, there\u2019s another murder and Takumi figures out that the song lyrics of this band Phantasm are apparently prophesying the deaths. So he goes to check them out. First of all, the music that you are forced to listen to is so bad, so shrill, so horrifying. The band, headed by lead singer Rei Ayanami\u2026I mean Ayase Kishimoto, is horrible. Bad. NOT GOOD. Their most popular song is apparently called Crucifixion, which is what I wished someone would do to me while watching this scene. Thankfully, the song is only forty-five seconds, so I\u2019m assuming their other songs are longer, and the reason Crucifixion is the favorite is because it ends fast, but not fast enough that your brain won\u2019t start punching itself. The concert must have been free with fantastic drink specials, because that is the only way I can see anyone rocking out to this bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nTakumi talks to Ayase about stuff. The police catch Takumi on camera running from that first murder scene so ask him questions, then let him go. Later he is pursued by the police for further questioning, but I guess it is too hard for the police to walk into his classroom and take him away. Why the hell is the guy at school, learning, doing normal things, when he\u2019s being chased by the police? And why wouldn\u2019t the police check the school for him if they want him so bad?\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s this catchphrase the murderer leaves behind. \u201cThose eyes, whose are they\u201d becomes a kind of pop culture thing. People are saying the words left behind by the murderer everywhere: on the street, in the school.  They want to brand it. WHAT? So a whole section of Tokyo is scared to death of a murderer, yet they decide to make his motto into a pop culture kind of thing? And the anime can\u2019t figure out what this catchphrase actually is. \u201cThose eyes, whose are they\u201d becomes \u201cWhose eyes are those\u201d and then goes back to the former. Consistency\u2026Chaos;Head doesn\u2019t have it.\\n\\n\r\nOh, did I also mention that Wikipedia is called We-Key Pedopheria in Chaos;Head? I\u2019ll let you decide why I find something odd with that.\\n\\n\r\nSo Takumi is having these delusions. He sees a guy in a wheelchair named The General who constantly harasses him about auto insurance or some bullshit and he blames it on the pink haired girl who he witnessed at the first murder. Her name is Rimi and I don\u2019t know how she puts up with Takumi. He calls her a demon and tells her he\u2019ll kill her. And her response? Slaps him, cries on his shoulder, and holds his hand. Because, you know\u2026realism!\\n\\n\r\nAs the plot continues to thicken, and I mean thicken to the consistency of syrup, we are led deeper and deeper into a world of confusion. What I mean is the plot makes no sense the more it keeps going. Well, let me rephrase that. It makes a little sense but is so convoluted and explained so badly that you\u2019ll end the show scratching your head and wondering how Ir2 is the equation that can destroy the world. There are these people with swords who are fighting to protect the world from being peaceful or something. There\u2019s a big evil corporation that uses these backpacks to make people believe their delusions are reality. The corporation has created a big metal testicle that will save the world from evil and make people happy through rebooting the system or some bullshit. There are six girls and one guy, Takumi, with these D-swords that are going to stop le evil corporation from making the world happy and safe because Takumi is a selfish fuckwit who wants to pork Rimi rather than let the world be without war.\\n\\n\r\nThis sounds as exciting as watching butter melt, and it is. The originality of the plot stems from its use of delusions being projected between people, but this entire idea is so badly explained. I didn\u2019t get it. I still don\u2019t understand half of what happened. When blowing minds, you must first set up a base level that everyone can get, and build to a pinnacle point where my head explodes with the ideas complexity. But this show jumps right for the pinnacle rather than explain the lower layers. Thus, no mind blown, just a guy scratching his head.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s point out some more fallacies. First, our buddy Takumi is the only person in his school wearing green. Everyone else wears blue. Trying to stand out and be a rebel Takumi? I mean, nobody likes you and you don\u2019t have many friends anyway\u2026no need to stand out from the rest\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAyase jumps off a four or five story school building and lands in a bed of flowers and manages to survive with no injuries. Because flowers are like a ten foot thick pillow.\\n\\n\r\nAt a later point in the show, the people downtown have a mass delusion and see the gayest excavator of all time strut down the road. When it disappears, they move on with their lives like nothing happen. And as the sword bearing girls destroy the backpacks containing the delusion machines with their seven foot tall ridiculous-ass swords, nobody says anything. Just a normal day in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a very cute character named Kozupii. She\u2019s probably the only character I can say I gave a percentile of a damn about. She can\u2019t talk. So she uses telepathy instead. She apparently had a bad experience as a child, and, as with everything in this show, it\u2019s fucking stupid. When she was a child, people followed her with mirrors and asked her who she was. Because\u2026that makes sense? People do that? Sure.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode nine Takumi is called by his sister, in dire need of help. He tells her to quit prank calling him. You know, when she sounds like she\u2019s being hurt, it must be a prank. Rather than be nice and ask what is going on. Because it\u2019s not like there are FUCKING MURDERS HAPPENING AND SHE COULD BE HURT!\\n\\n\r\nSo let me stop complaining about the plot and complain about everything else I haven\u2019t complained about  yet. The animation is horrible. It may be old, but the animation is still bad for the time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let me tell you something inspirational: You\u2019re always super special. The lackluster opening can be forgiven because everything else about the anime is lackluster. But the closing credits are a thing of beauty. Accompanied by the beautiful sounds of a Japanese person trying to speak English, this song is the epitome of laughable. Why are you trying to speak English when you don\u2019t know English?\\n\\n\r\nHere, just read the lyrics. Maybe you can interpret them for me:\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re always super special, that\u2019s why you are here with me\\n\r\nMiracle baby, I\u2019m happy to be with you\\n\r\nBig sing of \u201clove and peace\u201d\\n\r\nWhere there\u2019s enough bombs to blow the Earth\\n\r\n \u201cAll A-kids only\u201d\\n\r\nPrioritize money they own\\n\\n\r\nI wish I was kidding, but those are the real lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, I watched twelve episodes of this giant piece of festering dog shit. In those five or so hours I wasted I could have been reading a book, taking a class, learning a language, giving my time to charity. Nope, instead I dulled my mind with an overly complicated, underdeveloped, ugly, uninteresting mess of an anime. The characters are all cardboard cut outs with nothing at all to keep you interested in them. The plot continually gets more and more overly-complicated and badly explained. The writing is downright atrocious. The design is idiotic (the bad guys sword\u2026what the fuck was that?). Everything about this anime is bad. The only redeeming factor I may be able to give it is the fact that it ends.\\n\\n\r\nSave yourself five hours and heed my advice. Don\u2019t watch this. If you haven\u2019t seen Steins;Gate, watch that. If you have, go back and watch it again. Just, please, avoid Chaos;Head at all costs.",

            "content": "story- now i have heard how bad the story was from some people before going into the anime. however i mostly did go and watch it as a prerequisite to watch chaos;child that was recently released. the way the story goes initially isn't that bad. we have some cooped up Highschool student who is also a shut-in, neet, otaku. what makes him a bit different is that he suffers from mental problems ranging from schizophrenia, disassociation identity disorder, and other delusions. while interesting aren't used or explored to their fullest potential as most of it are discarded for something else or overused to the pointof exhaustion and no longer becomes clever or useful to the story. \\n\r\nof course  the main source of the story are the murders that take place which our main character becomes a suspect in and from their many of the other characters mostly girls begin to show up. at this point the story descends and turns from an average psychological anime into just some chunni fighting anime. as any use of delusions are now used from characters to use their magical swords and powers. plot, ideas, characters and technobabble just come out of left field and all that's left is to sat \"OK\" as things begin to happen for no rhyme or reason and nothing cohesive in the narrative to hold the plot points together. at the end of it all i have to say is \"that's it\"? as the story comes to some conclusion but never feeling like one\\n\r\n3/10\\n\r\nsound- when it comes to the voice acting it's alright for the most part the MC and several of the girls voices do end of getting annoying at points and bad at other points. the soundtrack was mostly forgettable adding nothing to the anime\\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\nart/animation- animation wise it was decent nothing felt that bad but it was mostly unimpressive. it works for what it was going for i guess. the background art looks decent enough but some of the character designs just look bad or shift between average to below average, to bad with little consistency\\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\ncharacters-  pretty much all the characters in the story had very little depth going on with them . as explained before the MC is some neet and feels more like a reactionary character that takes in all that is going on rather than having some sort of personality other than being crazy. of course he does develop a bit at the end but it end up feeling contrived rather than earned.  the girls in the story are nothing more than cookie cutter personality with little depth as well you may get back story out of several but never much in detail and never develop in a decent manner or at all. it's also explained that the girls get their power from mental torture they endured but is so lazily explained that it feels redundant. their also some unimportant bad guy and side characterless but very little to talk or care about  like the rest of the cast\\n\r\n2/10\\n\r\nenjoyment- not sure what to say other than i just went through this in one day and felt absolutely nothing. well other than that it's laughably bad but no bad enough to drop watching it, but just bad enough to see how worse it can get\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\noverall below average soundtrack, voice acting, and animation and  just bad story and characters.  \\n\r\n3/10\ufeff",

I'm a fan of the visual novels but the story in the anime was rushed as heck and even though I knew the story it was just madness  and very difficult to keep track of.  I mean like could anyone really understand what was going on half the time.  Even on the parts they tried explaining they failed at explaining all the way.  Well the main reason for this is because they only made the show 12 episodes they needed to make it at least 18 episodes \r\n(I know that's a weird number but still).\r\nArt: theart was really choppy and was only decent sometimes, the opening didn't even have average animation.  You could tell the animators tried their hardest to make as many still scenes as possible.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: probably the most passable thing in the show(just cause I am fan of Kanako Ito (not sure if I should put the \"u\" doesn't really matter).  The ending theme wasn't anything special (wasn't trying to use the word special but all well) the only reason I remember it because it was pretty annoying.  The sound track can't really remember anything worth mentioning except \"Phantasm\" which was great except they changed \"Phantasm\" in the dub which really pissed me off.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I'm one of those people who doesn't hate on Takumi just because he really wasn't annoying to me but I understand why people hate him as a main character.  He wasn't really a stable person to begin with so why make him get even crazier with all the mind f*cks, don't know maybe just me.  All the other characters were actually generic and I only really ended up liking Kozue(not because i'm a lolicon)because her attitude was very enlightening.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Yeah.......couldn't really enjoy much from this i'd rather just play the visual novel because it has everything I could enjoy from this and more.  This wasn't enjoyable there are a lot of things in this that made me cringe while watching this.  The thing that made me cringe the most is most people won't play the visual novel because most people will watch the anime and think the visual novel is terrible.(btw I don't think the visual novel is the best thing in the world and it is not my favorite either, just saying it's way better than the anime)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: just don't watch it I just recommend  the visual novel or watch steins;gate or robotics;notes since they take place in the same universe.",

Those people had better brace themselves for major disappointment.\r\nThe story centers around Takumi Nishijou, a teenage shut in who basicly spends all of his time playing RPG games, watching anime, and chatting online. He has heard through the grapevine about a series of murders, known as \"New Gen,\" occurring in his town. However, he dismisses this, as it does not apply to the \"two dimensional world\" he lives in\u2026that is, untilhe witnesses an awful murder at the hands of a pink-haired girl, who then becomes his classmate and claims they are best friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that pisses me off the most about Chaos;Head is that they actually had a really great idea for what could have been a very successful anime.  All of the supernatural elements are based on the theory that if the majority of people can perceive something, it is reality. They introduce a secret organization that plans to bend reality by sending images into the \"blind spots\" in people's brains, and \"giglomaniacs,\" who use the same power to try and stop them. It started out as an amazing mystery, but quickly took a turn for the worse when they started bringing in all of these stupid sci-fi elements. Also, the back stories of the characters made absolutely no sense. Basicly, they just didn\u2019t give reason for any of the events. So your mother was tortured\u2026okay\u2026can you tell us why? No, you just needed a back story to add more trauma to the life of your already generically angsty character.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, the only one who seemed to have thoughts of any kind was the main character, Takumi. The rest of the characters were so flat, it almost seemed that Takumi was the only character in the entire series. They all had very generic and uninteresting personalities, and barely any presence at all. Also, there was almost no development. The characters were pretty much exactly the same from the beginning to the end. Nobody grew, nobody learned, nobody seemed to gain anything from this journey. These characters were clearly only around to be looked at.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s really all that needs to be said about the disappointment that was Chaos; Head. Avoid this series at all costs. Believe me, it is NOT worth your time. It took a brilliant idea, and made it into a sloppy, generic, and overall terrible series.\\n",

I liked the show, I really did, but it was just below being called \"amazing\".\r\nI liked the story, it had an interesting plot, disturbing at times, but interesting. It starts off pretty basic for any psychological thriller, there have been some strange murders, you know, the basics. Although what made this show unique was how the murders happened, and if you watch it, you'll know what I mean. Anyways, the main guy is a total Otaku, which is how hegot the nickname \"Taku\" (short for Takumi). He skips school because he doesn't have many friends and he likes being alone, and by alone, I mean alone with his imaginary anime girlfriend. In other words, he's a total nerd. He lives in a shipping crate because he hates living at home with his parents, and his sister comes to visit him every so often.\\n\\n\r\nHis, what he would call \"normal\", life changes when he gets sent a picture of one of the murders from a strange user online. A day later, he goes down an ally to find that the murder in the picture had just taken place, with a pink haired girl holding the weapons used to kill the man, and evidently she knows him. He runs, goes back to school, guess what? She's in his class. What's even better, they're both best friends, or that's what she says at least.\\n\\n\r\nIt all spirals down from there to a point where humanity could end and he has to save the world.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was definitely worthy of being called a \"psychological thriller\" because you really had to think if you wanted to understand what they were talking about. I had to watch the entire series twice just to understand it completely. Confusing, but super good.",

            "content": "Spoiler free!\r\n=== STORY ===\r\nThe plot for this was... unbalanced. I think that's the right word. It started out kind of interesting, and could be the setup for a horrer-mystery type thing, but then it gets kind of sidetracked and comes to a grinding halt in the middle. Some extremely fast character development in the last 3 episodes is used to build up to... an unimpressive ending.\r\nIt seemed to me like a proper plot arc that was flipped upside-down, with a semi-interesting beginning, a generic ending and a depression in the middle where the rest of the show was supposed to go. Through the middle, therewas a slow build up to something, but the big \"twist\" really didn't shock me, which makes the rest of the plot useless.\\n\\n\r\n=== ART ===\\n\r\nNothing much to mention here. There weren't any interesting fight scenes, and most of the world was fairly ordinary.\\n\\n\r\n=== SOUND ===\\n\r\nI really like the opening song, but besides that, again, nothing really caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\n=== CHARACTER ===\\n\r\nThis is probably the weakest part of the show. None of the characters felt real - with the possible exception of the MC who is a whiney sissy the ENTIRE SHOW. He grated on me quickly.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, the character development is extremely slow, until the last episode where the MC suddenly grows a pair and actually fights (which also wasn't believable). Even so, the fight didn't feel very satisfactory or exciting, since the villain was utterly forgettable.\\n\\n\r\n=== OVERALL ===\\n\r\nI didn't really like this show. I was mildly interested in the beginning and quickly lost interest at the end. I mainly watched it because I enjoyed Steins;Gate so much, and was hoping that the precursor to it was good. It wasn't. I don't remember any references to Chaos;Head in Steins;Gate, and don't think it's worth watching to understand the rest of the series.",

            "content": "There are many animes that I dislike, but there are few animes that I can truly say that I hate. This is the prime example of that.\r\nAn anime can be boring, or have bland characters, and that's fine. I'll dislike the anime, but whatever. This anime, however, had an excellent start. The main character is interesting to see just how insane he is, and he's suddenly pushed into this dark and dangerous world filled with gruesome murders. He worked perfectly with this premise, because he would actually try to escape into his own insanity simply for comfort and that was really interesting to watch. Wehad a great mystery, and I genuinely wanted to see where they would take this.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we got the payoff. The only compliment I can give the payoff was that it was unexpected, as in I would never have expected this show to take such a turn for the dumb. For obvious spoiler reasons I won't list it here, but I'll tell you what I can. Essentially, they took genuine mystery story, that I wanted to see continue, and turned it into this crappy excuse of a supernatural sword fighting anime fighting against an evil corporation that wanted to use their powers for evil. The tone of the story ENTIRELY changed, and quite suddenly too. Everything of value, of seeing this guy go insane, of the mystery of what was happening to him and how he was tied to all these murders, of the hope for a decent explanation was gone in an instant.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even by supernatural sword fighting animes it was stupid.\\n\\n\r\nBut not only was the payoff bad, but the timing was off too. When did the solve the mystery? At the end right? WRONG. The mystery was solved in middle of the season. The mystery was SOLVED and they still had HALF A SEASON TO GO.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's not just that they screwed up the ending so badly. Possibly the worst thing about this show is not only did it burn down this great mystery story it had set up, but it pissed on the ashes. They added insult to injury by continually taunting us with \"mystery\" moments that are supposed to make you think \"What's happening to this poor guy?\" when we already know what's happening to the poor guy because THE MYSTERY WAS ALREADY SOLVED. And the rest of the season was just as boring as you'd imagine it to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I truly, truly hate this anime. I'll give it a 3 overall, because despite my hatred of this anime, I still at least try to remember what a good mystery they had originally set up, and even though they screwed that over, I can still find some value in remember those first few episodes when it didn't suck. If you really want to watch this, only watch the first few episodes, and run away as quickly as possible when you see a girl with a big transparent sword. Let the mystery always be in your head, and you'll be fine and might actually walk away from this with an enjoyable experience. And then go watch Steins;Gate, which was made by the same people and actually became one of my personal favorite animes. How these two animes could be related though still baffles me.",

I think he is. The art makes the Chais ;head really unique including the art. Some scenes are scary too me.

He followed it until he found out a bloody scene before his eyes, with a girl you know looks like the murderer of that scene. Then more clue and another clue bring you to another scene of gore incident.\\n\\n\r\nDelusion. Is the first thing comes to my mind when remembering this story. What if something you imagine becomes reality. Actually it wasn't nice, especially if you deluding over something like murder and girl you know (and you found her cute) is the murderer. It's your fault if you delude over something with your wrecked brain. Comeback to reality, myself!",

But if you can get your imagination captured by the good ideas and mentally fill in the blanks and blank out the terrible execution, you definitely could enjoy this show. But if you have any decent level of cynicism in you you'll hate this\\n\\n\r\nbut after re-watching with friends with a bit of alcohol i have realized this is a great terrible thing to watch, its so bad it can be funny in the right mindset",

I watched this show when I was younger and had finished the likes of Rosario + whatever and Highschool double DxD. Then I found this\u2026 it is closer to a horror movie without the horror elements or a psychological show but nothing is ever explained or makes sense. I honestly felt like I had no concept of time watching this show and not in a good way. With all that said\u2026its not bad, but definitely be prepared for this thing. The best way to describe this show iswith a scenario. Let\u2019s say you have just moved to a new house, but when you get there the house next door is a bouncy castle and its residents are sentient mannequins who also don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on\u2026 Enjoy. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, so I apologize in advance if I did not did a great job. This anime has many different rating from 2 to 10, all over the place. The main reason was because of expectations, but if you asked whether I enjoy it or not I enjoy it greatly. It was adapted for a Visual Novel, if you asked whether you should play the Visual Novel, I should say yes, since it is way better but that does not mean it was a bad adaptation, in the contrary it was well done.\r\nThe series its about delusions and reality. With that conceptthere is this horror and psychological esque scenarios. The MC is a  shy semi shut in, that does not have much interest with the third dimensional world. He somehow gets involve with a crime, that would make him stress over his life and peaceful life. There will be some truths and lies, that the MC will be stressing over as he gets involve in such crime, and the audience will enjoy as they learn what is real and what is not, as our delusional MC learns the truth.\\n\\n\r\nI'll cut to the chase the people that rated as very bad might have three reasons of why.\\n\\n\r\n First reason, the MC, many might have wanted a different character, a more brave and badass charater, but if that was the case the series would had been just plainly bad, and be more generic. The MC makes the series feel confusing, psychological, with a bit of horror and suspense, because of him, it makes stand out. But a lot of people wanted a MC that you want to relate to and admire. But if all stories would be that way, with the same class of character, they would just be carbon copy of each other. There is a harem tag on here but this series won't be your casual harem series you are expecting if you want to watch the usual ecchi+harem (I am not bashing the genre, I love those series too, but I like that is not concentrated this time on that).\\n\\n\r\nSecond reason, the ending. The ending might not be as great as many people would have like it. For me it was well done, but maybe a bit better in the polishing of its execution would have been better. The first 10 episodes are incredibly well done, the ending is not bad but not excellent either.\\n\\n\r\nThe third reason some people expected a bit more battle esque scenes, this series has some action, but its not the reason why you see it in the first place. I have read some comments about the episodes and it seems at times they had wanted a random power up for the MC to show some cool fighting scenes.  For battle action lovers, although there are fights this is not an battle action series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHow to tell whether you might enjoy the series? Watch the first two episodes and you shall see whether you like it or not. I was hooked by the first episode. If the suspense of the story does not get you by the second episode, it might not be your cup of tea.  This story greatness relies on the suspense and keeping the audience in the dark, while they make several theories of what is happening until the reveal what is going on. What is a delusion, a lie or reality? What is the truth? They do a great job of it. Again not a love-com harem series, or battle action series. It is a story of suspense while you keep theorizing of what is happening. A good series if you have watched too much of the so called \"generic anime\" for a while.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\r\nFirst impressions, so we got a super natural marrder mystery going down with harem elements going in the background. Sounds interesting enough.\r\nStory,5/10 \r\nSo the premise and setup of  choas head is pretty simple for the most part because in one way or another it's has been done before a lot of time.\r\nYou know Like we have the main character living his Madame life. There are some mysterious murders that have been going down  in his local area. He doesn't pay attention to these things and then out of nowhere he is then quickly dragged into the middle ofit.\\n\r\nwith him now trying to figure out what has been going on and finding out that things are more than they appear and him also finding out that he's got got super natural powers that give him the ability to make his imagination real and along the way finding out that there some girls who also have the same power as him. \\n\\n\r\nWhich now in retrospect this kind of thing has been kind of done before and some times better in the choas head case. \\n\r\nNow I am not saying that choas head is bad in any way. Because I thought it was quite interesting for what it was because it tackles some interesting concepts, like how realty can change so quickly or how you shouldn't trust everything you see and how do you describe the concept of  something that as real for not.\\n\r\nWhich is really something you don't see that very often.\\n\\n\r\nBut the problem I have with chaos head as a whole is that it's presentation was very disappointing in quite a few areas. I am pretty sure and don't quote me on this I am pretty \\n\r\nsure that the presentation in the visnel novel that this was based off was a lot better. But problems I have for one is that the pacing is very fast. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom a nartive stand point it feels like to me that it's hip hoping to every major plot point in about 12 episodes. \\n\r\nWhich kind of  kills all build up and because of the small amount of episodes the show never had time for cool down moments  or side story's to help flesh out the setting.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things  that the anime did get right when it came to presentation was the creepy atmosphere because this a story about mystery and murder.\\n\\n\r\nNow another problem I had as the ending because it was very wft and it is one of those open endings where you don't know what really happens next. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character taku was some what interesting.\\n\r\nLike his personality wasn't that special because he was a shut-in otaku who really doesn't have much of a personality. But what made him interesting was his mental problems which his ability kind of made it more fun because you don't really know if any off the things that he is seeing are real or something that he is thinking off.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters.\\n\r\nWhere also kind of interesting in way as well.\\n\r\nBecause they all had something interesting about them.\\n\\n\r\nlike for example one of the characters mostly  speaks in cryptic  word play.\\n\r\nA different character who was also interesting as a girl who only speaks using ner mind. \\n\\n\r\nEven though there personallys are genetic as hell.\\n\\n\r\nOne problem I found was the character relationships.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the pacing and ep count we never these characters come together naturally.\\n\\n\r\nNow You could say that to some  extent that they became closer together because they shared a common enemy  that was a huge threat and because of that they became closer.\\n\r\nBut doesn't really justify the fact that some of where some what close to him even though thay had only know him for a short time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow animation for choas head for the most part looks very nice for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nIt has some very nice backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has a nice colors as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe quite liked the op and ending themes \\n\r\nThey where quite nice to listen to.\\n\r\nBut they not really worth looking for.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost well kind of lacking for the part on its own. \\n\r\nBut it did bring the right atmosphere to every scene that showed up in the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWell on of the things I quite liked was the idea behind it. \\n\r\nBecause on Paper this would have been a really good idea if it was presented better.\\n\r\nI liked it's  idea of realty being contently put in a state of Mind fuck.\\n\\n\r\nI also quite enjoyed the creep atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nBut pacing and ep count did put  a  major dampening  of how I enjoyed is show. Because \\n\r\nWhile watching this show  it really did feel that it was missing something more to it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf your into v.n anime adaptation then you will probably   like it even though it feels a like fan service for v.n players.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you not into gennic story's in general and you do t like gore or maid fuck then stay a way. \\n\r\nBut you like the idea of choas head.\\n\r\nYour probably better off playing the game.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The plot does it's best to weed it's way into your head- and succeeds. It wasn't long before I found myself trying to confirm the existence of everything around me while looking like some sort of crazedmaniac. The only thing that I could complain about is- and this may only be me- but I struggled to keep up with the explanations. They we're said quickly and used lots of confusing words thus making it hard to follow. (Reading this back I sound like an idiot)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are very mixed. You've got the main character who is a NEET with his caring short fused little sister. After meeting these two you are continually introduced to new characters over the series. How likeable are they? Very good question! This really depends on your preferences, in my opinion only a few of the characters had a positive image. The main character; while there is nothing that really forces you to hate him, he's not got many likeable traits. This is the case for a lot of the characters in Chaos;head. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it?\\n\r\nI do, while some parts are a little hard to follow, the plot flows smoothly and really plays with your brain. If you are a person who enjoys tripping over your own thoughts as you try to unwind everything that's happened in the episode so you can come to some conclusion on what the hell is going on then this is the anime for you! If not, then I still think you should watch it. Hey, you may end up a crazed lunatic doubting your own existence like the rest of us!\\n\\n\r\n-MrCallum",

            "content": "I went into this anime having heard others bemoan it for being a terrible piece of junk anime but wanted to watch it before I began Steins Gate.  As per usual I do not watch the opening until the last episode, as I believe it often contains spoilers about un-met characters so I went into the anime fairly blind. \r\nI found myself enjoying the first few episodes immensely, watching with anticipation as the main character struggled with the collision of reality and delusions.  I was even tempted to Google the ending to confirm my own suspicions that Rimi was a delusion and itwas the main character killing the people (I was clearly wrong).  And then things started to fall apart.  \\n\r\nI was skeptical of the detectives being included as a parallel story line, and from that point on things that would have worked perfectly fine as the main characters delusions, actually turned out to be due to...science...? \\n\r\nThe anime started making less sense, and the main character became more annoying.  What started out as a slightly creepy psychological horror/thriller anime turned into a full-blown shonen gotta-catch-them-all harem chuunibyou delusion anime with the last episode being so unmemorable I don't remember it at all despite watching it less than a month ago.  I understand the plot is derived or follows closely with the visual novel, and I wonder whether some intern at the animating studio read the script and went 'hey guys I think this makes no sense, should we revisit this?' but was told to fuck off and go get coffee for everyone and the anime was never made intelligible.  \\n\r\nThe other main characters have very limited introductions and backstories, and you care very little about them.  The main character's 'save me save me' attitude gets old very very fast, and the only interesting theme centers around trying to figure out who the hell is the killer (which gets ruined too in a very anti-climactic way).  \\n\r\nIn conclusion, while I think it began as a strong anime, it fell apart as it tried to add too much to the anime, and really becomes difficult to like or care about the remainder of the story.  The only memorable part about the entire anime is 'who's eyes are those?'",

Just about every episode keeps you at the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next. I remember waiting each week wondering what would happen next to Taku. Towards the end Chaos Head seemed to have been a bit rushed, but besides that it&rsquo;s overall a decent watch. Better than some of the other animated works that had been released around the time this one had been. This is probably a better anime to be watched by those that had played the game, but being thatI hadn&rsquo;t played the game I was still very pleased with the series. Worth the watch!\\n\\n\\n",

I have just completed the series and I found it to be very interesting, and by that I mean it held my attention with gigantic phrases and theories that sound smart, but in retrospect are basically preachings from the gospel (or something like that). The hook for this story is the insanity that Takumi goes through after receiving an e-mailed picture of a murder, which was the latest in a series of killings called The Exge killings. He then goes mad as he triesto prove he isn't the murderer and that he is a real person (this comes up later down the line). As for my opinion, I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers. Sometimes I had to pause and rewind to catch what was going on, but it wasn't too bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this 9/10, it really put some reality bending ideas into perspective and made them seem plausible with inexplicable reasons and theories. And the ending was phenomenal (although some may not agree), it was dramatic and made sense to some degree.",

Just when you think you understand it all something happens, and I found myself going \"no way?!\"  I guess that's what made it so interesting to watch.  Then again all of the psychological genre anime I have watched, none of them were boring.  In fact I find that this genre of anime has the best story lines.  Well in my opinion.  \r\nAt first the story seems a little hard to follow.I often found myself pause/rewinding my vid just to see what happened to read the words on the computer. (any time there is a scene with the main character in the chat room it is very brief)  In time you slowly begin to understand what is going on, but at the same time you have so many questions and confused.  Only at the end do you feel that you understand what was going on, and it all seems to make scene.\\n\\n\r\nNot a very violent anime as some people claim it to be.  There are only 3-4 scenes that you may find disturbing.  \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I felt was very out of place was the ending song.  It is just way too upbeat, and does not match the anime at all.  At least the opening kind of sets the mood.  The lyrics are of hard to read since the people that translated is made the words white.  So it made reading them king of hard since it blended in with the back round at times.\\n\\n\r\nNot very in depth with the characters.  Not every character is explained.  Most are given a short one time explanation and that is it.  So you most likely still have some unanswered questions when you finish the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nNot much else I have to say about this anime.  I mean if you like anime with lots of twists and turns this is a pretty good one to watch.  I enjoyed watching this series to the point where it took me about 24 hours or less to complete it.  Well then again I watched this on myspace (finally no more megavideo)",

I really wanted to enjoy it and see it for what it could have been, but I was subsequently disappointed, and here's why.\r\nI'm not saying it was a terrible series, the problem (in my opinion) lies solely in the fact that it was limited to 12 episodes. There was way too much of a story concept for such a short amount of time. \r\nThis lead to the storyline being sort of all over the place. I wouldn't say it's confusing, but there were a lot of moments where I was asking myself \"what's goingon now?\".\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were great, I feel like in one way or another we can all relate to Takumi. The whole concept of delusions and reality coming together was a pretty cool idea. Unfortunately though, as I said, there just wasn't enough time to get the whole story across in an organized and simple fashion, and that's where they lost points with me in the end.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the only advice I can give for people that are planning to watch this series - you'll enjoy it, but please don't go into it expecting an amazing, gripping and suspenseful anime.",

            "content": "I first stumbled upon on a more prominent and dominating sister anime; Steins;Gate, which I thought was pretty descent with its display of mind-twisting time travel science fiction, so I decided to see this one. Since this one is way below the line of what its sister anime created, you might think that this is rather unpleasant or not worth the sacrifice. Personally, I think that this is better than Steins;Gate because it exhibited more confusion, mystery, thrills and it perfectly simulated the philosophy of one of the greatest philosophers in history \u2013 Plato, wherein he quoted, \u201cWhat if reality is just an illusion?\u201d \r\nStory(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story had a strong start with all the mysteries and confusion going on. You will have yourself wondering whether the character is a mental lunatic or somebody was just playing tricks on him; it perfectly depicts the characteristics of a psychological thriller. The story slowly but beautifully unravels its neatly tied ribbon. Although, as it goes further towards the end of its shinning crimson ribbon, the thrill you experience in the beginning will slowly fade away with it and transform into a sort of typical shonen battle anime. It started out strong but ended in an awkward but heart-warming way. The ending was quite weak to put it simply but the overall concept was quite astonishing. \\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was not that bad but it is quite unoriginal. For an art to stand out, it must hold onto a special element that belongs only to the anime or something like a signature style. You want to remember the characters faces no matter how many years have passed like Naruto and his yellow spiky hair and ninja outfit, Ichigo from Bleach with his orange spiky hair and shinigami attire, Lelouch vi Britannia and his Zero alter-ego costume or Kei Kurono with its realistic art and his Gantz battle suit and weaponry. Though I must say that the art is in sync with the anime but it could be better. \\n\\n\r\nSounds (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds were pretty descent, clean and strike at the right moment especially with those heart-stopping moments wherein you are unsure or unable to predict what is happening. The intro was plain and simple but it does give you a good vibe after every episode and as for the outro, it has a sorta techno dance feel to it which I find rather awkward for an outro for this kind of anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were quite distinct especially for the main protagonist with his seemingly twisted and confusing characteristics. The six main ladies in the series were quite distinguishable though some are weaker than the other. The antagonists on the other hand were quite the mastermind indeed but were not fully exposed throughout the series, which is a shame. \\n\\n\r\n*Overall, it is good but it could have been better. What would make most people remember a good anime is a good ending so one must create a big impact towards this line like the tragic ending in Death Note, Code Geass and Kuroshitsuji or a heart warming happily ever after moment in Junjou Romantica and Ouran Highschool Host Club. This anime ended simply but it did not bring that much of an impact that would tear your heart to shreds although it does not necessarily mean it ended horribly. The strongest points of this anime are its psychological and mysterious thrilling beginning and its philosophical concepts that would twist your mind.  \\n",

            "content": "Takumi Nishij\u014d is a complete hikikomori otaku who spends his days living in a docking crate on the roof of a cheap apartment complex. Practically his entire daily routine consists of playing his MMORPG, while having virtually no friends or social life. He even follows a strict schedule that allows him to go to school as little as possible, while still passing for the year. Takumi wants nothing to do with the so-called \u201c3-D world\u201d and instead indulges in sensual delusions with his \u201c2-D wife\u201d Orgel Seira, a female character from his favorite anime. His only contact with his family is through his bratty youngersister Nanami Nishij\u014d, though she does little to distract him from his own delusional 2-D world. \\n\\n\r\nOne night he\u2019s sent several images of a gruesome murder from a mysterious online user named Shogun. He initially dismisses them as fake, until something unexpected happens: Takumi witness the exact same murder the next day. The murderer appears to be a mysterious pink-haired girl, who\u2019s driven a hundred metal stakes into the victim\u2019s body. He flees the scene and is convinced that the girl is out for him next. When Takumi returns to class a few days later, he sees the exact same girl in his homeroom class! She claims to be close friends with him, but Takumi has no such memory of her. Soon he gets caught up in a series of even more murders dubbed the \u201cNew Generation Madness,\u201d while meeting several pretty girls who have a surprising interest and connection to him. What he\u2019ll face will change his life forever.\\n\\n\r\nIf the above synopsis seems like an interesting and compelling story, than that\u2019s because it is\u2026 in the video game. You see, Chaos;Head was originally a visual novel created by the companies 5pb and Nitroplus, who are particularly well known for such games in Japan. For those of you unaware of the genre, a visual novel is essentially a story-driven game that requires little to no interactivity. Mostly they consist of reading text and making the occasional choice that affects the story in some way. The graphics consist of static pictures (usually anime-like), with background music to set the scene. If the company has a higher budget, sometimes full voice acting is added for every spoken line. Now, that genre might not sound too exciting at first; but the stories in VNs are some of the most compelling and in-depth ever brought to video games. Due to their niche nature, they have a hard time selling well outside of Japan; so most go unlocalized. Some visual novels occasionally do get released like the Phoenix Wright and Zero Escape series of games, sometimes to even great success; but those games actually do have gameplay apart from strictly reading text. Chaos;Head isn\u2019t one of those games, so it never received a localized release. It was originally released on PC and later ported over to Xbox 360, PS3, PSP, iOS, and Android.  \\n\\n\r\nThe reviews I\u2019ve seen for this series have ranged from mediocre to outright horrible, but is it really that bad? I\u2019m probably one of the few people out there that\u2019s actually read the visual novel before seeing this series, so I think that gives me more than enough qualification to give this series a proper review. Anyways, a fan translation was luckily released for the game so I decided to check out the PC version. And wow, was it a trippy experience. Simply put, C;H is probably one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I\u2019ve ever had. It begins slowly, luring one in with a false sense of security. But when the mystery soon reveals itself and all the story elements falls into place, it becomes a non-stop thriller that had me glued to my computer screen until the very end. So yeah, the story was good; damn good even. As you might have expected, I had a lot of expectations going into this series. And unfortunately, the story only remained partially intact in its transition from game to anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe first problem is the length of the overall series. It seemed that the creators of the anime tried to take a 30+ hour story and squeeze it in the span of only 12 episodes. Now, most adaptions of anything inevitably have to take some things out; but there\u2019s almost no excuse with a television series. Seriously, 12 episodes? They couldn\u2019t have at least doubled that number? Now, the story isn\u2019t entirely butchered and the main plot points still are there; but there are several events in the series that are executed rather poorly in comparison to the visual novel which obviously wasn\u2019t limited by time constraints. Some things have been taken out and a few new events are clumsily thrown in that weren\u2019t even in the original story to start with! The shortness of this series kind of suggests to me that this was designed as more of a promotional tool than anything else. That leads into the second main problem. More or less, the anime assumes you\u2019ve actually read the visual novel. I can guess that perhaps 95% of the people watching this have not done so, thus many will probably be lost at some points.\\n\\n\r\nWith all my complaints, anyone reading this would probably assume that I\u2019m with everyone else in hating the series. In actuality though, I don\u2019t view it in such low regard. It no doubt has its flaws, but Chaos;Head still proves to be a thoroughly engrossing and compelling series for the most part. It may not have the same amount of depth as the visual novel, but what\u2019s presented is far from terrible. The story of the anime at least tries to stay true to the game and many of the cliffhangers that the episodes end on actually did make me want to keep watching. The show takes several surprising twists and turns through its brief course, and the major reveal that takes place towards the end is handled very well. The questions that Chaos;Head asks are real mind-benders too. Is this the real life or is it just fantasy (yes, that\u2019s a Queen reference)? Who can Takumi actually trust? Can delusions actually manifest into reality? Many of these do get answered in the end, but there are several sub-plots that seem to get forgotten or lost along the way. The ending itself might prove a tad confusing for some, and perhaps even lackluster; but I actually enjoyed its ambiguous tone. The way it connects to the beginning is actually pretty effective and surprising. Overall, the story of Chaos;Head almost reaches levels of true greatness; but several problems hold it back from being truly amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nSo what about the characters throughout the show? Well for starters, let\u2019s look at the protagonist, Takumi. At first glance, he seems to represent the stereotypical otaku. Anti-social, staying in all day, and playing video games. What makes him stand out, are the intense delusions that he constantly has and how they affect his surroundings. The visual novel\u2019s \u201cdecision system\u201d originally consisted of choosing different kinds of delusions, both good and bad, which would affect the story. The anime incorporates some of these in the plot, and they can get pretty creepy at times. Some of these are real obvious in that they\u2019re just fantasy, but others are real enigmas that almost seem scarily true. He\u2019s essentially a really messed up kid, and it\u2019s clear that Takumi probably has a mental problem not unlike schizophrenia. I guess that\u2019s part of what makes him such an entertaining character. Takumi is probably one of the most unlikely protagonists I\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s not a strong hero or out to save anyone. He\u2019s simply a troubled high schooler who simply just wants to be alone and play his online game because he lacks social skills. You really do feel sorry for him. Come on, if you\u2019re that hardcore to watch such an obscure anime series; you can probably relate to this guy at least a little. I know that I can. \\n\\n\r\nThen there are the supporting characters, and they\u2019re practically all female. This has sort of given Chaos;Head the negative stigma of being a harem anime, but it really isn\u2019t. Sure, you\u2019ve got a lone male protagonist surrounded by gorgeous women. It\u2019s a sci-fi mystery series at its core, and the whole romance aspect isn\u2019t even made apparent until the end. It\u2019s not like these women don\u2019t serve a purpose either. If anything, Chaos;Head probably satirizes the genre. If the rest of the cast had been male, I think we\u2019d probably have a far less interesting plot.  \\n\r\n Rimi Sakihata is the girl that Takumi witnesses at the murder scene who also claims to be his friend. He\u2019s initially deathly afraid and tries to avoid her at all costs. Eventually though, she appears to actually care for him and he\u2019s grows to trust her more. She\u2019s essentially the \u201cperfect girlfriend\u201d type of character, and there\u2019s really not that much else to say other than she\u2019s one of the few strong female anime characters that isn\u2019t just walking fan service. The relationship between Takumi and Rimi is later revealed to have a much deeper meaning; and it couldn\u2019t have been done better. The rest of the cast members each stand out on their own. I won\u2019t go over each character in detail, but suffice to say; there\u2019s enough personality from each girl that prevents them from being bland or forgettable. Obviously the visual novel did a much better job of fleshing out these characters due to having a longer length, but the anime handles them decently enough. There\u2019s not exactly anyone that stands out in particular, but it\u2019s an overall well-rounded cast with several memorable moments from each of them throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nAs per usual Japanese anime standards, the Japanese seiyuu all do a fine job in the voice-work department and they\u2019re even the same as the visual novel. Hiroyuki Yoshino in particular gets Takumi\u2019s pathetic and cowardly character down perfectly. If there\u2019s any problem at all, it\u2019s with the English dub. Todd Haberkorn voices Takumi decently enough, at least attempting to sound like Yoshino. Unfortunately, the girls all sound generic and even grating on the ears at times (I\u2019m looking at you, Nanami!). Unless you\u2019re someone who absolutely cannot watch subs, it\u2019s best to skip the dub entirely.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse, the same animation company who was responsible for Death Note, surprisingly were the people behind Chaos;Head. Make no mistake though; this ain\u2019t no Death Note here. The animation in this series is really a mixed bag, sometimes ranging from strikingly detailed to shoddily cheap. Probably the real highlight here are the Di-swords (fantastical blades that are \u201creal-booted\u201d from delusions into reality) that our heroines use in the series. They\u2019re undeniably beautiful, and it\u2019s clear that the original artists put a lot of thought into the designs of these weapons. The character models match the ones from the game, but the way they\u2019re drawn seems kind of lazy. The VN had a really nice digital look to it, but the anime really just seems sloppy. That\u2019s a real shame, because Madhouse normally dishes out really good looking shows. Hey, at least they got the Shibuya background setting to look decent enough. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP used for every episode \u201cF.D.D.\u201d does its job and is overall pretty memorable, but the same cannot be said about the ED \u201cSuper Special.\u201d This is no doubt a song that many will either love or hate, but I fall into the latter category. Cheesy Engrish lyrics and a crappy melody, it\u2019s pretty bad. The background music though was actually a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack is spot-on, consisting of gorgeous orchestral flourishes, haunting ambient electronics, and melancholic piano passages. The show\u2019s sound design is most effective during the long bouts of pure silence, in which we experience the gripping fear that goes through Takumi\u2019s fractured mind. However when used, it works beautifully and sets each scene perfectly. Besides the lackluster ED, I have absolutely no qualms over Chaos;Head\u2019s soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Chaos;Head is in no ways the horrible series that some make it out to be. I felt genuine suspense and intrigue when watching this series, and I do not regret my time with it. Perhaps the main issue is that the anime tries to tell a story that\u2019s too ambitious for only 12 episodes. But when at its best moments, the series almost touches on greatness. Watch this, followed  by its shared universe shows Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes; and then you have a rich universe filled with unforgettable characters and amazing stories. I also recommend checking out the original visual novel for the whole experience. Beyond that though, Chaos;Head is an excellent physiological thriller that while flawed, is still a worthwhile viewing.\\n\\n",

And due to basically hating the outside world, he spends most of his time reading manga, watching anime, and playing video games. He's what most people would rightly identify as an otaku.

By this point you as a viewer will think that you have it all figured ot, but dont worry because there are 180' plot twists every 30 seconds inthis show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where the problem with this show comes for me. There are about seven characters or so running around throughout thsi show, but you dont really get the feel of knowing any one of them. That is a problem because if you dont know characters, you cant relate to them; and i you cant relate to them, you wont care one way or the other. \\n\\n\r\nThe other problem is that you dont know what is going on until the show is 2/3s done, granted i dont even think the writers knew what was going on until that point so how are we supposed to. As I said earlier about all the plot twists, the story is ever-changing and not in a good way. It changes by completey dropping what had been going on, and binging up some crap that is supposed to be the new angle it takes. \\n\\n\r\nI think that the show had alot of potential at the begining with a crazy guy running around with simoltanious murders occuring, but before long all hope of a half-way decent story is lost and it just becomes  battle to see if you can last until the end.",

            "content": "So, I decided to watch Chaos;Head after finishing Steins;Gate and learning they were in the same universe.  I started with Chaos;Head because I saw the MAL-Rating and thought I'd 'save the worst for first'.  However, Chaos;Head is a far more interesting anime than my score may suggest, and I do recommend watching it if you can overlook some of the challenges with it.\r\nSo, firstly, the biggest strength of the show is that it has an interesting concept with philosophical themes, and at times has a great tone.  In many ways, I think the tone of Chaos;Head (at least early on) is mostcomparable to Higurashi: When They Cry, with an extremely disoriented main character trying to piece together what is happening, and the audience being left struggling with the protagonist.  The first half of the series uses this feeling very effectively.  I felt that the show lost some of its interest as the pieces started making sense, but overall, Chaos;Head has a great concept behind it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ultimate fatal flaw of the show is that the protagonist is the most unlikable protagonist I've ever seen.  He is selfish, pathetic, weak, whiny, extremely mentally ill, and ultimately doesn't really grow.  The reason why this show is complicated is, his personality is clearly a very intentional decision, and fits perfectly with the themes of the story.  It also makes a lot of the show not very enjoyable to watch.  This is also coupled with the fact that most of the secondary characters are shallow and boring, but that also fits into the themes of the protagonists personality and how he views the world.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the show is a really interesting watch with some smart writing, but not a particularly enjoyable watch.  If you were a fan of the psychological horror elements of Higurashi, I would definitely recommend this, especially because not a ton of shows make you as effectively disoriented as this one.  The themes of mental illness are explored very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason I recommend this show, however, is it sets up the sequel/spinoff series Chaos;Child, which I think is a far better series than the MAL-Rating may suggest.  There is an Episode 0 of Chaos;Child that summarizes the events in this, but I think it misses a lot of the plot, tone and themes that wind up setting up that series.  Chaos;Child is not as disorienting as Chaos;Head, but it also is a far more enjoyable watch with a much more likable cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, as a side-note, I have not played any of the visual novels in the Science;Adventure series, so I am looking at this anime in and of itself, and not in comparison to the original work.",

            "content": "It was the anime that got me watching two other animes I wasn't intending to. Although it seems the MAL lot proclaims Chaos;Head as the worst of the trio, I found it quite enjoyable. Had I not, the other two would remain undiscovered, as they were not on my planning-to-watch at the first place. While I agree about it being incomplete and vague, I suggest to remember there is a new season coming. Who knows, maybe it will be a game changer?\r\nBeing a massive sucker for darker themes, the brief of the anime hooked me up at once. However, although I have plenty of experiencein this field, I never learn - the reality often differs from expectations GREATLY. I did expect some gore and killing and generally a lot of darkness, just like any absolutely sane and sweet female in her early twenties would. What I was offered, however, included the latter so briefly it almost felt like a mock. It did tickle my fancy for I was given at least HINTS of what the description promised, hence why I carried on.You can't deny presence of the plot, but it is quite...Vague? Probably what got me truly interested and inspired to watch the other two animes was the conspiracy theory theme. I'm quite a big fan of those and usually have a documentary playing on the background, so naturally once the theme was introduced, I became very interested. I liked the concept of action taking place online via chat, considering the main character being a shut-in, which was another strong side of this anime. I can't help but love delusions of Taku, for it's so otaku-ish I fear that one day it might hit me, too. I don't mind Arystair Krory cuddling me and calling me his wife though, but people already think I'm borderline weird, so I'd rather not have the matters pushed any further. The inter-dimensional thing and rambles about technology, however, gave me a mild headache and belief my brains will explode as I'm well trained on Serial Experiments Lain and Interlude. And yet, it was nothing but big words to describe the obvious things. The anime started becoming predictive, which I'm not a fan of - plus the amount of clich\u00e9s it included was making me roll eyes. However, nothing annoys me more as little sub-plots that are literally there for 10 seconds or so, just so certain things that were causing questions and wonders get explained...And usually none of those explanations are even close to satisfactory. I will just mention the nurse here. Or the leader of the opposing political party. Get my drift? Hmpf. The story wasn't an UTTER disappointment, but hell, I understand all the low ratings now.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art, on the other hand, complimented my standards. After Casshern Sins and the drawing style that was making me shiver every second I spent watching the series, Chaos;Head was an eye candy. I think I'd appreciate it even if I had not watched an old-school drawing anime beforehand, because the anatomy game in the series was fairly strong. It also a palette I've anticipated, as well as the modern digital colouring I dig loads. The design of characters wasn't entirely special, considering Rimi and Sena's appearance and colour choice itself were a huge clich\u00e9s, but I did like Ayase. Being a rock chick myself, I couldn't help but appreciate her stage outfit and how they actually gave her some dark make up. The Di-swords were quite beautiful, although as a digital artist I could easily tell how easy it was to draw them. Overly, I'm quite satisfied with the art. The quality is high, the anatomy is well, the colours did not make me want to gauge my eyes out. No complaints. \\n\\n\r\nSound wise, I will just state the opening was annoying. A cheesy J-pop song that would go with a harem anime, a theme of which Chaos;Head DID have, but it wasn't quite the main point. The anime tried to find a middle ground between funny and serious, and sort of failed in that, but given the other two adaptations of the visual novels we know it's meant to be focusing on the serious part rather than the fun. For that reason I dislike the opening even more now, especially after being familiar with Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes. Despite that, ironically, I loved the ending. Not because it'd suit the anime, it was even worse than the opening in terms, but I somewhat liked the song. And the Japanese attempts to English in cheesy pop songs never fails in giving lulz. Miracle baby, ftw. The sounds in the series itself were alright. I hardly ever pay mind to those, really. So if I hadn't - it means they were okay. If they did come to my attention, it means they've probably irritated me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters...NOW WHERE DO I START. Clich\u00e9s, clich\u00e9s everywhere but with Taku himself. He had no development really, and that's what actually made him unique. Instead of a shut-in becoming a super duper poo-per (hahahaha see what I did there hahahasomeonedatemepls), he remains a helpless whimpering bum for the entire anime. While most found it irritating, I actually found it soothing, given the fact all the other characters were bloody clich\u00e9 - driven. Also randomly killing characters that were randomly introduced and existed for no actual point is quite lame. In general it seems as if many characters were introduced solely to fill the time of the episode and they never really played an important role. Their existence, after you finish the anime, just makes you tilt head to the side and go \"eh?\". The further I write this review, the better I'm starting to understand all the rage you guys felt when writing earlier opinions of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nBUT despite all that, and how much I'm angered at the moment, because upon writing things down I'm starting to realize I somehow overrated the anime, I must admit I'm guilty of enjoying it. I guess I'm still recovering from my 2nd year of university, and my brain don't enjoy pressure such as thinking applied to it. And this anime did not really demand much of it, even if it tried to convince me I needed a degree in physics to understand what the hell is going on. Despite my dad having one, I was failing physics miserably during my glorious times at school, and yet I understood pretty much everything THAT WAS ACTUALLY EXPLAINED, AND NOT JUST RANDOMLY MENTIONED. So yeah. This anime is a lie. \\n\\n\r\nOverly, I don't really regret watching it. It's somewhat of a guilty pleasure to watch something not so good once in a while and be able to go on without hating it. Plus, thanks to Chaos;Head, I've discovered Steins;Gate (which I actually refused to watch earlier for it being so popular) and Robotics;Notes (which finally gave me the darkness I demanded). I can't say the anime was WOW, considering I've ended up lowering all the scores as I went on writing the review, spotting all the potential flaws I've somehow managed to ignore before, but I still did enjoy it quite a bit. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so the final scores are:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10\\n\\n",

It constantly tried to push the boundaries of anime with its sense of mystery, action, and convoluted plot and story.  However, this anime absolutely dug its own grave doing that.\r\nAs far as characters go, this probably had some of the worst characters I have ever seen in my entire life.  The main character, to put bluntly, is a winy little bitch.  That's the only thing he brings to the table.  Yet these characters are drawnto him somehow.  Incredibly unlikable.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was hard to follow.  I had to pause frequently and go back to understand what the hell they were talking about.  The whole di-sword thing and using the imagination gave me an incredible headache.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the first anime I would highly not recommend.  I could not find one enjoyable aspect about this show.  I thought 12 episodes wouldn't be too bad.  Dear God it was.",

            "content": "Chaos; Head starts as a mysterious thriller and then turns into a simple game of destroy the villain to save the world (or Shibuya). Though the initial few episodes entices the viewer into finding out more about the world, the actual reality that the latter episodes fail to deliver on the promise.\r\nThe series seems to toy with the idea with being a mystery and a romance but in the end discards such endeavors. This is quite disappointing as the second half of the series destroys whatever good will the first half produced.\r\nIf you're looking for a good thriller series, there are plenty of better onesout there. If you're looking for a romance/harem (noticing that there are many cute girls in this... Rimi...), this is not it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is top notch, crisp and clear. Battle sequences are well done though sometimes it pans away just at the critical moment. There is a bit of CG used but it is done in a manner that doesn't detract from the overall quality of the series. The series uses colors of day and night well to define the mood throughout the series. The presentation overall is solid.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe series starts off with a very catchy OP and presents a good concluding ED that serves to \"calm\" the viewer from the \"Chaos\" of the episode that just ended. The BGM and numerous effects give an errie feel that the series demands. This is at the sacrifice of having any unifying theme underlying it all. There are numerous VAs in this, all of whom give their respective roles a lively personality. Though the main character is supposed to look like a wimp, I think they overdid it a bit.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nChaos; Head starts at a thriller that plays with your head. What is reality? What you actually see happening in the series vs. just a delusion of Takumi? It's really hard to tell at times but it sure makes the first half of the series fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is about an otaku named Takumi that strangely lives in a tiny shack-like container at the top of a building. Soon, events start happening that are outside his control and he is eventually forced to take action and figure out what is happening around him.\\n\\n\r\nThe early part of the show is very enthralling but once the truth of what is happening is out, the story doesn't try to add any additional twists, falling to a linear, very predictable, progression. And though there are many powerful (and cute) supporting female characters, they are by no means used anywhere close to their potential in the series. It's as if it was shooting for a romantic sub-theme but then shoved it aside.\\n\\n\r\nThe final climax at the end was very predictable and the show ends rather quickly after that. There isn't really an explanation for what happens after the climax, it just is. The lack of any falling action makes me think that the production team got lazy... This series definitely deserved more than what it ended up being.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nTakumo is a detestable character. He is an otaku and a wimp who cares only for his games and Seira-tan anime figurines. When anything becomes difficult, Takumo just runs away. His pitiful nature caries throughout the series as he finds himself in the middle of the largest crisis Shibuya has ever faced.\\n\\n\r\nDespite his personality, Takumo is probably the only non-static character in the entire series. Though the other supporting female characters are all unique in their own way, only a bare-minimum approach was used in their development. Several of the girls don't have any exposition on their past at all. This may have been to keep the mysterious feel early in the series but even once everything was clear, the supporting females only felt like additional baggage that the series just carried for the heck of it.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an enthralling thriller, enjoy the first part of the series. But then you might as well throw it out once the initial mysteries are solved as the latter portions of the series are very linear and lead to a conclusion that is both predictable and (even worse) poorly executed.",

I haven't read the manga so I don't know if it had the same problem but I feel like there was a lot of information and fringe science based ideas that the creator wanted to put into this series then just ran out of time/momentum and tried to finish it up really fast. \r\nOn topof that, the seriousness of the anime itself didn't match well with the stereotypical pink haired girl/flash school uniform/weird hair art style and the underlying female harem theme. I feel like there as just way too much going on and none of it fit together well. Some of the characters were cool and the overall story idea itself was interesting but the original mystery/murder concept got resolved very anti-climatically.\\n\r\nAll in all I'd say not to bother with this series but if you liked some of this manga-ka's other works you might like this.",

And Chaos;Head is no exception, no matter how much I was waiting for it to be released and aired in Japan. However, I must say that the story is intriguing enough for me to keep watching and watching, despite the horrible art.\r\nStory\r\nI must say, the story of Chaos;Head is very intriguing and mysterious. It drives off from the usual anime, since it is a psychological/horror series. It certainly stays true to its genre since it deals with concepts like delusions and murder chains. Anyhow, ChaosHead's strongest point is probably the story itself. It keeps you at the edge of the seat, and it might be slow at times, but when it comes down to the crunch, it is exceptional. The story is also much deeper than what you think. Its not all about \"boy sees murder, more murder happens, omg whodunit?!?\" in Chaos;Head. If you think that, oh boy are you in for a ride. Believe me. Since from reading the plot, I thought I was just going to be looking at gruesome murders time to time and the police trying to find out who did it. But, of course, I was in for a shock. And I bet you will as well :P\\n\\n\r\nStory Rating: 10/10\\n\r\n\"A twistful plot that keeps you guessing and wanting more. It is above expectations and is absolutely top-notch. But wait, who's eyes are those eyes?\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nMan. I've gotta say. The art is absolutely terrible. It looks very outdated, even the colours! I'm very picky in art and this is definitely one of the worst in a 2008 anime. However, there is one thing I kinda liked. The 3d Water Wheel. I absolutely loved it. XD It was probably the only highlight in terms of Art. Now, I know I'm being harsh in the art of the Chaos;Head anime, but I've just gotta point out that I'm only very harsh since the graphics of the Visual Novel of Chaos;Head was beyond amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSo yea...if the anime had the graphics of the visual novel, boy would I have given it a perfect score. Sadly, that is not the case.\\n\\n\r\nArt Rating: 3/10\\n\r\n\"Very low budget looking and cheap animations. The 3d Water Wheel gave it 3 points though.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI have nothing much to say about the bgm of Chaos;Head. It wasn't exceptional, but it wasn't bad either. The Op and Ed were quite nice as well :) An Ok music score over all :)\\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: 7/10\\n\r\n\"Nice BGMs and Op and Ed. Helped set the atmosphere :)\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWell, it was both good and bad XD Sometimes, the story completely blew me away and I enjoyed it, but sometimes, the plot went too slow and I suddenly notice how horrible the art is again. It's definitely a \"Wow, the end already?\" type of show, which means that time goes by quickly when you watch it. So, nice and enjoyable overall.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Rating: 8/10\\n\r\n\"Quite enjoying to watch. Well, unless you are young and they show the scary scenes of course.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though it had horrible artwork, the story definitely compensates for it. Fans of Horror will surely like this ^^ Recommended.\\n",

            "content": "In my (limited) experience in being part of the anime community, I have come to realize that there are 3 types of anime out there: the universally acclaimed, the universally despised, and the anime that happen to fall in the center. The first two are self-explanatory, but the latter needs a little more explanation: this sort of anime is often the sort where fans often take contrasting opinions, with there being some who love it to bits, some who absolutely hate it and others still who don't really care for it either way. Chaos; Head is percisely this sort of anime: it's not quite badenough to be unaminously disliked, but doesn't excel quite enough or everyone to have a positive opinion of it. Why is this however? Well, let's get down to it...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening episodes had such an engaging hook to them that I couldn't help but get drawn in: a delusional otaku caught up in a murder mystery, but due to the fact he IS delusional, neither we nor he can be sure what's real or what's not. It was an original hook, and one that intrigued me thoroughly, however the follow-through to this hook felt.... lacking. The story was good in and of itself, with the exposition, plot-twists, climax and ending all feeling appropriate and enjoyable. Why such a low score then? Simply put, pacing: there's not nearly enough time to grow attached to many of the characters, nor are you able to process the explanations given to you without having to take a few minutes after the episode and think about it. Additionally, it felt like the show could've used a little more... I dunno, calm time: time where nothing truly important happens, but there is additional scenarios and conversations between characters in order to give the audience some room to breathe (though I'm not sure how that'd happen with the main character being a hermit). I enjoyed the story throughly for what it's worth; it just was several tweaks (or perhaps simply were several episodes) short of being a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters, as aforementioned, represent some sort of stereotype: the withdrawn otaku, the overly sweet and protective love interest, the tough tsundere character, the ditzy yet adorable child-like character, etc. Yet somehow, I still enjoyed them all nonetheless: sometimes they felt flat and couldn't represent anything but their prominant personality trait, but with all of their unique and (appropriate, given the show's theme) tragic backstories, they felt fleshed out and more real to me. And of course, props must be given to the show's lead Taku: he gets the most character development out of anyone else in the show,  and is truly memorable because of the fact that the dorky, cowardly and socially inept don't usually get the spotlight in anime. Unfortunately, it is because of the fact the rest of the cast feels so stereotypical that they are not quite as memorable, nor do they leave a lasting impression on you when the anime is said and done; however, they were enjoyable to watch and played their roles in the show well, and that's as much as I could hope for. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe designs felt uninspired, the animation felt like lesser quality and sometimes it felt like the show lacked fluidity; however, it is cohesive and does manage to effectively convey the right emotions to the audience when it needs to, and is not nearly as painful to watch as it could've been. Plus, I love the OP and ED, especially the latter, so points go to the show for that. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTakumi's voice actor did an AMAZING job; he really nailed the various nuinances of the cowardly, dorky and occasionally creept Takumi Nishijo, yet did so without making him become completely unlikable. The rest of the cast unfortunately was not nearly as amazing or memorable, though the voices all fit the characters rather well. Additionally, the soundtrack was extremely well done; as aforementioned, the OP and ED themes were particular highlights for me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate what I initially stated, this is not a masterpiece: there are many anime better then this one, and by no means will this be liked by everyone. However, I personally liked the story, the character and the soundtack well enough to the point where I will likely add this to my shelf at some point: I WOULDN'T pay $60 bucks to buy it (Canadian price :p), but perhaps used on Amazon or on sale from RightStuf.com. This will never be a highlight of my collection, but it in my opinion, it's worth owning and experiencing nonetheless. Not everyone wil agree, but in my opinion it is at least worth watching a few episodes: the protagonist and story alone warrant this anime a chance, regardless of whether you will enjoy it overall.",

            "content": "Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd is not the most groundbreaking anime, nor is it too unpredictable.  The true beauty in the anime lies in the fact that you are immersed in a world that the characters themselves know is fabricated.\r\nSome of the more brilliant moments in the anime are not when the characters are struggling against [insert evil corporation], but instead when they realize and admit that their situations are obscure and that these situations are cliched.  In this way, even though a lot of the elements of Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd seem recycled, the fact that the main character, Taku, is a figure-collecting NEET justifies this (for even morereasons than just because the situation calls for it).\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nBeginning with scenes from what seems like a semi-insane NEET holed up in his hovel Welcome to the NHK style, the story progresses quickly and adequately.  Taku struggles with inner strife, and encounters many oddities and mysteries within Shibuya.  The story is intriguing and keeps the viewer watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is up to par from what would be expected from any studio these days.  Some of the effects on the weapons are particularly good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound is usually not something I pay very close attention to in an anime.  I don't recall anything particularly interesting other than a couple of inserts when the eerie Japanese folk song \"Sakura\" is echoed.  It took me a minute to recall what song was being played, and I was happy with the inclusion of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacter development is likely the biggest downfall of this anime.  Taku is fairly well developed, but his harem of women follows well-defined stereotypes for characters:  cute sister, contemplative quiet girl, semi-yandere, childhood friend/girlfriend, warrior chick.  Some of them fall out of their bounds a bit, but not to any extreme level.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this anime.  I actually finished it in one sitting, which hardly ever happens for me.  I hope you found this useful, and that from this review you can decide whether Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd is relevant to your interests.",

If you're looking for an anime that keeps you guessing on every episode, this is definitely for you. \r\nEvery episode unravels even more of the story in a way that keeps you glued every step of the way.

It wasn't anything special in my eyes, but it's pretty decent. \r\nThe sound was given an 8. Nothing special, but it wasn'tawful. \\n\r\nThere are always characters in anime that you can like or dislike. The characters in this anime is sort of a hit or miss. The main protagonist isn't that much of a likable character because he's a shut-in, but the rest of the cast makes up for it. There's a large variety of different characters in the show, and I feel the development wasn't bad, either. \\n\r\nThere are reasons, however, as to why I didn't like Chaos;Head. They weren't that huge of problems to me, so it didn't affect the overall score much. I felt the ending was very rushed. Although it was a satisfying ending that didn't keep you hanging, it could have been much better.\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was given a 9/10. I can't really decide. If you are looking for an anime that keeps you guessing, with just a \"tish\" of romance and action, this is definitely for you.\\n\r\nHappy watching.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Paranoia in the hands of a creator who has acute knowledge and respect for the inner clockwork of the human mind can lead to a genuinely neurotic experience that engages the viewer\u2019s mind, forcing it out of the comforts of rationalization, stalking it minute by minute, then suddenly beating it down until it explodes. Paranoia in the hands of a creator who has no respect for the mind\u2019s intricacies - or in Chaos;Head\u2019s case, a person trying to cash-in on the recent explosion of the visual novel medium - is at best a flash in a pan that may create some pyrotechnics early on, butis reduced to scraping up the burnt remains of the initial flair for the remainder of the run.\\n\\n\r\nChaos;Head is a visual novel inspired series about the delusions of NEET-otaku Takumi as he uncovers the conspiracy of a series of mysterious murders and meets a variety of hot girls along the way. Given such an inane premise, the only reason to watch this show is its thick atmosphere largely created by Takumi\u2019s delusions. Takumi is a hardcore, anti-social nut who will probably put on the white strait-jacket himself just to get away from the overwhelming pressure of the judgments of others. He spends his time watching anime, playing online video games, and (literally) conversing with his imaginary wife who serves as his personal cheerleader. Perhaps its the voyeur in me, but Takumi\u2019s paranoia is downright fascinating, and his perspective makes the whole experience feel far more unique.\\n\\n\r\nThough the protagonist is interesting, absolutely nothing else about Chaos;Head is quite as interesting. With few exceptions, all the girls of Chaos;Head are one dimensional, visual novel tropes with back-stories so overused that it pained me to even watch their flashbacks. I have come to the opinion that the only reason Takumi can interact with these individuals is because they remind him of all the girls he usually meets in his ren\u2019ai games.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, the show starts out as a mystery-thriller, but a few episodes in, it decides to be a shounen action series with Takumi having a personal army of chicks with magical swords who fights an evil man who claims his actions are for the greater good of humanity. While ambitious story-lines are commendable, the show should have stuck to its murder-mystery roots instead of expanding to a convoluted doomsday scenario driven by \u201cscientific\u201d babble.\\n\\n\r\nChaos;Head probably could have been a better series if it had more time to lay down its ideas and let some of its concepts sink in, but the greater part of me tells me that this would have only dragged out the pain. Unless you absolutely need cute, ren\u2019ai girls with your paranoia driven thriller, stay far away from this series.",

            "content": "What I thought of this anime when I first watched it was \"Ok another psychological anime and it's going to be great\". After the first couple of episodes I dropped. The story in the beginning had a potential but the characters kinda made me stopped watching it. There were also many times that when I was completely loss (I know that it is a physiological genre but it made absolutely no sense). So I stopped watching it. A couple months later I learned it had some sort of connection with Steins;Gate and did my best to finish it. At the end, it gave me abad taste with at least a satisfying ending\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe story was good and I understood the concept of delusions quite easily. I like the idea of using delusions to create the story. And some scenes were also quite mind blowing because of the idea. But as I said, some scenes were confusing and it even gave me a headache.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art was fine as well. Although some scenes totally didn't match with the art and characters look way too moe for this type of anime, the rest matched quite well. At least it didn't have guts spilling everywhere explicitly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound was ok, too. I liked the opening and ending songs. But I believed some of the sound of effects were a bit over-exaggerated and some to be better off not being in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nThe characters were what I disliked most of this anime. I mean why were most of the characters that were special were female and only one male. I felt the \"harem\" atmosphere and that isn't really needed in physiological types of anime. I didn't like the main protagonist either. He is so pathetic and after I watched it I sorta felt that it lowered my spirit. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI'm sorry for being so negative in this review. This is the first review I've done because I really felt agitated after finishing this but also felt relieved, too. The satisfaction was mediocre and I would really recommend this if you are into theories. I only finished this because I wanted to see if there were any connections to Steins;Gate. At most this anime would be 7/10 for me but it is only my opinion so don't judge it because of what other people say cause you might like it. Thank you for reading my review and I believe that one day you will try to watch this anime, too.",

The characters are so frustratingly frail minded it hurts. The characters are definitely the weakest part of the show. The story is meh. They try to explain everything with garbage \"science\". The main villain leaves the characters alone until they all have powers instead of killing them when he had the chance, and he gets defeated with a last minute power up. \r\nTheres a reason why this storyis hated so much its because its not good, even the only comment on the last ep. on funamation is \"This series was 10.5 brutally frustrating episodes and 1.5 gratifying ones\". If you still want to give the show a chance just watch the first two eps like i said before because it only gets worse from there so if you dont like those dont bother.",

            "content": "So Chaos Head. Definitely a interesting anime to say the least. I came into this anime with no expectations really. I just wanted to watch it because of the upcoming sequel Chaos Child. So the series is ok to say the least. It kind of smashed together with the story, and the characters in my opinion. So let's get the negatives out of the way. There a little too many characters in this short of a series. So this anime kind of has a harem feel to it. Although each harem has something to do with the plot. Which is already vague enough, and thenyou have to keep track of all these sub-plots. So the story is a bit hard to follow. Along with that the characters are not the greatest either. I couldn't really connect with these characters. So the weaknesses are definitely in the characters and the vague story. However aesthetically this anime is gorgeous. The movements and when the fights do happen it looks amazing. The voice acting is also pretty good too. I admit I am a little bias considering my favorite voice actor voices the main character. I do like the rest of the voice acting though. Overall this is a fair anime, but I would not put it up on my favorites any time soon.",

So When I first started the anime I was like oh god this anime is dreadful it sucks and this is by far the most annoying one I have ever seen. The protagonist was the most annoying guy in the world, until the last 2 episodes he decided to not be a total loser. The characters in the anime sucked because its every possible type of stereotypicalanime girl character and a stereotypical guy best friend. But the thing is the characters slowly become less annoying. Story was Very good I really liked the idea but I didn't like the beginning at all. The sound wasn't bad I can sorta understand Japanese and sometimes I'd think its nice everything but the lyrics. The art was well done The way they drew characters to reflect that type of person in them was very good. So overall it was a very good series",

            "content": "Now let me first say that despite my penchant for playing visual novels, due to certain technical circumstances (i.e. the patch for the game is horribly broken and unplayable) I have not been able to play the ChaoS;HEAd VN. Therefore, while I did enjoy the anime, please note that I have not played the game, and that the game is most likely way, way better than what I watched. That said, ChaoS;HEAd was a really fun ride, and really messes with your head.\r\nIf you've heard of/are watching/played Steins;Gate, you know what to expect, pretty much; the arbitrary semicolon in the name indicates that it ispart of the same game series (made by visual novel company Nitro+.) Instead of Akihabara, though, this takes place in Shibuya, and follows an antisocial shut-in named Takumi Nishijou, who suffers from many problems--the most pressing of which is the frequent delusions he has (to show the severity of this, his 2-D waifu Seira-tan materializes in front of him regularly and declares her love for him) . These delusions eventually grow to incredible proportions, effectively erasing the line between his imagination and his reality and making him incredibly paranoid. On top of all that, a series of murders, called the \"New-Gen\" incidents, have been taking place, torture devices shaped like crosses show up in his room, the message boards he frequents show him disturbing images, and every girl he runs into seems to either want to kiss him or kill him. All of these things seem to be connected to him somehow, and the fun of ChaoS;HEAd is figuring out exactly how.\\n\\n\r\nMany people have mixed feelings about this anime for many different reasons, but I thought it did a lot of things really well, and I'm quite eager to play the VN someday due to it. Also, you're always super special. Never forget that.\\n\r\nIf you've ever seen Paranoia Agent and you're thinking this sounds similar, get that shit out of your head right now, this is nothing like it. Recommended for fans of Higurashi, Umineko, Fate/stay night, or any other anime adaptations of story-based visual novels.",

Then I found the genre, it was harem but not comedy. Then I tried to watch it because it was a harem ( harem- one of my favorite genre in anime ^^ )\nI liked this anime because:\nThe story is to difficult to understand in the start, but even though it's difficult to understand, I continued to watch because of Takumi. Takumi is a boy who has no friends but he is an otaku. That's whyI liked him.\\n\\n\nAnother thing I liked was the story. There were 6 girls around Takumi. \\n\\n\nI can't compare ChaoS;HEAd to other mystery anime because in ChaoS;HEAd the harem genre makes the story enjoyable even if it's too hard to understand the story.\\n\\n\nThe opening and ending song is good, it's connected in the story.\\n\\n\noverall rate 8/10 because i enjoy watching this anime. :)",

            "content": "\"One cult shy of being a masterpiece\"\r\nSome shows are missed out by the mainstream, due to timing, or some marketing factor. Such shows usually get a \"cult following\" which bring them into the limelight, albeit a very specific limelight which is still somewhat obscure. In fact, as we learn more about the world, the smallness of our own attention field becomes more apparent: we may think that we know bout the mainstream and the obscure, but we really know only a very little of the vastness of everything.\r\nWhen it comes to anime, though, Chaos Head (who has time for all those exotic spelling alterations) isa rare case of a cult masterpiece without a cult. Yes, some people (such as me) love it, but, instead of putting it on a pedestal, it tends to be put in the shadow of its successor, the much more well known Steins Gate. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a bit of a shame, but also a bit to be expected. Whereas Steins Gate takes the viewer away from all plausible reality, into a realm of time travel and world lines, Chaos Head takes us into a mostly plausible perspective of the way \"delusions\" affect reality, and how technologies and techniques to manipulate the perceptions of others can lead to widespread delusions and other forms of Chaos, which starts in the Head of the promoter but can end up damaging others instead.\\n\\n\r\nOr, it can be fatal to the host that initiated.\\n\\n\r\nNobody would accuse this anime about being political, but it is very much a satire of how ideologies such a politics, sports, religion, domination, and other mental distortions of reality can cause people to act irrationally... or, alternately, how the human spirit, and a harem of girls, can save the world of any strong individual, even if they happen to be a bit insane with the boredom of life.\\n\\n\r\nOn a higher level, it should inspire everyone to learn to write draw. Instead of just mumbling to people who are not there, you could make a commercial product about it, instead, and turn your delusions into money.\\n\\n\r\nThe last two episodes are worth re-watching almost daily as they contain the best reversal ever in any show that I have watched, although the significance of it seems to have been missed by even fans of the show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of this high praise, I have to admit that hardly anyone will like this show, and those who do, will think of it as just a practice run that they team did before they went onto do Steins Gate. \\n\\n\r\nWho cares about them, though? If you are one of the chosen who understand the power of thought control and internal, intentional, self-arising cohesion, then it is very re-assuring to know that, on some level, so also do successful artists who managed to get funding and create several franchises... so, have hope, be inspired, and keep on bringing your hopes into reality by various forms of effort. \\n\\n\r\nDelusion, Illusion, or Ambition.... what makes the difference?\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode drags on a bit, and is quite depressing, in a way. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ugly:\\n\\n\r\nDue to the age, budget, and lack of widespread interest, this anime looks worse than anything else the team did afterwards (e.g. Steins Gate, Robotics Notes). Also, the VNs are unlikely to see an official English release, and the franchise is thus practically dead, despite the potential for universal application.\\n\\n",

I wasn't really sure until the last episode whether or not the main character was completely insane, and by proxy I started to question my own sanity and perspectives on things. The whole show gave me the impression that it was meant to be an allegory for mental illness, and it sent me on a philosophical, psychological and psychoanalytical roller coaster the likes of which I haven'thad from any other audiovisual media. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and I feel confident in recommending this anime. 10/10, do watch.",

The first episodes made me seriously wonder why I downloaded it and whether I should just delete it, but then it got more interesting. I'm still a bit confused by the plot: obviously from the first scene it's yet another world-within-a-world-story like _Kanon_ or _Clannad_, but it's not yet clear to me how everything matches up or what the protagonist is doing there while presumably Rimi is about to execute him in the real world.\r\nBut by the time I get up to episode8, I'm starting to fear that _Chaos Head_ will be nothing but one of the innumerable Evangelion-lite clones which think a shadowy organization like SEELE or allusively named plot devices like 'Project Noah' are enough for a good story; hopefully this will just be a long red herring like the DID diagnosis...\\n\\n\r\nBut no! My worst fears were realized for _Chaos Head_. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a series's ending, not even with _Angel Beats!_. It could have been great; there was real potential. Someone like Jun Maeda could have taken the series up to episode 7, written a new ending and backstory etc., and created something that will be remembered for a very long time. Certainly the people involved had a great deal of talent which they displayed in the splendid _Steins;gate_.\\n\\n\r\nBut ultimately someone involved failed, the series copped out, and continued with Eva lite ('Third Melt'? Are you effing kidding me?!) and 'love conquers all'. 6 is too high to express what bitter dregs of failed potential and blasted hope this series made me drink; only a 4 does it justice.",

Sorry for all the fans who liked this series, but I personally was losing my time. If you are someone that you like girls with superpowers, this is your series, but if you want to see something a little more soul, there are better recommendations.\r\ngreetings to the sick of the anime ....

The story starts out with a mystery and its actually kinda creepy. One thing I didn't like about Chaos Head was the fact that the story went on a little too slow for 12 episodes. The story is a little confusing but if you bare with it you can enjoy this anime.\r\nThe art and sound were both really good. The music that they played in scenes really did fit it well.\r\nThe characters in this are likable,each of them have a unique personality. \\n\r\nAlso I want to point out that even though Chaos Head has Harem as a genre, I want to reassure you that this isn't another love triangle among three girls like they have in usual animes, and that the girls are just working together with the male main character.\\n\r\nOverall I know half the people that watches this anime will drop it. It can be confusing at first but it does get interesting as you keep watching it. Chaos Head is recommended for people looking for Mystery, Drama and Physiological genres.",
