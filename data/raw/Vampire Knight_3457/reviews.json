            "content": "Story\r\nSome aspects of the setup I liked, like the school divided into day class human students and night class vampire students.  I would have loved the human heroine who patrols the grounds and night, making sure the vampires are  in line, except...Yuki was TOTALLY lame. Episode after episode was her chasing after Zero, stupidly getting herself into danger, being saved by a male lead, and then feeling guilty.  Really weak story, with few redeeming features.  The characters didn't grow, events didn't build up into a climax, and the resolution was contrived and lukewarn.  It was very much one of thoseanimes annoyingly full of longing, melodramatic gazes and characters saying each others' names in quiet, tortured voices.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art was all right.  Yuki was cute, Zero was handsome, and Kaname was gorgeous.  The other vampires were pretty lame though, just a bunch of generic bishounen who were totally loyal to Kaname cuz the mangaka said so.  I found Yuki's absolutely massive eyes irritating.  I've seen a lot of anime by now so I'm used to the huge eyes, but hers actually distracted me at times, maybe because the story had so little pull.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nGood soundtrack.  Lots of classical, which I enjoyed, and I like both the intro and ending songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are what I disliked the most, especially Yuki.  She was an extremely boring protagonist.  She carried around a cool-looking staff that seemed to have magical properties, but never once used it well.  Usually, she'd just bring it out only to drop it when someone said something upsetting or when she tripped.  She was then promptly rescued by Kaname or Zero.  Maybe the next season will explain why she is in the middle of all of this, but I think season 1 should give the heroine SOME value.  Sure, she was very generous with Zero, but I hate shoujo heroines who only stand out because they're SO good at being martyrs.  As for the other characters, they weren't much better.  Zero spent most of his time wanting to die.  Kaname constantly rescued Yuki, yet never explained her importance to him.  A little mystery is good, but too much \"she's so precious to me but I won't say why\" gets boring and annoying.  The \"villain\" only appeared at the very, very end, and I found their behavior inconsistent and what happened to them way too abrupt and anticlimactic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI don't have high standards.  I might've adored this show, if Yuki hadn't been such a weakling.  What I usually enjoy in anime shows is watching the protagonist learn and grow.  It's okay if the protagonist starts out ordinary or weak or with a massive crush, so long as they become stronger.  Yuki really didn't, though.  Kaname kept protecting her without explaining anything.  Zero usually pushed her away and also refused to share things.  She had a big heart, but I like heroines who're genuinely strong, not just good at sacrificing themselves.  Sorry, but anyone can say, \"Bite me.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nMaybe this is a good show for teenage girls, but I think anyone who just finished Ouran Host Club or Hana Yori Dango or other such shows will be disappointed by the heroine.  Most shoujo is so entertaining because the heroines are so intelligent, or plucky, or independent.  Yuki was none of those things.  Of course, fangirls who just want to see a cute big-eyed girl get bitten by various bishounen will still love it.",

            "content": "If you think that shojo series are all flowery, romantic (comedies) and cheerful, you're quite wrong, and Vampire Knight will prove that more than anything else. Keywords for VK are drama, emotional struggles and tragic pasts. Throw in a dash of vampire, and there you have Vampire Knight in all its glory.\r\nThe story revolves around the students of the Cross Academy, which is divided into the Day Class for humans, and the Night Class for Vampires. The main characters, Zero and Yuki, both have very sad pasts; Zero had his family killed by a vampire, and Yuki's first memory was a vampire attacking her. Thesepasts, which are revealed fairly early in the series, make a good base for their relationship and their emotional struggles.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the course of the story, the characters face one event/experience after another, which makes room for emotional struggles, lots of character development and, of course, some romance (hey, this is a shojo series after all), though the latter is overshadowed by the other stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is both standard shojo and something else at the same time. We have the pretty bishonen boys in place, complete with all the fallen-head-over-heels girls, and there's also the standard shojo eyes; large, with pupils that are almost larger than the actual eyes. But since the series has a darker, sadder tone to it, there's no lack on that end either. The coloring is often very dark, and the occasional lighting effect helps on this aspect of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, with sad pieces helping the sad mood, and overall good quality. There's nothing spectacular about the soundtrack though, and while the OP theme is very good, the ED theme isn't very cool, though it fits with the dark mood of the series. Voice acting is perfect; the moods are portrayed very well and there's an overall good quality.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I love about this series is the characters. I mean, I really love them. They're very deep, with their pasts and emotional struggles. Off course, there's superficial characters as well, but they're mostly supporting characters; the main characters are mostly deep and they have a lot of character development for such a short series. Their relationships with eachother are very deep too, and a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the series very much; this is a candidate for the best Spring 2008 anime. It's a bit open at the end, but I just read that there's a second season coming in October, so I'll accept that, and look forward to it.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "Well, since some people exactly like my reviews, I decided to do another one. This time, it's Vampire Knight. I've only seen 3 episodes and read some manga chapters, even through I can't consider myself as the VK-girl that knows everything, I know quite alot about the story and the characters. Anyway, here we go!\r\nStory - 100% [10]\r\nIf you haven't read the manga or saw some episodes of the anime, you'll probably already have an idea what this is about... Vampires. I say that you're right, but if you watch or read Vampire Knight, you'll find out that it's more than only ''vampires''. Let's startwith the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nVampire Knight revolves between Yuki, Zero and Kaname. Yuki and Zero are Cross-Academy's prefects (guardians). It's their duty to prevent the contact between the Day and the Night-class, even through it's very hard for them because all the girls from the Day-class have a big crush on the guys from the Night-class, that's not very rare because everyone in the Night-class looks gorgeous. Why are prefects needed? To prevent the Day-class of finding out the secret from the Night-class, in reality, all of them are vampires. The ''leader'' of the Night-class is Kaname Kuran, the one who saved Yuki's life when she was little. Ofcourse he's a vampire too and the most powerful of all, a pureblood. Yuki and Zero both live with the chairmain of Cross-Academy, Cross Kaien. Yuki doesn't have any memories from when she was a kid, her memories begin on the day that Kaname saved her from a vampire. Kaname asked the chairman to look after her, and he did. The same goes of Zero, a couple of years later he comes to live with Yuki and the chairmain to, after his parents where killed by a vampire.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is so loveable about all this? Both the anime and the manga have a mysterious feeling to it, that you know that something is going on but you don't know what. You'll also notice and the story gets ''darker'' each time, and that the characters change. It takes a while until you really understand everything because they tell you the story bit by bit, you may also expect some big changes, I warn you. I wish that I could tell you more, but I don't want to spoil it for you guys. I really recommend you guys both the manga and the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 80% [8]\\n\r\nWell, the animation. I must say that it's alot better than I expected. Still, I know that alot of manga-fans might be dissapointed. The manga might have better art, but I think that the anime is really well made. They put alot of effort in this, and with succes. If the manga didn't excist, the anime would probably get higher ratings. Well, my opinion is that that the Vampire Knight anime is a good adaptation to the manga, I really think so.\\n\\n\r\nSound -  90% [9]\\n\r\nThe sound, or better said, the music. The songs that the picked for both the opening and ending where really the right choice for this anime. Futatsu no Kodou to Akai Tsumi is the opening-song, sung by ON/OFF, and I really love it. It really matches the anime and gives you the Vampire Knight-feeling. I really like it. Then, for the ending-song, Still Doll sung by Wakeshima Kanon, was the biggest plus-point for me. I just loved it the first time that I heard it! How come? It's mysterious and matches Vampire Knight perfectly. When you listen to it, I'm sure that you'll also get the feeling that there's something that you don't know yet. For the soundeffects in this anime, I have nothing to complain. When you needed one, you got one, just how it is in real life. The good sound in Vampire Knight made it realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 100% [10]\\n\r\nHa, this was a easy one. The characters, you'll absolutely love them when you get to know them! What is good about this is that you don't only get to know Yuki, Zero and Kaname, but also the other people from the Night-Class and other random characters. Let's take Aidou as an example, he's not a main character, still, you know exactly who he is! I'll tell you something about the 3 main characters now.\\n\\n\r\nYuki - I think that you all know her type of character, but Yuki is not the typical ''shoujo'' heroine. No, she's different. You can see that she tries her best to help Zero and get a place in his heart, she really cares alot for others, which might also be her weakness. To save Zero from turning into a Level E, she let him drink her blood. Yuki was attacked as a little girl by a vampire who was fallen to a Level E, and than was saved by Kaname. She has no memories of her parents or who she really is. Because Kaname saved her, she has a great affection for him, and she trusts the vampires in the Night-Class.\\n\\n\r\nZero - He might look like a cold-hearted guy in the beginning, but he really isn't. Zero's family where killed by a vampire, that's why he really hates vampires, all of them. Anyway, in the beginning of the series you'll see him in pain a couple of times, I think alot of you got the picture back then. Yes, when he was attacked he was biten by a vampire, a pureblood. Since he didn't die he will slowly turn into a vampire himself. Since his huge hate for vampires, she fights against the progress with all his might. Zero always has a gun with him, he can use it to kill vampires. He also has a younger twin-brother named Ichiru, but he was not as healthy as Zero (no, he didn't die).\\n\\n\r\nKaname - A pureblood vampire who's respected by everyone in the Night-Class, no, better said, he's the leader. When he gives an order, it's final. Other vampires fear him and he's loved by alot of girls from the Day-Class. Even through he doesn't really care about them, he does care alot for Yuki, which you'll notice right away. You'll understand later why a vampire with so much power as Kaname cares so much for a normal girl like Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nI think I told you enough, the point is, the characters WIN!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 100% [10]\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Do you even need to ask? I REALLY enjoy this. It's a burden to wait for the episodes to air, but we have no other choice but wait, have we? If you like a mysterious story, vampires and some scary moments, watch Vampire Knight. I'll probably recommend this to everyone because this is something that everyone would like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 90% [9]\\n\r\nWhat? Miss ''I enjoy-it-so-much'', you didn't gave it a 10!\\n\r\nYes, people, I know what you're thinking. But you guys must remember, that I'd also like to see this from another point of view. Since I have also read a part of the manga, I know how it could have been. I really think that the people who made the Vampire Knight-anime did an awesome job! If you see the original when reading the manga, you might understand why I gave this a 9. Don't forget to watch it now, I'll hunt you!\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Vampire Knight is an awesome anime/manga with very enjoyable characters and a story! It might be one of the ''must-see's''. Judge for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay, minna! This was my review! I hope you didn't dislike it that much, I tried my best in writing it! Love, Erisu...\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you like pretty anime vampire boys, this might be right up your street. However, if you like something with a decent plot as well as the associated carnage and animalistic nature that vampires usually have, this will likely leave you somewhat disappointed (and that's me being rather kind..) and wishing it had delivered more for the time you put in.\r\nI began watching this on a friend's giddy recommendation and was intrigued somewhat by the first few episodes; although, all the way through near enough, it stayed at the same steady pace of mild intrigue and a general niggling wonder as to when the hellthe plot was going to kick in so that the story had some sort of point to it aside from a glorified love triangle. The plot itself, somewhere beneath the anime itself, has a lot of potential. The on-screen variation just doesn't seem to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, despite my 'fangirl-esque' fondness of a fair few of them, aren't particularly well mapped out and a lot of the character basis is shrouded in mystery, although not really in the right way - there are far too many vague bits and not enough explanation when it comes to motive and persona as well as situation. In fact, most of the characters seem not only 2D, but slight variations of the same 2D character. Also, most of the vampires you encounter in this series are rather fluffy aside from the pointy fangs, and the supporting cast are, to a fair extent, pretty forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, it was somewhat pleasing, although a lot of time seems to have been wasted on trivial matters while the potentially good bits have been glossed over or given a moment or two of screen time when they should have had a scene, or at the very least, *more* screen time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say this series is probably worth a watch if you're just looking for an easy vampire related anime fix, but after spending a good few hours ploughing through this series, I am left wondering if I want to bother at all with its counterpart; leaning heavily towards the 'No' vote.\\n\\n\r\nBear in mind that I've not read the manga, nor am I in the 'anime connoisseur' league, but I am a writer (of sorts) and would know a good story when it hit me in the face: sadly, this failed to deliver such a pleasant blow.",

            "content": "Vampire Knight is the 13-episode anime adaptation of the famous manga by renowned manga-ka Matsuri Hino. \r\nRevolving around a cast of teen-aged characters, or rather some teener-looking century-old vamps, the story unfolds with a female character named Yuki Cross, a renowned student who keeps one of the biggest secrets her school has to cautiously conceal, as the point-of-view. The typical shojo anime protagonist, she exhibits the traits (candy eyes, cheerful attitude, encouraging words, beautiful face, and most specifically attractiveness) many viewers would like her to. As the main of the main characters, she, of course, is most likely to have different interactions with the othercharacters. Some of which are Zero Kiryuu and Kaname Kuran, of which both are considered in the anime as the 'guys' girls often have in their little dreamland. Of all the other characters, these three make the story move on to a different chapter. Other characters play a not-so-catchy role as the mentioned three do, but practically their 'existence' in the series would prove them essential to the story. Evolving in a slow phase, the characters-- of which most female viewers would note their totally 'hot' appearance&mdash; make up most of what the audiences really stick their ass to. Since the bishies in this anime are the ones made to stand out, most VK-tard viewers are females! But don't consider this show &quot;gay!&quot; It's good, I tell you (and no... I'm not being bias)! All the characters, be male or female, are candy-eyed. The main characters themselves have, obviously, their own life stories. They evolve in the same phase as the story does, of course. In my case, I hate none of them. Given equivalent weights of parts in the story, such characters are highly guaranteed to please us the viewers; thus, I give them a commendable 8 ^_^\\n\\n\r\nThe story, on the other hand, evolves in the same phase as the characters do: not rushed yet not slow. To put simply, the story it features has an assortment of drama, romance, and, noticeably, a bit of horror (quite a good &quot;chemistry&quot; if you ask me). The &quot;horror&quot; part is not highly emphasized, even though the title itself suggests it would offer a good hair-raising experience. What I call true horror would involve ugly demoniacs. On the contrary, there ain&rsquo;t any fugly bad guys&mdash;just them who have killer smiles! What I think is the main highlight is romance (I relate it with the &quot;Knight&quot; in Vampire Knight)! Consider a girl interacting between two dependent guys a romantic story featuring a tense love triangle. The genre drama is given the same importance as romance&mdash; good romance must involve good drama! I take back what I said about it not plunging into a deep plot. I admit the story is nice! Following a stream of media res, there's quite a good number of flashbacks. The first episodes of the anime don&rsquo;t really offer a good number of twists. It was only at the latter part that things turned out to be the unexpected. With these ingredients in the story, it deserves an 8 ^_^\\n\\n\r\n          I have not read a single page of the manga, but many say the art of the manga was a lot better than in the anime. Perhaps it is. I do think that the art and animation aren't exactly that good. There are quite some distortions in the face of the characters. Some viewers commented that the manga was just too &lsquo;sketchy&rsquo; for the art to be animated. Then again, it wasn&rsquo;t at all that bad. I give the art and animation a 7.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n          The music or sound, on the other hand, furthermore adds eeriness to the already-creepy theme, or whatever emotion the scenes require. The music presents a good vampire-ish theme. There is nothing more to say about the sound, so I give it a 9 ^_^\\n\\n\r\n          Vampire Knight is not exactly my type of anime, but it still gives me the urge to watch it&hellip; and as they say, &ldquo;let VK show you a sweet dream next time!&rdquo;\\n",

            "content": "WARNING-- before reading this review, please take into account the fact that I disliked Vampire Knight. If that one statement offends you, please do not read onward. I do not assume any responsibilities for broken monitors, laptops, or mobile devices. \r\nAlso, if you like dark romance or any romance dealing with vampires, I recommend this to you. See if you like it. Though, if you prefer adventures or are not a fan of things dark, or of soap operas, this is not recommended. \r\n..:::..:::..\r\nNo matter what anime it is, the very first question that ever comes to my mind when writing  review is this--\"Where do I start? What do I say?\"\\n\\n\r\nWith Vampire Knight, that question never occurred. I know instantly where to start. Since I'm such a freak about certain things, when I write reviews I have to write them in this order-- Story, Art, Sound, Character, All in all. but with this anime-- JUST this one-- I'm going to start with Character, because that is where I know to start and where I feel I need to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nYes. Here we go. /deep breath/ Vampire Knight's characters are... awful. Hate me if you wish, but honestly, they're just annoying. This show isn't *insanely* popular, but it is well known, and I have a large share of romance anime-loving friends, and each one of them referred me to this. I don't see why. The characters all have their own tortured pasts and this makes it pretty much uninteresting. It's ok if people have a hard enough past to make them interesting-- and not to mention STRONGER-- but Vampire Knight does not do this. They just get weaker because of how hard their past is. I'll... show you.\\n\\n\r\nYuki~\\n\r\nThe supposed heroine, an amnesiac with the only memory of when she was being attacked by a vampire when she was littler. Anything before that, she does not know. She carries around a weapon and is a night guard of sorts, keeping the Night Class and Day Class separate. Does she do a good job at this? ...No. Yuki must always be saved, and whenever she cries someone's name they will come. The plot and characters were all so predictable that, when Yuki fell over and dropped her weapon, the next thing she'd do would be call someone's name. That person would then come and completely kick the butt of her attackers. Yay. I predicted this every time, and every time it happened just as it happened in my mind. Yuki was not a heroine, but was nothing more than a weak girl who supposedly wanted to help Zero by sacrificing some of her blood to him. People regenerate blood, vampire (...probably) or human, so it's not too much of a sacrifice. They'll just get it back later. Nothing special there. And in return for giving her red liquid to him, Zero would come save her. Her weapon's only purpose was to be flung around or dropped when she was surprised or something. She irritated me so much that-- ...No, I won't say.\\n\\n\r\nZero~\\n\r\n...Oh heck. He's just a suicidal guy who has a \"secret\". He's a vampire. Wooooo. Who knew that was coming? /sarcasm/ All he does is regret his past and be all pathetic over it, and instead of developing he just sits and sighs sadly. Oh, and when Yuki calls out, he rescues her. I think he's rather torn between liking Yuki or not, or maybe it's just his oh-so-pathetic-feel-bad-for-me past, but he just bugged the crap out of me. Perhaps I am being much too critical for anyone's taste, but I feel I need to agree with some of those that gave this a bad review, and point out why. There's really no character development here, and when the characters are supposed to develop, it actually just makes them more annoying. There are so many things to dislike about this overused type of personality that I won't even point them out, or nobody would read my review because I could make a book out of it. But I'll share a few-- as I've stated earlier, he's suicidal, yes, but he's also a bit cold and unsociable and fights with his own emotions. Doesn't he have another side to him? He never really reveals one. At least not in this series. So far, I don't think even Vampire Knight: Guilty could bring to life this pathetic show, but I have high hopes for it...\\n\\n\r\nKaname~\\n\r\nDo I HAVE to talk about him? Auuugh... He's just your average super strong, top of the class, well-liked guy with a \"soft side\" for the protagonist, Yuki. It seems that Kaname and Zero's roles are equal-- to \"provide drama\" (yeah, great job at that.) and save Yuki all. the. freaking. time. Yes, he's a vampire, and all this other purely annoying stuff, so why does he like Yuki so much? She's cute? She's helpless? She's \"kind\"? I don't know, I'm hoping it will be revealed in Vampire Knight: Guilty, but I really don't know. Though, I'm sure it will, because how could an anime go on like this? He seems so obsessed with Yuki (and Yuki so obsessed with him) that it's just stupid. Why? I want answers, and I want them in the next season. If I don't get them, this show will be in my list of \"Worst 5 anime I have ever seen\". So, yes, if they reveal some of their secrets, I'll be... uh, happy. I guess. But for the most part, Kaname is a guy who doesn't make sense, and he's too much of a mystery. Mysteries, yes. But I can only take so much of \"I'm keeping everything to myself and acting cool yet obsessed with this girl for no reason\". Auuuugh. I just... no. Never mind. If I go further, I'll be ranting for the entire day, which I don't have time to do, so let's move on.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters~\\n\r\nWait, there were other characters? Wow! I hadn't even noticed! Oh, now that you say it, I do remember some of them. they were Kaname's followers, right? And they had such cliche personalities that I could die? Yeah, them! Right... If your brain is working properly, you should already know my opinion of the supporting cast by now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory~\\n\r\nIt seemed to be just slightly unique, and it had many places it could have gone, but it decided to stay as a stupid soap opera. It never really got deeper or darker than that, and the bad guy was sort of non existent until the very end. Weird. I like to be introduced to my antagonist at the very beginning, if possible. This was just one of the thousands of things that disappointed me in this show. Why everyone loves this is just something my brain can't grasp. I dunno, maybe your brain can't grasp why the heck I love Higurashi or Death Note, so let's leave it at this-- it's an opinion. The end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nAll in all, it was typical, yet with a darker sense of feeling. It really made me wonder how the heck the creator(s) did this. I mean, how do you take cliche art and give it a darker feeling to it? all in all, it was nice and enjoyable... but then the fight scenes came on. I mean, really? Just because it's a supposed romance doesn't mean the movement of the battles has to be completely awful. And trust me, ohhhh-- when mistakes in a frame are made, it was dang obvious. Most of the time in anime, I can tell when a mistake is made yet I can't always place it, but I know it's there. With Vampire Knight, that never happened once. I always knew where the mistakes were-- Yuki's face was too long. Her mouth was in the incorrect place. Zero's eye shape is wrong (and no, not because he's making a different expression, his eye shape is literally wrong). So many other things. So, when it is bad, it is very bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~\\n\r\nI enjoyed the opening, and... I actually have the ending on my iPod. I loved it. I have no idea why. There was something creepy yet mysterious and beautiful about it. It's not super special, but I liked it, and that's my opinion. The overall soundtrack for the movie was actually very nice, and I noticed *most* of it. It kind of helped enhance the mood, but most of the time it made it cheesier and more annoying. On its own, though, it's a fairly good soundtrack. The voice acting for the Japanese isn't necessarily anything super special-- each voice actor fits their role. And you know my opinion on the characters, so sometimes the voice acting was really annoying too. They sulk in the darkness of their rooms, softly calling out the name of the other character, their heart aching-- yeah, yeah. It gets annoying. If there's an English version, I didn't watch it, so...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Vampire Knight to me was very annoying and cliche in some of its parts. I hoped that it would go in a different direction since the overall setup of the plot was enthralling, but it went absolutely nowhere-- and I could only groan at the screen and slap my forehead. \\n\\n\r\nDepending on your taste in anime, you might or might not like this. I'd say, just to be safe, read the other reviews and build an opinion of your own before you watch this anime. Mostly, read as many reviews that give it a bad score, then read a few that give it an 8 or above. Decide what you want to do, and watch or don't watch this. If you've already seen it, then... good for you. Write your own review. If my review upset you in any way, please read the statement at the very top of this review. :P\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I just disliked this anime, and I'll stick with what I usually like. There were so many ways it could have gone, and so many twists it could have taken-- but it stayed annoying, predictable, and just... Ugh.",

It's quite obvious from the beginning that the love triangle is KanameYuukiZero, then why does Kaname present in YuukiZero scenes? In those scenes in the manga he wasn't even there at all O_o And there are more.\r\nThe story of course is great, but the anime ruined it totally. Zero behaves like a wimp, he's not like himself, and Yuuki also. Since when Yuuki has been takingZero's insults seriously? I won't tell spoilers but the anime exposes things very fast. Things that were clear at chapter 34 in the manga were hintend at episode 5 for example and in the opening and ending as well. The animation is so poor, and the art that is absolutely amazing in the manga is ruined in the anime. But I love the seyuus, they are awesome and as well the opening theme and the ending theme (not their clips, only the songs).\\n\\n\r\nI really hoped that the anime of my favorite manga would be awesome, but I guess I was mistaken.

            "content": "10 years ago, Cross Yuki was rescued from an attack by a rogue vampire that got her whole family killed by Kuran Kaname, a noble vampire. Now, under the watchful eye of Chairman Cross, Yuki's foster father, both are students at the Cross Acedemy, where there's a Day Class for humans, and Night Class for vampires. There, Yuki, along with Kiryuu Zero, a childhood friend with a deep hatred for vampires, they attempt to prevent the secret of the vampires' identities from the student mass.\r\nSTORY\r\nI was sorely disappointed with the anime. Hino Matsuri's manga version had a great story going for it, only for theanime version to warp it really badly. I give the writers credit for trying, but one shouldn't change the story so drastically it affects the flow the mangaka created. It isn't bad for those that haven't read the manga, but for those that have, I highly doubt you'll like it.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nAgain, to be fair to the producers, the art ain't that bad, but comparing to the manga, Zero doesn't really have a dark, sad look that he does in the manga, and Yuki looks far too cute that she almost has a Kanon style look.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nI love the opening song. I really do. The sound thoughout the show really does give a good feeling too, and helps bring up the mood. But sound really doesn't help improve a storyline.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nYuki is the best character in the anime version, and the only reason I gave this a 7, because I actually liked her with comedy, which she lacks in the manga. However, the rest of the characters are either the same, or thrown out of character. Aidou, for example, wasn't really explored deeply, and he just does things that weren't explained in the anime, but was in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI wasn't bored out of my wits, but I wasn't exactly jumping with joy at every episode of new release like I would with some anime. I had hoped it would be as enchanting as the manga was, but by the end of episode 2, I found it lacking.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nI cannot say it is a bad anime in anyway possible, nor is it a good one either. I expected better of the company that did legends like Higurashi no Naku Koroni and Rurouni Kenshin, and good anime like Kyo Kara Maou and Marimite, but this was just a disappointment. If you liked the anime, I recommend the manga. Art's better, character's better, story's better, and of course, enjoyment's better.",

I could not stop watching it. \r\nWhen the anime did vary from the manga, I found it to be an enriching manner that made the story a little bit easier to understand. There were a few points in the manga when everything wasn't very clear, and the anime did a very good job of clarifying everything. And again, the music was perfectly chosen, with a well-chosen catchyopening them and a chilling and haunting ending theme. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are definately significant weak spots to this anime. The art was okay at best, with a few even laughably horrible animation points, and one of the most important scenes in the manga was rushed through towards the end, completely ruining the effect the manga had given. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as for the storyline of Vampire Knight in general, I have to give props to the writer for not trying to make obvious plot points some big surprise. When she knew the audience was going to find out something anyway, she embraced that fact and built upon it. \\n\\n\r\nI think this is something that should be watched and enjoyed for nothing else than the chilling sounds and high entertainment value.

            "content": "Throughout my time of watching anime I have discovered many series that I have made me sit back and think \"I'm glad anime became a main interest of mine\" . The list is long ranging from things like Steins;Gate to LotGH. \r\nThe problem however with anime is that it reminds me of Reddit and 4Chan. You begin looking at the funny things, the good things, the parts that get to you. Then you realise.....Beyond the funny memes you get the disgusting and idiotic parts that make you question why the internet should be allowed. At the bottom of the anime change is this. Vampire Knight.A show so bad if I had to have my entire memory erased of my last 21 years just to rid me of this monstrosity, I'd snap your hand off at the chance.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly the name of this show. \"Vampire Knight\" , I personally believe this should be changed for historical implication of the story. I believe it should be changed to Twilight's Ugly Sister and frankly I think that's a serious insult to the story of Twilight. It's light years ahead of this nonsense, least I could laugh at the stupid staring.\\n\\n\r\nSo \"story\" wise. Vampire Knight follows Yuki and her love triangle thing with Zero (the only somewhat acceptable character in the whole show) and Kaname (or as I would like him to be renamed \"Worse version of Edward Cullen\" ) . I could give you more background on the series such as the whole school system of day and night but frankily what's the point? Focus is on a terrible love story involving terrible characters. The love story gets worse and worse the more elements that are revealed and infact Im gonna give this show 1 bit of credit. The love story is even worse in the manga! Though this is due to length of the manga compared to the length of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is completely dull. What else is there to say? I can't recall one OST or one bit of sound that made the show better. Opening is terrible and so are the endings. Sound isn't a gigantic factor in anime for me, if the story is great I can deal with a poor soundtrack but its the little things that go a long way some time.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Deen and their art eh? What a great company. For every decent show like Higurashi they do they end up doing something as terrible as this. The art is dark and boring which I get in the concept of the story? But the stories terrible.....So lets throw in some random dance animations on screen make it more entertaining for myself.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment levels for this were definitely a 10. Totally right! Why wouldn't you enjoy a terrible story, with terrible music an terrible characters created by a terrible studio......... Apologies the British sarcasm within me just came over me then. I don't know why.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest this is avoided like you would avoid those messages from fake accounts asking you if you want to see them on cam. Unless you are into putting yourself in a detrimental position, then by all means watch this monstrosity. Oh and it even has a 2nd season. I'd like the weed they were smoking when that was green lit. Ha. Lit.\\n",

            "content": "Vampires in anime is nothing original and definitely nothing ground-breaking, in 2006, the idea of vampires had taken a back seat, Twilight didn't exist so there was a lack of screaming fangirls talking about what team they were, in fact, before there was Twilight....There was Vampire Knight.\r\nMany people, including me tend to think \"oh, vampires, meh\" and it takes a quality show such as Production IG's 'Blood: The Last Vampire' to turn heads and make people think otherwise, only to be kicked in the teeth by god awful vampire anime such as Fortune Arterial, Vampire Knight was a step in the right direction, but itsfar from perfect.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow the story of Yuki Cross, who as a child, was attacked by a Vampire and saved by Kaname Kuran, a pureblood vampire (he's basically top of the vampire hierarchy).\\n\r\nTime skip to high school because every anime seems to be set in bloody high school, she attends Cross Academy led by her father, Kaien who is determined to make Humans and Vampires live in harmony by having them attend the same school.\\n\r\nThe day class is for humans such as Yuki and her partner Zero as school guardian, and they are responsible for keeping the over-excited girls at bay when the night class strut their way into Cross Academy.\\n\r\nThe night class are (wait for it) THE VAMPIRES, and are, in my opinion the only set of characters that kept the entire series afloat during the more...dull time of the series. We have Kaname Kuran, Yuki's love interest and childhood hero and Aido Hanabusa, the comic relief antagonistic senior to Yuki who is presumably jealous of their relationship, the rest dont have much importance, but theyre all equally cool.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Deen took the reigns for this anime, well known for animating When They Cry (Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni) and, while they've never been at the peak of animation quality, thankfully for this show it isnt utter shit either, the animation is mediocre at best and certain action scenes felt off to me, other than that, its bearable to watch, so, as of right now, Vampire Knight is a fairly solid anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the good stuff, i'll quickly give my two cents on the opening and ending song before i get on to the 'dub or sub' argument, the opening song took me around 9 episodes to get used to, and on occasion i actually skipped it as there is absolutely nothing noteworthy on it, the song actually starts before the characters in the preview of the episodes have finished speaking leading to a clusterf**k of different voices for a few seconds. The ending song titled 'Still Doll' was more compelling, it didnt try to animate too much and it left a large sense of insecurity on me after it had finished, the voice of the singer Kanon Wakeshima was borderline perfect and the last few frames was very creepy.\\n\r\nDub or sub? Sub. I havent even watched it in japanese just yet, but the dub felt like it was just slapped on, the dialogue was poor for reasons i'll get onto in a moment, and i honestly think the dub is the primary reason i never enjoyed the show as much as i should have.\\n\r\nNow its no spoiler to say that Zero's parents are dead as its explained pretty much right after he is introduced, their death is his motivation to keep fighting and the source of his hatred for vampires, Yuki is meant to be his bestfriend, just keep that in mind for the quote i'm about to give you...\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"You think she's the vampire that brutally murdered your entire family?\"\\n\\n\r\nWTF? Yes, all the characters that mention Zero's parents to Zero himself seem to love reminding him of how the series' antagonist butchered his parents, which made me feel that either the characters were trying to make Zero cry or that they needed to remind him for the sake of having something to say.\\n\r\nThe voice actors do an outright poor job of expressing the feelings between the characters that the japanese dub apparently has which causes the whole romance/tragedy side of the show to be completely laughable, i honestly watched death scenes of the characters multiple times thinking \"Wait, was i supposed to care?\"\\n\r\nThe dub has successfully made it onto a list of english dubs i flatout REFUSE to listen to ever again in my life, and i can count the amount of such dubs on one hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, to some extent make the rest of the show bearable, not a single character that matters in the story is a cliche stereotype of any anime archetype, and for that i can applaud the idea, however thanks to the dub, the characters came off as plain with no character growth whatsoever and when the story gets 'serious' in the final 4 episodes, i felt myself struggling to even finish it, taking 30 minute breaks between episodes to cope with the inevitable cliffhanger ending.\\n\\n\r\nOh, yes, normally i dont like talking about a show's ending to the point where i give it a whole section in the review, but in my belief the ending is what makes the show solid, and in this case...it wasnt, it ends on a god-awful cliffhanger which, if you were struggling to finish the first 13 episodes like i did, you are now forced to watch 13 MORE to get the full effect of the story, admittedly, however, the story is incredibly strong, making no room for your typical beach episodes or filler bullshit, everything is completely necessary and the plot twists are masterfully executed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show is by no means for everyone, and if you want a vampire anime i would rather recommend Blood: The Last Vampire or Trinity Blood over this, but if you must, watch it, it ain't half bad, i have alot to say about it (mostly negative) but honestly i think its because i havent watched the japanese dub or even the second season, so my final opinions on the series as a whole is likely to change, but for now, the first season was a tad messy, leaving all of the explanations for the second season in typical Studio Deen fashion.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 6/10 and the overall recommendation to stream it if you have absolutely nothing else to watch",

            "content": "In summary, Vampire Knight is the anime offspring of Ouran High School Host Club meets Twilight. I didn't have high hopes for this anime and was pleasantly surprised at the strength of character development and some plot twists. \r\nCross Academy is like 2 schools rolled into one. The normal day class students are all intrigued and have terrific crushes on members of the Night Class who look like Movie Stars. Of course they day class is completely unaware that the Night Class are vampires, and an uneasy peace is kept by 2 prefects (Yuki and Zero), obeying the Headmaster's ideals of \"let's all just getalong\".\\n\\n\r\nThe night class looks like Ouran High School Host Club come to life. Every one of the men is handsome *sigh*, with the handsomest being Clan Kaname, the Pureblood Noble. He saved Yuki when she was a child, but Yuki's fellow prefect Zero hates him because he is a vampire.\\n\\n\r\nTherein is the crux of the love triangle! The plot twisted and turned enough to keep me interested. There was a lot of angst, staring and brooding. Parts of it were downright sexy. Even I who hate the sight of blood found myself intensely interested in some of the ... food scenes. \\n\\n\r\nArt was same as Ouran style, sound was just ok. Although the OP was very well done the rest of the soundtrack was very nondescript.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was a little unexpected (a cop out) or I would have scored it higher. However thanks to 1 scene of fanservice for females the overall score ended up as an 7. At the end of it, the series didn't feel complete hence the 7 overall score. Good premise, lots of promise, could have been better executed. At the very least though, it was good enough to make me want to watch the sequel (just to find out what happens).",

            "content": "The setting for this anime is maybe not an original one, VampirexMortal. But little parts of the storyline had me intrigued, and on the advice of a friend, I sat down to watch it.\r\nAs I said, little additions and quirks of the storyline (such as Yuuki being saved by a vampire as a young girl, Zero's *affliction* -I'll call it that so there are no spoilers- and vampires being a night class while mortals are a day class of a boarding school.) made me enjoy certain parts of this story.\r\nThe first few episodes had me thoroughly enjoying it, the art a major bonus to thestory. Comedy I wasn't expecting filled the first few episodes, and the music had me humming along.\\n\\n\r\nThen, it all began to go downhill. Trying to suddenly adapt into a very dark, very sombre tale from what started out as maybe a black comedy had the whole story floundering. The story began to be brushed as what seemed to be filler episodes took up minute after minute. The true story and plot is only set into motion around episode 9. Leaving 4 episodes to give you a very unsatisfying and lukewarm ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another part of this anime which annoy me. Kaname is the most pretentious (I'm sorry to say), stuck up, arrogant and very, very cunning and sly. Not really the qualities you expect in a shoujo - do you? And while I'll admit it's refreshing, it's still not right.\\n\r\nYuuki is...utterly pathetic. One thing that puts me right off certain animes or mangas is weak female protagonists. And Yuuki is one of the worst. I'd like to hope it's because the mangaka needed filler chapters. Yuuki, never learning from her mistakes, constantly walking into trouble and always ends up being rescued by either Zero or Kaname.\\n\r\nThis does nothing to prevent the whole show falling into a downward spiral as it tries to explain every filler episode with chilling precision. Fair enough, but why not just call it what it is - an episode in which the base plot does not progress, and a chance to see Yuuki saved by some hot guy?\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was this anime's saving grace-the only reason I rated this anime as high as I did, for me, as I went completely off this anime the minute Yuuki batted her eyelashes and was saved by Kaname. If you must watch this show - the side characters are actually the most interesting, and most comedic.",

            "content": "Initially, I wanted to rate this review 9/10 overall because I'm secretly (well, not so secret anymore) in love with one of the characters inside *fan girl moment* ZERO *blush* \r\nZero is just too hot for an anime character, don't you think so? \r\n*End of fan girl moment* \r\nBack to the topic,\r\nBasically, this story is about vampires, vampires and vampires as you would predict from the title. Honestly, I didn't plan on even watching this anime even though I heard great reviews about it and all because of the word \"Vampire\". Ever since Twilight came out, vampire books and movies have been a hit andI personally find it overrated so I didn't even bother to look up for reviews about it.\\n\\n\r\nUntil...one day, I you-tube hopped and spotted Vampire Knight and read the comments...\\n\\n\r\nThe one that attracted me the most -> \"OMGGGGG the guys in vampire knight are soooooooooooooo hot\"\\n\\n\r\nSince it's hard for me to get obsessed over an anime character (Okay, to be honest, it's quite easy, they just have to look pretty and good looking and I'm hooked but then, I'm being quite biased ain't I?) I went onto review sites and look up for the characters and dayum! One of the main characters attracted me just like that so I decided to give this series a try.\\n\\n\r\nI will be honest though - if the first episode doesn't get me hooked onto it, I will by no means watch a second episode - unless, I'm TOO bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode did get me hooked because it was so deep and thrilling in a fun way ;)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought that the story was really interesting and the plot gets deeper as you dived more into the series. No filler episodes and that makes me really happy as they concentrated on the story more.\\n\\n\r\nYou should wiki the story to know more about the Purebloods and the vampire families - that is really interesting. I find it really fascinating that Purebloods have so much power compared to the normal vampires and Level E and so on...\\n\\n\r\nI was really afraid the story is gonna be 24/7 scary and vampire-y (as in biting and licking and stuff) but thank goodness, there were funny moments and chibi-fied faces as well. I'm surprised Kaname didn't have a chibi-face of himself!\\n\\n\r\nI guess he's too cool for it B)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing much to rave about but it's pleasant to my eyes. At first, I get so annoyed with the female protagonist because her eyes are SO huge that it's crazy! I mean, I know that anime girls usually have huge eyes but her eyes are so huge that they look like they're gonna suck me in anytime - seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe male leads are of course - stunning and very, very hot. I have no objections of the character's art except for Yuuki's eyes. Other than that, the other characters looked pleasantly beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe background was decent - I mostly see trees and lots of trees but they suit the mood just right because half of the series, the background plays quite a role because they were very dark and moody just like the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED songs were alright although I find the ED song REEEEALLY creepy that I usually skip it most of the time. I get scared easily and hey, red eyes and broken mirrors? Nuh-uh. I'm out.\\n\\n\r\nBut what really impressed me was the voices of the characters. It suited them just right! I love Zero's tortured voice (heheh it's sexy) and Kaname's \"serious and mysterious\" voice as well. I particularly liked the Chairman's voice as well. He can sound so serious at times...and then......HAPPY at other times.\\n\\n\r\nEpic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter character character. I really love the characters in these series. Sure, they are all the same - love triangle, beautiful people T_T and all but what I'm talking about is the character itself - the personality.\\n\\n\r\nI personally find Yuuki's character very weak and a little bit annoying because she doesn't do anything much and doesn't help much either other than giving her blood for Zero to drink. One good point about her: She's cute? And she's very optimistic. \\n\\n\r\nKaname's character is very, very interesting. You never know what he's up to...and you wonder - is he a good guy or a bad guy? It's like he's never both of them or he could be both of them...\\n\\n\r\nHe just leaves you confused.\\n\\n\r\nZero's character - dude, could you blame him if he wants to kill himself? I'm sick of people saying Zero's character is so weak and lame and all but can you actually imagine yourself in Zero's situation? Both parents killed by a vampire and yet, he turns into a vampire himself and is unable to control his thirst? Tell me, if you're like that - will you still find yourself weak? \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are really interesting as well. I loved it when slowly by slowly, their pasts are being depict to the viewers and it leaves us wanting more!\\n\\n\r\nAidou is one of the supporting characters that impressed me. He can be so friendly and flirty yet...mean. Watch it to know what I mean :P\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSome scenes were a bit draggy but they're not as draggy as Vampire Knight Guilty's, personally I find VKG verrrrrry slow but I shall save this review for later. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode leaves you a cliffhanger and makes you crave for more! An episode without a cliffhanger basically tells you - \"*Yawn* I shall watch this some other day...\" \\n\\n\r\nI know the director was trying to picture Yuuki's thoughts but they were really too much that I can predict what she's gonna say even before she goes into her \"I'm scared of Vampires\" mood...it's always...the same.\\n\\n\r\nBut all I can say is, it's interesting yet at times, it can be draggy and annoying. The plot is what keeps me glued onto the laptop screen. Episode by episode, they slowly tells us about the relationship between the vampires and the vampire hunters and of course, Yuuki's past..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe 8 is for the lovely characters and the really interesting story and of course the enjoyment. The -2 - some scenes were draggy and put on repeat but other than that, you're gonna enjoy this movie if you're up for a little romance and mystery. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It could've been much better if the plot progressed quicker instead of having the same subject for many episodes in a row and also trying to explain things better and not leaving things in a open.\r\nArt (3/10)\r\nAbsolutely disliked it. The only feature that could make the character noticeable were the different hair colors of each character, otherwise, distinguishing them and remembering them would be nearly impossible.\r\nSound (2/10)\r\nThis is merely my opinion but I hated the openings, endings and most of the background sound.\r\nCharacter (5/10)\r\nSome characters were boring, especially Yuki since shedidn't do anything special. Zero was kinda nice and Kaname too but that's only because I liked their style and way to do stuff.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10)\u00b4\\n\r\nNothing to add, just boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the worst anime I ever watched. Only finished watching it because I thought something would happen further but it was a false hope. The sequel is much better since it reveals all the secrets and things we DIDN'T KNOW and WANTED TO KNOW in this season. A bunch of more action and suspense and less drama could've made this a lot better.",

The art is quite decent. Its actually pretty well done. The eyes are quite big though, especially on Yuuki. The face expressions when somebody's getting bitten by a vamp was pretty cool as well. reading ze' manga and watching ze' anime, I have noticed that the characters have LONG necks! Its a bit too long! =3=\r\nSTORY: Its not the best, sadly.VK has its ups and downs during the story. And, I was expecting lots of action because they put vamps withhumans together so, I wanna see some blood on da' floor. PS: I think in some parts of VK, Matsuri Hino trys to put in some funny parts but.. It doesnt seem to work..\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: I hate it when vamps are suppose to act \"distant\" or \"cool\". It makes me..furious! Seriously, Im getting tired of that.. The only person I seem to aprove of would be Ichijou Takuma. But, he's not exactly the best.. I LOVE THE HEADMASTER! He's hyper, giddy..and etc! He's the best, he PWNS. Kaname protects a bit tooooooooo much.. Zero acts like he's PMS-ing. Yuuki is just.. eh. Aidou is too vain within himself.. I can go alll day.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: By reading this review, you can tell that Im VERY disapointed. Matsuri Hino's MeruPeri (something like that) is a bit more enjoy-a-ble.",

            "content": "Vampire knight was a welcome change for me in terms of the darker tone of the show, compared to the usual reverse harem, soujo anime. I loved the fact it was not the typical sweet and innocent cliche anime, it had at least a little more depth to it. \r\nI say a 'little' because to be honest it still is far from being a well, rounded, engaging, action packed and thought-provoking anime. It still is very much targeted at teenage girls with a thirst for 'twilighty' things.. \r\nThe story was not a bad one, compared with many other animes of a similar genre, as therewas the element of horror and mystery. The characters were fairly interesting. Kaname was my favorite, and Zero being a troubled soul also had his quirks and complexities. Sad to say our protagonist was rather weak and oh-so-obliging. I would be the first to say I hate an overly loud, domineering and arrogant protagonist, but seriously, Yuuki takes the feminist cause back about a decade. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have been watching Earl and the Fairy, Haku\u014dki, Special A etc, I think you would enjoy a similar feel but change of scenery. Other than that i believe you would find Vampire Knight rather average and perhaps best to be avoided..\\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nSome aspects of the setup I liked, like the school divided into day class human students and night class vampire students.  I would have loved the human heroine who patrols the grounds and night, making sure the vampires are  in line, except...Yuki was TOTALLY lame. Episode after episode was her chasing after Zero, stupidly getting herself into danger, being saved by a male lead, and then feeling guilty.  Really weak story, with few redeeming features.  The characters didn't grow, events didn't build up into a climax, and the resolution was contrived and lukewarn.  It was very much one of thoseanimes annoyingly full of longing, melodramatic gazes and characters saying each others' names in quiet, tortured voices.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art was all right.  Yuki was cute, Zero was handsome, and Kaname was gorgeous.  The other vampires were pretty lame though, just a bunch of generic bishounen who were totally loyal to Kaname cuz the mangaka said so.  I found Yuki's absolutely massive eyes irritating.  I've seen a lot of anime by now so I'm used to the huge eyes, but hers actually distracted me at times, maybe because the story had so little pull.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nGood soundtrack.  Lots of classical, which I enjoyed, and I like both the intro and ending songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are what I disliked the most, especially Yuki.  She was an extremely boring protagonist.  She carried around a cool-looking staff that seemed to have magical properties, but never once used it well.  Usually, she'd just bring it out only to drop it when someone said something upsetting or when she tripped.  She was then promptly rescued by Kaname or Zero.  Maybe the next season will explain why she is in the middle of all of this, but I think season 1 should give the heroine SOME value.  Sure, she was very generous with Zero, but I hate shoujo heroines who only stand out because they're SO good at being martyrs.  As for the other characters, they weren't much better.  Zero spent most of his time wanting to die.  Kaname constantly rescued Yuki, yet never explained her importance to him.  A little mystery is good, but too much \"she's so precious to me but I won't say why\" gets boring and annoying.  The \"villain\" only appeared at the very, very end, and I found their behavior inconsistent and what happened to them way too abrupt and anticlimactic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI don't have high standards.  I might've adored this show, if Yuki hadn't been such a weakling.  What I usually enjoy in anime shows is watching the protagonist learn and grow.  It's okay if the protagonist starts out ordinary or weak or with a massive crush, so long as they become stronger.  Yuki really didn't, though.  Kaname kept protecting her without explaining anything.  Zero usually pushed her away and also refused to share things.  She had a big heart, but I like heroines who're genuinely strong, not just good at sacrificing themselves.  Sorry, but anyone can say, \"Bite me.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nMaybe this is a good show for teenage girls, but I think anyone who just finished Ouran Host Club or Hana Yori Dango or other such shows will be disappointed by the heroine.  Most shoujo is so entertaining because the heroines are so intelligent, or plucky, or independent.  Yuki was none of those things.  Of course, fangirls who just want to see a cute big-eyed girl get bitten by various bishounen will still love it.",

            "content": "If you think that shojo series are all flowery, romantic (comedies) and cheerful, you're quite wrong, and Vampire Knight will prove that more than anything else. Keywords for VK are drama, emotional struggles and tragic pasts. Throw in a dash of vampire, and there you have Vampire Knight in all its glory.\r\nThe story revolves around the students of the Cross Academy, which is divided into the Day Class for humans, and the Night Class for Vampires. The main characters, Zero and Yuki, both have very sad pasts; Zero had his family killed by a vampire, and Yuki's first memory was a vampire attacking her. Thesepasts, which are revealed fairly early in the series, make a good base for their relationship and their emotional struggles.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the course of the story, the characters face one event/experience after another, which makes room for emotional struggles, lots of character development and, of course, some romance (hey, this is a shojo series after all), though the latter is overshadowed by the other stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is both standard shojo and something else at the same time. We have the pretty bishonen boys in place, complete with all the fallen-head-over-heels girls, and there's also the standard shojo eyes; large, with pupils that are almost larger than the actual eyes. But since the series has a darker, sadder tone to it, there's no lack on that end either. The coloring is often very dark, and the occasional lighting effect helps on this aspect of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, with sad pieces helping the sad mood, and overall good quality. There's nothing spectacular about the soundtrack though, and while the OP theme is very good, the ED theme isn't very cool, though it fits with the dark mood of the series. Voice acting is perfect; the moods are portrayed very well and there's an overall good quality.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I love about this series is the characters. I mean, I really love them. They're very deep, with their pasts and emotional struggles. Off course, there's superficial characters as well, but they're mostly supporting characters; the main characters are mostly deep and they have a lot of character development for such a short series. Their relationships with eachother are very deep too, and a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the series very much; this is a candidate for the best Spring 2008 anime. It's a bit open at the end, but I just read that there's a second season coming in October, so I'll accept that, and look forward to it.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "Well, since some people exactly like my reviews, I decided to do another one. This time, it's Vampire Knight. I've only seen 3 episodes and read some manga chapters, even through I can't consider myself as the VK-girl that knows everything, I know quite alot about the story and the characters. Anyway, here we go!\r\nStory - 100% [10]\r\nIf you haven't read the manga or saw some episodes of the anime, you'll probably already have an idea what this is about... Vampires. I say that you're right, but if you watch or read Vampire Knight, you'll find out that it's more than only ''vampires''. Let's startwith the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nVampire Knight revolves between Yuki, Zero and Kaname. Yuki and Zero are Cross-Academy's prefects (guardians). It's their duty to prevent the contact between the Day and the Night-class, even through it's very hard for them because all the girls from the Day-class have a big crush on the guys from the Night-class, that's not very rare because everyone in the Night-class looks gorgeous. Why are prefects needed? To prevent the Day-class of finding out the secret from the Night-class, in reality, all of them are vampires. The ''leader'' of the Night-class is Kaname Kuran, the one who saved Yuki's life when she was little. Ofcourse he's a vampire too and the most powerful of all, a pureblood. Yuki and Zero both live with the chairmain of Cross-Academy, Cross Kaien. Yuki doesn't have any memories from when she was a kid, her memories begin on the day that Kaname saved her from a vampire. Kaname asked the chairman to look after her, and he did. The same goes of Zero, a couple of years later he comes to live with Yuki and the chairmain to, after his parents where killed by a vampire.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is so loveable about all this? Both the anime and the manga have a mysterious feeling to it, that you know that something is going on but you don't know what. You'll also notice and the story gets ''darker'' each time, and that the characters change. It takes a while until you really understand everything because they tell you the story bit by bit, you may also expect some big changes, I warn you. I wish that I could tell you more, but I don't want to spoil it for you guys. I really recommend you guys both the manga and the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 80% [8]\\n\r\nWell, the animation. I must say that it's alot better than I expected. Still, I know that alot of manga-fans might be dissapointed. The manga might have better art, but I think that the anime is really well made. They put alot of effort in this, and with succes. If the manga didn't excist, the anime would probably get higher ratings. Well, my opinion is that that the Vampire Knight anime is a good adaptation to the manga, I really think so.\\n\\n\r\nSound -  90% [9]\\n\r\nThe sound, or better said, the music. The songs that the picked for both the opening and ending where really the right choice for this anime. Futatsu no Kodou to Akai Tsumi is the opening-song, sung by ON/OFF, and I really love it. It really matches the anime and gives you the Vampire Knight-feeling. I really like it. Then, for the ending-song, Still Doll sung by Wakeshima Kanon, was the biggest plus-point for me. I just loved it the first time that I heard it! How come? It's mysterious and matches Vampire Knight perfectly. When you listen to it, I'm sure that you'll also get the feeling that there's something that you don't know yet. For the soundeffects in this anime, I have nothing to complain. When you needed one, you got one, just how it is in real life. The good sound in Vampire Knight made it realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 100% [10]\\n\r\nHa, this was a easy one. The characters, you'll absolutely love them when you get to know them! What is good about this is that you don't only get to know Yuki, Zero and Kaname, but also the other people from the Night-Class and other random characters. Let's take Aidou as an example, he's not a main character, still, you know exactly who he is! I'll tell you something about the 3 main characters now.\\n\\n\r\nYuki - I think that you all know her type of character, but Yuki is not the typical ''shoujo'' heroine. No, she's different. You can see that she tries her best to help Zero and get a place in his heart, she really cares alot for others, which might also be her weakness. To save Zero from turning into a Level E, she let him drink her blood. Yuki was attacked as a little girl by a vampire who was fallen to a Level E, and than was saved by Kaname. She has no memories of her parents or who she really is. Because Kaname saved her, she has a great affection for him, and she trusts the vampires in the Night-Class.\\n\\n\r\nZero - He might look like a cold-hearted guy in the beginning, but he really isn't. Zero's family where killed by a vampire, that's why he really hates vampires, all of them. Anyway, in the beginning of the series you'll see him in pain a couple of times, I think alot of you got the picture back then. Yes, when he was attacked he was biten by a vampire, a pureblood. Since he didn't die he will slowly turn into a vampire himself. Since his huge hate for vampires, she fights against the progress with all his might. Zero always has a gun with him, he can use it to kill vampires. He also has a younger twin-brother named Ichiru, but he was not as healthy as Zero (no, he didn't die).\\n\\n\r\nKaname - A pureblood vampire who's respected by everyone in the Night-Class, no, better said, he's the leader. When he gives an order, it's final. Other vampires fear him and he's loved by alot of girls from the Day-Class. Even through he doesn't really care about them, he does care alot for Yuki, which you'll notice right away. You'll understand later why a vampire with so much power as Kaname cares so much for a normal girl like Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nI think I told you enough, the point is, the characters WIN!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 100% [10]\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Do you even need to ask? I REALLY enjoy this. It's a burden to wait for the episodes to air, but we have no other choice but wait, have we? If you like a mysterious story, vampires and some scary moments, watch Vampire Knight. I'll probably recommend this to everyone because this is something that everyone would like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 90% [9]\\n\r\nWhat? Miss ''I enjoy-it-so-much'', you didn't gave it a 10!\\n\r\nYes, people, I know what you're thinking. But you guys must remember, that I'd also like to see this from another point of view. Since I have also read a part of the manga, I know how it could have been. I really think that the people who made the Vampire Knight-anime did an awesome job! If you see the original when reading the manga, you might understand why I gave this a 9. Don't forget to watch it now, I'll hunt you!\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Vampire Knight is an awesome anime/manga with very enjoyable characters and a story! It might be one of the ''must-see's''. Judge for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay, minna! This was my review! I hope you didn't dislike it that much, I tried my best in writing it! Love, Erisu...\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you like pretty anime vampire boys, this might be right up your street. However, if you like something with a decent plot as well as the associated carnage and animalistic nature that vampires usually have, this will likely leave you somewhat disappointed (and that's me being rather kind..) and wishing it had delivered more for the time you put in.\r\nI began watching this on a friend's giddy recommendation and was intrigued somewhat by the first few episodes; although, all the way through near enough, it stayed at the same steady pace of mild intrigue and a general niggling wonder as to when the hellthe plot was going to kick in so that the story had some sort of point to it aside from a glorified love triangle. The plot itself, somewhere beneath the anime itself, has a lot of potential. The on-screen variation just doesn't seem to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, despite my 'fangirl-esque' fondness of a fair few of them, aren't particularly well mapped out and a lot of the character basis is shrouded in mystery, although not really in the right way - there are far too many vague bits and not enough explanation when it comes to motive and persona as well as situation. In fact, most of the characters seem not only 2D, but slight variations of the same 2D character. Also, most of the vampires you encounter in this series are rather fluffy aside from the pointy fangs, and the supporting cast are, to a fair extent, pretty forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, it was somewhat pleasing, although a lot of time seems to have been wasted on trivial matters while the potentially good bits have been glossed over or given a moment or two of screen time when they should have had a scene, or at the very least, *more* screen time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say this series is probably worth a watch if you're just looking for an easy vampire related anime fix, but after spending a good few hours ploughing through this series, I am left wondering if I want to bother at all with its counterpart; leaning heavily towards the 'No' vote.\\n\\n\r\nBear in mind that I've not read the manga, nor am I in the 'anime connoisseur' league, but I am a writer (of sorts) and would know a good story when it hit me in the face: sadly, this failed to deliver such a pleasant blow.",

            "content": "Vampire Knight is the 13-episode anime adaptation of the famous manga by renowned manga-ka Matsuri Hino. \r\nRevolving around a cast of teen-aged characters, or rather some teener-looking century-old vamps, the story unfolds with a female character named Yuki Cross, a renowned student who keeps one of the biggest secrets her school has to cautiously conceal, as the point-of-view. The typical shojo anime protagonist, she exhibits the traits (candy eyes, cheerful attitude, encouraging words, beautiful face, and most specifically attractiveness) many viewers would like her to. As the main of the main characters, she, of course, is most likely to have different interactions with the othercharacters. Some of which are Zero Kiryuu and Kaname Kuran, of which both are considered in the anime as the 'guys' girls often have in their little dreamland. Of all the other characters, these three make the story move on to a different chapter. Other characters play a not-so-catchy role as the mentioned three do, but practically their 'existence' in the series would prove them essential to the story. Evolving in a slow phase, the characters-- of which most female viewers would note their totally 'hot' appearance&mdash; make up most of what the audiences really stick their ass to. Since the bishies in this anime are the ones made to stand out, most VK-tard viewers are females! But don't consider this show &quot;gay!&quot; It's good, I tell you (and no... I'm not being bias)! All the characters, be male or female, are candy-eyed. The main characters themselves have, obviously, their own life stories. They evolve in the same phase as the story does, of course. In my case, I hate none of them. Given equivalent weights of parts in the story, such characters are highly guaranteed to please us the viewers; thus, I give them a commendable 8 ^_^\\n\\n\r\nThe story, on the other hand, evolves in the same phase as the characters do: not rushed yet not slow. To put simply, the story it features has an assortment of drama, romance, and, noticeably, a bit of horror (quite a good &quot;chemistry&quot; if you ask me). The &quot;horror&quot; part is not highly emphasized, even though the title itself suggests it would offer a good hair-raising experience. What I call true horror would involve ugly demoniacs. On the contrary, there ain&rsquo;t any fugly bad guys&mdash;just them who have killer smiles! What I think is the main highlight is romance (I relate it with the &quot;Knight&quot; in Vampire Knight)! Consider a girl interacting between two dependent guys a romantic story featuring a tense love triangle. The genre drama is given the same importance as romance&mdash; good romance must involve good drama! I take back what I said about it not plunging into a deep plot. I admit the story is nice! Following a stream of media res, there's quite a good number of flashbacks. The first episodes of the anime don&rsquo;t really offer a good number of twists. It was only at the latter part that things turned out to be the unexpected. With these ingredients in the story, it deserves an 8 ^_^\\n\\n\r\n          I have not read a single page of the manga, but many say the art of the manga was a lot better than in the anime. Perhaps it is. I do think that the art and animation aren't exactly that good. There are quite some distortions in the face of the characters. Some viewers commented that the manga was just too &lsquo;sketchy&rsquo; for the art to be animated. Then again, it wasn&rsquo;t at all that bad. I give the art and animation a 7.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n          The music or sound, on the other hand, furthermore adds eeriness to the already-creepy theme, or whatever emotion the scenes require. The music presents a good vampire-ish theme. There is nothing more to say about the sound, so I give it a 9 ^_^\\n\\n\r\n          Vampire Knight is not exactly my type of anime, but it still gives me the urge to watch it&hellip; and as they say, &ldquo;let VK show you a sweet dream next time!&rdquo;\\n",

            "content": "WARNING-- before reading this review, please take into account the fact that I disliked Vampire Knight. If that one statement offends you, please do not read onward. I do not assume any responsibilities for broken monitors, laptops, or mobile devices. \r\nAlso, if you like dark romance or any romance dealing with vampires, I recommend this to you. See if you like it. Though, if you prefer adventures or are not a fan of things dark, or of soap operas, this is not recommended. \r\n..:::..:::..\r\nNo matter what anime it is, the very first question that ever comes to my mind when writing  review is this--\"Where do I start? What do I say?\"\\n\\n\r\nWith Vampire Knight, that question never occurred. I know instantly where to start. Since I'm such a freak about certain things, when I write reviews I have to write them in this order-- Story, Art, Sound, Character, All in all. but with this anime-- JUST this one-- I'm going to start with Character, because that is where I know to start and where I feel I need to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nYes. Here we go. /deep breath/ Vampire Knight's characters are... awful. Hate me if you wish, but honestly, they're just annoying. This show isn't *insanely* popular, but it is well known, and I have a large share of romance anime-loving friends, and each one of them referred me to this. I don't see why. The characters all have their own tortured pasts and this makes it pretty much uninteresting. It's ok if people have a hard enough past to make them interesting-- and not to mention STRONGER-- but Vampire Knight does not do this. They just get weaker because of how hard their past is. I'll... show you.\\n\\n\r\nYuki~\\n\r\nThe supposed heroine, an amnesiac with the only memory of when she was being attacked by a vampire when she was littler. Anything before that, she does not know. She carries around a weapon and is a night guard of sorts, keeping the Night Class and Day Class separate. Does she do a good job at this? ...No. Yuki must always be saved, and whenever she cries someone's name they will come. The plot and characters were all so predictable that, when Yuki fell over and dropped her weapon, the next thing she'd do would be call someone's name. That person would then come and completely kick the butt of her attackers. Yay. I predicted this every time, and every time it happened just as it happened in my mind. Yuki was not a heroine, but was nothing more than a weak girl who supposedly wanted to help Zero by sacrificing some of her blood to him. People regenerate blood, vampire (...probably) or human, so it's not too much of a sacrifice. They'll just get it back later. Nothing special there. And in return for giving her red liquid to him, Zero would come save her. Her weapon's only purpose was to be flung around or dropped when she was surprised or something. She irritated me so much that-- ...No, I won't say.\\n\\n\r\nZero~\\n\r\n...Oh heck. He's just a suicidal guy who has a \"secret\". He's a vampire. Wooooo. Who knew that was coming? /sarcasm/ All he does is regret his past and be all pathetic over it, and instead of developing he just sits and sighs sadly. Oh, and when Yuki calls out, he rescues her. I think he's rather torn between liking Yuki or not, or maybe it's just his oh-so-pathetic-feel-bad-for-me past, but he just bugged the crap out of me. Perhaps I am being much too critical for anyone's taste, but I feel I need to agree with some of those that gave this a bad review, and point out why. There's really no character development here, and when the characters are supposed to develop, it actually just makes them more annoying. There are so many things to dislike about this overused type of personality that I won't even point them out, or nobody would read my review because I could make a book out of it. But I'll share a few-- as I've stated earlier, he's suicidal, yes, but he's also a bit cold and unsociable and fights with his own emotions. Doesn't he have another side to him? He never really reveals one. At least not in this series. So far, I don't think even Vampire Knight: Guilty could bring to life this pathetic show, but I have high hopes for it...\\n\\n\r\nKaname~\\n\r\nDo I HAVE to talk about him? Auuugh... He's just your average super strong, top of the class, well-liked guy with a \"soft side\" for the protagonist, Yuki. It seems that Kaname and Zero's roles are equal-- to \"provide drama\" (yeah, great job at that.) and save Yuki all. the. freaking. time. Yes, he's a vampire, and all this other purely annoying stuff, so why does he like Yuki so much? She's cute? She's helpless? She's \"kind\"? I don't know, I'm hoping it will be revealed in Vampire Knight: Guilty, but I really don't know. Though, I'm sure it will, because how could an anime go on like this? He seems so obsessed with Yuki (and Yuki so obsessed with him) that it's just stupid. Why? I want answers, and I want them in the next season. If I don't get them, this show will be in my list of \"Worst 5 anime I have ever seen\". So, yes, if they reveal some of their secrets, I'll be... uh, happy. I guess. But for the most part, Kaname is a guy who doesn't make sense, and he's too much of a mystery. Mysteries, yes. But I can only take so much of \"I'm keeping everything to myself and acting cool yet obsessed with this girl for no reason\". Auuuugh. I just... no. Never mind. If I go further, I'll be ranting for the entire day, which I don't have time to do, so let's move on.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters~\\n\r\nWait, there were other characters? Wow! I hadn't even noticed! Oh, now that you say it, I do remember some of them. they were Kaname's followers, right? And they had such cliche personalities that I could die? Yeah, them! Right... If your brain is working properly, you should already know my opinion of the supporting cast by now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory~\\n\r\nIt seemed to be just slightly unique, and it had many places it could have gone, but it decided to stay as a stupid soap opera. It never really got deeper or darker than that, and the bad guy was sort of non existent until the very end. Weird. I like to be introduced to my antagonist at the very beginning, if possible. This was just one of the thousands of things that disappointed me in this show. Why everyone loves this is just something my brain can't grasp. I dunno, maybe your brain can't grasp why the heck I love Higurashi or Death Note, so let's leave it at this-- it's an opinion. The end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nAll in all, it was typical, yet with a darker sense of feeling. It really made me wonder how the heck the creator(s) did this. I mean, how do you take cliche art and give it a darker feeling to it? all in all, it was nice and enjoyable... but then the fight scenes came on. I mean, really? Just because it's a supposed romance doesn't mean the movement of the battles has to be completely awful. And trust me, ohhhh-- when mistakes in a frame are made, it was dang obvious. Most of the time in anime, I can tell when a mistake is made yet I can't always place it, but I know it's there. With Vampire Knight, that never happened once. I always knew where the mistakes were-- Yuki's face was too long. Her mouth was in the incorrect place. Zero's eye shape is wrong (and no, not because he's making a different expression, his eye shape is literally wrong). So many other things. So, when it is bad, it is very bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~\\n\r\nI enjoyed the opening, and... I actually have the ending on my iPod. I loved it. I have no idea why. There was something creepy yet mysterious and beautiful about it. It's not super special, but I liked it, and that's my opinion. The overall soundtrack for the movie was actually very nice, and I noticed *most* of it. It kind of helped enhance the mood, but most of the time it made it cheesier and more annoying. On its own, though, it's a fairly good soundtrack. The voice acting for the Japanese isn't necessarily anything super special-- each voice actor fits their role. And you know my opinion on the characters, so sometimes the voice acting was really annoying too. They sulk in the darkness of their rooms, softly calling out the name of the other character, their heart aching-- yeah, yeah. It gets annoying. If there's an English version, I didn't watch it, so...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Vampire Knight to me was very annoying and cliche in some of its parts. I hoped that it would go in a different direction since the overall setup of the plot was enthralling, but it went absolutely nowhere-- and I could only groan at the screen and slap my forehead. \\n\\n\r\nDepending on your taste in anime, you might or might not like this. I'd say, just to be safe, read the other reviews and build an opinion of your own before you watch this anime. Mostly, read as many reviews that give it a bad score, then read a few that give it an 8 or above. Decide what you want to do, and watch or don't watch this. If you've already seen it, then... good for you. Write your own review. If my review upset you in any way, please read the statement at the very top of this review. :P\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I just disliked this anime, and I'll stick with what I usually like. There were so many ways it could have gone, and so many twists it could have taken-- but it stayed annoying, predictable, and just... Ugh.",

It's quite obvious from the beginning that the love triangle is KanameYuukiZero, then why does Kaname present in YuukiZero scenes? In those scenes in the manga he wasn't even there at all O_o And there are more.\r\nThe story of course is great, but the anime ruined it totally. Zero behaves like a wimp, he's not like himself, and Yuuki also. Since when Yuuki has been takingZero's insults seriously? I won't tell spoilers but the anime exposes things very fast. Things that were clear at chapter 34 in the manga were hintend at episode 5 for example and in the opening and ending as well. The animation is so poor, and the art that is absolutely amazing in the manga is ruined in the anime. But I love the seyuus, they are awesome and as well the opening theme and the ending theme (not their clips, only the songs).\\n\\n\r\nI really hoped that the anime of my favorite manga would be awesome, but I guess I was mistaken.

Now, under the watchful eye of Chairman Cross, Yuki's foster father, both are students at the Cross Acedemy, where there's a Day Class for humans, and Night Class for vampires. There, Yuki, along with Kiryuu Zero, a childhood friend with a deep hatred for vampires, they attempt to prevent the secret of the vampires' identities from the student mass.\r\nSTORY\r\nI was sorely disappointed with the anime. Hino Matsuri's manga version had a great story going for it, only for theanime version to warp it really badly. I give the writers credit for trying, but one shouldn't change the story so drastically it affects the flow the mangaka created. It isn't bad for those that haven't read the manga, but for those that have, I highly doubt you'll like it.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nAgain, to be fair to the producers, the art ain't that bad, but comparing to the manga, Zero doesn't really have a dark, sad look that he does in the manga, and Yuki looks far too cute that she almost has a Kanon style look.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nI love the opening song. I really do. The sound thoughout the show really does give a good feeling too, and helps bring up the mood. But sound really doesn't help improve a storyline.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nYuki is the best character in the anime version, and the only reason I gave this a 7, because I actually liked her with comedy, which she lacks in the manga. However, the rest of the characters are either the same, or thrown out of character. Aidou, for example, wasn't really explored deeply, and he just does things that weren't explained in the anime, but was in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI wasn't bored out of my wits, but I wasn't exactly jumping with joy at every episode of new release like I would with some anime. I had hoped it would be as enchanting as the manga was, but by the end of episode 2, I found it lacking.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nI cannot say it is a bad anime in anyway possible, nor is it a good one either. I expected better of the company that did legends like Higurashi no Naku Koroni and Rurouni Kenshin, and good anime like Kyo Kara Maou and Marimite, but this was just a disappointment. If you liked the anime, I recommend the manga. Art's better, character's better, story's better, and of course, enjoyment's better.",

I could not stop watching it. \r\nWhen the anime did vary from the manga, I found it to be an enriching manner that made the story a little bit easier to understand. There were a few points in the manga when everything wasn't very clear, and the anime did a very good job of clarifying everything. And again, the music was perfectly chosen, with a well-chosen catchyopening them and a chilling and haunting ending theme. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are definately significant weak spots to this anime. The art was okay at best, with a few even laughably horrible animation points, and one of the most important scenes in the manga was rushed through towards the end, completely ruining the effect the manga had given. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as for the storyline of Vampire Knight in general, I have to give props to the writer for not trying to make obvious plot points some big surprise. When she knew the audience was going to find out something anyway, she embraced that fact and built upon it. \\n\\n\r\nI think this is something that should be watched and enjoyed for nothing else than the chilling sounds and high entertainment value. Just, if you've read the manga, don't expect the same beautiful work in this anime.",

            "content": "Throughout my time of watching anime I have discovered many series that I have made me sit back and think \"I'm glad anime became a main interest of mine\" . The list is long ranging from things like Steins;Gate to LotGH. \r\nThe problem however with anime is that it reminds me of Reddit and 4Chan. You begin looking at the funny things, the good things, the parts that get to you. Then you realise.....Beyond the funny memes you get the disgusting and idiotic parts that make you question why the internet should be allowed. At the bottom of the anime change is this. Vampire Knight.A show so bad if I had to have my entire memory erased of my last 21 years just to rid me of this monstrosity, I'd snap your hand off at the chance.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly the name of this show. \"Vampire Knight\" , I personally believe this should be changed for historical implication of the story. I believe it should be changed to Twilight's Ugly Sister and frankly I think that's a serious insult to the story of Twilight. It's light years ahead of this nonsense, least I could laugh at the stupid staring.\\n\\n\r\nSo \"story\" wise. Vampire Knight follows Yuki and her love triangle thing with Zero (the only somewhat acceptable character in the whole show) and Kaname (or as I would like him to be renamed \"Worse version of Edward Cullen\" ) . I could give you more background on the series such as the whole school system of day and night but frankily what's the point? Focus is on a terrible love story involving terrible characters. The love story gets worse and worse the more elements that are revealed and infact Im gonna give this show 1 bit of credit. The love story is even worse in the manga! Though this is due to length of the manga compared to the length of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is completely dull. What else is there to say? I can't recall one OST or one bit of sound that made the show better. Opening is terrible and so are the endings. Sound isn't a gigantic factor in anime for me, if the story is great I can deal with a poor soundtrack but its the little things that go a long way some time.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Deen and their art eh? What a great company. For every decent show like Higurashi they do they end up doing something as terrible as this. The art is dark and boring which I get in the concept of the story? But the stories terrible.....So lets throw in some random dance animations on screen make it more entertaining for myself.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment levels for this were definitely a 10. Totally right! Why wouldn't you enjoy a terrible story, with terrible music an terrible characters created by a terrible studio......... Apologies the British sarcasm within me just came over me then. I don't know why.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest this is avoided like you would avoid those messages from fake accounts asking you if you want to see them on cam. Unless you are into putting yourself in a detrimental position, then by all means watch this monstrosity. Oh and it even has a 2nd season. I'd like the weed they were smoking when that was green lit. Ha. Lit.\\n",

            "content": "Vampires in anime is nothing original and definitely nothing ground-breaking, in 2006, the idea of vampires had taken a back seat, Twilight didn't exist so there was a lack of screaming fangirls talking about what team they were, in fact, before there was Twilight....There was Vampire Knight.\r\nMany people, including me tend to think \"oh, vampires, meh\" and it takes a quality show such as Production IG's 'Blood: The Last Vampire' to turn heads and make people think otherwise, only to be kicked in the teeth by god awful vampire anime such as Fortune Arterial, Vampire Knight was a step in the right direction, but itsfar from perfect.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow the story of Yuki Cross, who as a child, was attacked by a Vampire and saved by Kaname Kuran, a pureblood vampire (he's basically top of the vampire hierarchy).\\n\r\nTime skip to high school because every anime seems to be set in bloody high school, she attends Cross Academy led by her father, Kaien who is determined to make Humans and Vampires live in harmony by having them attend the same school.\\n\r\nThe day class is for humans such as Yuki and her partner Zero as school guardian, and they are responsible for keeping the over-excited girls at bay when the night class strut their way into Cross Academy.\\n\r\nThe night class are (wait for it) THE VAMPIRES, and are, in my opinion the only set of characters that kept the entire series afloat during the more...dull time of the series. We have Kaname Kuran, Yuki's love interest and childhood hero and Aido Hanabusa, the comic relief antagonistic senior to Yuki who is presumably jealous of their relationship, the rest dont have much importance, but theyre all equally cool.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Deen took the reigns for this anime, well known for animating When They Cry (Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni) and, while they've never been at the peak of animation quality, thankfully for this show it isnt utter shit either, the animation is mediocre at best and certain action scenes felt off to me, other than that, its bearable to watch, so, as of right now, Vampire Knight is a fairly solid anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the good stuff, i'll quickly give my two cents on the opening and ending song before i get on to the 'dub or sub' argument, the opening song took me around 9 episodes to get used to, and on occasion i actually skipped it as there is absolutely nothing noteworthy on it, the song actually starts before the characters in the preview of the episodes have finished speaking leading to a clusterf**k of different voices for a few seconds. The ending song titled 'Still Doll' was more compelling, it didnt try to animate too much and it left a large sense of insecurity on me after it had finished, the voice of the singer Kanon Wakeshima was borderline perfect and the last few frames was very creepy.\\n\r\nDub or sub? Sub. I havent even watched it in japanese just yet, but the dub felt like it was just slapped on, the dialogue was poor for reasons i'll get onto in a moment, and i honestly think the dub is the primary reason i never enjoyed the show as much as i should have.\\n\r\nNow its no spoiler to say that Zero's parents are dead as its explained pretty much right after he is introduced, their death is his motivation to keep fighting and the source of his hatred for vampires, Yuki is meant to be his bestfriend, just keep that in mind for the quote i'm about to give you...\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"You think she's the vampire that brutally murdered your entire family?\"\\n\\n\r\nWTF? Yes, all the characters that mention Zero's parents to Zero himself seem to love reminding him of how the series' antagonist butchered his parents, which made me feel that either the characters were trying to make Zero cry or that they needed to remind him for the sake of having something to say.\\n\r\nThe voice actors do an outright poor job of expressing the feelings between the characters that the japanese dub apparently has which causes the whole romance/tragedy side of the show to be completely laughable, i honestly watched death scenes of the characters multiple times thinking \"Wait, was i supposed to care?\"\\n\r\nThe dub has successfully made it onto a list of english dubs i flatout REFUSE to listen to ever again in my life, and i can count the amount of such dubs on one hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, to some extent make the rest of the show bearable, not a single character that matters in the story is a cliche stereotype of any anime archetype, and for that i can applaud the idea, however thanks to the dub, the characters came off as plain with no character growth whatsoever and when the story gets 'serious' in the final 4 episodes, i felt myself struggling to even finish it, taking 30 minute breaks between episodes to cope with the inevitable cliffhanger ending.\\n\\n\r\nOh, yes, normally i dont like talking about a show's ending to the point where i give it a whole section in the review, but in my belief the ending is what makes the show solid, and in this case...it wasnt, it ends on a god-awful cliffhanger which, if you were struggling to finish the first 13 episodes like i did, you are now forced to watch 13 MORE to get the full effect of the story, admittedly, however, the story is incredibly strong, making no room for your typical beach episodes or filler bullshit, everything is completely necessary and the plot twists are masterfully executed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show is by no means for everyone, and if you want a vampire anime i would rather recommend Blood: The Last Vampire or Trinity Blood over this, but if you must, watch it, it ain't half bad, i have alot to say about it (mostly negative) but honestly i think its because i havent watched the japanese dub or even the second season, so my final opinions on the series as a whole is likely to change, but for now, the first season was a tad messy, leaving all of the explanations for the second season in typical Studio Deen fashion.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 6/10 and the overall recommendation to stream it if you have absolutely nothing else to watch",

            "content": "In summary, Vampire Knight is the anime offspring of Ouran High School Host Club meets Twilight. I didn't have high hopes for this anime and was pleasantly surprised at the strength of character development and some plot twists. \r\nCross Academy is like 2 schools rolled into one. The normal day class students are all intrigued and have terrific crushes on members of the Night Class who look like Movie Stars. Of course they day class is completely unaware that the Night Class are vampires, and an uneasy peace is kept by 2 prefects (Yuki and Zero), obeying the Headmaster's ideals of \"let's all just getalong\".\\n\\n\r\nThe night class looks like Ouran High School Host Club come to life. Every one of the men is handsome *sigh*, with the handsomest being Clan Kaname, the Pureblood Noble. He saved Yuki when she was a child, but Yuki's fellow prefect Zero hates him because he is a vampire.\\n\\n\r\nTherein is the crux of the love triangle! The plot twisted and turned enough to keep me interested. There was a lot of angst, staring and brooding. Parts of it were downright sexy. Even I who hate the sight of blood found myself intensely interested in some of the ... food scenes. \\n\\n\r\nArt was same as Ouran style, sound was just ok. Although the OP was very well done the rest of the soundtrack was very nondescript.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was a little unexpected (a cop out) or I would have scored it higher. However thanks to 1 scene of fanservice for females the overall score ended up as an 7. At the end of it, the series didn't feel complete hence the 7 overall score. Good premise, lots of promise, could have been better executed. At the very least though, it was good enough to make me want to watch the sequel (just to find out what happens).",

            "content": "The setting for this anime is maybe not an original one, VampirexMortal. But little parts of the storyline had me intrigued, and on the advice of a friend, I sat down to watch it.\r\nAs I said, little additions and quirks of the storyline (such as Yuuki being saved by a vampire as a young girl, Zero's *affliction* -I'll call it that so there are no spoilers- and vampires being a night class while mortals are a day class of a boarding school.) made me enjoy certain parts of this story.\r\nThe first few episodes had me thoroughly enjoying it, the art a major bonus to thestory. Comedy I wasn't expecting filled the first few episodes, and the music had me humming along.\\n\\n\r\nThen, it all began to go downhill. Trying to suddenly adapt into a very dark, very sombre tale from what started out as maybe a black comedy had the whole story floundering. The story began to be brushed as what seemed to be filler episodes took up minute after minute. The true story and plot is only set into motion around episode 9. Leaving 4 episodes to give you a very unsatisfying and lukewarm ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another part of this anime which annoy me. Kaname is the most pretentious (I'm sorry to say), stuck up, arrogant and very, very cunning and sly. Not really the qualities you expect in a shoujo - do you? And while I'll admit it's refreshing, it's still not right.\\n\r\nYuuki is...utterly pathetic. One thing that puts me right off certain animes or mangas is weak female protagonists. And Yuuki is one of the worst. I'd like to hope it's because the mangaka needed filler chapters. Yuuki, never learning from her mistakes, constantly walking into trouble and always ends up being rescued by either Zero or Kaname.\\n\r\nThis does nothing to prevent the whole show falling into a downward spiral as it tries to explain every filler episode with chilling precision. Fair enough, but why not just call it what it is - an episode in which the base plot does not progress, and a chance to see Yuuki saved by some hot guy?\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was this anime's saving grace-the only reason I rated this anime as high as I did, for me, as I went completely off this anime the minute Yuuki batted her eyelashes and was saved by Kaname. If you must watch this show - the side characters are actually the most interesting, and most comedic.",

            "content": "Initially, I wanted to rate this review 9/10 overall because I'm secretly (well, not so secret anymore) in love with one of the characters inside *fan girl moment* ZERO *blush* \r\nZero is just too hot for an anime character, don't you think so? \r\n*End of fan girl moment* \r\nBack to the topic,\r\nBasically, this story is about vampires, vampires and vampires as you would predict from the title. Honestly, I didn't plan on even watching this anime even though I heard great reviews about it and all because of the word \"Vampire\". Ever since Twilight came out, vampire books and movies have been a hit andI personally find it overrated so I didn't even bother to look up for reviews about it.\\n\\n\r\nUntil...one day, I you-tube hopped and spotted Vampire Knight and read the comments...\\n\\n\r\nThe one that attracted me the most -> \"OMGGGGG the guys in vampire knight are soooooooooooooo hot\"\\n\\n\r\nSince it's hard for me to get obsessed over an anime character (Okay, to be honest, it's quite easy, they just have to look pretty and good looking and I'm hooked but then, I'm being quite biased ain't I?) I went onto review sites and look up for the characters and dayum! One of the main characters attracted me just like that so I decided to give this series a try.\\n\\n\r\nI will be honest though - if the first episode doesn't get me hooked onto it, I will by no means watch a second episode - unless, I'm TOO bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode did get me hooked because it was so deep and thrilling in a fun way ;)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought that the story was really interesting and the plot gets deeper as you dived more into the series. No filler episodes and that makes me really happy as they concentrated on the story more.\\n\\n\r\nYou should wiki the story to know more about the Purebloods and the vampire families - that is really interesting. I find it really fascinating that Purebloods have so much power compared to the normal vampires and Level E and so on...\\n\\n\r\nI was really afraid the story is gonna be 24/7 scary and vampire-y (as in biting and licking and stuff) but thank goodness, there were funny moments and chibi-fied faces as well. I'm surprised Kaname didn't have a chibi-face of himself!\\n\\n\r\nI guess he's too cool for it B)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing much to rave about but it's pleasant to my eyes. At first, I get so annoyed with the female protagonist because her eyes are SO huge that it's crazy! I mean, I know that anime girls usually have huge eyes but her eyes are so huge that they look like they're gonna suck me in anytime - seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe male leads are of course - stunning and very, very hot. I have no objections of the character's art except for Yuuki's eyes. Other than that, the other characters looked pleasantly beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe background was decent - I mostly see trees and lots of trees but they suit the mood just right because half of the series, the background plays quite a role because they were very dark and moody just like the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED songs were alright although I find the ED song REEEEALLY creepy that I usually skip it most of the time. I get scared easily and hey, red eyes and broken mirrors? Nuh-uh. I'm out.\\n\\n\r\nBut what really impressed me was the voices of the characters. It suited them just right! I love Zero's tortured voice (heheh it's sexy) and Kaname's \"serious and mysterious\" voice as well. I particularly liked the Chairman's voice as well. He can sound so serious at times...and then......HAPPY at other times.\\n\\n\r\nEpic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter character character. I really love the characters in these series. Sure, they are all the same - love triangle, beautiful people T_T and all but what I'm talking about is the character itself - the personality.\\n\\n\r\nI personally find Yuuki's character very weak and a little bit annoying because she doesn't do anything much and doesn't help much either other than giving her blood for Zero to drink. One good point about her: She's cute? And she's very optimistic. \\n\\n\r\nKaname's character is very, very interesting. You never know what he's up to...and you wonder - is he a good guy or a bad guy? It's like he's never both of them or he could be both of them...\\n\\n\r\nHe just leaves you confused.\\n\\n\r\nZero's character - dude, could you blame him if he wants to kill himself? I'm sick of people saying Zero's character is so weak and lame and all but can you actually imagine yourself in Zero's situation? Both parents killed by a vampire and yet, he turns into a vampire himself and is unable to control his thirst? Tell me, if you're like that - will you still find yourself weak? \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are really interesting as well. I loved it when slowly by slowly, their pasts are being depict to the viewers and it leaves us wanting more!\\n\\n\r\nAidou is one of the supporting characters that impressed me. He can be so friendly and flirty yet...mean. Watch it to know what I mean :P\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSome scenes were a bit draggy but they're not as draggy as Vampire Knight Guilty's, personally I find VKG verrrrrry slow but I shall save this review for later. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode leaves you a cliffhanger and makes you crave for more! An episode without a cliffhanger basically tells you - \"*Yawn* I shall watch this some other day...\" \\n\\n\r\nI know the director was trying to picture Yuuki's thoughts but they were really too much that I can predict what she's gonna say even before she goes into her \"I'm scared of Vampires\" mood...it's always...the same.\\n\\n\r\nBut all I can say is, it's interesting yet at times, it can be draggy and annoying. The plot is what keeps me glued onto the laptop screen. Episode by episode, they slowly tells us about the relationship between the vampires and the vampire hunters and of course, Yuuki's past..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe 8 is for the lovely characters and the really interesting story and of course the enjoyment. The -2 - some scenes were draggy and put on repeat but other than that, you're gonna enjoy this movie if you're up for a little romance and mystery. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It could've been much better if the plot progressed quicker instead of having the same subject for many episodes in a row and also trying to explain things better and not leaving things in a open.\r\nArt (3/10)\r\nAbsolutely disliked it. The only feature that could make the character noticeable were the different hair colors of each character, otherwise, distinguishing them and remembering them would be nearly impossible.\r\nSound (2/10)\r\nThis is merely my opinion but I hated the openings, endings and most of the background sound.\r\nCharacter (5/10)\r\nSome characters were boring, especially Yuki since shedidn't do anything special. Zero was kinda nice and Kaname too but that's only because I liked their style and way to do stuff.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10)\u00b4\\n\r\nNothing to add, just boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the worst anime I ever watched. Only finished watching it because I thought something would happen further but it was a false hope. The sequel is much better since it reveals all the secrets and things we DIDN'T KNOW and WANTED TO KNOW in this season. A bunch of more action and suspense and less drama could've made this a lot better.",

The art is quite decent. Its actually pretty well done. The eyes are quite big though, especially on Yuuki. The face expressions when somebody's getting bitten by a vamp was pretty cool as well. reading ze' manga and watching ze' anime, I have noticed that the characters have LONG necks! Its a bit too long! =3=\r\nSTORY: Its not the best, sadly.VK has its ups and downs during the story. And, I was expecting lots of action because they put vamps withhumans together so, I wanna see some blood on da' floor. PS: I think in some parts of VK, Matsuri Hino trys to put in some funny parts but.. It doesnt seem to work..\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: I hate it when vamps are suppose to act \"distant\" or \"cool\". It makes me..furious! Seriously, Im getting tired of that.. The only person I seem to aprove of would be Ichijou Takuma. But, he's not exactly the best.. I LOVE THE HEADMASTER! He's hyper, giddy..and etc! He's the best, he PWNS. Kaname protects a bit tooooooooo much.. Zero acts like he's PMS-ing. Yuuki is just.. eh. Aidou is too vain within himself.. I can go alll day.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: By reading this review, you can tell that Im VERY disapointed. Matsuri Hino's MeruPeri (something like that) is a bit more enjoy-a-ble.",

            "content": "Vampire knight was a welcome change for me in terms of the darker tone of the show, compared to the usual reverse harem, soujo anime. I loved the fact it was not the typical sweet and innocent cliche anime, it had at least a little more depth to it. \r\nI say a 'little' because to be honest it still is far from being a well, rounded, engaging, action packed and thought-provoking anime. It still is very much targeted at teenage girls with a thirst for 'twilighty' things.. \r\nThe story was not a bad one, compared with many other animes of a similar genre, as therewas the element of horror and mystery. The characters were fairly interesting. Kaname was my favorite, and Zero being a troubled soul also had his quirks and complexities. Sad to say our protagonist was rather weak and oh-so-obliging. I would be the first to say I hate an overly loud, domineering and arrogant protagonist, but seriously, Yuuki takes the feminist cause back about a decade. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have been watching Earl and the Fairy, Haku\u014dki, Special A etc, I think you would enjoy a similar feel but change of scenery. Other than that i believe you would find Vampire Knight rather average and perhaps best to be avoided..\\n",

Check.\r\nAre there fight scenes with guns, handheld weapons, or magical powers?\r\nD. All of the above. Check.\r\nIs there a mid-series break to make one season like two?\r\nYes, check.\r\nIs there an obligatory fan service episode at a pool/hot spring/beachso all the female characters can be seen in swimwear? \\n\r\nNo.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, while it isn't ENTIRELY cliches and been there, done that. \"Vampire Knight\" just fails to leave an impression or impact on a viewer. The story is fairly generic but leaves you curious enough to proceed to it's conclusion in \"Vampire Knight: Guilty\", the art is decent and at times good, the music very fitting and reminds me of \"Castlevania: SOTN\". The Sub vs. Dub battle goes to the Sub. I have to give props to Mamoru Miyano for doing a great job in his duel roles.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like this show and while there were some moments when I thought it was gonna take that big step forward and show me something, it ended up being just a tease.

            "content": "Story 7/10\r\nThe story was definitely interesting and entertaining, but it could have been executed better. During whole 13 episodes, they didn't fully explain what exactly are the differences between Pure-blooded Vampires - Aristocrat Vampires - Normal Vampires and Level E Vampires. Of course, basic knowledge was given, but I feel like they could have gone into more details. Moreover, one of the things in my opinion this show lacked was a good antagonist. The antagonist appears only at the end of the series, so until that moment you are confused so who's the bad guy? Is it Vampires or not... Nonetheless,  it was obviousthat all 3 main characters have had rather harsh past. However, only Zero's (one of the MC) past was explained further. Even though, there's still another season for VK, I am disappointed that 1st season wasn't used to introduce the characters so that I could get more into the story. On the other hand, this made the show mysterious and less predictable as you don't know what kind of persons they actually are (exception main heroine).\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nNothing special, but it wasn't bad either. The art in my opinion was decent and did have some unique traits. Eyes of Yuuki was really different from what I am used to see and I couldn't say I actually liked... but everything else was appealing. The Vampires as expected were showed as more beautiful than humans, however I wasn't really fond of the bishounen looks.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nNow that was incredible soundtrack. Both opening and ending songs were so good that gave me chills while listening to them. Moreover, soundtracks fit very well with the rather dark mood of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nMy feelings towards the characters constantly kept changing. Sometimes they were very appealing. I loved to see how they have some inner thoughts and struggle to reach the answer they are looking for. All 3 MC's have a deep past, but none of them really feel like sharing the pain with anyone. And this is where comes the annoying/irritating part. The heroine Yuuki crosses the line, she goes too much into Zero's private life. Of course, that's rather normal for a protagonist, but that's what disappoints me the most - making a very typical heroine who always goes after the person who has some problems and ends up in some kind of trouble and getting saved by either Zero or the Pure-blooded Vampire Kaname. However, ignoring this go after-get into trouble-be saved part, the characters are very different from each other and that's what makes the story better. The ending gave me a hope that 2nd season will answer many questions about the characters and show more development of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nEven though, I wasn't really complimenting the show. I can honestly say it was still very enjoyable. The soundtrack makes up for many minor issues I have with this anime. Furthermore, I love to see when characters have some deep inner thoughts and are struggling to find the answer they are looking for. So the only real problem I have with VK is that Yuuki barely changed through whole series and was too much of a typical heroine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI think it's a good rate for this anime. The lack of information about Vampires and MC's history + lack of character development (heroine) were the negative aspects. The OST was definitely the best part of the anime. I believe this a perfect show for teenage girls due to bishounen looks of Vampires, but as for the guys it's nothing that spectacular. Although, it is definitely interesting and worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading :)",

I'm 18 years old and I loved this anime.\r\n  I'm very into romance with animes, and I always HAVE to have at least one or two kisses. Although Vampire Knight didn't really have one, I still loved it. It provided the right amount of romance, even if there wasn't much kissing.\r\nI like how it has different elements to it, there's some thriller scenes, romance, comedy and some action. I would have liked more action, but apart from that it wasperfect for me.\\n\\n\r\n  The negatives? Like I said, lack of action, apart from that I can't really think of much else.\\n\\n\r\n  The soundtrack was great, it made my heart pound and I loved that. I was constantly singing the theme music for weeks after watching.\\n\\n\r\n  The art was better then average I'd say, sometimes Kaname could end up looking a bit odd, but apart from that it was nicely done.\\n\\n\r\n  I gave it a 9, but it would have definitely gotten a 10 if there was more fighting.\\n\\n\r\n  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did :)",

            "content": "Vampire knight is an anime about vampires where a school exists to try and promote a peaceful coexistence between humans and vampires a.k.a. cross academy. It centers around the lives of zero and yuuki who both have had their lives affected by vampires in their past and have been in the care of the chairman of the academy since their encounters with vampires.\r\nThe story is quite interesting and perhaps slightly different from your usual vampire anime. It is more of a highschool drama. And i must emphasize the word \"drama\" here because that is the main genre that this anime would fall under. There isa lot of it throughout the anime. The anime also contains hints of romance though not very deep or romantic, you have a classical love triangle as well. In some ways the story can be said to be an action anime though there is not much serious fighting, more emphasis is placed on the characters' encounters and reactions, so violence is kept to the minimal. I found it a bit boring as a result, some say the manga had more action. However, unlike some of the other vampire animes, this one can be said to be more intricate and diverse in that there are more specifications and ideas about vampires as depicted by the writer. In my opinion, the anime is a an ok start to a longer series so hopefully the second season will be better. This anime can be a bit dark, but i think it has some meaning in it thatnks to this.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not bad, typical shuojo style of drawing characters with big eyes and stuff. But i did not find any exceptional quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound again is nothing special though i took a liking to both the opening and closing songs which i thought were quite suited to this kind of dramati anime. However, there were no insert songs that brought out the atmosphere better.\\n\\n\r\n The main characters were deep but besides that most of the other characters have not a big part in this anime. Though i found Kananame a very dark character, this story is quite dark anyway. Had there been more development of the side characters as well i think the story would be more complete.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the humourous scenes inserted in the anime which apparently is not as frequent in the manga. I think that the story can be quite gripping at the start because you are drawn straight into the story where the events are occuring quite fast. This helps to draw the attention of the watcher so if you do watch this anime you will probabbly be addicted to it becuase of all the suspense that ends each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i think the anime is only average, perhaps due to length of the series. The ending of the anime is open but there will be a second series so that's ok(just a warning), but i have seen better as short as this one. Also those who don't like animes that are quite dark i suggest you don't watch this because it contains some dark themes. If this series was longer it would have been better, but since there is a second season we will see.",

            "content": "Vampire Knight I feel like is one of those animes that some people will love and some people will hate on. I personally loved watching Vampire Knight. The actual aspects of the anime such as the story and characters may not be up to par with other animes but I definitley did enjoy watching it.\r\n--STORY--\r\nThe story in Vampire Knight probably got a bit repetitive as the anime went on. There were a few times that something new and interesting got brought into the story but that was short lived as something occured to stop that extra story to bring the anime back to the regular,reptitive storyline it had going. Even with these reptitive story line I still enjoyed it. I actually loved it and I cannot really explain why. But, I will say the story was not very productive throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\n--ART--\\n\r\nThe art style in this anime was really pretty and some of the characters were GORGOUS! Zero is my absolute favourite, he just always looked AMAZING! Kaname was also very good looking and Yuki was very cute. The brightness in the eye's of vampires and the overall art style was really nice and easy to look at and I thought the constant dark colours of the anime also really worked.\\n\\n\r\n--SOUND--\\n\r\nSound was something I didn't really pay attention to whilst watching Vampire Knight but from what I did the sound was fine. That's all I can really say on that. Although I can say that I really liked the voice acting for each of the characters and Kaname's voice was very calming in the way he always spoke so calmly and seemed like every word was a word of understanding.\\n\\n\r\n--CHARACTER--\\n\r\nSo some of the characters in Vampire Knight were great (not naming any names...ZERO) and then there were some that seemed generic and boring. I was hoping that Yuki (main female heroine) would be more of a badass then always having Zero and Kaname or someone there to help her. She has a cool weapon that she never uses. Zero was a great character and I could go on for hours about him so I am just going to stop there and Kaname seemed to get more mysterious and interesting as the season went on. I will be very interested to see how he turns out in the next season. All the other charcters seemed pretty generic with no specifically interesting qualities though.\\n\\n\r\n--ENJOYMENT--\\n\r\nAs I have already said, I really enojoyed Vampire Knight. Even if it is not counted as one of the best crafted anime out there, if I enjoyed then that's what matters. \\n\\n\r\n--FINAL THOUGHTS--\\n\r\nVampire Knight is a bit of your cheesy, romance, action but not really, vampire anime. It may have not had the best story or characters but it was extremly enjoyable for myself to watch and I would recommended it to most people, probably to be met with a judgy look but that's ok because Zero. :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nZero is my bae <3",

I can see how people could enjoy it and I tried so hard to enjoy this, but it was just kind of meh.\r\nStory: 5/10 - There was story there, but it felt generically shoujo with the character development you would expect from a generic shonen anime. It wasn't unlikable, but it could have been much better.\r\nArt: I honestly don't care about the art. If a toddler drew it in crayon and it still had a good story, then count me in.\r\nSound: 5/10  nothing memorable. The opening wasn't anything too amazing. Not bad, but not good.\r\nCharacter: 5/10 They hadsuch a good opportunity for characters here, but they ended up just being kind of stiff. generic girl gets in trouble and gets rescued. Sad vampire hates life and wants to die, and worst of all the other vampires at the school had watered down personalities except for the main guy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10 - I didn't hate it, and I didn't like it. I would recommend it though because it might be something someone else would like. It had redeeming qualities that just didn't appeal to me. I personally did not enjoy it too much but I would still recommend giving it a watch.\\n\\n\r\nBONUS: Watchability - This title was surprisingly tame as far as content goes. sure there is some blood and fighting but nothing too graphic. there was not much fanservice either that I remember and the language was also kept to a minimum.",

I didn't expect it to be this good, or that I would get swept into an endless bliss every time I open the book. \r\nThough I've purchased every volume out so far I've taken to reading it online. It may not be 100% correct but it's close enough for me. The story is absolutely amazing and I've read the entire thing over and over again and I still cannot get enough of it. \r\nAs for the anime, when I heard they were coming out with an actual visual for the mangaI was so overjoyed. Watching it with subtitles may not be the greatest by just to see the characters I fell in love with on pages become a visual with voices and movement is one of the best things I could ever ask for. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love vampires or even if you don't and just love really thrilling romance and fantasy manga or anime, then this is the perfect story for you. If you're not captured after the first few chapters I can assure you it won't be long afterwards. This wonderfully written vampire, love triangle, suspense manga is enough to grab anyone's attention. \\n\\n\r\nYou've got to believe me, just check it out. This is by far the best manga/anime I've ever seen or read. I hope you'll all love it as much as I do.",

            "content": "Cross Academy is a school with a difference: in a unique and experimental setup designed by the headmaster, it has a Day Class consisting of ordinary humans and a Night Class filled with vampires. Yuki Cross and her friend Zero Kiryu are school prefects whose job it is to make sure the secret of the Night Class is always safe; they patrol the school grounds at night and supervise the switchover of classes at dawn and dusk to prevent any 'accidents' from happening. While Zero is suspicious of vampires and hates the idea of sharing the same space as them, Yuki admires the Night Classfor their beauty and sophistication; she is especially intrigued by their charming leader, Kaname, because he once saved her life. However, as Yuki quickly learns, not all vampires are amiable like the Night Class, and as terrible events unfold, Yuki must ask herself whether in a world where vampires are the hunters and humans are the prey, peaceful coexistence can really be achieved.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\r\nOn the face of it, Vampire Knight appears to be just another hackneyed shoujo series designed to cater to sexually frustrated fangirls. Firstly, you have the exquisite beauty of the entire male cast; not to mention the relentless \u2018sucking' and \u2018biting' and \u2018sinking' of teeth into soft, yielding flesh; and finally, the fact that the characters spend more time nuzzling each other's necks in hopeless abandon than they do talking sensibly about their problems.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, though, Vampire Knight will amuse male and female fans alike because, at its core, it provides an original plotline that's consistently good from start to finish. At its best, Vampire Knight teases out the various threads of its central mystery whilst never actually giving anything away. By this I mean the dynamic relationship between super-vampire, Kaname Kuran, and brave-but-vulnerable Yuki Cross. Amongst other things, Kaname commands a loyal gang of vampires and can shatter glass with nothing but a thought - why he would go out of his way to protect a human girl for no apparent reason is a question that instantly captures the imagination. Following that, Zero Kiryuu's tragic subplot provides extra emotional depth as well as an action-packed glimpse into the world of vampires, hunters, and humans.\\n\\n\r\nAt only thirteen episodes, the only real flaw in the narrative is a general lack of complexity; although, with at least another season to go, there is more than enough scope for the dilemmas to get messier.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (7/10)\\n\r\nAs a series of still images, Vampire Knight admittedly looks good enough to bite; rich colour tones, clean lines, and some of the best-looking bishounen this side of Ouran High School Host Club combine for a wholly sensual experience. Unfortunately, the characters have to move around (sometimes, they even have to fight), which only makes Vampire Knight's technical faults all the more obvious - I haven't seen such mediocre action sequences since... well, for a very long time. Luckily, these are few and far between and don't detract from the overall pleasant animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nI find the opening theme fun and catchy but, as a single, also rather average; instead I'd recommend the ending theme, \u2018Still Doll', a haunting piece with truly sumptuous vocals. Everything in between is about as memorable as last week's breakfast.\\n\\n\r\nFar more impressive is the voice acting, which is not just suitable at all times, but very, very good; the convincing performances are probably the main reason why the script doesn't come across as melodramatic as it should.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\r\nApart from the three protagonists, Vampire Knight is populated with a one-dimensional cast. However, taking into account that the vast majority are either unimportant or just make cameo appearances which doesn't require much depth, this isn't too big a problem. That said, even the central characters remain rather static across thirteen episodes, with only Zero displaying any noticeable changes in personality. What keeps them interesting despite this is that they are at heart entertaining stereotypes with little personal twists.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Cross is the generic plucky lead who spends all her time confused about what's going on and generally being protected; even though she is portrayed as somewhat kick-arse in the beginning, this isn't a trait that's followed through in her development. On the other hand, she's an easy character to get attached to because of her giving nature and adorable comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nKaname Kuran, the most powerful vampire in town, also comes with a magnetic \u2018wan' smile and a stunning arsenal of catalogue poses (like Family Guy's Captain Kirk, I don't think he holds the same position twice in the entire series). In all honesty, considering his sophistication and understated power, he's quite the cool cat - naturally, his main appeal is that nobody can figure out what exactly he wants i.e. why he's at Cross Academy looking out for Yuki despite obviously having better things to do.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Zero Kiryuu is a wishy-washy Dante (Devil May Cry) with an attitude problem; when he's not moping about with his shirt conspicuously undone, he's venting some emo rage down an angled camera. He's completely uninteresting for the first couple of episodes; however, once his subplot kicks in and his personal conflicts come to light, he becomes immediately likeable in that anti-hero way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nWith considerable emphasis upon pinning girls against walls and sucking their erogenous zones in every episode, Vampire Knight is easily a fangirl's dream anime; however, the quality of the storytelling should not be underestimated by anyone else for that matter. Any fan looking for a strong fantasy drama with an original take on vampires and a beautiful animation style should put this somewhere at the top of their list.",

            "content": "I have been meaning to write review for this,but im not sure if its needed :p\r\nbut here it goes. This review doesnt have any manga prespective as i have not yet read it. \r\nTo start this story has a great concept and spin on the age old story of vampires. It is intresting that the creators came up w/ 3 diff levels of vampires which bascially break down into Noble vampire::Reg. vampires::Level E vampires. Essentially takes many diff historical types\r\nof vamps and gives them a backstory in why they are that way. The Main story takes place at a school w/ a day class[humans] nightclass[vamps] but \\n\r\nday class doesnt know that the night class is in fact vampires. The &quot;perfects&quot; and main characters yuuki and Zero protect that secrect. Although its difficult  when all the vamps are hotties and all the girls in the school are constantly after them ;which helps for some comedic breaks. The school is used as a way to show the world that vamps and humans can coexsist as long as vampire take these fake blood tablets to substitue real blood..this is where my negetives come in. \\n\r\nNegitives are this. While its a nice concept of tablets are nice.. it is evident its not feasable vamp wise. heres an analogy: lets say someone tells\\n\r\nyou --i want you to agree to take these food pills/appitite supressients instead of eating food for good of coexisting w/ the world. Oh see that table\\n\r\nfull of hamburgers.. you're not allowed to eat them! Thats a no no!--\\n\r\nEventually we're all going for those burgers! xD That part of the story was kinda just didnt work for me..i mean they dont have a blood bank ..a donation center something! :p Some situations were also very conveinant but\\n\r\nmeh..i can deal with that\\n\r\nArt was great. loved the style and character designs. Comic relief scenes were just that and cute. but the genral dark mood was great. \\n\r\nMany bishonen and bishoujo so im sure many ..including myself are happy\\n\r\nw/ that. i know there some dispute of manga vs anime style but i think they\\n\r\nlooks great. i like the way the eyes are drawn. \\n\r\nMusic matches the mood nicelyduring eps. i cant say i liked the intro too much,but the ending theme Still Doll is one of my fav songs now ^.^\\n\r\nCharacters  are well developed and still mysterious which i love. \\n\r\nthings are explained but all when it is apporiate. sometimes it can be a bit predictable [except for kaname] The only charac. that loses cool points with me the main girl of our story, yuuki. at first i thought shes pretty intresting,but they turned her into typical stupid anime girl who makes the worst desions..or make silly assumptions xP. very frustrating. i cant im rooting for zeroxyuuki be/c yuuki is well lame. but im rooting for Zero in a way. \\n\r\n      Overall this is a great watch and i cant wait the next season. sometimes\\n\r\nit seems the story might be lacking but i hoping for more in the next season. \\n\r\nif you love vampire stories, with some nice fansevice once n while and intresting story..be sure to give this a try yoosh!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Here are my thoughts of this anime after watching 12 episodes of it.\r\nThe story is pretty much solid. Vampire Knight revolves around  its three main characters named Cross Yuuki, Kuran Kaname and Kiryuu Zero. Vampire Knight is just like your usual generic vampire novel delivered in a more romantic way.  While watching this anime, the viewers perspective on whom Cross Yuuki ( a girl who's saved by Kuran Kaname amidst of a vampire attack) should end up with is somewhat divided and is mostly considered by its fans as a love triangle between the three. The animation, as I have expected (since StudioDeen, a well known crappy animation studio made the animation for this one)  is very poor.  The characters were drawn in a noticeable deformed way, the battle sequences were poor and lacks 3D perspective. However the background animation is passable , the environment is decipted very well. The sound of this anime gives off the expected Gothic feelling to it. From the romantic violin scores and up  to the mysterious gothic Ending theme. The seiyuus of this popular adaptation has some of the best line up ever. Mamoru Miyano and Horie Yui's performance is stunning.  This is definitely worth watching for if you're a fan of these two popular seiyuus. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the story but hated the animation (as you can tell by now) Even though I haven't seen the manga yet, I'd say that the plot of this anime is at top notch, however Studio Deen caused the anime version of this one-of-a-kind masterpiece to meet its downfall. The second season of this anime will come out soon and how I wish to all of everything that is holy to redeem this anime's reputation. I hope that the animation would be okay for the second season and if not, knowing the anime version of Vampire Knight is an epic fail.",

Wasnt as bad as i remembered i remembered a horrible vampire drama that resembels the horror that is twighlight shudder but this one was ok. I will admit the plot kinda goes a little over board the characters support it. I love some characters but i hated others like how i thought zero was a respectable character with a tragic backstory who i felt for and then there is our leading lady i mean my god is she bland i mean wheat toast bland but i dont see how people can think she is like bella. Here is thereason for one yuuki actualy fights kinda and she has a backstory that i liked kinda but the big difference is she has a heart unlike that she witch bella. But lets continue the opening song is fine but the ending is badass i love it the artwork is passible and the one of the few major flaws is the villians my god were they bad i mean the leader of the night dormatory killed her in seconds she must of been no threat if he could defeat her so why all this buildup. So those are my major problems so overall not as bad as i remembered. Hmm maybe that means the twilight movies are not that bad as i remembered im gonna go check. 2 hours later oh my god i was wrong i misjudged the twighlight films because THEY ARE WORSE THAN I REMEMBERED I HATE THESE MOVIES AND i dont mind this show well see ya",

Otherwise, I really liked was perhaps a bit differently than in the manga, but good.\r\nI liked the characters, I like their personality.\r\nIt was not much on the individual character learn, but it makes it even more exciting.\r\nWhat else to say is that the Opening and Ending, really really really good.

This anime is filled to the brim with bizarre, nonsense soap opera twists and paper thin middle-school-oc characters. \r\nIt's hard to rate because it is, indisputably, a bad show. The plot only makes sense if you actively try not to think about it. It cares way more about its edgy xx~*darkly sexy*~xx aesthetic than anything else. The main character switches between overpowered mega badass and helpless child so fast you'll get whiplash; everyone else can be summed up in about fivewords each. But it's also insanely fun to watch. You'll be teleported back to a time when people were still using words like Japanimation and Animanga and we all thought calling people \"baka\" and owning a katana made them the koolest kid in school.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said I feel bad for people who actually watched it during that time. Abuse is romanticized like crazy and I know it definitely messed some people up.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary: If you're looking for an emotionally involving show with complex characters run away, run far away. If you're looking for something to remind you how hilariously cringy and terrible everything was in the 2000s then jump right in.",

He was the only character I actually kind of cared what happened to.\r\nYuki just seemed like an overly-obsessed fangirl, and both she and Kaname kind of screwed Zero over later on in the series.\r\nI really couldn't stand Kaname, either. He was justa flat character who popped up at random moments to show his apparent displeasure at what was happening at any given time; it was just irritating, and for most of the characters, no growth occurred whatsoever. Yuki just got more annoying, but I'm not sure if that counts as development or not.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I had with Kaname, was the fact that the author seemed to have been trying to make him all mysterious, when in actuality, Kaname was merely some guy who the main character happened to be obsessed with for seemingly no reason. Even when they explained his backstory, it was quite under-developed. Kaname was treated like an important character, but as I previously stated, he never really showed up until it became oddly \"convenient\" to the story; he kind of just showed up whenever, and when he did, it was usually to show his unwarranted hostility towards Zero.",

I was able to fight my way through four episodes before Ialmost shot myself. If anybody who likes this show is offended, I do sincerely apologize for these words and do desire to find out why it is so popular.

            "content": "Can we say, Bish-OH-nen!! Tra-la-la-la! Vampire Knight is a bishounen lover's most lurid dream come true, to date. This is an irrefutable fact, however the question begs asking; does this show does have more to offer than beautiful people filled with angst? It's hard to judge these types of shows fairly because more often than not they are based on mangas [a lot of which I don't read]. Most of the time the smart thing to do is to just score based on the merits of the anime itself [which I intend to do here] but by doing so, the anime scores terribly because thestory score will suck because without the foundation of reading the manga the story seems like it's \u201clacking\u201d or that the exposition is too slow and drawn out. Personally, I liked this show a lot this show [obviously] however objectively speaking, it does lack a certain universal appeal.\\n\\n\r\n~ Art\\n\r\nThe art style for this show definitely complies with my sense of aesthetics for anime. Bright, crisp colors for day scenes and a darker but similar color scheme for the night scenes. Lines are a bit thicker and noticeable but still neat and clean and the shading is smooth. There is also a good level of attention given to the small details as well as great representation of a number of textures and surfaces, like trees, broken glass, some of the walls in various scenes. \\n\r\nThe animation ranges from average to really good with some very subtle use of CGI. This is a shoujo series so there isn't much by way of fighting and action scenes but there are some weapons and special F/X used, most of which involve some sort of glow effect. \\n\\n\r\n~ Sound\\n\r\nI don't think there was much music beyond the OP and ED...and if there was, the fact that I didn't notice, speaks volumes. The OP was OK enough. What I liked best about it was the flow and repetition of the words \u201cAka-ku, Aka-ku, Aka-ku/Yume-wo, Yume-wo Hate-e\u201d. But it's the ED that's the better of the two, IMHO. It's very original, and I'm more  impressed by unique things and so i really like this deranged Gothic lullaby with it's unique melody and off-kilter waltzing rhythm.\\n\\n\r\n~ Story\\n\r\nVampire Knight is not a complex story. It's actually somewhat predictable and clich\u00e9d And the story is far from solid. Since this is another manga adaptation [I don't plan on reading the manga] to me, it's very noticeable how very \u201clacking\u201d the story seems and so \u201clight\u201d. Vampire Knight fits squarely in the fantasy-drama category there's the fantasy element [vampires] and of course there is drama [angst]. There are some comedic elements punctuated throughout the series that offsets the overall angsty tone of the show...tho some times the comedy seemed ill-timed not to mention superfluous. \\n\r\nOne thing about this show that kept nagging at me is how it reminded me of two completely different shows. The first one is LOVELESS with all the bandages [bandage-fetish?] plus that whole sadomasochism thing [and let's not act like there was none in this show, OK?]  The second show VK reminds me of it Ouran High School Host Club with the elite school aspect, the comedy and the reverse-harem. I'm still not completely sure what a MOE anime is [if someone can give me a SIMPLE definition, hit me up] some say that it's an anime that caters to fetishes. If that's the case then, yes, Vampire Knight fits the bill because it seems to cater to all manner of fetishes from Gothic to twins to bandages to uniforms even a little suggestive Yaoi/Yuri action...and of course bishounen.\\n\\n\r\n~ Characters\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, it's the extensive cast of characters of Vampire Knight that made this show so appealing to many people. I can only speak for myself [and perhaps those of a similar inclination] that this show most definitely became a \u201ctop pick\u201d as it presented a visually stunning cast of grade A, bona-fide bishounen. This seems to be what carries the weight of the purpose of this show. Extremely pretty boys all tormented and angst-ridden over some vague, mysterious issue. We have beautiful boys posing with each other [for those of us that like things risqu\u00e9 and slash-able] as well as beautiful boys all fawning over the female lead, Yuki [reverse-harem]. \\n\r\nWhich brings me back to what I said about this show reminding me of Ouran...doesn't Yuki and Haruhi look similar? I know that a lot of anime heroines tend to have that vulnerable, waif-ish look with the big eyes and mousy brown hair but these two look similar [of course barring the fact that Yuuki is drawn more Gothic-looking.] and then combine that with the twins, the stoic tall guy, the hype, cute little blond guy along with the reverse-harem and the a private elite school and you can see why I find both shows similar.\\n\\n\r\n~ The Verdict\\n\r\nGorgeous characters, beautiful set/scenes, decent animation however I would not say this show is for everyone. For example boys [or those who like \u201cboyish\u201d things] may not go for a show like this where beautiful boys lay on couches and fret over some seemingly banal issue.... this might be too EMO or whatever the new word is nowadays. ha-ha! Also from a continuity stand point the show may wind up incomplete. Most manga adaptations end up that way, which bugs me because I only like to watch completed anime....I like having closure.\\n",

Cause my hatred for it is so strong I must write it down. :) \r\n Anyways..... Vampire Knight.. OMG. I think this is the only anime I truly despise..... I couldnt even finish watching the whole thing!!! And its only freaking 13 eps long! Thats just sad. I only managed to watch like... what? 5 episodes I think? Pfft. The first ep I was excited to watch... mostly cause all my friends kept talking about it... so I feltthe need to check it out. Hmm... Vampires, Hot guys, fighting.. This anime sounds pretty good. *add to list* \\n\\n\r\n... *begins to watch*.....*dies* \\n\\n\r\nTHiS ANIME WAS A FAIL! The anime equivalent of Twilight (dont get me wrong... freaking twilight is better than this -__-) Vampire Knight was a fail. Why? Well, lets talk about the main character, Yuki. Can I say MARY SUE??? The freaking girl is utterly useless and pathetic! She cant do shit and always gets herself into trouble having to have help from either Zero or Kaname. Not only do I hate her cause she's just a freaking useless mary sue, but she's like a freaking puppy following Kaname all the time... Desperately seeking him and practically willing to throw her life away for him. Talk about sexist archetype... Useless pathetic chick in need of hot vampire (which by the way is a douche in my opinion.) He also pissed me off.  \\n\\n\r\nThen theres zero.... aww.. My only favored character from this anime, despite his super emo-ness. Yea, his melodramatic suicidal emotions get annoying at times, but he actually cared for Yuki. And even though Yuki ''cared'' for him too, it seemed like she cared more for the douch bag Kaname than ever even though she met him a few days ago (compared to Zero who's been her childhood friend) I symphasize for Zero, he went through hell in the past... so I wouldnt blame him for acting emo. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the characters pissing me off... it just gets worse. Yuki continues to get into trouble, Kaname has to save her, Yuki ignores Zero for Kaname, and Kaname looks like he's gonna devour Yuki but is desperately trying to resist. \\n\\n\r\nI personally hated this anime. I even thought of giving it a second try and watching it.....then all the memories came back of those few eps I saw and my hate for it grew even more... lol. Watch it if you really want to... but I would NEVER recomment this anime to anyone personally. I heard the second season is better, but i honestly dont care. I know its still gonna be shitty. After hearing news from friends that she goes with Kaname and turns into a vampire herself and Zero goes his seperate way, I wasnt suprised. \\n\\n\r\nWord of advise, stay clear of this anime. I truly still do not understand why this anime is so popular... I really dont. Disagree with me all you want... I dont care.. I still stand with what I wrote. And yes, I am a Zero Fan all the way. \\n",

I was at a loss for what to watch and as I love dark animes (with a bit of romance on the side) somebody recommended that I should watch Vampire Knight. Since the whole Twilight thing, everyone has become obssessed with vampires and I thought 'So what could they do differently?'\r\nWhat indeed...\r\nStory (8):\r\nI enjoyed the story a lot. I loved all the characters (especially since Zero is voiced by the same actor as Light from Death Note. Big plus in my book) and the story flowed beautifully. I will say thatI found quite a lot of it fairly predictable but this was by no means a bad thing. I was always interesting to see the story surrounding Yuuki, Zero and Kaname-sama.  \\n\r\nThe story wasn't shockingly original but I enjoyed it nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\\n\r\nI was a very different style to what I usually watch (bearing in mind that Elfen Lied and Higurashi are some of my favourite animes which are both fairly simple). I loved the way the characters are drawn, I love the glowing eyes and the fangs and the eroticness of the vampires which was all done rather tastefully.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed both the opening and the closing songs which really set the mood for the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): \\n\\n\r\nI felt the character development was done very well and there was no characters that I found particularly detestable. I especially loved Zero's character and the special bond that he has with Yuuki",

Then, the idea of some human students having to patrol and watch the vampires - fighting and even killing them if things become dire - seemed intriguing too.\r\nBut...then the characters came into play. \r\nReally, the only character I found remotely interesting was Zero, the best friend/possible love interest with a dark past. The heroine was dull and spineless, and the other male lead was creepyand not appealing to me whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it's been a long time since I watched it and I'm going on the frustration and disappointment I felt back when I did.

But then again, he had his share dreary moments.\r\n   Let's be honest here, why exactly do the love interests fall in \"love\" with Yuki Cross? There is little to no obvious development in romance between Yuki and her love interests. The interactions are completely normal between them, but for some reason, the two main love interests can't keep their fangs off of herflesh.\\n\\n\r\n   Zero and Kaname both fall for her for no apparent reason, and the main character is so generic she's not even like a human anymore (Pun intended; though it wasn't very good). The plot falls into shambles, especially when vampires target Yuki out of lust for blood. Zero was a character with LOTS of potential, but even that was failed. To me, he became, unfortunately, the character with the most wasted capacity to do great things and make the storyline bearable.\\n\\n\r\n   I could barely enjoy the anime because I cringed every 2 minutes. A new character that's even more cynical than the previous one appears, and it got tiring. I put it on hold for some time, trying to sort it out, and tried watching it again, but it was so cringeworthy I had to let it drop.\\n\\n\r\nIf you value your intense and dramatic \"Hellsing\" life, then this anime is not for you. If you're one of those people who values their innocent sparkly \"Twilight\" life, then it's not for you, either. ANY vampire story lover should stay away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10",

It's one of those shows that I'm not sure if it deserves a 6 or 7 (I give it a 7 just trying to be nice). The main problem I have with this show can be summarized into one sentence, that is, a character-driven story with not-so-good characters. Some argue that VK has done a great job at portraying the characters' emotional struggles and conflicts. I somewhat agree. I would agree more if \"struggles and conflicts\" were replaced with \"teenage angst and emo-ness\", and if \"great\" were never used. It'snot like I don't believe why Zero wants to die so much, but the writer shouldn't spend every single second talking about that. Also I saw zero progression in the main characters and their love-triangle relationship. Frankly speaking, I think the writer is going to keep it like that until the last chapter (I'm reading a little bit of the manga myself too). It's a good way to attract teen readers because it's going to keep them guessing whom Yuki will end up with, with the help from traditional yuri-artstyle. The drawback, on the other hand, is that it makes the story pretty much pointless. But I think the most important question is whether I'm going to watch the second season? Yes I am. Am I going to recommend it to anyone? Of course not (unless that person is a fangirl).",

The art is great, but not outstanding. Specifically Zero, I thought came out looking different than expected. However I have grown to like his image. \r\nOverall this anime never fails to entertain with each episode, it makes sense and the storyline nevergets boring. I think the hidden emotions are best fitted for the characters that they have been given to. Also, something important, I think the anime follows the story line of the manga pretty well. Not perfectly, and there are some things that have been changed but overall I would love the story even without reading the manga prior. \\n\r\nKudos VAMP KNIGHT!",

It's just another common shoujo romance with vampires included. \r\nThe story wasn't anything impressive. All the plots were pretty easily guessable, the the show is constantly surrounded by this dreary feel that makes it hard to watch. It's not exactly the type of dark I like in my shows, but I'm accustomed enough to shoujo romances and vampire stories that I managed to make it through. \r\nThe art was fine. The characters were easily distinguishable, the animations for 'vampirepowers' were pretty cool to look at, and Zero's design (especially with his glowing eyes and tattoo) were pretty well done. The backgrounds and characters other than Zero, Yuki, and Kaname were too mundane to remember though. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and closing themes were pretty good, and the gothic music was cheesy but somewhat fitting. Most of the voice actors were pretty terrible, but with Vic voicing Zero, I managed to get through it, though I cringed every time any other character talked pretty much. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are cliche as any others you see. There's nothing special about them in the least. Don't even hope for character development either. The heroine is simply a doll who comes off at first as a strong heroine before becoming another regular wall decoration. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it enough to finish it. Zero got me through it-- without him, I'm not sure if I could have retained my sanity through watching this. There's so many plot holes I don't even know where to start. Why are two people tasked with handling hordes? Why can't they just buy barriers? Why don't they instill an actual curfew? Why don't they have vampire hunters on campus until halfway through the season? Why does Zero get a private room? Why is every character an idiot?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not bad, but not something I would watch again. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: like damsels in distress, like fights, like vampires, like strong masculine guys being adamant while writhing in pain, love triangles?\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: want character development, want an actual dark plot, don't like cliches\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

Yuuki was strong and not afraid to stand up for herself.\u00a0\r\nI love the wide variety of characters that was displayed throughout the show. There were characters like Kaname who were quiet and powerful, then there was characters like Kaien who were both silly and serious. The characters were all lovable in this show, and to me that's what makes a show good.\u00a0As for characterdevelopment, the creators did a good job with everyone, especially Zero.\\n\\n\r\nYou know when you decide to listen to the theme song instead of skipping it to get on with the show? That's how I felt with this show.\u00a0The music was beautiful and did a great job at setting the \"vampire mood\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story was great, and I'm glad it focused more on action rather than romance. The comedy was great as well.\u00a0\\n",

It's not one of your typical vampire romance animes where a vampire guy and human girl fall in love. The ending is also an ending that you wouldn't expect to happen at all. Theres a lot of back story that creates a lot of mystery and connects the main characters' pasts with one another. This goes the same for season 2 as well. The Vampire Knight series is a MUST WATCH! I alsosuggest reading the manga as well! :)",

I also liked the idea of prefects having to keep the humans and vampires  in line when it comes to the classes. But the part I really didn't like was the fact that Yuki Cross was totally pathetic and couldn't really do anything for herself. Kaname and Zero always came to her rescue every time she messed up. There were also a lot of long romantic stares and soppy melodrama. The story never really comes to any climax. \r\nArt:\r\nTheart is okay. Nothing particularly special or worth talking about. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music is mainly classical in this series. It fits the anime, even if it's not the type of music I normally listen to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is probably the part of the anime I  disliked the most. Yuki was totally lame and relied on Kaname and Zero all the time.  She carries this staff thing around all the time and she doesn't do a very good job of using it because Kaname or Zero. She was just a really boring heroine. I have no problem with characters being really weak at the beginning but I expect them to grow and develop as a character. But no. The male leads would just promptly come to her aid as if it was routine. Then there's Zero, who just wanted to die all the time. We also have Kaname who rescues Yuki all the time, but we have no real reason why he does. I mean it was kinda cute, but at the same time really creepy why he'd do that with no motivation or reason behind it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, I didn't expect this anime to good. I only really watched it because I saw it on Chrunchyroll when I had nothing better to do. I just wanted to watch it casually and switch my brain off while watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAverage. 4/10.",

I really liked the concept of a separation of classes at the academy: Night class and Day class. I also love the look of the uniforms. But sadly, that is where my Like List ends for Vampire Knight..\r\nVery dry and boring story. Repetitive and meaningless. Bland and useless characters.

            "content": "I've seen quite a few negative reviews about this series. You see, I'm one of those people who reads reviews and takes them into serious consideration before watching an anime. If a series has unfavorable reviews, or some hiccup that I just can't deal with, I will refuse to watch the show. Vampire Knight is one of those shows that I would never have normally considered watching... that is, if I weighed reviews by the score at the top right.\r\nThe majority of reviews ended up bashing the female lead, Yuuki Cross. They called her inept, stupid, slapped a martyr complex on her, and essentially saidthat she's the worst female lead to come along since Shinji from Evangelion...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I read these after watching anime with exceedingly strong female leads (i.e. Maid Sama, Nodame Cantabile, etc.). Frankly, the idea of a feminine lead appealed to me, considering the disturbingly masculine leads I've experienced up until now. I found Yuuki to be a breath of fresh air from the stereotypical shoujo lead. It's not that I felt she was more realistic than those other characters (though you have to admit a certain lack of realism in the characters of almost all romance plots. The characters are intended to appeal to a wide variety of audiences to increase ratings, not play at creating realistic characters), but rather that she seemed to turn a new page in that musty old book. She had her share of flaws, and her submissiveness did annoy me at some points, but they were bearable. \\n\\n\r\nNow, with that out of the way, allow me to explain exactly why I scored this show an eight. Some of you may cringe in horror at that. I don't really mind. My goal is to inform possible future viewers of whether or not they will enjoy the show. \\n\\n\r\nTo be frank, if you don't like vampires, bishounens, or \"weak\" female leads, then you are going to hate this show. It will have nothing to offer you unless you're just doing it to blow a few hours. However, if you are into a darker romance plot than the usual \"girl meets guy, they fall in love with drama in between and live happily ever after,\" then you'll probably take a liking to this series. Furthermore, if you are getting sick of wondering exactly how many steroids your female lead is popping on an hourly basis, then you'll breathe a sigh of relief to know that Yuuki Cross has her fair share of estrogen and then some. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of the story is fairly nice: an academy where vampires and humans coexist (unknowingly on the humans' behalf). The chairman's kids are the \"guardians,\" or the people who make sure that the human students don't learn of the existence of the vampire students. It's quite the task, considering that the vampires are your classic cast of bishies. They really played up on the \"vampires are hotter than the average person\" in this on. (While I'm touching on art--albeit briefly--I'd like to mention that Yuuki's eyes are indeed ridiculous. They are huge. You're probably thinking that they can't be that bad, and even if they are that you've seen some pretty big eyes before. Even so, take my word for it. Yuuki's eyes take \"big\" to a whole new extreme.)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the story does take a few twists and turns as it goes, but it essentially revolves around the idea of humans and vampires coexisting peacefully. Everything else is mainly in the name of character development. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it will definitely bore you if you wind up hating the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty good for the most part. There are a few cliches here and there, and some things go unexplained about the characters, but the interactions make sense for the most part, and they are handled in a way to fit the atmosphere of the show. At the same time, the interactions between the two male leads and Yuuki can get pretty tedious at times. It can be frustrating to watch all of that pent up angst an confusion. But that's pretty standard for romance anime in general. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was lovely. While I did not particularly care for the OP and ED, I found the music on a whole to suit the show perfectly. One minor problem would be how the music cuts off in the middle of the piece at a scene shift. I disliked that, as the pieces were quite nice from time to time, and the cut-off tended to occur while I was enjoying a particular piece...\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, since I've made it clear that I thoroughly enjoyed this show, this review is exclusively for Vampire Knight. It does not extend to Vampire Knight guilty, which I do feel is worth a watch. In fact, I do not know how you can only watch the first installment. It ends with a bit of a cliffhanger (annoying, I know), with very few issues resolved.",

            "content": "First, general information about this review:\r\n1. This is going to include spoilers. I'll try to keep the number down, but reviewing a series (or a movie or book or whatever) without spoiling anything is close to impossible.\r\n2. Everything in this review is my own opinion. You are free to state your own, but please don't try to force it onto me or someone else. Thanks.\r\nFirst, general information about the plot:\r\nThe series mainly revolves around life at Cross Academy, a private school with a Day Class and a Night Class; the Day Class consist of normal students that sleep at night and study during the day;the Night Class does it the other way around. Now, what only few people know (but what is actually painfully obvious), is that the Night Class consist solely of vampires.\\n\r\nYuuki, a girl from the Day Class of Cross Academy, was saved from a bad vampire by Kuran Kaname when she was 5 years old. Oddly enough, she also cannot remember anything from before that time. Kuran Kaname is a vampire and at the same time leader of the Night Class at Cross Academy. Yuuki was then adopted by Cross Kaien, chairman of Cross Academy and an acquaintance of Kaname's. Ever since then, Yuuki has admired Kaname, but also accepted that his saving her probably meant nothing to him. However, when Yuuki was 11 years old, Kaien, now her foster father, brought a boy home; he was covered in blood. The boy was Kiryuu Zero, and his family had been killed by vampires. He was the sole survivor. Understandably, he bears a deep-seated hatred for the entire vampire race - also for the pacifist group that is the Night Class. One day, Kaien asked him and Yuuki to become Prefects for the school, however, that was to be only a cover for their true task; guardians, to protect the secret of the Night Class from the outside world. Yuuki accepted for the sake of protecting and promoting the peace at Cross Academy, Zero did in order to keep the vampires in check. And thus, the love triangle is formed. Zero cares a lot about Yuuki, even though he doesn't show it; so does Kaname, even though Yuuki thinks otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters & character development:\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters in this series to know; in the beginning, you are likely to have trouble distinguishing some of them, especially Kain Akatsuki and Aidou Hanabusa, since they look almost like twins. That is probably the one trouble this anime has with its characters. Other than that, the main characters get a lot of spotlight, but somehow, there's always enough left for the others. I find that the love triangle Zero-Yuuki-Kaname is very interesting; Kaname and Zero are not simply rivals, nor do they want Yuuki's love; they simply wish to keep her away from the other. Both of them can't stand each other, Zero for obvious reasons and Kaname for reasons that have yet to be revealed at the beginning of the series.\\n\\n\r\nPlot development:\\n\\n\r\nI found that the plot in this series was rather easy to predict, however, that didn't bother me, as there were too many things happening between Zero, Yuuki and Kaname to think about the plot. However, there are a few revelations, but none of them are sudden; we always get hints, to the point where it is obvious. What is interesting about that is what it changes between the characters. Meaning that not the plot is interesting in this series, but the effect all those events have on the characters' relationships.\\n\r\nBuuuuuuut, all that changes in the second season, when Yuuki attempts to uncover her lost past. As usual, we get many hints over time, and at least for me, it was obvious what was going to happen. I'm not going to spoil that big surprise here, find out for yourself. However, it is quite unfortunate that the anime quits at the (at least for me) most interesting point, the reason probably being that there wasn't enough manga material to continue the anime. But I can assure you, if a third season is coming, it will likely be soon.\\n\\n\r\nComedy:\\n\\n\r\nYes, even though Vampire Knight is a rather serious story, there are lots of funny bits, but the great thing is that they never seem misplaced. Especially funny is the scene where the chairman calls the Night Class his \"cute little vampires\" in front of Zero and Yuuki, and she almost literally reads Zero's mind on that subject for Kaien...\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nVampire Knight is an excellent anime for those who love vampire stories combined with romance; also for those who want to see how many hints they need to figure out a secret, even though that is rather secondary. It is one of my all-time favourites, and personally, I give it a 9,5/10, since it has pretty much everything I want... Except for a third season.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga:\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the anime, the manga isn't much different. Drawing and storyline and such are almost exactly the same, save small details. However, if you hit the end of the second season for the anime and want to know how it goes on, go ahead and read the manga. It also has some (usually quite funny) \"bonus chapters\" that tell small sidestories that are unimportant to the main storyline, but usually show funny (and sometimes quite interesting) scenes that are not in the anime. The bonus chapters are usually quite pointless, but their simple pointlessness makes them so funny. For instance, Kaname randomly placing a bucket full of water on Aidou's head...\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can only recommend this series. What are you waiting for? Go ahead and watch it!",

My friend is obsessed with Vampire Knight, but me, not so much. I don't know. I guess the whole vampire line.. I'm not sure. I just didn't care for the plot. There was comedy, and it was good humor. But it was one of those Animes that will get you cracking up, but you have one second before it gets serious again.\r\nArtwork was amazing. It had great style and I ADORED the uniforms.The animation was great too. Earns a 9 by me.\\n\\n\r\nNot much to base off of sound. The theme music for season 1 was great, but season 2's was just plain bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were given a 7 because I felt like they didn't show to much originality. Now I'm not saying there wasn't any, because there was, but I felt like not all the characters were as original as they COULD be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was a 7, because I enjoyed it, but didn't LOVE it. As in, I probably wouldn't watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall it was given a 7. It isn't a must watch, but I would recommend it to many anime fans out there.",

There is something special about the Night Class though.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nI like the story a lot. How it starts is interesting, and it will bring up questions for the veiwer to make their own theories about. Basically, Yuki and Zero who watch the school grounds at night to protect a certain secret from the Day Class students and Zero holds a secret too. Yuki was a young girl when Kaname found her on a snowy nightand he is her 'beginning.' \\n\\n\r\nThe story is interesting because it is different from other vampire stories such as taking place at a school with two different kinds of 'people.'\\n\\n\r\nPart of Yuki's past is explained but not a lot which makes it more mysterious and this encouraged me to continue watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt -10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy the art and how it was animated. I like the detail in the characters such as the eyes to the hair of the characters same as the scene. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI like the sound of the show such as the music it will fit perfect with the scene and the feeling. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I put 7 here is because I would have liked if they touched a bit more into Yuki and Zero's past or some of the other characters. I feel like if they did more of that I would have gave it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that bothers me about Yuki though is she talks about Kaname so much while Zero is kind of ignored even though she wants to look after him too. She always has problems picking between them which is annoying and how Kaname acts towards Yuki despite how uncomfortable Yuki is around him. With a bad experience with vampires, she even expresses that she is scared of him at one point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it very much. I have always been interested in vampire stuff and this anime captured that. Everything from the music and scenery makes it have a mystery kind of feeling. It isn't scary but if you don't like supernatural stuff or mystery then this anime isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I will give it an 8.\\n",

Kaname is constantly resquing Yuuki.Zero is constantly being pitty for himself.

This show has all these things in abundance. What surprised me was that the story actually felt somewhat grounded. The characters' reasonings and motivations, while melodramatic, felt consistent and not unconvincing. \r\nThe heroine Yuki is a mixed bag. She doesn't cry and drown in self guilt nearly as often as she could, and her actions aren't completely recklessly stupid. I was able to sympathize with her conundrum- wanting to help both Zero and Kuran and not understanding either of them orherself, and I usually felt like she was making tough choices out of necessity. However, she was also pretty lame, carrying around a weapon she never ever uses.\\n\\n\r\nThe politics of the vampire world were interesting to watch, and I felt like themes of mortality, trauma, cruel fate, attraction, and loyalty were well-explored. There is very little filler.\\n\\n\r\nI found out later that the manga was written by an author who I really like. Vampire Knight would have benefitted greatly from getting to finish out it's plot along the lines of the manga, because as is the ending is not very satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nFrom my own scoring system:\\n\r\n2/3 for characters and relationships\\n\r\n2/3 for plot and storyline\\n\r\n2/3 for formal elements\\n\r\n1/1 for my special award (this is kind of a tentative award but I did feel like Yuki is a complex and active character)",

I do like some Vampires anime but this one was just plain boring and have no emotion. the Leads guys in the serie look that there are just there and have no emotions to just scare the little girl. Then the story don't make sense to the point that you want to just quit. It waste to watch 13 episode and 2 season of this.  To be Honest I think that anime do not follow the Manga which itwas base on. There  took what look Ok and put it worst into the show. Well this earn my 1st place of the worst anime. It been there since the serie end. I recommend to all of you that do not waste the time to Watch to 13 episode. Maybe I just save you from 6 Hours of not so good anime.",

            "content": "Going into the series, I had high expectations. All of my anime loving friends said that they loved it. Vampire Knight Basically met these expectations, but it felll a LITTLE short. No matter, this was still a good anime.\r\nStory (8):\r\nThe story was apparently ripped off of some show in the 80's, according to my mother, but being  that I'm a \"youngster\" I didn't know it, so it was a new story plot to me. The whole concept of a vampire hater turning into a vampire is quite amusing, all that self-hatred and toil and such. It makes the characters deep and emotional. The pacewas perfect in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\r\nI love the dark art that they use, going with the theme, and they boys were pretty dang hot, if you ask me. Yuuki's eyes were......a little big, I guess, but hey, it's anime, I got used to it. The detail was excellent, and I loved how all the vamp-y scenes were done, and how the blood stains were on thier face and neck.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10):\\n\r\nMy gawsh, if I could listen to the OP and EP over and over andover again, I most certainly would. Also, the organ (organ, right?) and stings in the background while the anime was going on was perfectly excecuted. And as creepy and spine-chilling as it was, when you heard the sound of something sounding like crunchy skin when a vampire bit into someone's neck was disgustingly thrilling. This was the best aspect of Vampire Knight, personally.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6):\\n\r\nThis is where Vampire Knight was very poor in. I probably would have given this a higher score if Yuuki's character was more reasonable. She's so thick-headed and absent-minded that it drives me crazy sometimes. Luckily, Zero's emo-like, yet kind and caring  personality and Kaname's good/evil character made of for Yuuki's never changing, never developing, oh-so-very aggrivating personality less annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9):\\n\r\nThe enjoyment level is fairly high, which is good for someone who hates all vampire like storylines. The sound and art really made this a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8): \\n\r\nOverall, Vampire Knight is something that will keep you up late at night because, \"I just need to finish one more episode. That's it, I promise.\" Trust me, you will break that promise.",

It may start off somewhat slow, but it definitely becomes more captivating with each episode. Throughout this anime, a love triangle is prominent consisting of the lead character Yuri, whom is open to the idea of vampires, Zero, whom is strongly opposed to anything remotely associated with vampires and Kaname, an actual vampire. The twist, I did not see coming, although some may, I surely did not!\r\nThe style of anime is quite nice, colors and visual effects aesthetically pleasing, although there is  better, there ismost definitely A LOT worse. The sound, is fair... a bit so-so here and there, however the opening and closing tracks are hits in my opinion. There is no much character development present, however, there are flash backs of the previously mentioned character's childhoods, though that is about as deep as it gets. In regards to enjoyment, I rarely found myself bored; although at some parts it did drag on. Regardless, it was far from unbearable and if you push through those parts you'll most likely be pleasantly surprised. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I rate this very good. If you're into all the vampire romances, Vampire Knight is worth a watch.",

And I found the fact that all the girls in the school clamored around the vampires and thought about them so much, the fact that they were so vapid and unintelligent, to be offensive. Females are NOT at all like the brainless mobsters in the school. It's like the freaking Twilight of anime. \r\nAnd the plot in general. Boy hates vampires -> girl who is friends with the boy runs around getting into danger due to extreme stupidity ->girl being constantly saved by gorgeous boys time and time again. Don't give me that crap. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nYes, the art was good. The special effects, I have to admit, were pleasing, and the lighting gave certain scenes a great effect. The one thing that disturbs me about the art is Yuki's abnormally huge eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe sound complements the anime perfectly. It was perhaps the best part of watching Vampire Knight. The opening perfectly gets the intended feelings across, and the ending adds an eerie undertone to the anime, which is even more perfect, as it usually finishes with a cliffhanger. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\\n\r\nIt was bad. Unoriginal. \\n\\n\r\nYuki is the typical good-girl protagonist, who is in the midst of a (of course) love triangle. She has no personality whatsoever besides her annoying optimism and is a complete crybaby. She want to protect the ones she loves, yet is not even capable of protecting herself, relying on others to save her from danger. \\n\\n\r\nZero is the typical tortured, broody, hot guy who is meant to make fangirls with his good looks and heroism, along with a bad-boy attitude. \\n\\n\r\nKaname is the typical dark, broody hot vampire (too much like Edward Cullen. Blech) and is all-powerful and all-chivalrous. He wows fangirls with his power and makes them squeal with his chivalry. Yet another stereotype. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it okay-ishly, but I would definitely not rewatch it. The constant cliff-hangers make the watcher want to find out what happens next, which actually does little to improve the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nMediocre, cliche, and unoriginal. That is all this anime is: average, and may even be a little less than average.",

But it just fascinated me soo.. soo much! I really liked the Story about Vampires and all these secrets around them. (And I'm not a Twilight fan or whatever..) The plot takes hold of you and doesn't let you go till the very end! I was crying, I was laughing, I was freezing! The romance between the characters was just so heart touching even if there was not many \"romantic-scenes\" (and I'm usually verydelicate when it comes to these scenes..) I just felt every single moment when there was a brief \"romantic\" moment! The main girl wasn't that annoying and trust me, I hate those girls normally in Animes. The only negative thing I can admit is that this Anime leaves you with a very \"dark feeling\" in your chest. If you know what I'm saying.. It's when you are not \"satisfied \" and it leaves you with many questions and heart-ache( haha....) \\n\\n\r\nSo if you like: dark, dramatic, not that bloody, less action, on it's own \"romantic\" vampire Anime.. THEN you MUST watch it!\\n\r\nIf not..then leave it :)\\n\\n\r\nOne more: VK is an Anime I still can't compare to other Animes because to me.. It's just different.... and I loved everything about it!",

Unlike many other anime, the story is quite similar to the manga, so if you if you read the manga as well, then you'll be glad.\r\nI'm personally a huge fan of romantic scenes and there were quite a few of them that just made me all mushy inside. There was a lot of action scenes as well so it isn't all just lovey dovey....so yeah, I think it's worth watching.\r\nThis is my first review, Itried to be broad so it doesn't give anything away but I'm not sure if it's any good....anyway yeah :)",

            "content": "The beginning of Vampire Knight was cliche and predictable. Almost immediately, Yuki's character was exposed to be nothing more than the same love-struck school girl and the storyline was that of every mediocre anime. However, the show proved itself to be different when Zero's secret struggle of being a vampire took off. This sudden internal fight created interesting suspense in this otherwise predictable story.\r\nThe show became particularly noteworthy and distinguishable when Zero gave into his blood lust and drank Yuki's blood. His character, even in these early episodes, became the sole drive of the show, his hatred for vampire-kind creating a believable struggle for ahuman turned vampire. Kaname's response to this scene was somewhat mysterious, yet expected. It was Yuki, however, that failed to surprise. Her predictable decision to still care for Zero, while also remaining ignorant of Zero's apparent feelings, was not believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe show continued with this somewhat cliche love triangle, though remained interesting because of Zero's hatred for Kaname and struggle with himself. At this point in the show, the audience could easily empathize with Zero, somewhat like Kaname, and perhaps put up with Yuki despite her annoying qualities.\\n\\n\r\nThe entrance of Maria Kurenai brought the show to a particular low. Her cliche \"bad-girl\" routine was annoying and loathsome, though it was perhaps the purpose of her character. The needless \"mystery\" of her true identity made the audience question why Shizuka did not just appear herself without the useless middle man. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Maria's entrance did improve the tension between the characters. Kaname began showing particular promise as a character when he showed signs of dislike for Maria. Zero's character development and history continued nicely with his hate for Shizuka leading him to protect Yuki further. However, Yuki remained suspended in the middle of this now interesting development, making her character annoyingly naive amidst a greater problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe entrance of Ichiru shifted the balance of the show and, though being an odd and sudden third party, proved to be an interesting and important addition to the show. His character provided another side to Zero's story, showing the difference between humans who hate vampires and humans who envy them. The heartbreaking conflict between these once loving brothers created even more depth to Zero's already tragic character.\\n\\n\r\nIn the ball scene, the anticipated moment of Yuki and Kaname's romance finally arrived. However, it proved somewhat disappointing when Kaname's affection was met by childish complaints. While Kaname's character, at this point, seemed only important for his affection for Yuki and attractive face, the audience was left on Kaname's side, confused by Yuki's dismissiveness to both him and Zero.\\n\\n\r\nIn the final episodes, Yuki unsurprisingly gives herself to Shizuka for Zero's sake. Fights ensue between nearly all the characters and the audience was left more interested in Yuki's choice between Zero and Kaname rather than the seemingly pointless fight with Shizuka, who did not seem to have a real motive at all. In the confusing end amid all the fighting, the audience was left to believe that Zero murdered Shizuka. Shizuka's dying story seemed more like \"filling\" time than anything else. However, Ichiru's character proved to be truly breathtaking when he, being a human, drank Shizuka's blood. It is this final episode, however, that truly brought everything to an exciting and suspenseful cliff hanger. Kaname's character, having been boring and needless throughout the whole season, suddenly became perhaps the most unique of all of them. When Kaname was revealed to be the true killer of Shizuka, his character became one of incredible illusion and mystery, his true motives being veiled throughout the entire season. In addition, Hanabusa's unrelenting loyalty to Kaname was shaken when he was revealed to be the only eyewitness of Shiuka's death.\\n\\n\r\nThe final scene was one of true anticipation, being the final face off between Zero and Kaname. While they did not physically fight, Kaname revealed his true nature to Zero, not for the first time, but now in light with the murder he committed. While his motives towards Yuki were true, Kaname's motives for Zero and the school were left unknown. Surprisingly, and very excitingly, Kaname almost forced Zero to drink his blood, though the audience was left unsure exactly why he would choose to save such a hated foe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Vampire Knight has one of the more surprising and exciting storylines of anime. With the beginning being somewhat cliche, the show takes dramatic turns that quickly pull it from the \"romantic comedy\" genre to that of \"thriller\" or \"drama\". While Yuki's character is predictable, annoying, and not unlike that of any other anime female, she can be tolerated with Zero's unique and tragic character as well as the reveal of Kaname's ulterior motives. The end of this season proves to be an appropriate closure with Shizuka's death, yet also leaves the audience wanting more of the irresistible plot twists and interesting character relationships. With wonderful plot twists, incredibly developed supporting characters, and subtle themes of chaos vs harmony, Vampire Knight is a show worth watching and can be much enjoyed by audiences with preferences from the romantic genre all the way to that of thriller.",

There are the Dayclass and the Knight class. Both classes are housed in Different buildings have different time teaching. In addition to that, known as prefects to take care that no pupils come from Dayclass the Knight class too close to the so-called class switching. One of the prefect's Yuki Cross, the daughter of the rector. Does she know about more than any other on the Knight Class? And lately Yuki is plagued by nightmares.Whether that has something to do with her past that she remembers only fragmentarily? Vampire Knight shows many Emutionen as well as very many action scenes and what you have to think about it, to understand it. If you are a fan of such vampire anime, this is a mandatory series.

            "content": "Full thoughts on Vampire Knight: it's terrible. Firstly, the writing: The story is about a girl called Yuki who was rescued by a vampire as a child and adopted by a former vampire hunter who now runs a school split into a day class of human students and a night class of vampire students. A love triangle develops between Yuki, her adopted brother, and the vampire who rescued her as a child. There's some action and some attempts at making the villains morally ambiguous, but none of the characters really undergo any development or make rational choices. For example, the senate want to bring backto life the vampire who killed Kaname's parents... even though they have no control over him and he keeps killing their members.\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Ichiru keeps changing sides willy nilly and doing things counter to his own motives, and to make matters worse one of Yuki's love interests is revealed to actually be her brother. This would disturb any real person, but instead she freaking agrees to be his lover, turning the clich\u00e9 vampire love triangle into an incest vampire love triangle. Zero, one of thetwo love interests, also doesn't try to talk Yuki out of leaving with Kaname at the end, and for no reason promises to kill her, even though that is blindingly the opposite of what he actually wants to do, and his actions once again seem highly unrealistic. The animation quality is appalling by Studio Deen's standards.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who's seen the Fate UBW movie knows that they have some seriously talented animators, but in this series the frame rate is often much slower in backgrounds than it is on the characters, and there are a few I stances of the walk-cycles being off, and it looking more like characters are growing than moving forwards. That might be forgivable, if it weren't for the fact that there are 2 scenes in which characters fall forwards out of windows and inexplicable land on their feet, suggesting that they did somersaults in mid air that we didn't see. Characters frequently go out of their way to act cool for no clear reason, including the headmaster, who half the time acts like a complete nut job, and since the vampires are in no way adversely affected by sunlight, it makes sense that they would be split up into the classes that they are.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also not explained why all of the main characters who are vampires in the second season suddenly have powers that were said in the first season to be exclusive to purebloods. Yuki is also a very weak main character, frequently needing to be rescues and suffering from very unhealthy levels of obsession towards Kaname. It also makes no sense that Zero would ever be on a school disciplinary committee when he keeps skipping classes. The English dub is the worst I've ever had the misfortune of listening to in terms of bad voice acting, and two of the supporting characters, Aido and Ichijo look almost exactly the same, so it's often hard to tell who is who between them. In short, Vampire Knight is an appalling mess of an anime and I do not recommend it. 3/10",

            "content": "Please note that this review also covers season 2 of this anime, which is called Vampire Knight Guilty.\r\nSo I first watched this anime when I was about 13 years old. Having stumbled across it while watching television, I decided to give it a go.\r\nI actually enjoyed it quite a lot, but then again at age 13 I enjoyed pretty much anything that caught my interest. Now that I'm 17, I've been exposed to a lot of anime that I enjoy a lot more.\r\nSo Vampire Knight is, in a nutshell, what you get when you turn Twilight into an anime, get rid of a lot ofthe sparkles and werewolves and give it some more interesting characters. The story is simple: we have a boarding school that is inhabited by both vampires and humans. The vampires all take the Night Class, because hey, guess what, they're actually nocturnal! Well, except one - Zero Kiryuu, a vampire-turned-human who resides in the Day Class with his best friend Yuki Cross.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main characters - Yuki, Zero and Kaname - can all be described as Bella, Jacob and Edward respectively, in layman's terms. Of course, mere comparisons will only bring forth confusion, so let me go through each of them real quick.\\n\\n\r\nYuki is a cheerful but ditzy girl who really just wants everyone to get along with each other. Basically the typical cardboard cutout shoujo protagonist, really. There's nothing much more I can say about her, but she does become a little more badas after a particular turning point in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nZero would probably be the end result of a fusion between Sasuke Uchiha and Jacob Black. He was the son of a couple of vampire hunters; however, he was bitten by a pureblood vampire for... some reason that I can't remember. But lemme just say that as a character, he's edgier than the Shadow the Hedgehog game, and that's saying something.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have Kaname, the gorgeous but mysterious pureblood vampire dude. Nothing much I can say about him, either, aside from some major spoilers - I honestly don't know whether it's because I haven't watched this anime in ages or he and the other characters are just that flat and poorly-developed. Because ironically enough, from what I remember Yuki was the one who got the most character development. \\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, the art and animation in this anime is... okay. Nothing to write home about. The music's okay. The OPs and EDs aren't really my cup of tea, personally. I can't say much about the sub since I haven't watched it, but I'm not a very huge fan of the dub. I will give brownie points to Vic Mignogna pulling off a dark and edgy character's voice surprisingly well, but the rest of the characters' voices aren't really that great to listen to, especially Kaname's. He just sounds... so passive-aggressive all the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you happen to be 13 or younger, or you're just entertained easily, then you might actually enjoy watching this. But if not, well, I can assure you that there are better shoujo anime out there.",

Yes, the main characters Yuki, Kaname, and Zero all had great character developments throughout the series andhonestly, they were what hooked me into the show,  but what I did not like was that the supporting characters like the night class remained kind of mysterious.  I was very interested in getting to know more about them but they were not given much attention and just stood there. Overall, Vampire Knight is one of my favorite anime of all times and would definitely watch it again.",

            "content": "Here's the thing: Vampire Knight is the first anime I ever watched (if we're not counting Pok\u00e9mon, that is). I watched it years ago and it was the anime that got me IN to anime and manga. I just fell in love with the story and the characters, and even though I'm not a fan of love triangles or complicated romances I couldn't help but love the way the Zero/Yuuki/Kaname triangle is done in this series. \r\nI can recognize that Vampire Knight is not perfect; it's full of tropes and things that have been done before. Since watching Vampire Knight I've watched \"better\" anime. Butat the end of it all, I think my enjoyment and deep love for Vampire Knight outweighs all of those tropes and problems. To me, it's a perfect anime BECAUSE it comes with such strong emotional attachments.\\n\\n\r\nI love Yuuki and her determination, even if sometimes she's unbelievably and unnecessarily stubborn. I love Zero and his tortured soul because he's just trying, really. I mean, it pretty much sucks to know you're probably going to lose your humanity at some point. And I love Kaname because he's smooth and charming but beneath that he's dark and even a little cold.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are really important for me, and I love the characters in this anime too much to let them go. I've watched it a handful of times over the years and each time I still love it a little more than the last time.\\n\\n\r\nSo I understand those of you that find the story less than stellar or the characters annoying, but I think (for me) this anime is too close to my heart to NOT love. It's the first anime I watched and it's what got me into anime. So, really, this is a masterpiece because it's timeless for me and important to me. And I think that's important!",

Well for one thing they have two classes DAY for humans AND NIGHT for vampires. Do humans know about the vampires? No. For one thing that humans won't know and vampires won't attack them would be two student quardians name Yuki and Zero be guarding so won't be any trouble. Another way for vampires won't attack humans to hunger the students blood is taking a blood tablet (pills) Yuki and Zero are the only twohumans that know the night class are vampires. Also have a past life from tragic experience life on vampires. \\n\\n\r\nIt;s a interesting story when watching the anime. Its a typical school thinking be all comedy but everything has more series issues than just all comedy. One thing be confused on the vampires, how can they walk in the daylight? One thing be sure is they have pure blood. So curious to find that out watch it. For romance, defenility a love traingle going on. Let me say its hard to see me who should be with who. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it a lot so can't wait to read the manga the first time since it made me want to read it. If haven't and watched it, then you will. Also the second season be coming out too in October. yeah lets be patient",

Its plot is very complex and we see vampires interactions with humans at the cross academy. There are many different stories going on zero is a vampire hater and we slowly discover why and his family who was murdered by the very vampire his brother serves. And in a twist of fate he himself is biten and turning into a vampire which provides a very intresting situation. Yuki herself slowly remebering thoughts and we see her confusing relations with Kaname the head of the night school apure blood.\\n\r\nThe art is stunning and i love the lyrics and music used for openers. I agree with many this is confusing and sometimes dry in a few episodes the frst series seems to float aimlessly at times unlike the sequel which clearly picks up the pace. A great one id recomend.",

You will be sure to like the characters and be rooting for Yuuki to end up with a guy after you have seen a few episodes. Overall I think it deserves a 9 out of 10 becauseit left a cliff hangger at the end. But I highly recommend cheaking Vampire Knight out.",

Yes, it's really addictive. But I had to say, Ithink the reason Vampire Knight took the list as 'the best shojo' it's due to the BISHIES, and seriously I had my friends ga-ga over them than the story.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI had nothing to say about the sound.

            "content": "Cross Academy was founded by the wealthy Kaien Cross to facilitate the idealized cohabitation of what would otherwise be considered predator and prey. Nestled away quiet and secluded in the woods, the students at this prestigious academy are segregated... Er, I mean, separated... Into two different classes. During the daylight hours, you\u2019ll find the classrooms occupied by humans, going about their peaceful school lives in a way that both their innocence and ignorance are protected. Swing by campus at night, however, and you\u2019ll find those same classrooms filled with students of a more pale and toothy sort. This class is made up of vampires, mostof which won\u2019t hesitate to taste your blood if you get too close to them.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping these two halves of the student body separate are Yuki Cross and Zero Kiryu, the former of whom was adopted by Kaien following a traumatic vampire attack when she was a child, and the latter having been taken in years later after a similar event. Together, they form the disciplinary committee, formed to keep their fellow students from crossing a line that should never be crossed. Unfortunately for them, Zero seems to have brought something back with him from his encounter as a child, as he slowly begins to turn into a vampire himself. As he loses control of his humanity, it\u2019s up to Yuki, his only friend in the world, to ease his pain and keep him tied to humanity. Can she save her childhood friend from a fate worse than death, or will her mind be too clouded by her feelings for the mysterious Vampire dorm leader, Kaname Kuran?\\n\\n\r\nVampire Knight was animated by Studio Deen, a company that I praised heavily in my Irresponsible Captain Tylor review... But that was nineties Studio Deen, which I almost feel is a completely different company from 2007 Studio Deen. The animation budget, as is the case with most modern Deen releases, was bare bones, and on-screen movement is noticeably cheap with very few exceptions. Characters freeze in the background like lifeless mannequins if they\u2019re not the focus of the scene, and move only slightly in very robotic spurts when they are. Characters profiles bounce up and down to indicate walking, or in the few far shots, they walk or run like they don\u2019t actually exist in their own environment, with emotion only seeming to exist in their insanely detailed eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI can kind of tell by the angles, art design and often pretentious editing that Deen had a specific vision and visual tone in mind when they were making this show, but they just didn\u2019t have the experience or talent necessary to work with such a small budget. The backgrounds are decent, albeit somewhat generic and lifeless. The character designs are highly attractive by shoujo standards, with it\u2019s two male leads looking just debonair and hunky enough to tease the female viewers, and Yuki herself looking just enough like the wide-eyed, plain-yet-pretty protagonist that they\u2019d want to insert themselves into. There aren\u2019t very many characters other than them, but the ones we do have look distinguishable enough to be passable.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is full dark gothic-sounding fare, blending somber piano, heart wrenching violin-work and a powerful greek choir to express the emotion of any given scene far better than the stiff looking characters can. Pipe organs are used in the main theme to create a sense of church-like foreboding, a fitting warning of the darker, more sinful paths the characters will inevitably travel. Composer Takefumi Haketa knows just when to use restraint and when to take over, grabbing your attention at all the right moments, and he also seems to know the characters themselves just well enough to give them appropriate themes to match their roles in the story. Yukis theme in particular actually had me choking up a bit the first time I heard it isolated. It\u2019s a very well-made soundtrack in general, and it\u2019s a really fun listen whether in or out of context.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is called Futatsu no Kodou to Akai Tsumi by On/Off, and as far as the song goes, it\u2019s awesome. It takes the same tone and style as the soundtrack and turns it fast and catchy without bastardizing it. The video, on the other hand... Remember when I said the show occasionally uses pretentious editing? They go full tilt with it here. This single video crams in as much imagery as it can, somehow making time to go through that old clich\u00e9 of having the camera pan past all the supporting characters in a single shot. It\u2019s a busy op where there\u2019s way too much going on visually, which is why I kind of appreciate the much slower pace of the ending theme\u2019s video a little more. Still Doll by Kanon Wakeshima is probably the best piece in the entire soundtrack, at least in terms of composition and singing talent alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub, on the other hand, is ghastly. To start off on a positive note, there are two really good performances in this, with one of them of course coming from the celebrated VA Vic Mignona in the role of Zero, a character constantly going through some sort of physical or emotional turmoil, which Vic pulls off flawlessly. The other is by Laura Bailey, playing the role of the deliciously evil villain Maria, who sadly doesn\u2019t enter the story until episode 9. She\u2019s able to play both halves of her character in equally convincing fashions, and she doesn\u2019t just do this by changing her voice... No, they\u2019re two completely different characters in one, which she handles like the pro she is.\\n\\n\r\nAll right, let\u2019s rip this band-aid right off. In the role of Yuki Cross, we have Mela Lee, one of my least favorite voice actors ever. She\u2019s more or less okay with her characters awkward or comedic scenes, but anywhere else, she alternates between sounding wooden and sounding like a deflating balloon. She also gets on a lot of viewers nerves by mispronouncing Kaname\u2019s name with a distinct \u2018meh\u2019 at the end. But oh, speaking of Kaname, at least Yuki doesn\u2019t sound like a synthesized computer voice. You can partially blame this on the character, but good voice actors can make a character sound good even without inflections. Somebody like Crispin Freeman could have killed this role.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other assorted characters played by actors who don\u2019t do a very bad job, but aside from Bryce Papenbrook as Hanabusa, Travis Willingham as Kaname\u2019s best friend Toga and a delightful cameo appearance by Jamieson Price, they don\u2019t get much in the way of screen time or lines. For the most part, their role in the story is to gush about how awesome Kaname is and dump exposition for the audience, and they do a serviceable job of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub was written to be extremely faithful to the source material, with the only changes made being in the interest of matching the on-screen lip flaps. Believe it or not, this was kind of a bad idea. The dialogue is very literal, with little to no subtlety in any of it. As much as I hate using Family Guy as an example of anything, do you remember the Handiquacks episode, where Meg, Chris and Peter are trying to write their pilot? The dialogue in Vampire Knight sounds closer to what Chris and Peter settled on than the far more engaging line that Meg suggested. Everything is blatant and explanatory, making the characters sound stilted and downright boring.\\n\\n\r\nThis is unusual for me, but I actually wish somebody had tweaked the dialogue to sound more flavorful... I\u2019m not talking about crow-barring in slang terms or pop culture references, but it would have been nice to hear some double-talk and sly innuendos tying the thirst for blood to more basic impulses. Or at the very least, have the characters be a little more vague about their plans and motives so that the audience actually has something to think about. The only character who actually speaks with any subtlety or ambiguity is Maria, and Laura Bailey does have a lot of fun with this, but it only lasts for a single episode before her identity is revealed and she rejoins the rest of the cast in mediocrity\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of times in this season alone where two characters will have a conversation that goes along the lines of \u201cHey, remember that thing we both know about that the audience doesn\u2019t?\u201d \u201cYes, I do, and I\u2019ll explain it to you, for no other reason than just to prove it! Seriously! No other reason!\u201d And that\u2019s just when they manage to avoid the most cliched exposition set-up in anime history, \u201cAs you know...\u201d Rewrites are not a bad thing when done right, and Vampire Knight seriously needed one. If you need any more proof of this, there\u2019s a scene in episode 9 where Zero gets scolded for not referring to a pure-blood with the proper honorific... Despite the fact that the dub has no honorifics. Go ahead and listen to it if you really want to hear Vic and Laura chew the scenery, but otherwise, stick to the subs on this one.\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn\u2019t notice from my plot summary, Vampire Knight follows what sounds... At least to me... like a flawed concept. Maybe I\u2019m just thinking about this all wrong, but if you\u2019re trying to encourage the peaceful cohabitation of humans and vampires... Maybe you want to let the humans know about it at some point? Maybe you\u2019d want them to go to school together, under close supervision, rather than holding the humans just out of reach like a tasty snack that they\u2019ll want even more because they can\u2019t have it? Because every time these two classes meet, the chance for danger is so high that they needed to implement a disciplinary committee. And hell, it\u2019s not like the sunlight kills the vamps. They just get sunburned... Which somehow makes less sense than the whole sparkly thing.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I haven\u2019t heard anybody make that complaint before, I have heard pretty much every other complaint this series receives. A lot of them are from Twilight haters claiming it\u2019s the anime answer to that sorry franchise, while a lot more of them criticize it on technical issues, or they just call it flat out boring. Yeah, this show doesn't have a very good reputation. Even Watchmojo, a Youtube channel that considers Naruto and Pokemon to be two of the top ten best anime ever made, didn\u2019t even bother to include Vampire Knight on their top ten anime vampires list, despite Zero and Maria being pretty good candidates for it. So for everything that it does wrong, does it do anything right?\\n\\n\r\nQuite a few things, actually. Vampire Knight is a paranormal romance story through-and-through, belonging to the same genre as Twilight and it\u2019s various knockoffs. The point of these titles is to be a sexy, romantic escapist fantasy for women, although target age may differ. Vampire Knight is about as good as a paranormal romance can get, as it succeeds at a few basic elements that Twilight failed at. First of all, in regards to the main love triangle, you never have to wonder why those two paranormal dudes are after that bland, bitchy Bella chick. Zero and Yukis relationship leaves absolutely no question about why they\u2019re so close or why there\u2019s so much unresolved tension between them, and while Kaname\u2019s intentions aren\u2019t made clear until season 2, you can still tell at an early stage that there\u2019s some substance to it beyond him just being a creeper. Also, I hate to say it, Vampire Knight is actually really sexy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s a ton of fanservice, exposed skin and big boobs. At best, Zero takes his shirt off a few times. The sexuality in this show is something far more subtle than that.\\n\\n\r\nSee, the school is divided between two classes. The night class, the vampires, are mature, introspective, experienced, and generally carry an air of superiority. The night class, made up of humans, come off as much younger in comparison, despite being physically the same age. They\u2019re naive, and they worship the night class, but interaction is forbidden... The vampires can only drink blood from other vampires, while the humans are left to wonder what goes on in the other class, having no idea what the truth of it all is, and yes, there\u2019s heavy temptation on both sides. The metaphor behind all of this... Yes, Vampire Knight has a metaphor, close your jaws... Is about sexuality. Vampires represent the sexually active, while humans represent the virginal. That\u2019s why the opening song\u2019s title translates to \u201cTwo beating hearts and the crimson sin...\u201d The blood in your heart is the sin.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you\u2019re going to sexualize vampires, you have a very fine line you need to be careful not to cross. Vampire bites aren\u2019t always consensual, and a series that handles itself poorly could become rapey as a result. Long time readers will remember me criticizing Diabolik Lovers for exactly that problem. Non-consensual biting does occur in Vampire Knight, but unless it\u2019s being used for tension, it\u2019s considered a bad thing... Zero is so ashamed after he bites Yuki for the first time that he begs her to kill him before he gets worse, and doesn\u2019t touch her again until she freely offers herself to him. Moments of tension between these two occur in a dimly lit bathroom, in the school pool, and in an empty part of the school where SHE LETS HIM BITE HER FROM BEHIND, turning the act of vampirism into an erotic sort of forbidden fruit.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why Vampire Knight resonates so strongly with it\u2019s target audience. This is why people like myself, who are still as far away from that target audience as possible, can still find it so damned addictive. It\u2019s engaging not because of it\u2019s low-stakes plot or it\u2019s terrible writing, but because of its sexuality. And even if you don\u2019t pick up on any of that, the main plot-line is still pretty interesting. Having one of your main characters struggling to resist becoming a vampire with every fiber of his being while a girl who cares about him tries her best to ease his pain while setting respectable boundaries is a concept you simply can\u2019t screw up, and it makes borderline Mary-Sue Yuki into a much stronger character as a result.\\n\\n\r\nThis plot-line will make up for all the other boring or confusing stuff, leading you all the way to a cliff-hanger that will leave you salivating for a second season... Which unfortunately exists. Yeah, I\u2019m not going to talk too much about Vampire Knight Guilty, as I\u2019m only reviewing season one, but it\u2019s worth noting that in my opinion, that season is just one long, consistent journey downhill. It brings fatalism into the arcs of our three main characters, rendering all of the choices they\u2019d made throughout the series pointless and ending in a conclusion that would have pissed me off even if it was conclusive... Which it wasn\u2019t. But at least the first season makes you WANT a sequel, which is something.\\n\\n\r\nVampire Knight is available from Viz media. You can watch the entire series for free on their site, or if you\u2019d rather own the physical copy, you can find the DVD sets at a reasonable price both in stores and online. The second season, Guilty, can also be found the same way, or you can just buy all 26 episodes together. The original manga by Matsuri Hino is also available stateside from the same company, or just in old issues of Shoujo Beat. The live action musical is totally a thing that exists, and if you don\u2019t need subtitles, you can view the whole thing on Youtube.\\n\\n\r\nVampire Knight is everything a trashy paranormal romance should be. It\u2019s romantic, it\u2019s sexual, it plays very sincerely with the concepts of forbidden love and loss of innocence, and it even manages to squeeze in some homoeroticism at the last minute without ever breaking from context or character. Having said that, good trash is still trash, and being a more serviceable version of Twilight still leaves a lot to be desired. I enjoyed it for what it was, and I\u2019m likely to keep my DVD set despite the unfortunate festering growth that\u2019s attached to it. I won\u2019t hold the second season\u2019s failings against it, though... On it\u2019s own, I give Vampire Knight a surprisingly decent 5/10.",

So much so that it overshadows some of the characters and they do not get equal screen time, so they're just kind of there. Though since it was minor it was fairly easy to ignore in the thick of it, but did take away from my score. \r\nDespite the creepy feel it fortunately wasn't too gory atall. Some blood but not copious amounts. We're faced with some really tense moments which kept me hooked.\\n\r\nKnew how to change pace, when one story was too heavy going, the writers knew when to switch it up to keep it fresh and interesting,\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nRather good. Though in some ways I feel it could've been better, They move rather stiff like marionettes and the expressions sometimes don't suit the emotions that are meant to be conveyed in certain situations but generally beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIntro/ending songs pretty good. Catchy, It'll be unlikely forget them, suits the tone of the series.  VA's good but sometimes could've been better, but definitely not the worst VA's.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nPretty good. The headmaster serves as our primary source of comic relief amongst a very serious cast. Some are a bit underdelvoped given the time but this is somewhat remedied in '...Guilty'\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nKinda spoilery? I'll still try to remain as vague as I can but you might want to click 'show less' now.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I found to be quite odd is that Yuki is faced with a Dilemma later in the series. Something which she couldn't have been able to do, Yet we are not indulged in what she thought of this. When faced with the request I thought 'whoa!! what's she gonna do about this?!' turns out not much at all...and it's shrugged off in a matter of seconds despite the difficult situation it put her in.\\n\\n\r\nAnother instance which confused me was she had a flashback Yuki had of Kaname doing something she thought he'd never do. It was not clear to me if it was a fellow night class student, who had just been talking about something similar. Or an innocent person. Neither one we're indulged to find out which. And it's left there and not mentioned again.",

And then rescued by another. Now 10 years later, Yuki Cross, the adopted daughter of the headmaster of Cross Academy, has grown up and become a guardian of the vampire race, protecting her savior, Kaname, from discovery as he leads a group of vampires at the elite boarding school. But also at her side is Zero Kiryu, a childhood friend who\u2019s hatred for the creatures that destroyed everything he held dear, is now determined never to trustthem. This coexisting arrangement seems all well and good, but have the vampires truly renounced their murderous ways, or is there a darker truth behind their actions. Is Kaname's infatuation with Yuki the beginning of a forbidden romance, or is it something in her forgotten past that draws him to her. Because in this world of secrets, nothing is as it seems. And the price of misplaced trust may even be worse than death.\\n\\n\r\nReview:First thoughts on this anime was amazing! If you love the supernatural genre but want a bit of romance in there too then this is a perfect anime for you.

            "content": "Ohkay, here it goes.\r\nStory-\r\n  What really bothered me about the story was how in the beginning, it was introducing everything that the story was about. and once you get further into the story it leaves you on the edge of your chair just waiting to see what happens. By the time I finished the first season, I was jumping off my bed eager to know what's going to happen next. Season Two, I would say, in my opinion, and bare with me here, did not move forward. What I mean by that, during the first season, the story was actually getting to the plot,and what lead to it, but once the plot hit, it's mystery after mystery after mystery after mystery! First, we have Yuki, I still don't understand her past, even though she kept flash-backing to it. Kaname, I'm not even going to start on him. He's just a book with blank pages. You literally have to find the right words and letters somewhere in this world in order to understand how he came about. And Zero, him I wasn't that disappointed with, to me, it explained his....well, everything, his whole life, pretty much. I just had this feeling inside me that kept thinking wait, there's something more to this, I just know it. Yet, it left us hanging, hanging for so long I almost gave up and took the fall. \\n\r\n   Another thing that bothered me about the story, was the ending. This is the biggest disappointment EVER because after EVERYTHING that Zero and Yuki have been through, he still turns the other cheek, BUT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. I'm not to spoil the end.... Didn't he love her..? It was damn obvious to me despite the fact that it wasn't mentioned AT ALL. I hate.... hate.. how just because Yuki turns a completely different leaf, he automatically thinks, \"because she turned a new leaf, all that we have been through, all that she meant to me, is irrelevant.\" despite the fact that he's a vampire hunter, I still lost some hope in them two, regardless of Yuki and Kaname, I think Zero and Yuki would be better together. It really disappointed me. But that's just my opinion.Also, at the end you see someone, I'm not going to say whom, getting a flashback and, I'm telling you, I cried the MOST at that part. I hope it will get to you as it did to me, because it was just completely sad and the thought of it being all over makes me want to cry again. AND... at the end you see two people, I'm not going to say whom, go off on their own and then you realize. Shit, where's ______!! While I was watching, I completely forgot about this character and I cried because I realized where he was. Another mystery that I want to be solve because what if I'm wrong.? And at the very very end, when you see Zero and what he does, that right there gave me tiny bit of hope, but inside I feel like the hope will just be a waste. I actually cried because Yuki and Zero are no longer close. It broke my heart into a billion pieces, you can't imagine how heartbroken I am. \\n\r\n   BUT.... I really love the story as well.... Just soo many shocking truths when the mysteries do get solved. I screamed in shock so loud I think I woke up my neighbors from across the street.And I did that almost every episode... maybe twice. I love everything, but the ending... It disappointed me so much that I was balling(crying immensely) but I also cried because it wasn't what I expected from the 3 main characters, Kaname, Yuki and Zero. And because the series was over as well, but mostly the first two.\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\n   The art was beautiful! I love the details, including Zero's tattoo and the veins and how they drew the night class students, they look gorgeous! Also, the bodies look incredibly amazing, and I put emphasis on the bodies because other animes would make them too tall, or too skinny that they look like twigs or tooth pick dolls walking and talking, it wasn't appealing to me. \\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\n   I LOVE the songs chosen for the openings and endings for both season, especially the ending for Season Two, because it was more of a creepy, scary , feeling and I think it fit the genre of the story well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\n   Ohkay, I'm not going to spend my time on this one because I spent a lot of time on just the story. \\n\r\n   First off, Yuki. Because of her, half of the drama and supernatural things that happened, probably wouldn't have happened if she wasn't so selfish. Yuki pissed me off half of the time I watch it because she was too clueless to the point where it's not even cute anymore, and she was selfish, especially towards Zero. Poor Zero, I cried for him every time Yuki did something that hurt him. She is also stubborn, especially at the end. It got me soo mad because people were risking their lives for her and she decides to be an idiot and do things her way. But that was in the beginning of the end.. If that makes sense. Because if it wasn't for her, the ending would not have ended the way it did and the ending would've have been a lot more disappointing than it already is. \\n\r\n   Then you have Kaname. Like I said, a huge book with blank pages. He is still filled with mystery and I gave up, hoping that I can be able to look into the manga and actually find the gates to Kaname. Other than that, I would want someone like Kaname, because to me, throughout the story, he was the one who was hurt the most. And it was all for Yuki. Kaname still is mysterious and I have a gut feeling that he will remain mysterious, which gets me aggravated because that makes the story less enjoyable.\\n\r\n   Last is Zero. Zero is, well, Zero. There's not much to say about him other than him having a huge grudge on Kaname and anyone who is related or associated with him. And towards the end, I feel like someone needs to hit him with a bloody rock and tell him to wake up and let it go. But Zero is also a guy who just hates himself, yet wants to make Yuki happy regardless if that means giving up his life for her. I cried so much for Zero. Yuki doesn't even realizes what she has, she's so selfish she just wants it all but doesn't look in front of her and sees what she already has. What saddens me the most is how he hasn't changed perspective at all in the end, and how he will just be miserable because of a grudge that's holding him back from moving on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\n   In general, I enjoyed it, some of the episodes were a bit too scary where I was scared to sleep at night, but I enjoyed the excitement. I enjoyed how I was always on alert and on the edge of my seat anxious to know what would happen next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\n  Overall, it was amazing.. just amazingly beautiful. I loved it. I would say I would watch it again, but I think the excitement would begin to fade because I know how the story went. It really saddens me now that it's all over, and I wish there were more seasons and episodes because this series is truly one of the best, I love the plot twistings, the drama, the tension between the main characters, all of it. Even if it pissed me off a little bit and disappointed me greatly in the end, I think that not all endings are complete endings, let alone happy, and I think the ending just leaves you more on the edge of your seat to the point where you're already sitting on the floor. I realized that there is more drama than there is romance; its almost 50/50, but the drama is a bit greater. I recommend this to those who love the thrill, the excitement, the cliff hangers, the plot twisting, the journey of a love triangle, and maybe even like getting aggravated over it. It's a good story, and it makes you want to get more into it. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this was helpful :) \\n\r\nAnd arigatoo for taking the time to read this ^-^",

The first season has a few weak points in the story (that I will address shortly) that pushed me into not finishing it the first time I began watching the series. What I was really obsessed with was the music. I absolutely love the ending and opening themes for this season of Vampire Knight. But music does not make an anime.\r\nThe plot line in this series starts out slow with a whole lot of foreshadowing. Nothing too interesting happens until about episode 10. I find this fact to be sort of frustrating, but the interestingside stories and character interactions kept me interested well enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the story are very well thought out, though could use more background story to all of them - at least in this season. The length of time it learned to discover anything about the main characters sort of made me want to pull my hair out, but what the series lacks in time-management, it certainly makes up for in foreshadowing.\\n\\n\r\nThe character voices in both English and Japanese are superb, though I prefer the Japanese cast. Overall, I give this particular season an 8 and have high hopes for season two!",

Actually, yeah, Vampire Knight's not very much like Twilight at all, except for the vampires in school element.\r\nVampire Knight handles light and shadows very well, giving normal, everyday scenes a gothic feel. But the main thing I love is of course Zero Kiryu, the Draco Malfoy-esque character to offset the Harry-like Kaname. I love love love the interactions between Zero and his twin, Ichiru (voiced brilliantly by the same seiyu, Mamoru Miyano).\r\nThere's alsoa super-interesting almost-love triangle between Zero, Kaname, and Yuki Cross, our heroine. Why is it not a 10, then? The ending! [Mild spoiler:] Kind of deus ex machina and Yuki changes overnight into someone we don't really know, leaving us lost and really befuddled by her choices. I would have ended it much differently.",

Having the diverse of characters as well as the different plots, made this anime very enjoyable. \r\nThe music in this series was...amazing. I have no other way to put it.

Lizzy forced me to watch and I instantly fell in love with it ! The show has characters that are dimensional and the animation is rough and everything is drawn with exact perfection. The coloring is of the dark midnights of the underworld .Plus  the music is deep and is intense and quite catchy XD I love the violin pieces and started to learn how to play its sweet sad sounds.t I likeabout this anime is they don't make vampires so glamorous o. They actually make it  more like a progressive disease or like a drug addict . They make it  suck to be a vampire ( no pun intended ) \\n\\n\r\n    The story is a girl who is the protector of the day and night class. But the night class is a bunch of  hot vampires! She has to deal with keeping this secret , her love that is forbidden for Kaname and trouble (hot ) guy friend who is going through the phases of turning into a monster. Also it's not like love triangle situation though it might seem like that. To me Yuuki and Zero are sorta like brother and sister and it's just killing her that he is dealing with extreme pain. Kaname ( vampire kingish hottie and the guy I ) Has known Yuuki for a long time and it is just beautiful! This anime is dramatic, mysterious, dark , funny and one of the best vampire genre you can read or watch . X3 You will find the ultimate hotness factor ! seriously I feel sad for my brother because for 3 nights he kept hearing over and over \" OMG KANAME IS SO HOT!!!!! I WANT HIM TO BITE ME!!!! \" or \" Poor zero he is just a pity situation :/ POOOOORRR ZERO!!! \"  * ultimate fangirl moments * \\n\\n\r\nwatch it now !!!!! It is 10 times better than Twilight !!! GET IT GET IT GET IT ok now I'm going so I can finally finish the series ! Bye bye\\n",

But I'll vouch for the former. And I think VampKnight can pull a better Twilight because the vampires herein are more devious, more human, and less tolerant of #### (thanin more otaku-esque animu about vampires).\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I'll admit: VampKnight DOES have its small share of lulz. However...\\n\\n\r\nVampKnight is quite stern and solid for something about a bunch of vampires trying their best to play nice with the humans they share the air with. The few mediators they have are doing the best they can to keep this pot from boiling over. Yet these outside interferences, AND the fact that one of them's turning into a vampire...\\n\\n\r\nI also don't agree with theme of how vampires should hold their lust for blood in check. Vampires are bloodsuckers. They don't have to kill their prey, but they do it to survive, last I checked.",

The comedy wasn't funny enough, the drama wasn't dramatic enough, the romance wasn't passionate enough. I think it tried to be too many things and failed at everything.\r\nI'm not a fan of slice-of-life animes.

I felt like it needed to in order to make it feel more bitter-sweet during the ending of Season 2. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like Yuki, again the premise of her character seemed cool, but it just never delivered. Her character seemed COMPLETELY out of place the entire time. Like I said earlier, it felt more like she belonged in a slice-of-life anime.

Sorry, going to have to put these somewhere. I will start with with the heroine. Yuki Cross annoys me quite a bit with her overly perky and prodding behavior. I'm not saying I dislike her per-se, just that I am annoyed by her personality. I also find that her eyes are drawn very large and I feel that they don't have character in them, and they don't suit thesmall mouth drawn for her. Though needless to say, she is a unique and independent character, and I admire her for that.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the pros! So many of the characters are so darn likable! For example, Zero Kiryu. He is a strong character for the series, and the inner conflict only helps with that. Another one of my favorite characters has to be Headmaster Kaien Cross. Excluding the scenes that show him as a foolish, silly, na\u00efve imbecile. Other than those scenes, I admire that he has a level-headed wise personality, a mentor. Overall, the art is good, and the backgrounds are absolutely wonderful. The sound quality is good and I am enjoying the series quite a bit. \\n\\n\r\nAdding to the cons, though, would have to be all of the love-struck girls of the school, and it seems that Sayori Wakaba is the only rational, level-headed girl to attend. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, this is what I have concluded after watching three episodes, and I'm sure Vampire Knight makes drastic changes in episodes I still have yet to watch.",

            "content": "What went wrong?\r\nI went into this anime knowing it was a drama and was excited when the opening themes were more realistic and less Twilight.  I just don't know why the writing team choose the directions they did. \r\nThe Good:\r\nAnimation, Sound, majority of the Character Ark's, as well as the story foundation.\r\nThe Bad: \r\nThe main character is a chump and there's no reason behind it and the show has an underlying case of \"Pseudo Action\" there's a bit of fighting and combat but it didn't seem to to hold any weight or seen like the fights are significant enough even though there is plentyof buildup to the fights.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ugly:\\n\r\nMy biggest issue was not the awful Anti Climactic ending our even the unnecessary end kill promises between Yuri and Zero...\\n\r\nIt was the Story Continuity Error. Early and middle of the first season they explain how becoming a Vampire works and how to avoid becoming a monster servant (degrading level E) and how to counteract any issues...AND THEN IGNORE THE RULES, they spend the time and effort to explain the rules of Pure, Reg and E and then just start skipping and ignoring things.\\n\r\n      I had to watch it in English to make sure I had understood and rules and reading the reviews nobody has brought this up...like at all.\\n\r\nI'm so confused as to why they just ignored it and I would have easily accepted a Strawman Excuse like \"chosen one\" or \"Cursed one\" but no! No one either acknowledges or wasn't paying attention to the rules.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nWatch it if you want to watch a really rough piece of coal that had the potential of a diamond. This was and ok watch but a disappointment in many areas. \\n\r\nI hope the sequel series has some answers, good luck out there\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Art: The art style for Vampire Knight is indeed beautiful and original for all the characters appearances fit their personalities. The backgrounds are drawn very well and nothing seems out of place. Especially, since this anime was made in 2008 which was a time when anime was still in its \" experimental stage\". I would have given this anime a 10/10 in art but the hairstyles bothered me since many of the characters looked like they never bothered to cut or brushed their hairs in years so I'll go with 9/10.\r\nSound: The sound work for this anime was without of doubt excellent in thisanime. The soundtrack fit every scene perfectly and the sub and dub work was fantastic as well. All the voice actors for Vampire knight with the exception of Yuki Cross was well executed. Yuki's English voice actor sounded honestly mediocre and for some reason had a hard time pronouncing Kaname Kuran's first name right. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the voice work for this anime Japanese & English that is. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The main character Yuki Cross can be described in one word by everyone who watch this show. \" Pathetic\". She spends most of her time crying about not  being able to help Zero and lets her get into some kind of danger only for Zero and Kaname to save her ass. She can't do anything on her own and when confronted with a problem she runs away from it. She's a bland and forgettable as the main female lead. Kaname was a creepy stalker who had the hots for his own ( spoiler )..... ugh just thinking about it grosses me out. Zero was the only normal and decent one out of the three main characters. His love for Yuki was explained well and reasonable unlike Kaname and on top of that he is actually strong and dependable. Kaname has bad vibes coming from him just by looking at him. The side characters were interesting since they were actually developed. Hanabusa's reason for worshiping Kaname is pretty passionate and Kaien Cross' love for his children was very strong and you could actually feel the bond between him and his family. I could mention other characters but this section is getting way too long. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: I fell asleep while watching this anime which rarely happens even if I am watching an anime at 3:00 am because I'd still be awake but this anime actually bored me to sleep. The plot was dull and forgettable simple as that. This anime is short so it shouldn't have any filer episodes but there were way too many filer episodes. Far too many sexually provocative blood draining scenes that was time consuming ( I mean there's like seven scenes in the anime where Zero keeps drinks Yuki's blood it's too many and takes up way too much time.) This anime also has incestuous elements to it which is a major instant turn off. I'd rather watch the last few episodes of Death Note than this snore fest. I'm not gonna include shit from the manga because news flash this isn't the manga.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This anime wasn't awful but it's nothing that I'd watch twice. I guess since It was really boring  I didn't really understand half of it. But if the plot was decent, with the art style and music as well as the dub work this anime could have been a masterpiece. But sadly, the plot and characters just dragged it down. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're interesting kinky romance sucking blood and hot guys shit like that or just have a lot of free time this is the anime for you. But for those who are looking an interesting anime about vampires here's a list of decent vampire animes:\\n\\n\r\n1 Hellsing/Ultimate ( Violence and War )\\n\r\n2 Shiki ( Survival )\\n\r\n3 Seraph of the End ( Friendship/ Family and War )\\n\r\n4 Blood Lad ( This shits hilarious )\\n\r\n5 Jojo's Bizarre adventure ( violence and profanity)\\n\r\n6 Trinity Blood ( Masterpiece)\\n\r\n7 Servamp ( In case you're into hot guys and fights because it was actually pretty good )\\n\r\n8 Blood C (epic Fightsssssss )\\n\r\n9 Bakemonogartari series ( This is so bad that its good )\\n\r\n10 Vampire Hunter D ( very short but interesting)\\n\\n\r\nVampire animes to avoid: Diabolik lovers because that shit will make you die and come back to life just to commit suicide again\\n\\n\r\nItsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi: I can't describe how cringy and awful this anime is",

            "content": "The most beautifully drawn characters I've ever laid my eyes upon. I am in love.\r\nBut, that doesn't mean this one's my favorite.\r\nFor despite it's a pretty art, the story is kind of unsatisfying. \r\nHere is why: the characters have their own uniqueness, but some have their missing pieces. Especially Yuki, who joins the bandwagon of damsell-in-distress (ugh, I hate those) that later becomes powerful. For some arbitrary reason. \r\nAnd the most powerful tool a writer could come in force with, is the reasoning.\r\nThere is not much reasoning in Vampire Knight now, is there? \r\nExcept for the part where one girl falls in love with thevampire, the vampire likes her back, and it's a love triangle--! The author seems confused on whether he should give Yuki to Kaname or Zero, anyway, for both of them are gorgeous and eternally broken. And I believe that 'that' romance made this anime stand out. People in general will always look for a love to suck on to, that they will feel like they're in a sort of paradise--in Vampire Knight, the romance focuses on a love based on protection, temptation, for the sake of vampirism. Had they become humans, there wouldn't be a story, but I think that's unfair to the author. I do respect the maker of this, since it's a story based entirely on fantasy that only lacked the logic of reason, and consistent plot magnets.\\n\\n\r\nPlot magnets are, compelling--obviously--but they're almost perfect that the bullet holes are patched up. In Vampire Knight, like I said, it's like the plot lost the connection of the dots. Fair enough, the beauty of this anime is that ignorant bliss that some romance will only taste sweetly once it last longs. Luckily, Vampire Knight lasted for 2 seasons. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I kept sucking onto it. For the sake of the taste. Not really because I was being guilty of my vampirism. \\n\\n",

It is what started my love for anime, so I decided to revisit it.\r\nStory 9/10 - It's unique to itself from what I can see, and I love how the characters interacted with each other. Sure, it did sometimes seem as if someone was doing something for no reason, but everything was eventually revealed. I would love to see the anime surpass what it already has.\r\nArt 10/10 - The art is beautiful and well made. Art styles are very important for me, and most times I tend to stray away from old art styles. Although sometimes Iwould gawk at some very 'broad' shoulders.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 - I did this mainly because the voices rarely portrayed what emotion the character was showing. Also, some voices were a bit .... different.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10 - The characters were intriguing and each would surprise you in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 - The anime was something great to come back to and revigorate my love for anime.

            "content": "If the Twilight movies were a cartoon that was orchestrated properly to form a coherent plot aside from the love triangle, it would be called vampire knight. Rather than being a dig at this anime, I say this as a positive. The other side of the coin is that, while better than the twilight movies, I've seen more intelligent conversation in OHSHC (host club for non otaku).\r\nStory: 4\r\nA solid 4. A VERY solid 4. The show is entertaining to watch at a base level. That being said, if you like surprises, look slightly further. Maybe a little more to the left? I could accurately describein detail to my friend how the season would end from the first three episodes or so alone. I don't recommend this show as a \"I'm going to sit down and watch this!\" show. Leave it running in the dubbed (cringe if you will but the dub was very well done for this show) while you write a paper or something. Odds are you won't miss anything.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI am probably being overly generous here by a full point or more. I personally liked the art style because it suited the genre. Those of you able to find symbolism in little ways will pick up on strange character effects that give a somewhat deeper insight into who they are. The biggest reason i give this a 7 is that IT EXISTS IN THE WONDERFUL REALM OF 1080p! Who doesn't love high resolution vampires? Most of you? got it\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nIf you don't watch the show (I gained nothing from either season) then at least do one thing for me. LISTEN TO THE OPENING AND CLOSING SONG OF THE FIRST AND SECOND SEASON! I'M BEGGING! The intro manages to be a spectacular display of the characters without revealing any key plot points or over insights into future plotlines. The music is so perfectly and flawlessly orchestrated that I had to rewind at times just to experience the sound again. The glorious and beautiful music. Oh. And the actor's voices were... adequate? The voice actors could have been better cast. Easily. But I found it worth it for the MUSIC! The music is actually the sole reason I'm writing this recommendation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nIn a word? Bland. Nothing new or insightful was born from these characters, and the relationships between different individuals were dully executed from the get go. Nothing new, nothing creative, and no reason I should use more than 4 lines to describe characters I cant even name now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/3\\n\r\nIt's a good show to have in the background while you do other things because it keeps your interest enough to make you listen without forcing you to focus on the show solely. If you're going to do the usual anime thing and only sit and watch it, I'd have to rate this show a blatant 3. It's boring and shallow. Nothing of note aside from the love triangle (I do like the triangle though).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nHonestly not worth watching the show to watch the show. I can't think of anything that would make me recommend this show other than the music unless you liked Twilight. If you DID like Twilight, however, this show does the forbidden love triangle and vampires in general SO much better than the movies did.",

            "content": "Let me first state that if you have never watched vampire knight, you are missing out.  Missing out on what? You ask. Well, the art of course!  Granted, it's not nearly as beautiful as the manga, but it's still pretty good (minus occasional fight scenes).  In fact, the whole reason I continued watching through all episodes of Vampire Knight and Guilty, was because of it.  It's so detailed and the colors are so dark and gorgeous that it held my interest the entire time.  I kept wondering how long it took them to draw all those scenes (I have noidea how they animated it-for the record) with each character having such detailed clothes and hair and eyes.  Crazy.\\n\\n\r\nSo what did I think of the rest of it?\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSimilar to every vampire romance.  Not necessarily my cup of tea, but hey if you take the story apart to it's core: vampires living among humans, it's pretty interesting.  (the whole romance thing overshadows the politics and nuances of it in every story like this though)  I am reading the manga, which is ongoing, so I would recommend to people who think the anime has no plot: read it.  After it gets past where the anime is; it gets more interesting, trust me.  They address some pretty interesting topics.  It's a shame the anime never touched on them.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs other reviews have mentioned; the music is great.  The opening and closing have a sort of dark beauty to them.  I liked the first opening a lot.  The soundtrack itself is decent as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs mentioned, this is like most vampire romances and the characters follow that theme as well.  There's one girl with two guys that will cause a ship-war for the followers.  Much like the Edward and Jacob war of Twilight, you're bound to see Zero fans vs. Kaname fans online.  Yuuki isn't quite as needy as Bella, though, so that's good.  Actually I found the supporting characters more interesting.  The Night Class and the Hunter's Association have more drama between them (drama that I found more interesting than the romance aspect) than Zero and Kaname, well, almost.  I found Cross's idea that vampires and humans could coexist interesting and...well, I don't want to spoil anything.  I do want to say this: they gave the supporting characters very little to do in the anime.  Again, I recommend reading the manga.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI liked looking at the art and listening to the music.  It was about more than purely the story for me, which is why I continued to Guilty and then later to the ongoing manga.  Yes, artwork got me to watch 26 episodes of an anime and read over 80 chapters of a manga; I liked it that much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed it and you might too!  Even someone who prefers her vampires to be evil and scary over romantic and jaded enjoyed this, so don't count it out yet!",

For starters the female lead was extremely irritating, from her infatuation with Kaname to her constantly being saved despite her cocky attitude and just annoying personality. She was just chasing after Zero all the time.\r\nNormally, I don't stop an anime based on it's arts but all the other factors that coincided with dropping this anime just helped to the fact that I wasn't a fan of the art style, not that it was bad, just that I wasn't a fan. Plus Yuki's eyes, were just a bit creepy.\r\nI was never really into vampires anyway, but this anime wasjust on Netflix one night out of boredom, and I though why not. So that may have hindered my overall view slightly, but I doubt it.\\n\\n\r\nBut, if you're into anime with vampires, annoying leads, with no build up to big events and overall a disappointing climax. Each to their own.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI don't know about you, but the whole aspect of incest that followed, I was not a fan of.

            "content": "Vampire Knight was one of the first anime I ever watched, and I was into it right away. I think I was drawn in originally by the music and art style, both of which I will say are two of the strongest points of the show in my opinion. It was one of those shows that started out great for me and progressively went down hill as time went on. \r\nNot to say that I didn't like the entire first season. I did. It was the second season that I didn't like as much. But I'll talk about that another time.\r\nI was really drawn inby the story from the start, partially because at the time I was really into vampires and pretty much liked anything that had vampires in it. I liked the dark tone and the drama, and I felt like that meshed really well with the gorgeous soundtrack to make a really interesting anime that I couldn't pull myself away from. I actually liked it so much that I started reading the manga, as well, which was even more beautiful, artistically, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I enjoyed the story, however, I couldn't say so much for the characters. I wasn't a huge fan of either Kaname or Zero: Kaname pretentious and conceited, which I guess he had a reason to be since he was so powerful. I'll admit he was pretty awesome in that respect, but mostly I just wanted to slap him. I liked Zero just a bit better, but all of his whining about hating vampires and hating his existence got a little old eventually. Yuki was okay, but I just felt like there was nothing unique about her to make her stick in my mind. As for the rest of the characters... none of them really resonated with me. I kind of liked Yori later on even though she was a minor character. I just thought she was sweet.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, overall the first season of Vampire Knight was something I really enjoyed. I'll never get over that seriously chilling soundtrack. I guess maybe, if you like vampire love triangles I might recommend it to you.",

            "content": "This review is spoiler-free.\r\nI am sad to admit that it is rare that I find an anime that has an actual well-developed and original storyline. Luckily, Vampire Knight is one of them. \r\nBefore I started Vampire Knight, I had very low expectations for the series. The animation style seemed sloppy, and the entire story seemed cliche and cheesy. This anime quickly changed my mind and erased all of my uncertainties.\r\nThe story is somewhat of a love-triangle, not gonna lie. But it\u2019s not bad at all! Even more than a love story, the series is action-packed, has well thought out dialogue, has amazing characters and characterdevelopment, and has many twists and turns that will make you want to keep watching episode after episode with no breaks in between.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is a must watch if you enjoy all of the above. There is lots of blood, and lots of feels. The story-line progresses wonderfully, and is complete throughout the beginning, middle, climax, and end. Nothing left me disappointed. I mean, a little more love action would be nice, but that\u2019s just because I\u2019m a perv.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sidenote, Vampire Knight Guilty is the second season that starts out right where the first season left off and should be watched directly after. \\n\\n\r\nBoth opening theme songs are awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few super epic twists that I hope don\u2019t get spoiled for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason this is an 8/10 and not higher, is mostly because of the animation. It\u2019s simply not my favorite style. A few things could also be a bit less cheesy, effects could be cooler. If the series was longer I probably would have enjoyed it more. \\n\\n\r\nThere you go, good luck and I hope you enjoy your Vampire Knight journey.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~Oddtakuu",

The only remotely cool thing is the vamp theme, but that's also over done. Music was cool. The story was average. I was bored. I watched the whole thing 'cause a girl I knew swore up and down that this was the holy grail. I felt like I was watching an animated twilight without the werewolves. Yuki or whatever her name was (god knows, I was so bored I can't even recall properly) was the average blushing chick who grows into a stronkgirl. Zero was weirdly obsessive protective dude. Kaname acted like the average upper-class snob. It doesn't get anymore detailed than this. And if you can draw some enjoyment out of the sizzling hunk of garbage this anime is, why even read reviews? You'll settle for anything.",

Unfortunately season 1 and season two just have 13 episodes each. Ugh. Why does good series have to be short always. What i love about Vampire Knight is just everything. From the genius story plot to the settings up to the characters..it's just amazing! The guys are freakin' hot especially Kiryuu Zero. I'm inlove with him actually. seriously. he's just so manly. The way he speaks, he acts, and he loves. i just wish the female protagonist, Kuran Yuuki, ended up with him.Ugh. he did not. Anyway, as the title says it is about vampires. and who may you ask the vampire knight? find out for yourself haha. kidding. spoiler warning! Zero-sama is the knight. the strongest one as Kuran Kaname said, the real love interest of Yuuki. Each of the vampires have their own loved ones. only few loved each other mutually because if someone loved someone, that someone loved other someone.haha.i strongly recommend this for otakus who are into romance, bloody, suspense, comedy, types of genre. If you know Blood+, surely you will love this more. the sketch of the characters are very perfect. you would almost wish they are real people. i just wish they are real people. if i were Yuuki, i will go with Zero. i just can't accept the fact that she chose Kaname.argggh. i want more! i'm not satisfied huhuh. Hino-senpai, pls make more of Vampire Knight Guilty (season2). kahit manga lang that will do! hehe. well, you guys should watch this talaga. ne? pls comment on this review. hihi. arigato gozaimasu for reading. ja!",

The anime has got nothing bad in it and is very enjoyable.\r\nAlthough, if you watch this anime I suggest you read themanga afterwards or else the relationship between Kaname and Yuki will probably freak you our or scar you slightly. Reading the manga makes you understand that their relationship is definitely NOT how the anime has portrayed it.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the only thing that I disliked about the anime... the fact that they made a relationship between two of the characters seem worse than it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nApart from that it's a great anime and if you like Vampires I suggest you watch this ^_^",

            "content": "Are you interested in vampires? Tired of watching trite shoujo animes? Then you are warmly welcomed to read this review!\r\nThe story begins with a girl, whose memory starts on a snowy day, sitting on the velvet of snow in a desolate place. A vampire came to attack her and she was saved by a pureblood vampire named Kaname Kuran. Kaname took her to Kaien Cross who adopts her as his daughter. Giving her the name Yuki; meaning snow & Cross as surname. Soon Kaien establishes Cross academy for both human and vampires to create harmony among them. There exists the day class for humans andnight class for vampires. As only Yuki and a vampire hunter boy called Zero Kiryu knows about the existence of vampires, their job is to patrol the academy and protect the day class students living in the school dorm. While Kaname is the dorm president of the elite society\u2019s night class vampire students.\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Yuki, Zero and Kaname. Though Yuki is the main protagonist, the first season unfolds the story of Zero\u2019s sad past. Why? The season 2 will give its answer by itself. In season 2 Yuki\u2019s true identity is revealed. You will also realize why the title is \u201cknight\u201d instead of \u201cnight\u201d. And rather than the three of them meeting by fate, it was quite destined for them for the sake of their future. \\n\r\nEven though shoujo is one of its genre, it is totally different than most other shoujo animes. Now, what makes this huge difference? Most shoujo animes are involved with daily and love lives of high school going dreamy-looking, handsome guys and exceptional girls and nothing more than that. Yes, here also every guy is totally bishounen or good-looking type. Having a love-triangle, but there is mystery and supernatural added with it. It is an eerie shoujo anime with a mystical and gothic storyline. \\n\r\nThere are many people who watch either only shoujo or shounen anime. So it is kind of hard for them to have a different taste at once even if they want to. They are not used to it. That\u2019s why, if you want to have a new taste with both shoujo animes\u2019 romance and shounen animes\u2019 supernatural and mystery, this one is very good for you. Out of the clich\u00e9 plots, gives you the real vampirish mood. It is said that it is Twilight for those people who didn\u2019t like Twilight. The opening and ending themes are quite spooky.\\n\r\nThough it has a dark theme, it lacks action. Yuki has some immaturity. The relationship of Kaname and Yuki is kind of hard to stand after exposing the truth though in the manga it is also negated after the progression of the story. (which I\u2019m not revealing that for not spoiling)\\n\r\nIf you like it, you may follow the manga since the ending of the anime still leaves some mystery behind.\\n",

The characters were okay, Yuuki Cross comes off as a Mary-Sue, and so does Kaname Kuran...except he's a Gary-Stu. xD Zero Kiryu had to be my favorite character, he had character development throughout the show. I would say that I don't necessarily enjoy this anime. Some episodes weregood, but some weren't. Overall, I give this anime a...3 out of 5?

Well, i liked it in a way that, it was kept short and less complicated. There are some stuffs that i find annoying about the characters but still i enjoyed watching. To be specific with the character, the main heroine, \"Yuuki\". I find her a little bit helpless, like she always needs to be taken care of and when she said she's ready to help she will eventually turn to something like (sorry for lack of better word) useless.\r\nI'd saythe music, i mean are very very good. The opening song and the ending song are both fantastic! Eventhough some might think that the ending song is a bit creepy but hey! This is a vampire story so i guess, it cant be helped right ^_~ wink!",

            "content": "Twilight, Interview with the Vampire, and even Vampire Diaries are just some of the famous movies and shows that tackles vampires. Vampires has always been one of my biggest fascination and here I am about to express in details on why vampires has always been a hot topic nowadays and why Vampire Knight became one of them.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026.\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nFirst, it is a very common story for vampires to have a very gloomy life. In this series, we see how complicated can be the lives of vampires. Not only for the lowest type of vampires but for nobles and purebloods also. Wealways admire them and yet they are always portrayed as not so happy people. It serves like a moral lesson that even with so much power and long lives it still wouldn\u2019t give you an assurance of attaining happiness. We see vampires who do not want people around them turn into vampires and we also see human beings who wanted so bad to become a vampire.  After learning the truth about their lives and that vampire themselves is not so happy with their lives, you will realize the importance of being a human. The story itself might be gloomy and equipped with a very heavy drama however you can still get so excited by the storyline and main plot of the series. It is still interesting and anticipating to see how the story will go. The only thing that bothers me in the story is the romance part. One of the reasons why I love stories about vampires is because of their love story. Vampire\u2019s love story is always complicated which is very much different from your everyday love story and yet you can still feel the passion from them when they are in love. Because they\u2019ve been living for so long or can live for so long, vampires tend to either fool around with different people all their lives or search for that one true love. After finding that true love they will love that only person for the rest of their eternal lives. There is no half-hearted love when it comes to vampires and they are always so passionate about their love. The thing that bothers me is that it is an obvious fact that Yuki and Kaname are in love and yet it looks like to me that Yuki is more infatuated with Zero. In fact, there are moments when I thought that Kaname was just a third party and it is a love story between Yuki and Zero. Oh well, I guess it gives more a complicated touch to the story considering it is not just about the romance side of the story but more on the complicated lives of vampires that intertwines with humans.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe number one reason why I just love vampires is that they are so damn gorgeous looking creatures. Particularly, in this series, almost all the characters are delicious looking especially the vampire characters. The author manages to create them perfectly and that\u2019s not only with the way they look but more importantly with their personalities. Vampires are very proud creatures. Aside from the fact that they\u2019ve been living for so long that they\u2019ve acquire too many wisdoms much like old people, they are so proud of their species also. They believe that they are way above from any type of species including human beings. And because of that, they carry themselves with so much nobility, sophistication, and elegance. The series\u2019 characters are the epitome of a genuine vampire. Setting aside the real and noble vampires, Zero is also gorgeous looking although he suffers a lot because he is not a vampire at will. I don\u2019t exactly like Yuki though I don\u2019t particularly like her. She\u2019s one of those types of character that I like the least. The type of character that\u2019s very frail and weak just like a traditional damsel in distress in your everyday fairy tale. She can\u2019t do much and keep on doing misplaced kindness which turns out so cheesy and so very clich\u00e9. Because of her unnecessary and over to top kindness to Zero, it\u2019s as if he is the real person that she loves when she always claims that she\u2019s always been in love with Kaname. I really don\u2019t like people who do things half-heartedly and can\u2019t decide considering Kaname himself is so sure with his feelings with Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nAbout KURAN KANAME\\n\r\nKaname is the very epitome of a real vampire. Gorgeous, sophisticated, elegant, enigmatic and very much cool. Him being a pureblood and leads the rest of the vampires make him even hotter. Plus, there\u2019s this very mysterious aura around him just like a typical vampire character. You really can\u2019t understand what are his real motives and the reasons with his actions. And after realizing the reasons behind it all you will love him even more. In fact, his in the top 10 of my hundred lists of best characters and NUMBER ONE on my lists cutest male characters and that never changes for so many years already. I just love it when he speaks and utter the name \u201cYuki\u201d. It is like a very devil seduction.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the Animation\\n\r\nVampire Knight has one of the most amazing animations with its breathtaking visuals and gorgeous looking characters. The seiyus\u2019 voice gives more seduction to the hotness of the characters and so the delivery of the lines is so magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favorites and would always remember even after watching it or even after so many years. I am so looking forward to the sequel.\\n",

The quality and art is magnificent, even the watcher falls in-love with the characters. It is very intense. The characters, each and every one of them; are unique. They are all out-standing and have a special place in the watchers heart for every one of them. They all have different personalities and you never know what will happen next. My enjoymentof watching this specific anime was 100 %. I am totally satisfied with this particular genre, especially the anime. Overall, it is a 10 in every area!",

Now after ten years she studies at Cross Academy in the day class while at night roams the school grounds with Zero a vampire hunter who turns into a vampire from a bite given to him by a pure blood, to ensure that no one ever finds out that the night class actually consists of vampires. It a wonderfulstory about a girl life as she lives in the world of vampire caught between awe and fear for them while she tries to discover her own past and ensure the well being of those close to her. \\n\r\nThere is blood everywhere and a beautiful love story while she has to decide between the one who saved her and her childhood friend. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI love the story line, it's so different from the usual Vampire stories. Plus it gives you awe-inspiring moments.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\r\n 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThough it was really good it's not as great as the art work in the manga. There are some scenes that are absolutely beautiful to watch. The fight sequences and the ones that have blood make you go-O.M.G! \\n\\n\r\nI love the scenes where there is a lot of tension in the air, it makes you hold your breath.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\n 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and closing tracks are superb! Even the sound effect in the anime are well timed. The background music suits the mood of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\n 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBeautifully created. Each character suits the role given to them and they work together wonderfully to weave a magical tale. \\n\r\nMostly the characters are dark and yet so beautiful that it's a sin to think of them. \\n\r\nThere is a lot of hidden meaning behind each character's role and that makes you love them even more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\n 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a total must watch!!!! I assure you that you will fall in love with the anime. The only downside is they stop before the real fun starts. \\n\r\nIf you really want to pick up where you left off, you need to read the manga too. \\n\\n\r\n- Quotes - \\n\\n\r\n\"The world is dyed with the color of blood. It will never be able to go back to the way it was before\" \\n\r\n\"The next time you open your eyes the world might have already changed\" \\n\r\n\"I will cover and hide the part of my heart that wants to cry and scream\" \\n\r\n\"Being like this makes me feel like we've returned to the old days somewhat. Yeah. Zero is Zero. Even if you are a vampire now.\" \\n\r\n\"I didn't understand anything. Zero suffered and suffered for four years. What were you thinking, all by yourself? He loathes vampires so much, he wants to kill them all. All this time, Zero wanted to kill himself too.\" \\n\r\n\"I long for him.... but I understand. There's a line that vampires and humans can't cross.\" \\n\r\nYuuki Cross \\n\\n\r\n\"I want these gentle hands and this kind smile, even though I should not want such a thing\" \\n\r\n\"Her very existence means the world to me\" \\n\r\n\"Because Yuuki was there, I might have been able to live on...\" \\n\r\n\"But you thought it would be okay to become a vampire, right...? I will never let you turn into something like that. Even if it means I have to make Kaname Kuran my enemy...and even if it means you will hate me...\" \\n\r\n\"Thats why for you, you have the right to be cruel to me. \\n\r\nNo matter how much you make me worry or how much danger you put me in, just as much as you like, but these are not enough compensation even I have to sacrifice my leftover life for you. I'd not utter a word of complaint\" \\n\r\nZero Kiryuu \\n\\n\r\n\"Humans should never be turned into vampires. But in the old days, hidden from history, when the war between vampires and vampire hunters was at its peak, vampires turned many humans into vampires to use in battle. And now the aristocrats have the duty to manage those survivors. Sometimes we have to kill them off...\" \\n\r\n\"It's all right. You be just the way you are, Yuuki. You're different from the Night Class students who wait on me... You're a warm-hearted girl, Yuki. That's more than enough.\" \\n\r\n\"Zero, you're suppose to be the one that hates vampires more than anyone else... but you need blood more than anyone else. I think you're more vampire like than any other vampire.\" \\n\r\nKaname Kuran \\n\\n\\n\r\n\"I'll show you a sweet dream next night\" \\n\r\n- in the anime.",

Unlike some other animes Vampire Knights story line isnt legnthy and it gets strait to the point. The show is all around addictive. From the frist episode to the one I've seen. Anybody who really is tired of stupid boring animes should really give this a try. The voices are also really cool and they were able to match the voice and the characters personality quiete well. Only thing that i would say is annoying about this anime is that it only has englishsubs not dubs. Reading the screen can get tiresome but after a while you get lost in the show and forget your reading. A very, very, very addicting show. If you dont believe me check it out on youtube they have all the episodes in good quality.",

(brotherly and sisterly love)\r\nVampire knight is a long series obviously about vampires.\r\nThe headmaster of true cross has a theory.....his theory is that Vampires and humans should get along and live side by side now and forever. But there are obviously going to be a few hiccups in this plan to ensure that it goes smoothly. This encludes The True Cross academys day students to protect the Night class students. Yuki Cross and Zero Kiryu, the only two students that can protect the Night classes secrets.\r\ntheres a bit of a love triangle though inbetween Yuki Cross, Zero Kiryu and Kaname Kuran. Kanameis a night class student who is a vampire and Zero is a half blood.\\n\\n\r\nHalf Blood: A person who isn't born a vampire and is turned into one during his or hers life.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Cross: a young girl who knows nothing about her previous life as she had her memory wiped by a vampire that she doesn't know. Shes the adopted daughter of the headmaster.\\n\\n\r\nZero Kiryu: hes been Yukis childhood friend since he can remember but he hates Kaname and his affection towards Yuki. He was turned into a vampire when he was younger. he knows that soon he will be losing his sanity and will fall to a level E.\\n\\n\r\nKaname Kuran: Hes the night class president and saved Yuki from a vicous vampire when they where younger. Hes the only Pureblood in the night class and thats why hes the president.\\n\\n\r\nTheres many other characters that you will meet along the way but all in all these are the main 3 characters to look out for in the series.\\n\\n\r\nA smash hit manga and anime all around the world, with many series and a brilliant story line it is a must read. the episodes can drag on a little bit and kind of repeat themselves, i recommend that you watch the episodes and then read the books.\\n\\n\r\n12:59 Pm 9th of October 2012 ~Amy",

When it starts out, it seems like it just some typical high school anime (which I hate) but it turned out to be something completely different than that...\r\nIf you like an anime with a good balance of romance/action, then this is the anime for you.  It has the best romance scenes I have ever seen in an anime.  This serieshas so many tragic stories, and it makes you love all the characters involved.  \\n\\n\r\nYou cannot predict this anime at all.  I tried, but it was to no avail.  New, crazy things happen in each episode that leave you thinking, \"How could that possibly happen?!?!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that really had me was the Japanese voices.  I am not really one to watch subbed anime in general, but this one got me into it!  The Japanese voices have so much more emotion in them, and that really made me want to watch the show SO much more.   I really did love Zero and Kaname's voices, they just portrayed so much emotion.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do watch this, Vampire Knight Guilty is the second season, which you must watch after!
