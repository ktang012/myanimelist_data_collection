            "content": "\"You are not a human. You are an object.\"\r\nIf you were told the above, what would your reaction be? Sakai Yuji, the male protagonist of Shakugan no Shana, was thrown precisely into this chaotic situation one day while walking home from school. At the same time, viewers were introduced to the main theme of the anime. What if no one will ever remember your existence in this world. Being dead is one thing, but if everything about you will be erased from this world when you die (that includes people's memory of you), the thought alone could be terrifying to many.\r\nWhile at first glance Shakuganno Shana may seem like just another anime with the protagonist being thrown into a world he never thought existed. It really make itself standout from the rest if for no other reason than the spectacular introduction to the theme of the story. The story develop itself rather slowly midway through the series as the viewers were taken back in time for some background learning that lead us to understand certain characters better (more on that in the character section). Overall there was no rush to the story as events unfold themselves in a very elegant and comprehensive manner.\\n\\n\r\nIt should, however, be noted that since this is just an introductory season to the Shana saga (there is a season 2 to Shakugan no Shana and there will most likely be more in the future), not a lot of questions were answered ... but many were raised and leave people in confusion at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThough it can't be considered a masterpiece in animation, it is in fact still pretty top notch, especially the battle effects (flames for example, were animated in great detail and looked very awesome). If there's anything to complain about, it would be the over-sized eyes on most characters. But once that's accepted, everything else about the animation should not hurt your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the OP were very catchy, I didn't quite like the ED much (personal taste). Sound tracks were great as they match well with the intended scenes, some can even help drive your emotion a bit. In addition, the seiyu are quite famous:\\n\r\nShana voiced by Rie Kugimiya whose famous for her role in Full Metal Alchemist as Alphonse Elric, Nena Trinity in Gundam 00, and Louise Fran\u00e7oise in Zero no Tsukaima. Kazumi Yoshida voiced by Ayako Kawasumi who voiced in Fate/stay night as Saber, Kanokon as Chizuru Minamoto, and Otoha Sakurano in Sky Girls. \\n\r\nShakugan no Shana also stars Hitomi Nabatame, Shizuka Itou, Mamiko Noto, and many many more talented voice actors/actresses.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are what make this anime shine like a star. Due to the \"non-rushing\" nature of the show, each character (even the supporting casts) present their own background history and overtime we get to know their personality more and their \"behind thoughts\". This result in a very real and believable group of fantastically designed characters (both in terms of the \"realism\" and the \"looks\"). Definitely not something you see often in anime these days. The drawback is that some viewers may find it boring or made the stalled the story development.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not quite a masterpiece level anime, Shakugan no Shana is still a show that is very successful in every single aspect. Personally, this show started out quite a bit like Busou Renkin and Bleach (while others say it is similar to Fate/stay night), but it ultimately delivered a much stronger impression on me than the ones mentioned.",

            "content": "I couldn\u2019t get myself to finish it (Actually watching up to this episode was a trial in and of itself in a way). It simply has too many flaws that can't be overlooked. Shakugan no Shana is one of those anime that has a really intriguing plot but can't follow up on it. The first episode was stunning and I was looking forward to a deep and somehow philosophic, mature anime but it turns out to be a bad-guy-appears-and-is-defeated-anime. \r\nSTORY\r\nDon't be deceived by the intelligent beginning. I thought I was going to witness an excellent story and drama just from the opening. It quickly becameboring, lame, and confusing. It evolved into just another of the partly romance, partly action stories, with both aspects being underdeveloped, flat. If I had read a paragraph summary of the show then it would've been just that much more boring (ruining the only part of show) it was one of the few redeeming things the show has, that concept...\\n\\n\r\nIt has uninteresting dialogue, repetitive battle scenes, and slow execution. They bring in some sort of awkward romance story that isn't really fulfilling or moving. So this series basically becomes a horribly clich\u00e9 and contrived romance with absolutely no progress in any meaningful direction. The actual story development with the baddies, romance and all that is REALLY clich\u00e9. Neither the story nor characters are worth it for watching this series. The action was actually boring to me, the ones I saw anyway...\\n\\n\r\nIt's best summed up as a sword girl + generic male lead fighting to save the day. They came up with some 'intricate' plots but really they aren't that impressive. The show tries to blur its simplicity with many terms and names. It's roughly about a boring and overly confusing and overly repeated plot about mistes, torches, flame hazes, guzes, balance of the world, etc... The whole thing is just confusing and I don't feel like it's my fault. There's not enough explanation yet there's so much confusing, boring dialogue\\n\\n\r\nthere was this ONE SCENE that I thought was the ULTIMATE EXAMPLE OF WHY it's so...manipulative and impudent at the same time. it also is one of the biggest/annoying problems in new anime that I canNOT STAND.\\n\\n\r\nSo they show Shana changing and they show her taking her panties off (lol)\\n\r\nBut while she's doing that she's talking about all that mumbo-jumbo and that mumbo-jumbo made no sense.. AND AND  because I have yet to thrown in the towel even though the signs are huge that the show is shit, I re-watch that scene. orz OTL   I realize it really doesn't make ANY SENSE. it's like they're trying to cover it up with this weird loli fanservice which doesn't do much for me. Have her say shit that makes no sense which they are apparently deluded that the viewer will take in as really too complex and deep or whatevers to comprehend if she takes her undies off while she says it. Was this in the ep I dropped it? PRObably. this is a really bad tell-tale sign that this anime is a piece of popular overrated shit.\\n\r\ntalk about trashy,  and just plain insulting. i'm sure the loli otakus went crazy over that scene but i didnt...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nAs episode after episode passed, I just felt horribly unsatisfied without any character development.They lack any sort of sort of dimensionality: unconvincing voice acting, dull dialogue, no development. Everyone else besides Shana is merely \"devices\" to make things a bit more intricate and to help push the \"story\" on. Characters are basically given whatever set of feelings and goals and repetitively do the same action. Nearly all of them are meaningless and replaceable. The male lead is not very appealing and can be easily forgotten. Shakugan no Shana is blessed with Shana, a cute character, but that's it. Shana is the only interesting character and even so she's not THAT interesting. Shana is clearly \"loli\" which doesn't make me like her any more BTW but hey if you're into that sure\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe enemies are just enemies, it's like they exist only because the anime needed them. They don't explain their background all that much, they don't have motives really, boring, possibly annoying, same old same old, in other words I couldn't care much...  From the 1st ep I just thought the baddies just weren't that \"cool\" but then again I didn't get to see/meet the other baddies I saw in the opening so who knows. But I doubt it...\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nI loved the artwork. It's what made me want to watch this in the first place. Though I did find the animation itself to be a little ordinary since I've seen other anime that look like this. It's normal  production quality of recent anime. Basically as much as I like the artwork, I can't watch for that\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nOne department Shana does quite well at is music. Its theme songs are very good and even fits in with the series with the lyrics. As far as voice acting, I couldn't help but feel that some characters weren't sounding too convincing. That could simply be due to the poor execution of the characters and storyline, consequently damaging the mood of the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are better anime of this genre out there fo sho. Shana never really passes more than an average/below average show. I would recommend that you watch the openings, because they look awesome and all that &  maybe the firsrt couple eps if you just wanna know what it's about but I can't fathom watching all 24 eps... Overall, a show with huge potential that fails to live up to its hype. \\n\\n\r\ndo yourself a favor and watch SLAYERS NEXT!! (watching slayers next twice is more enjoyable than watching shana once lol) instead of this anime. it has a girl with red hair too lolz... no but seriously it's actually funny and the serious parts are really good too (this anime is cool... in short while shana just gets lamer and lamer). seriously the characters actually have souls and the story is actually cool (I have this thing against fantasy anything but I love this fantasy anime) and the background music kicks ass and so does the op/ed and the seiyuu. It's better in every single way except maybe animation but I personally prefer slayers next animation to shana animation personally. it's on HULU!\\n\\n\r\nwww.hulu.com/the-slayers-next",

            "content": "Okay, for my first ever review, I thought I'd review one of my all time favourites, Shakugan no Shana.\r\nBefore I start, let me say that this anime is not everyone's cup of tea. Some people love it, some hate it and some are in between. As for me, I love it to bits so if my review seems a bit biased, I apologise right off the bat.\r\nFirst off, the storyline, I'm sure there are a few anime out there featuring parallel worlds or dimensions but I really enjoyed the way it's portrayed in this anime. The main reason for this being that, with such agrim and mature-ish beginning to the anime that gave it such a depth to storyline, the anime does also get lighter by mixing it with some other elements as well and I enjoy these lighter moments as much as the more intense parts of the anime. And mind you, this anime does seem to make the world around the main protagonist, Yuji, to seem hopeless at the start but it grows to become more light-hearted while still maintaining its original premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is rather good in my honest opinion. The characters are reasonably well drawn, although they are of the large-eyed variety as seen in many anime, they are still pretty decent to look at. In my opinion, the artwork shines the most during the fight scenes. The fight scenes never seem to leave you disoriented since it is laid out in such a way that makes it simple and yet, an enjoyment to watch.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound of the anime, I have found nothing I am particularly unhappy about when it comes to the overall sound of the anime. Basically, everything sounds alright, with no flaws or anything that I have found. The voice acting was also pretty decent, and I know some people would beg to differ right here but I liked the way that Rie Kugimiya voiced Shana to be very child-like to mirror Shana's original age and her true child-like self. I did also really enjoy the opening and ending themes of the series. The animations during these are pretty decent as well.\\n\\n\r\nNow for my favourite part, the characters. The characters really do grow on you in this anime. They also really do have some growth, even the less important ones do have some development to a certain degree. The most of development however must happen to the main characters and this series does not disappoint. First off, the main male protagonist, Yuji Sakai, there is a good deal of development especially at the early stages of the series when he is thrust headlong into a reality that seems so hopeless for him, and yet, he grows to understand and accept his situation. Second, there's Shana, the main female protagonist. Being a tsundere(wiki it if you're wondering what this means) character, she does have a lot of development as a character in the story throughout the series as she grows less cold toward Yuji, as she originally viewed him as little more than an object, and instead begins to grow more fond of him and these feelings really confuse her as she still has to maintain her duty as a Flame Haze.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the enjoyment factor, I really did enjoy it. Especially in the later parts of the anime, the plot and the characters did leave me feeling more and more attached to the anime. Most of all, I enjoyed watching the development of Yuji and Shana's relationship together since it's not your typical boy likes girl, girl likes boy drama, it's a lot more complicated than it appears.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great anime to watch with characters that begin to grow on you after a while. I definitely would recommend watching it. And it's also a must watch for any tsundere fan out there as well.",

            "content": "Shakugan no shana... An anime with alot of potential that overall felt like alot of regurgitated shounen/romance anime was a bit of a let down. The predictable uninspired story line, repetitiveness, cheesy humor, and mediocre character development left alot to be desired and is far from a masterpiece that is popularity would make you believe it is. \r\nStory line: \r\nThe initial introduction of the story really got my hopes up; basically about a normal boy who gets pulled into a bizarre battle only to find after words he no longer really exists, and that his entire being will slowly fade away and be forgotten byall of his loved ones. While discovering mysterious powers of his own he is emersed into into the world of magic and battles along with the cute but stubborn Red haired girl Shana who fights off those that threaten humanity.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite having an interesting few episodes the plot it stale. It moves very slowly and is predictable for the most part. The anime could have easily been done in half the episodes they took. The battles slowly become tedious along with the story. Also the cheesy romance that develops made it almost unbearable to watch after a certain point. If I were to describe the enjoyment of the story line most of the middle episodes drop down to a 4-5 nearly killing the series...\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt was... acceptable. As far as most main stream shows go the art was OK... but it was overall mediocre. It also feels very deceiving that the advertisements and Opening theme for the series has such beautiful animation because its really not that great overall. Some of the battle scenes were well done though.\\n\r\nCharacter animation wise the most attention is given to Shana; and they do a very good job with her. The rest of the characters on the other hand are uncreative and boring. The main character specifically lacks any real attracting traits that would set him apart from a side character...\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nOpening and ending songs are pretty good, I especially enjoyed the first ending theme Yowake Umare Kuru Shoujo. The music in show overall was acceptable, but nothing really stands out about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe two main characters... try imagining Saber and Shirou from fate/stay night as middle schoolers and that should give you an idea; Although Shana is much more vocally stubborn  that Saber ever was. \\n\r\nShana is the predictable Tsundere character~ The stubborn easily ticked, but deep down shy emotional girl. Her character development is interesting since she doesn't really understand basic human interaction very well...\\n\r\nYuji also is the predictable week but good hearted normal kid, who grows up to be more dependable courageous guy. \\n\r\nPerhaps what killed the character development was when they attempted to throw in romance... its just didn't work for this plot because of their age... and it split what the story really should have focused on. \\n\r\nThere are actually alot of other characters in the story... but their development is mediocre or nonexistent...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\r\nI don't really have much else to say about this series other than It was actually painful to put myself through the torture of watching this entire series; and I think anime fans that are looking for something deep, a moving story line, and/or epic battles will be very disappointed unless they have very low standards.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason its gets overall higher scores is because it was made for a large viewing audience~ incorporating humor, action, Romance, magical/fantasy and slice of life.  They say the Jack of all trades is master of none, and this anime proves this point.",

            "content": "I will say at the beginning of this anime i did feel a little hopeless. The anime imposes a scary thought into your head, what if i flicker out? What if no one REMEMBERS me? That is the main theme of this anime. Not whether or not you existed, but whether or not you are remembered.\r\nThis is a story about loving someone who isn't necessarily human, but human to you. I warn you, the first three or four episodes are sad, because you will most likely be empathizing with the Torches. But, overall, the anime is enjoyable, meaningful, and somehow, it makes you look forthe silver lining.\\n\\n\r\nWatch the first 4 episodes, and then after that, you can basically assess whether you will enjoy the art style and theme or not.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9\\n\r\nWith many twists and turns, this anime definitely has you addicted to each and every episode. Each episode develops the characters phenomenally each step of the journey, and creates a dramatic tension that could almost be understood as the recognition of one's self and values. The only problem I had with the story was the fact that...   Yuuji never kisses Shana. I waited for that every episode after they mentioned the &quot;oath&quot;. .  Also, i have never heard someone describe the feelings attached to a kiss so accurately and empathetically.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10 \\n\r\nThe effects are... amazing. I will admit i was thrown off by the overly big eyes at the very beginning when i looked at the cover for this anime, but somehow they suit the style and artistic quality of the anime. The effects when Shana has her burning hair are astounding, and the lighting effects are magnificent. I watched a splash in the water, gaping at how intricate and amazingly crafted it was. Art is without a doubt a perfect 10 for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nI loved the voice actors for every character, and enjoyed the OP and ED sequences very much. I would've rather had a slower song for the OP, but when you get to episode 13 (i think), the OP changes and it becomes suitable for the episodes. I enjoyed the ED very much. I'm usually one to skip the credits each episode, but i watched with awe for most of them. And i enjoyed the art in the background =]\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 10\\n\r\nThis is the first anime i have ever given a 10 on characters for. Most characters are flat, that don't change substantially from episode to episode, but SHakugan no Shana shows the difference between Yuuji and his understanding of his own situation, and his own acceptance of him becoming a Mistes, and also Shana's relationship with Yuuji (No matter how many times she avoids it by yelling &quot;Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!&quot;) develops so intricately into the plot. This was one of the most wonderful character development sequences i have ever come across. You will fall in love with Shana and Yuuji for their admirable qualities (and some of Shana's detestable manners). I can guarantee that.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nEveryone loves a good sad anime every now and then. And then to be lifted up from that sad anime into a happier light. That's what this anime does. It makes you involved with every single character, and makes you enjoy every aspect of the visual effects, the sound effects, and the general aura that is exhumed from whatever device you're watching it from. It's got a lot of good moments, though it doesn't have the outrageous &quot;Anime Comedy&quot; animation that i've seen in others (Where the characters get huge teeth to bark with, or their heads get huge and their bodies become small, other effects like that). So if you enjoy that particular aspect of Anime Comedy, i say look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n\r\nI would give this one a perfect 10, but i feel that the storyline could move quicker towards the beginning, and admonish the fact that people want don't want to be put off by the sadness. I think if you watch this, i will give you the same advice that i have given for other animes: Watch the first 3 episodes, and if you like it, watch it, or ditch it (Even if it is &quot;Orphen: The sorcerer stabbing something or other&quot;). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy =]",

The issue was this is maybe it was a bit to much, i love these shows but even i found myself a little bored at times. \\n\\n\r\nAs for lead characters Shana ticks all the boxes for me as a female lead and really doesn't disappoint though out the show, she's funny strong and prefect for main role of this show. Sakai, Yuuji could have turned into a real mess of a character but he takes on the burden of his new responsibility's well and wants to become stronger, which i found would have been better than hiding behind the Stronger characters in the show. As for a three lead i suppose we have Yoshida, Kazumi who for the most part is really only there to add another twist to the relationship between Yuuji and Shana. The issue i always have with a second female lead in these types of the shows the fact that there isn't any competition for the male lead, keeping in mind when i'm writing this i am only half way though the second season, so i could be dead wrong but normally its pretty easy to see who going to come on with the male lead by her side. So yes they develop the characters well but they do rather slowly and it can damage the over pacing of the show and the overall enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking at this show and expecting it to eat your heart out and make you sit on the edge of your sit, your not really going to get it here. The story although interesting isn't anything we haven't seen before so therefore it isn't going to make you jump out of your seat. \\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch this show? If your are interested in the type of show and have maybe watch and enjoy'd shows like Zero Louise then yes you should, you will find it still rather entertaining as i did. The show has some heart felt moments and so real fast paced action that you will enjoy but for the most part it can be sort of dry, so if you have seen shows with the same sort of premises as this and haven't enjoy'd it then its a safe bet this isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nHope my review was helpful  \\n\r\nMurphy      \\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime.... is just another anime. Nothing spectacular or amazing.\r\nSTORY: it started off extremely slowly, and i think the first half of the series was basically explaining the main concept of how people disappear, who Shana was and what she does. I would have rather liked to see all these elements integrated into the story, because otherwise, it is a huge influx of information. The plotline was predictable.\r\nART: best part of the series. I liked the scenes when there were a lot of red, there seemd to be many shades of red, and it reflected the intensity of battle. NOTE: battle intensity that should bein battles, not, the battles that Shana was in.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: not bad, the OP and ED were kinda catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Yuuji is such a tool. His kind of character annoys me. Shana was more interesting, but her obsession with melon bread and her &quot;shut up&quot; phrase was ALMOST overdone. But for loli lovers, her habits would make Shana an instant win.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: it moved slowly, I had stopped the series for a while because I got bored. I finished it, just to see what the hype was about after the series was complete. Nothing out of the ordinary, a good way to pass time.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like lolis, Shakugan no Shana is a good recommendation.",

            "content": "Spiralsraise's Review: \r\nThe beginning of the series was interesting. You had a character who was conflicted about his place, if he could really be human, and behave as one, yet acts very much like one even though he's a Torch. Often Yuji would hear from Shana that he is \"just\" a torch and it would get to him. Through out the entire story he tries hard to identify and establish some kind of connection to Shana and be as much help to her as he can. To make things just a bit harder for Yuji, Shana's personality leaves her detatched from the world, since herfocus is mainly on being a Flame Haze and how serious she takes it. Aside from the two main characters (Shana and Yuji) there continues to be diversity in personalities of characters.  A fair portion of the time the characters are what are helping to drive the plot, but there are times where that doesn't happen.\\n\r\nThe Plot is interesting and different in some aspects from things i've seen before. It makes you wonder yourself if life where that way, if you were a torch, would you notice? What would your personal conflicts be? Would you still want to do everything on the figurative (and sometimes literal) things you want to do before you die list? Would it actually count if you tried to since you aren't really you and more but an impression of who you are. At the beginning it can pose a lot of personal questions for yourself but seeing how Yuji deals with these sorts of questions (not all of them) and how he tries to reaffirm himself that he still has an identity is the initial hook. You end up wondering where he developed the strength to look at his reality so calmly, yet with conviction. \\n\r\nThe romance that you see in the story isn't overwhelming either. It's there yet it's controlled and the romance doesn't become the plot. One of the more enjoyable things about the romance in the plot is Shana's own confusion and lack of understanding of things. Her uncertainty and balancing the part of herself that is a Flame Haze and the part that she identifies as Shana is an interesting parallel to the story, and shows the growth that Shana goes through once meeting Yuji. However, with that said Shana's feelings for Yuji do become more involved with the plot as it progresses and some may see that becoming more of the focus. \\n\r\nEven though a fair portion of the story is serious there are comedic points that can get you laughing and help lighten up the story and see the characters as those you could identify with to some degree. All in all, It was an enjoyable 24 episode season, and i'm curious to see how they plan to continue the story.",

            "content": "[fanboyism]\r\nGah this review will prob sound a little biased but I just can't help it because Shakugan no Shana is my second favourtie show EVER >_> but I tried my best to give it a decent review. So please try to read it before knocking down this review lol.\r\nI never really even knew about Shana a couple months ago, the main reason I watched this show was because while browsing wikipedia I saw a pic of Shana and I thought she looked like Konata from LS LOL so I thought why not? In the end I never expected I would find an anime that wouldhook me so much, this show was perfect for me since it had everything I was looking for in a show at the time. And if it was destiny after I finished watching this season I learned of a second season that had just started ON THE SAME DAY LOL I win :)\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story of this anime was definitely a very interesting and complex one as well, the first episode alone I felt was so packed with info shallowing it all was overwhelming, but I wasn't complaining because since episode one this show struck me and kept me interested till the very end. This story at first I thought was going to include action but after seeing Shana's struggle to try to understand her love of Yuji and the heavy drama elements of this show kicked in, that sealed the deal for me since I had found a perfect balance between my favourite anime elements.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm sure everyone will agree when I say the visual highlight of this show is ALWAYS Shana when she is in flame haze mode with her bright red firey hair and her bright red eyes, really pretty to look at ^_^ other than that the show had some pretty decent animation although there were parts where you could see an obvious lack of animation when there were some distorted faces and stuff like that. The visuals were not bad, but they also didnt really overwhelm me. Although there were parts where it really did look great I give it an 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is IMO one of the show's best features, the background songs played during the more dramatic moments felt perfect and during the battles as well. Hishoku no Sora piano version is one of my favourite pieces to date and every scene where it was played I fell in love with &gt;_&gt;\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: OK, I'm going to admit if it wasn't for Shana this show would not be on my favourites. Unlike her, all the other charactes where they main of supporting justs did not feel like they were developed enough for me to care about them, Yuji maybe just a little bit. Shana on the other hand I thought was developed perfectly, watching her change from her rude and cold self into a more charing person because of Yuji's influence was REALLY cool to see, her internal struggles caused by her feelings were IMO really touching moments, Yoshida I felt was only good to make Shana realize her feelings and other than that she just pisses me off lol...Shana is what made this show so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: When I finished watching this show I was overwhelmed by how beautiful it was, I felt like I had watched a show that was made for me and knew that It had become a favourite for me. There I go sounding biased &gt;_&gt; but it was a good show no matter how you look at it anyways...\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was really something I enjoyed and I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy so I STRONGLY RECOMMEND to give this show a try. And since I am currently watching the second season another review will come soon lol if I was not so biased I would prob give this show a solid 9/10 or 8.5/10 but well I'm a fanboy so I'll give it a perfect 10/10 lol\\n\\n\r\n[/fanboyism]",

Staff\r\nPlot (by sirhcle):\r\nShakugan no Shana is set in our world in which everything is fueled by the power of existence. One day a boy names Sakai Yuji finds that he is moving in a time-frozen realm, whilst a monster (called Rinne) ingests blue flames (power of existence) for their masters (called Tomogara). It is here that Sakai Yuji meets a girl who he later names Shana. Shana is a flame haze, responsible for annihilating Rinne and hunting down their masters. Who wish to use power of existence to become stronger, by harvesting thepower from humans and in turn the world is distorted.\\n\r\nWhen a person's power of existence is taken away, they cease to exist. Flame Haze's can produce a torch - an artificial existence that will slowly falter but slowly transitions ones existence to nothing as to ease the sudden shock in disappearance of an individual. Yuji and Shana team up to defeat the Tomogara and their plans of gaining power of existence.\\n\\n\r\nsirhcle's comments:\\n\r\nI've heard a lot about this anime from forums and people, but fail to see how it is so unique. Razz The anime starts off very slowly, but picks up it's pace at the end. I think that the introduction to the world is quite lengthy, although it's concept is not all that complex. The storyline seems to entangle a lot on the relationship side between Shana and Yoshida, but these seem to be premature-junior high school crushes. We are also given 2-whole episodes on Shana's background which helps us understand the role of a flame haze and her behavior in relationships, but it's usually something I'd prefer to pick up along the story.\\n\r\nI found the storyline to be fairly predictable.\\n\r\nNot as great as I'd expected, but still an 'okay' anime. I think the appeal comes from Shana and lolicon lovers. I swear, meron-pan (melon bread?) is selling like hot cakes these days.\\n\r\nI'd recommend people who 'have time' to watch it.",

            "content": "Plot\r\nHere's a background check:\r\nShakugan no Shana was originally a light novel series written by Yashichiro Takanashi that started in 2002 and ended in 2012. Since then, it has spawned two manga adaptations, three anime seasons, four OVA episodes, and a movie, of all things. According to Wikipedia, critics \"praised the series for its execution of typical story elements and how it continuously becomes better over time. However, the series is described as having issues with pacing.\" (Pfft... Yeah, \"issues with pacing\", that's totally all that's wrong with it...)\r\nThe story is about a high school student named Yuji Sakai, and he's... well... dead. Okay, he's notreally 'dead', per se, but his original body has ceased to exist because it was eaten by something called a 'Crimson Denizen'. Now a 'Torch', Yuji is saved by a 'Flame Haze' known as the Flaming Haired Blazing Eyed hunter, and-\\n\\n\r\nOkay, okay, stop. What is a Crimson Denizen supposed to be? What's a Flame Haze? What's a Torch meant to be? Where did these guys come from? I don't know what's going on here - slow down and explain things, please.\\n\\n\r\nSee, this is what I was like when I was watching the first episode. And you know what? I was like this the entire time I was watching it as well. Shakugan no Shana has indefinitely and stubbornly refused to answer the most important questions. It has refused to establish what everything is supposed to be; it's like it expects the audience to figure everything out by themselves. It's like telling a child to build his own bed, and you've removed most of the parts to make the overall frame - that's how badly Shana fucked up in giving me a clear definition of what is what. For example, they mention something called an 'Unrestricted Method', and they show it... but they don't outright explain what this 'Unrestricted Method' is supposed to do, because it appears to have more than one use.\\n\\n\r\n...Okay, so maybe it did explain what a Torch was... once. In the entire anime's run as of the first season. In the first episode. In less than five seconds. Seriously, how can they expect me to remember what everything is if they not only don't explain things to me properly in the first place, let alone give a more in-depth explanation as to why shit is happening? Also, perhaps there were more explanations on what a Crimson Denizen was, but I certainly didn't hear it. As far as I know, they probably said it when the stereotypical loli tsundere was changing her clothes. Yeah. How smart of them - I'm totally able to focus on the dialogue in the midst of all the hateful things I was thinking about while watching a 12-year-old body being exploited for the lolicons' entertainment. Way to go, J.C. Staff - that's always a good way to not piss people off.\\n\\n\r\nThey got around to explaining what a Flame Haze was too. Guess when. No, seriously, I'm asking you: Guess which episode is where they got around to telling me what a Flame Haze is. ... Got an answer?\\n\\n\r\nIf you guessed around episode 15-17, you'd be just about right. Yes, I'm not lying - they took over ten fucking episodes to explain what a Flame Haze is. Basically, it's kinda like a soul reaper, in that its mission is to maintain the balance of the world's existence. Got that? Okay, now try to make sense of what they mean by maintaining the balance of existence.\\n\\n\r\nYour guess would be as good as mine, because that's what they use to fight. But it makes no sense, whatsoever. How the fuck can you use existence to fight? Existence is existence; you can't manipulate its essence the way they do in the show. Couldn't they have just called it magic or something and call it a day? Please, some logic would be nice.\\n\\n\r\nActually, yeah, that's another thing this show is missing: Logic. Yuji's love triangle is treated as something important to the story - spoiler alert: it really isn't anything special; it's actually a pathetic mess - yet both girls involved have no logical reason to like him at all. I'll go through what made them start to like him.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female loli tsundere lead, Shana, began to like Yuji after she did a complete 180 degrees on her characterisation when he started watching her getting changed right in front of him. She was okay with it, right until Yuji brought it up and started to not act like a Mystes. (What's a 'Mystes', you ask? To be honest, the show hasn't told me what this is, either.) Apparently, he's so 'human', that she develops self-consciousness around him out of nowhere after being alive for god knows how long. The most annoying part about that scene is that she never had a problem changing clothes with anyone else in her past. Why the sudden change when he's involved? Because, reasons, that's why. \\n\\n\r\nThe other girl - Kazumi Yoshida - likes him because he talked to her. That's all he did, and he ended up making her want his dick. How is that romance? That doesn't work in real life, and it most definitely does not work in anime. What a joke...\\n\\n\r\nThe show also reaches its lowest point at the end of episode 24, the final episode of the first season. Alastar (or Alastor - whatever, the dub couldn't decide which one it is) tells Shana that in order to save Kisami City from becoming a \"fountain of existence\" - whatever that means - he has to be able to take this 'existence' to transform himself from being a pendant into his true form as a Crimson Lord, which is basically a lord of something called the Crimson World. (What's the Crimson World? Again, the show never explains this, let alone shows it to us.) What happens when he transforms is that the Flaming Haired Blazing Eyed hunter dies - always has. That means Shana was going to die, and that there was no way of surviving; they never said there was a chance of survival.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I was like, \"Hey, that actually might be a good way to end the show - it'd be dramatic, I'd enjoy myself... Yeah, this could work.\"\\n\\n\r\n...Then I remembered that I spoiled the ending a long while ago. And that I remembered it extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nYuji decided to die with Shana, and they walk off into the light to save the city . . .\\n\\n\r\n. . . and then wake up on top of a building, the city saved. Oh, and Yuji kept his clothes, but Shana's disappeared for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nYes, that's right, they survived. And guess what? Alastar said this (paraphrased): \"Oh look at that, it appears there was a chance of survival after all.\"\\n\\n\r\n... What. You mention that almost directly after it happens? You expect us to accept this bullshit? This is the worst anime ending ever... At least School Days had a point to its ending. This didn't, other than to say, \"Oh, don't worry guys, they'll be back for the next season!\" Yeah, fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you think this is all I have to say? Oh no, I'm just getting started. *cracks knuckles* Now then...\\n\\n\r\nThe flashback episodes looking into Shana's past are also stupid as all fuck. At this point, she was training to become a Flame Haze on a hidden floating island that we're given no idea where it came from at all (and it was floating over a fucking city), and we're also given no indication as to how old she actually is, but it's been hinted that she's at least over 100. One of her training partners is this skeleton dude, and she decides to pull a prank on him so that she can finally get a hit in, because when they train, she always loses.\\n\\n\r\nShe takes galloons of tomato sauce and pours it into a big hole she dug up, and then sleeps near it to get the skeleton dude to fall into it after jumping off the nearby tree to attack her. It works, and the guy is covered in sauce while Shana gets a training sword and donks him on the head, getting a hit.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what he does? He flips his fucking shit, and then proceeds to unleash all of his power, resulting in a massive explosion that not only revealed the island's location to the enemies, but also destroys it to the point that it starts to collapse after an episode. Dude, calm the fuck down! It's a prank for Christ's sake. No experienced fighter that had been portrayed as this calm, badarse character would all of a sudden change his personality entirely and do something as stupid as revealing the secret location where you train Flame Hazes like Shana. Honestly... \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's not all. They had one villain that I thought was cool, but then he got completely worfed by a Mystes known as the Flame Haze Killer. (I thought a Mystes was supposed to be something else entirely, but it turns out I was wrong.) Said Flame Haze Killer not only looks like a samurai, but also is the most powerful Mystes ever. I'm serious - that's exactly what they said. Guess what happens when he fights Shana.\\n\\n\r\nHe gets defeated in three minutes by a headbutt. And Shana was wearing fucking bandages, and nothing else. Gee, how threatening that guy must be. Shana didn't even use a sword against him. She dodged a few times, punched a hole in his side, and then headbutted him. And Shana didn't get hit once. How come she defeated him, yet gets her arse kicked quicker than you can say \"power inconsistency\"?\\n\\n\r\nI think that's all I'm going to say about the plot, because at this rate, I'm going to write a whole book about how bad the plot is. It could've worked if it tried to be a Bleach rip-off, but it didn't even do that. It is badly written, illogical, and just plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot gets a 0/10 from me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI give zero fucks about pretty much all of them. The only characters I cared about either die or never show up again, if at all. Everyone else is either dumber than a bag of hammers, annoying as fuck, completely useless, or a mixture of all these things and more. If you want specifics...\\n\\n\r\nYuji Sakai is one of the blandest protagonists I have ever seen in anime. He's not only a dumb fuck who can't see how much a girl likes him even if she bit his face off, but he's also way too obviously a character you project yourself into. He has no real personality, he's way too average, and he has the most overpowered treasure in the entire show. It's called the Midnight Lost Child, and all it does is replenish his existence every time the clock strikes midnight. His 'dumb fuck' aspect comes in when he keeps thinking at the beginning, \"I'm going to disappear soon enough\", and he never questioned why he was still alive until an all-powerful bystander points it out to him. Said person told him this in episode 5. Shana explains how the treasure works in episode 7.\\n\\n\r\nShana is probably the biggest disappointment in terms of the show's characters. At first, she started off as this cold-hearted, apathetic Flame Haze - but after episode 3 (or 4), she turns into a stereotypical loli tsundere in literally less than two minutes into the scene where she was changing clothes - oh, and her catchphrase is \"Shut up, shut up, shut up!\". Yeah, that's totally cute...\\n\\n\r\nShana pisses me off because she is pathetically weak when it comes to combat. And she's been training for, what, a few decades? Isn't she an experienced Flame Haze? If so, why is she always relying on Yuji and Alastar to help her out? Why must she be so useless? I was hoping for a C.C.-like personality and character development, with swordsmanship that will make Erza smile. But no, she is a pathetic excuse of a character, and I fail to see why lolicons like her. ...Oh wait.\\n\\n\r\nKazumi Yoshida, the normal girl in Yuji's love triangle, is boring, stupid, and useless. And very, very pointless.\\n\\n\r\nMargridor (can't spell her name) had a moment where she could develop into a better character, but instead she stays exactly the same: a drunk whose ambition in life is never fulfilled in the first season's run.\\n\\n\r\nHer two teenage followers don't develop as characters at all.\\n\\n\r\nYuji's school friend pointlessly falls in love with Yoshida.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the villains are one of the major flaws in the whole anime. All of them, literally all of them, are about as threatening as a fly - and if a villain dares to be interesting, expect him to get worfed twice, by the same dude. If they do something that's supposed to be threatening, it fails to make you feel like it's threatening. All of them are one-dimensional, and none of their goals have any real point to them, other than to be 'For the Evulz'. There's a guy with a doll fetish, and he wants to make her human - but he fails to be an interesting villain, let alone a dangerous one.\\n\\n\r\nAnother 'noteworthy' villain includes an 8-year-old girl named Hekate. What is her goal? She wants to desire something, anything. So, when Yuji is kidnapped by the Balmask - the three main bad guys, and they mostly stand around and talk about fuck all - she decides she wants to literally become him, personality and everything. She does this by 'touching' him in his mind. Said 'touching' comes with being really, really close to his crotch with her own, and making orgasm sounds and blushing while they both glow blue.\\n\\n\r\n...Are they having sex? She's 8 years old! What is wrong with this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you think that's bad, introduce the Crimson Denizen twins that have several make-out sessions multiple times. These 'sessions' are actually quite detailed, with saliva and everything. Feeling sick yet? Here's the reason why they do it: The sister loves her brother. That's why. And judging by the brother's reaction when she's killed by Shana in the most hilariously bad fire tornado ever, he doesn't give two fucks about her at all. I'm not kidding! When she dies, he doesn't even look at her; he just keeps fighting. He doesn't even look like he actually heard her final words.\\n\\n\r\nNot that it matters in the end - the annoying shit dies as well. Good riddance.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even going to bother going through every single character. Why? Because they all suck. The anime might not be as bad if the characters were likeable, but I cannot find it within myself to give a shit about what they go through. I just can't.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters receive 0/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff did a really shitty job with the animation, especially during the fight scenes. They are cheap as all hell, uninteresting, and just . . . bleh... What's the point in even watching them? Fairy Tail's manga fights are better, and they're extremely short compared to other Shonen series like Bleach and Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the only part of the animation I thought was kinda cool was all in the second opening song. It would've been awesome if the fight that happened in the opening was the same standard of animation for the other fights, but Shana being Shana, that wasn't ever going to happen. So, what else is there to say? Nothing, really.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 0.5/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (voice acting, sound effects, music)\\n\\n\r\nI only watched Shakugan no Shana in English, and my thoughts on it are . . . less than praising. There were about three-to-four voices I thought were pretty good, and that's it. Everyone else was either 'meh', annoying, or boring and uninteresting. And to think, Shana is the same person who did Roberta (Black Lagoon) and Rarity (My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic).\\n\\n\r\n'Special' mention has to go to Yuji's mother, however. She is seriously the biggest weaboo voice actor I have ever seen. Instead of just saying Yuji and Shana, she says \"Yu-chan\" and \"Shana-chan\". No-one else in the entire dub says any honourific at all. And instead of Alastar, she says \"Alasutaru\"! She said a name the same way it's said in Japanese, in an English dub! \\n\\n\r\nSound effects are nothing noteworthy - pass.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the music should have been one of the redeeming parts about this show, but even that's been neglected. I honestly almost never notice the music - it's practically forgettable. However, I must admit that one song stands out: the second ending song is actually quite good.\\n\\n\r\nSound gets a 3/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict\\n\\n\r\nShakugan no Shana is quite honestly the worst anime I have ever seen, and will probably stay this way for the rest of my life (unless I finish Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan, but that's another story). The plot is so terrible that I nearly fell asleep on multiple occasions (and that is actually very hard to do with someone like me), the characters are pathetic, the animation is cheaper than a Vietnamese hooker in Las Vegas, and the sound only has one good, memorable song, while everything else is weak. Stay away from this anime; don't ever watch it, because it'll be a pointless waste of time and energy, and you won't get any satisfaction from watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI've never had this happen yet, but I bet there will be some Shana apologist out there that will say something like, \"Oh don't worry about the first season, because the second and third season are a lot better.\" To quote Yahtzee Croshaw: \"You know that's not a point in its favour, right?\" A better second season or third season is not going to make the first season any better.\\n\\n\r\nIf the first season fails to impress me, I am never going to watch the second or third season just to see if I might enjoy myself or not. What's the point in wasting more time on something that wasn't worth wasting time on in the first place? Because of this, I am never going to watch anything related to Shakugan no Shana ever again.\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict for Shakugan no Shana is...\\n\\n\r\nYou know what? This show isn't even worth a final verdict - there are so many things wrong with it that to give it even half a point would be to compliment it. I'm sorry, but taking the second ending out of the show would be the only thing I find satisfying about the entire experience. If it wasn't connected to the show at all, that'd be better. But it's there to stay, so there's no use bitching about it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought School Days was bad, then reconsider your opinion on that anime's ending - from the looks of it, it looks immensely satisfying. Gigguk thought so, and from my first impressions of the first episode, I think so too. If you think the worst anime you can think of is bad, I point you towards this anime, and will leave it at that. Unless it really is worse, but that remains to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I don't get about this anime is that people love the ever-living shit out of it. To which I say, why? What is so good about it? Name one thing apart from the music that is actually good about it, and do it in relation to the first season only. Can't do it? Of course you can't, because it's awful.\\n\\n\r\nI never do understand the way other people think sometimes... and I don't think I even want to.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's a decent series however there is a ton of emotional and time filler. First the good points however and then the filler issue.\r\nThe animation is really nice and the story is reasonably unique. The character design can be summed up as either really good or direly lacking depending on the character in question. The story doesn't move too slow, it's mainly a filler issue. The story has depth though it's not as structured as some others. There is no overwhelming sense of the ultimate structure of the fictional universe...it's more of a perspective of seeing the box from within the box then being ableto view the box from the outside perspective. It could have used more storyline relating to I suppose the \"higher-ups\" as it lacks a sense of origins for the main female protagonist. There are others who fill the role but it's feels like okay, got some good guys and some baddies...but no firm sense of ultimate agendas.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself skipping through episodes (4-20 second intervals) towards the end of the series as I was losing my patience waiting for something to actually happen. Watching scenery slowly scroll by and characters being lost in their emotions gets tiring when it's present in half of all the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is fair though if they removed the overly emotional content and the fillers like scrolling slowly past scenery it would have been significantly more enjoyable overall. If you've got the extra time and don't mind the filler you may enjoy the series more however.",

            "content": "Shakugan no Shana started out as a light novel series written by Takahashi Yashichiro. It's been very successful, inspiring a radio drama, manga, anime, video game, and a movie. The question then becomes whether it's worthy of the hype, fails to meet it or is just over-rated tripe. I don't have time to look at everything related to Shakugan no Shana, so I'm just going to watch the first of the TV anime.\r\nThe story involves a young man named Sakai Yuji who comes to a frightening discovery when time stops around him and monsters appear and begin consuming people. He's saved by a girl witha sword who goes through a long exposition dump revealing that there are monsters called Tomogara who consume existence and she's a guardian of some sort called a Flame Haze. She fights the Tomogara and creates torches to act as a sort of buffer to gradually drain the existence of those eaten by the Tomogara and then disappear and be forgotten. Yuji soon learns that he's immune to the time stopping effect because he's a special kind of torch with a treasure inside. The concept could be interesting, but the execution is horrendous. Everything moves ridiculously slowly. The anime could be ten episodes long, at most, and lose nothing but it's twenty four episodes. That's fourteen episodes of filler and pointless padding. It makes the whole anime really boring and tedious to watch. That isn't the only issue. The dialogue is stilted, there are multiple plot holes and the characters all have competence levels that change substantially based on the power of plot contrivance. The fight scenes aren't even good since there's just a lot of padded build up and then they end really quickly. I will grant that the ending suits the series well since it's also incredibly stupid.\\n\\n\r\nIf the filler and padding were used for character development it wouldn't be filler or padding. The characters are just annoying. They're all complete and utter one-dimensional twits. The only character who develops at all is Shana who keeps accumulating obnoxious traits. She starts out as a typical tsundere. Then she becomes a typical tsundere and creepily co-dependent. If Yuji had any sense he'd get a restraining order at that point, but since he's dumber than a brick that doesn't happen. Then she adds whiny to the list and officially becomes one of the most annoying, unsympathetic characters ever written. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is lazy. The backgrounds are very undetailed and the characters are very plain. Sometimes their lips don't even move while they're talking. If the art is good for anything it's that it's so dull it makes a good sleep aid.They throw in fan service with the main protagonist randomly, which is disturbing since she looks to be about twelve and you get unnecessary scenes of her in the bath.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is bad. Most of the voice actors are type cast and none of them seem to be putting any effort into their performances. Which is either really bad directing or actor apathy. The music is the best part of the anime and it's just stock and mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. The female characters rarely talk to each other except about guys. Seriously, this may be the only anime I've seen with a female protagonist and several female supporting characters that fails the Bechdel test in all but a couple episodes. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Shakugan no Shana is a 2/10. It's terrible. The characters are what really kill it. If they were better written it might just be a dreadfully dull anime, but they're so insipid and obnoxious that it becomes a real chore to watch. I can only recommend it to those people who are dreadfully dull or looking for a quick insomnia remedy.",

            "content": "Story (8.8) - Shakugan no shana...hum..after watching the first episode i told to myself: \" lol...all characters look like kids and its way too childish for me\" ... well the fact is that i got used and it wasnt that bad as i was thinking after the 1st episode..its not that the 1st ep was bad (in fact it was a good start), i just was expecting something a bit different from this anime..anyway lets talk about the story..\r\nWell, the story starts when yuji sekai finds out that he is a torch..a torch is something that replaces someone who is already dead.. As the timegoes, torches disappear completly from the world and people&acute;s minds. But yuji is a special one, he has a treasure that allows him to stay fully recover the existence he lost at every midnight. At the same time he finds the truth about himself, he meets shana, a flame haze, who has the mission to keep the balance of the world. Then the start to stick together and fight against a lot of enemies.\\n\r\nMy opinion, is a well made story, i liked it and i give it a 9...\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (9.0) - Well, at start i didn&acute;t like the fact the characters looked way to childish, but i got used to it, and i ended up liking it..i think the design is good and the details in envyronment and that stuff are certanly in the group of the best i saw..about the effects and animation, well certainly is well devellopped and the producers worked a lot..its not perfect, but i&acute;ve seen much worse for sure..\\n\\n\r\nSound (7.2) - Nothing special indeed..its not something i can say i disliked it, but also i cant say i liked it...its just acceptable..\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacther (8.0) - Well, some charather i noticed no devellopment during the whole series..others like the main characters were well develloped and sometimes it sound like it was way too much..the story goes around yuji and shana, and sometimes it gives way to much attention to it..well, in overall i think its enough to say characters are good but with some flaws..(also, some of them are really anoying grrrr lol)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.3) -  A fine show with moments of action, suspense and mistery..however, there is also the oposite, in some moments i almost slept during some episodes, that if it was me i would just had cut those parts from the series..but in overall i got satisfied and i consider it a good anime to spend some time watching.\\n\\n\r\noverall (8.5)- In the limit between 8 and 9..i have a great doubt about this final rating, since in some way i really liked it, and in another way i dont think it was something special..but i decide to give credit to it and give a 9, plus a recommendation for all thos who like this kind of stuff with magic, abillities, suspense, fights..etc...\\n\\n",

The romance, or the lacking of it, was HORRIBLE. The romance between the two characters was ridiculous. I'll more about it in the character section. Other than that the story keeps you interested with plot twists here and there but for the most part, well at least for me, you can't get around how annoying the romance is.\r\nArt: GREAT visuals in this anime. They really do a good job on how it looks other than one thing and thatsthe purple bear, seriously. They could've made it more vicious or something because in my opinion it kinda looked stupid when just standing there. That was really the only downside of this anime when coming to art. It was very easy on the eyes really.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Everything was good other than one thing. SHANA'S VOICE!!!! I remember just watching it thinking &quot;Someone please kill this girl off or at least change voice actors&quot;. Everything else was fine really but someone that is supposed to be legendary should sound a bit...well cooler. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I think they did really well here, everyone was in the anime was extremely enjoyable to watch. They all had their own personalities that developed as the anime went on which is very impressive because it didn't feel like the series was wasting time by introducing these characters. Shana was tooooooOOOOoOO annoying when in came to Yuji. Being stuck up and headstrong only goes so far. There are times where she is tolerable but enter Yuji's feelings into the equation and everything goes under when coming to Shana's character. Too me personally she is a quite annoying character that brought down the series. If she wasn't so powerful then she would be very replaceable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed everything not dealing with Shana/Yuji relationship. Those parts were just too annoying that it made me want to just stop the anime right there. The fights were good though. The supporting cast was awesome as well, saving this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Pretty good, just Shana's voice and Shana/Yuji relationship parts was so annoying that it makes you want to beat children and the elderly but other than that I would recommend it IF the person had already watch a whole bunch of other anime and just wanted something to burn time.",

The story was somewhat original - neither a standard anime storyline nor a groundbreaking unprecedented plot.  The animation style is not the most flashy or intricate, but the action sequences are mostly well animated.  I\\'ve seen much worse, but I\\'ve also seen much better.  The music is good, but typical.  Nothing new there.  The characterization is interesting, but verges on outrageous at times.  There are times when the things the characters do/say are very hard to take seriously.Despite how mediocre my description must make the series seem, it is actually quite entertaining and dramatic.  All in all, you can\\'t go wrong.",

            "content": "I saw a fire that ignited and blazed strong for an instant.  It grabbed my attention and had me going towards it.  The fire quickly died down however, weakened and became very dim.  I watch the flame, waiting for it to die, but for some reason it stays: weak and flickering.\r\nThis is essentially what I thought about this anime.  It starts off really strong in the first four episodes with really cool ideas and even some thought provoking themes that could potentially be explored.  I was really interested to see where it was all going to go... and it endedup being really disappointing.  But oddly, it was never really bad or terrible.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10 (below average)\\n\r\nIt starts off great, putting the main character Yuji in a shocking realization: he found out that he died a long time ago and has a limited amount of time before he is wiped out of existence.  I loved seeing his denial, I enjoyed seeing Shana initially looking upon Yuji as some object, but realizing through Yuji and his situation that not all people were selfish.  Unfortunately,  something very convenient ends up happening and from that point on, the story descends to mediocrity at best.  The story goes from being unique with cool ideas to incredibly cheesy: protagonist is clueless and is part of an annoying love triangle, girl with superpowers finds boy who holds the key for the bad guys great evil plan,  main villains want to obtain ultimate power.  It also really fails to balance comedy/slice of life with action/adventure, resulting in a really inconsistent experience.  Sometimes they spend way too much time on pointless swimming episodes we have seen a million times or pointless love triangle crap.  Other times when you have an interesting arc they don't explore it as much as I would like, and the arcs that are really boring feel like they go on forever!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10 (average) \\n\r\nShana's character is what kept the weak flame alive for me, even though she is your typical tsundere.  I think the reason I like her is because conceptually her character is very interesting and despite her cliche archetype is the only one that gets any meaningful character development.  Yuji's classmates aren't too bad either.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand...\\n\r\nYuji is a typical clueless, dense, dull protagonist\\n\r\nVillains are almost all one dimensional and are as dull as dishwater.\\n\r\nBig-Breasts-Blond booze drinker and talking book were both incredibly annoying, with just as painful sidekicks to boot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 (good)\\n\r\nIt does its job well.  I particularly like the flame haze look. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 (good)\\n\r\nThe ost is actually pretty good albeit repetitive.  Serieux was an ost I really liked in particular.  A really fitting track for a bad ass red haired chick kicking ass with a sword.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10 (meh)\\n\r\nThis is a very popular series and I am pretty sure a lot of people really like it.  I did see the potential and I do see some of the appeal for this show, but I just couldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.  \\n\\n\r\nHow much you can enjoy this, I think, depends on how much you can tolerate the high school melodrama, cliche shounen action stuff, and some cookie cutter character archetypes.  If you can get past all of this: it does have decent animation, good music, some interesting concepts, and some surprisingly charming moments with Shana.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 (average)\\n\\n\\n",

An anime that takes advantage of that makes a good, interesting show to watch.\r\nSadly, Shakugan no Shana is not one of those.\r\nStory: 6 / 10\r\nSo the setup of Shakugan no Shana was incredible. The ideas behind it were intriguing, and they're the things that made me want to watch it.\r\nHowever, after watching some more episodes, things just begin to drag.\r\nIntense fight scenes become boring snooze-fests. You can tell that the writer(s) had no idea whatto do with this setup, so they basically removed any bit of originality it had; that's quite a feat.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 / 10\\n\r\nMost of the artwork is quite good, albeit generic-looking, and the animators do a decent enough job, but ultimately they can't really salvage anything out of this. It looks pretty boring, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5 / 10\\n\r\nAside from the jingle that plays before and after the commercial breaks, I found nothing amazing in this soundtrack. The opening and ending songs are quite good though, and they fit the show very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3 / 10\\n\r\nOnly one of these characters was interesting. Just one. Most of them lack any kind of charisma and they're cardboard cutouts of many stereotypes: tsundere, harem protagonist, laid back villain, the list goes on.\\n\r\nMarco was the only character I thought was really funny and interesting, but even \u00b4his\u00b4 jokes got old really fast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3 / 10\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the first episodes were very good. They were interesting.\\n\r\nAfter the third or fourth episode though, it just becomes a slow, boring, generic anime with little to no redeeming qualities. I was begging for the 5th episode to end about 13 minutes in, I just couldn't stand how monotonous it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5 / 10\\n\r\nShakugan no Shana's painfully slow and dull execution severely damages its unique concept, which is a huge dissapointment. I recommend you avoid this one.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nHe had thought his normal days would last forever, until they were ended abruptly by an encounter with a girl with red hair and eyes. He named her Shana.\r\nNot long after he enters high school, Sakai Yuji\u2019s normal days come to an end. He sees something bizarre on his way home: people are frozen in a strange fire, and a monster that looks like a large doll is attacking them. Just when he's about to be killed, a girl in a dark cloak wielding a large sword appears, and slices the monster in half. Although Yuji survives the strange encounter, the girl informs him ofa desolate truth: \" 'You' don't exist anymore.\"\\n\\n\r\nShe calls herself a Flame Haze who hunts \"Guze no Tomogara\"; intruders from another world. She explains to him that he is a \"Torch\", a substitute of Yuji whose \u201cexistence\u201d has already been devoured. She also told him that he is a special Torch, \"Mystes\", which contains a precious item in it. When he looks at his chest, he sees within himself a faint flame, just as she said.\\n\\n\r\nIt is in this way that his eternal struggle alongside the girl begins.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art work was enjoyable to watch because the way the character had good details and how you can actually see the real quality of it made it great. The quality is enjoyable but is not the same quality as Clannad or Fate Zero. The art work could of been improve more on the world and the way the fighting animation were. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great, I loved the first and last season intro and outro. The sound was played at the right time and just made me want to watch the anime again and listen to the song over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nSome people can say Shana was suborn because she didn't like to be around Yuji because she felt weird around him. Yuji was the main character who was dragged into the world Shana secretly lives in.\\n\r\nThen you have your supporting characters such as:\\n\r\nAlastor\\n\r\nKazumi\\n\r\nKeisaku\\n\r\nEita\\n\\n\r\nI found Alastor to be like a faster to Shana because he would always be by her side and will always comfort her and try to make her happy and focus.\\n\r\nI find Kazumi brave that she always trying to help even though she can't because humans can not do anything the the Crimson Denizens.\\n\r\nI found Keisaku brave and a person that only care about the present time because he would do everything he can to be a help of Margery.\\n\r\nI found Eita brave and shocked because he would try to be a help of Margery but when the incident happened he stopped talking to Margery since he was in a state of shock.\\n\\n\r\nEnding:\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was not as I expected. Why? Because it was left as a cliffhanger and the audience will not know how it truly ends. But nonetheless it was a great ending with a cliffhanger. \\n\\n\r\nMy rating here:\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a 9 because of how the third season was. The third season took a while to get used to and it didn't explain how it happened until the ending of the anime. I also hate how the ending was because they left it as a cliffhanger that will rise a lot of unanswered questions.\\n",

            "content": "\"You are not a human. You are an object.\"\r\nIf you were told the above, what would your reaction be? Sakai Yuji, the male protagonist of Shakugan no Shana, was thrown precisely into this chaotic situation one day while walking home from school. At the same time, viewers were introduced to the main theme of the anime. What if no one will ever remember your existence in this world. Being dead is one thing, but if everything about you will be erased from this world when you die (that includes people's memory of you), the thought alone could be terrifying to many.\r\nWhile at first glance Shakuganno Shana may seem like just another anime with the protagonist being thrown into a world he never thought existed. It really make itself standout from the rest if for no other reason than the spectacular introduction to the theme of the story. The story develop itself rather slowly midway through the series as the viewers were taken back in time for some background learning that lead us to understand certain characters better (more on that in the character section). Overall there was no rush to the story as events unfold themselves in a very elegant and comprehensive manner.\\n\\n\r\nIt should, however, be noted that since this is just an introductory season to the Shana saga (there is a season 2 to Shakugan no Shana and there will most likely be more in the future), not a lot of questions were answered ... but many were raised and leave people in confusion at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThough it can't be considered a masterpiece in animation, it is in fact still pretty top notch, especially the battle effects (flames for example, were animated in great detail and looked very awesome). If there's anything to complain about, it would be the over-sized eyes on most characters. But once that's accepted, everything else about the animation should not hurt your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the OP were very catchy, I didn't quite like the ED much (personal taste). Sound tracks were great as they match well with the intended scenes, some can even help drive your emotion a bit. In addition, the seiyu are quite famous:\\n\r\nShana voiced by Rie Kugimiya whose famous for her role in Full Metal Alchemist as Alphonse Elric, Nena Trinity in Gundam 00, and Louise Fran\u00e7oise in Zero no Tsukaima. Kazumi Yoshida voiced by Ayako Kawasumi who voiced in Fate/stay night as Saber, Kanokon as Chizuru Minamoto, and Otoha Sakurano in Sky Girls. \\n\r\nShakugan no Shana also stars Hitomi Nabatame, Shizuka Itou, Mamiko Noto, and many many more talented voice actors/actresses.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are what make this anime shine like a star. Due to the \"non-rushing\" nature of the show, each character (even the supporting casts) present their own background history and overtime we get to know their personality more and their \"behind thoughts\". This result in a very real and believable group of fantastically designed characters (both in terms of the \"realism\" and the \"looks\"). Definitely not something you see often in anime these days. The drawback is that some viewers may find it boring or made the stalled the story development.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not quite a masterpiece level anime, Shakugan no Shana is still a show that is very successful in every single aspect. Personally, this show started out quite a bit like Busou Renkin and Bleach (while others say it is similar to Fate/stay night), but it ultimately delivered a much stronger impression on me than the ones mentioned.",

            "content": "I couldn\u2019t get myself to finish it (Actually watching up to this episode was a trial in and of itself in a way). It simply has too many flaws that can't be overlooked. Shakugan no Shana is one of those anime that has a really intriguing plot but can't follow up on it. The first episode was stunning and I was looking forward to a deep and somehow philosophic, mature anime but it turns out to be a bad-guy-appears-and-is-defeated-anime. \r\nSTORY\r\nDon't be deceived by the intelligent beginning. I thought I was going to witness an excellent story and drama just from the opening. It quickly becameboring, lame, and confusing. It evolved into just another of the partly romance, partly action stories, with both aspects being underdeveloped, flat. If I had read a paragraph summary of the show then it would've been just that much more boring (ruining the only part of show) it was one of the few redeeming things the show has, that concept...\\n\\n\r\nIt has uninteresting dialogue, repetitive battle scenes, and slow execution. They bring in some sort of awkward romance story that isn't really fulfilling or moving. So this series basically becomes a horribly clich\u00e9 and contrived romance with absolutely no progress in any meaningful direction. The actual story development with the baddies, romance and all that is REALLY clich\u00e9. Neither the story nor characters are worth it for watching this series. The action was actually boring to me, the ones I saw anyway...\\n\\n\r\nIt's best summed up as a sword girl + generic male lead fighting to save the day. They came up with some 'intricate' plots but really they aren't that impressive. The show tries to blur its simplicity with many terms and names. It's roughly about a boring and overly confusing and overly repeated plot about mistes, torches, flame hazes, guzes, balance of the world, etc... The whole thing is just confusing and I don't feel like it's my fault. There's not enough explanation yet there's so much confusing, boring dialogue\\n\\n\r\nthere was this ONE SCENE that I thought was the ULTIMATE EXAMPLE OF WHY it's so...manipulative and impudent at the same time. it also is one of the biggest/annoying problems in new anime that I canNOT STAND.\\n\\n\r\nSo they show Shana changing and they show her taking her panties off (lol)\\n\r\nBut while she's doing that she's talking about all that mumbo-jumbo and that mumbo-jumbo made no sense.. AND AND  because I have yet to thrown in the towel even though the signs are huge that the show is shit, I re-watch that scene. orz OTL   I realize it really doesn't make ANY SENSE. it's like they're trying to cover it up with this weird loli fanservice which doesn't do much for me. Have her say shit that makes no sense which they are apparently deluded that the viewer will take in as really too complex and deep or whatevers to comprehend if she takes her undies off while she says it. Was this in the ep I dropped it? PRObably. this is a really bad tell-tale sign that this anime is a piece of popular overrated shit.\\n\r\ntalk about trashy,  and just plain insulting. i'm sure the loli otakus went crazy over that scene but i didnt...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nAs episode after episode passed, I just felt horribly unsatisfied without any character development.They lack any sort of sort of dimensionality: unconvincing voice acting, dull dialogue, no development. Everyone else besides Shana is merely \"devices\" to make things a bit more intricate and to help push the \"story\" on. Characters are basically given whatever set of feelings and goals and repetitively do the same action. Nearly all of them are meaningless and replaceable. The male lead is not very appealing and can be easily forgotten. Shakugan no Shana is blessed with Shana, a cute character, but that's it. Shana is the only interesting character and even so she's not THAT interesting. Shana is clearly \"loli\" which doesn't make me like her any more BTW but hey if you're into that sure\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe enemies are just enemies, it's like they exist only because the anime needed them. They don't explain their background all that much, they don't have motives really, boring, possibly annoying, same old same old, in other words I couldn't care much...  From the 1st ep I just thought the baddies just weren't that \"cool\" but then again I didn't get to see/meet the other baddies I saw in the opening so who knows. But I doubt it...\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nI loved the artwork. It's what made me want to watch this in the first place. Though I did find the animation itself to be a little ordinary since I've seen other anime that look like this. It's normal  production quality of recent anime. Basically as much as I like the artwork, I can't watch for that\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nOne department Shana does quite well at is music. Its theme songs are very good and even fits in with the series with the lyrics. As far as voice acting, I couldn't help but feel that some characters weren't sounding too convincing. That could simply be due to the poor execution of the characters and storyline, consequently damaging the mood of the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are better anime of this genre out there fo sho. Shana never really passes more than an average/below average show. I would recommend that you watch the openings, because they look awesome and all that &  maybe the firsrt couple eps if you just wanna know what it's about but I can't fathom watching all 24 eps... Overall, a show with huge potential that fails to live up to its hype. \\n\\n\r\ndo yourself a favor and watch SLAYERS NEXT!! (watching slayers next twice is more enjoyable than watching shana once lol) instead of this anime. it has a girl with red hair too lolz... no but seriously it's actually funny and the serious parts are really good too (this anime is cool... in short while shana just gets lamer and lamer). seriously the characters actually have souls and the story is actually cool (I have this thing against fantasy anything but I love this fantasy anime) and the background music kicks ass and so does the op/ed and the seiyuu. It's better in every single way except maybe animation but I personally prefer slayers next animation to shana animation personally. it's on HULU!\\n\\n\r\nwww.hulu.com/the-slayers-next",

            "content": "Okay, for my first ever review, I thought I'd review one of my all time favourites, Shakugan no Shana.\r\nBefore I start, let me say that this anime is not everyone's cup of tea. Some people love it, some hate it and some are in between. As for me, I love it to bits so if my review seems a bit biased, I apologise right off the bat.\r\nFirst off, the storyline, I'm sure there are a few anime out there featuring parallel worlds or dimensions but I really enjoyed the way it's portrayed in this anime. The main reason for this being that, with such agrim and mature-ish beginning to the anime that gave it such a depth to storyline, the anime does also get lighter by mixing it with some other elements as well and I enjoy these lighter moments as much as the more intense parts of the anime. And mind you, this anime does seem to make the world around the main protagonist, Yuji, to seem hopeless at the start but it grows to become more light-hearted while still maintaining its original premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is rather good in my honest opinion. The characters are reasonably well drawn, although they are of the large-eyed variety as seen in many anime, they are still pretty decent to look at. In my opinion, the artwork shines the most during the fight scenes. The fight scenes never seem to leave you disoriented since it is laid out in such a way that makes it simple and yet, an enjoyment to watch.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound of the anime, I have found nothing I am particularly unhappy about when it comes to the overall sound of the anime. Basically, everything sounds alright, with no flaws or anything that I have found. The voice acting was also pretty decent, and I know some people would beg to differ right here but I liked the way that Rie Kugimiya voiced Shana to be very child-like to mirror Shana's original age and her true child-like self. I did also really enjoy the opening and ending themes of the series. The animations during these are pretty decent as well.\\n\\n\r\nNow for my favourite part, the characters. The characters really do grow on you in this anime. They also really do have some growth, even the less important ones do have some development to a certain degree. The most of development however must happen to the main characters and this series does not disappoint. First off, the main male protagonist, Yuji Sakai, there is a good deal of development especially at the early stages of the series when he is thrust headlong into a reality that seems so hopeless for him, and yet, he grows to understand and accept his situation. Second, there's Shana, the main female protagonist. Being a tsundere(wiki it if you're wondering what this means) character, she does have a lot of development as a character in the story throughout the series as she grows less cold toward Yuji, as she originally viewed him as little more than an object, and instead begins to grow more fond of him and these feelings really confuse her as she still has to maintain her duty as a Flame Haze.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the enjoyment factor, I really did enjoy it. Especially in the later parts of the anime, the plot and the characters did leave me feeling more and more attached to the anime. Most of all, I enjoyed watching the development of Yuji and Shana's relationship together since it's not your typical boy likes girl, girl likes boy drama, it's a lot more complicated than it appears.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great anime to watch with characters that begin to grow on you after a while. I definitely would recommend watching it. And it's also a must watch for any tsundere fan out there as well.",

            "content": "Shakugan no shana... An anime with alot of potential that overall felt like alot of regurgitated shounen/romance anime was a bit of a let down. The predictable uninspired story line, repetitiveness, cheesy humor, and mediocre character development left alot to be desired and is far from a masterpiece that is popularity would make you believe it is. \r\nStory line: \r\nThe initial introduction of the story really got my hopes up; basically about a normal boy who gets pulled into a bizarre battle only to find after words he no longer really exists, and that his entire being will slowly fade away and be forgotten byall of his loved ones. While discovering mysterious powers of his own he is emersed into into the world of magic and battles along with the cute but stubborn Red haired girl Shana who fights off those that threaten humanity.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite having an interesting few episodes the plot it stale. It moves very slowly and is predictable for the most part. The anime could have easily been done in half the episodes they took. The battles slowly become tedious along with the story. Also the cheesy romance that develops made it almost unbearable to watch after a certain point. If I were to describe the enjoyment of the story line most of the middle episodes drop down to a 4-5 nearly killing the series...\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt was... acceptable. As far as most main stream shows go the art was OK... but it was overall mediocre. It also feels very deceiving that the advertisements and Opening theme for the series has such beautiful animation because its really not that great overall. Some of the battle scenes were well done though.\\n\r\nCharacter animation wise the most attention is given to Shana; and they do a very good job with her. The rest of the characters on the other hand are uncreative and boring. The main character specifically lacks any real attracting traits that would set him apart from a side character...\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nOpening and ending songs are pretty good, I especially enjoyed the first ending theme Yowake Umare Kuru Shoujo. The music in show overall was acceptable, but nothing really stands out about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe two main characters... try imagining Saber and Shirou from fate/stay night as middle schoolers and that should give you an idea; Although Shana is much more vocally stubborn  that Saber ever was. \\n\r\nShana is the predictable Tsundere character~ The stubborn easily ticked, but deep down shy emotional girl. Her character development is interesting since she doesn't really understand basic human interaction very well...\\n\r\nYuji also is the predictable week but good hearted normal kid, who grows up to be more dependable courageous guy. \\n\r\nPerhaps what killed the character development was when they attempted to throw in romance... its just didn't work for this plot because of their age... and it split what the story really should have focused on. \\n\r\nThere are actually alot of other characters in the story... but their development is mediocre or nonexistent...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\r\nI don't really have much else to say about this series other than It was actually painful to put myself through the torture of watching this entire series; and I think anime fans that are looking for something deep, a moving story line, and/or epic battles will be very disappointed unless they have very low standards.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason its gets overall higher scores is because it was made for a large viewing audience~ incorporating humor, action, Romance, magical/fantasy and slice of life.  They say the Jack of all trades is master of none, and this anime proves this point.",

            "content": "I will say at the beginning of this anime i did feel a little hopeless. The anime imposes a scary thought into your head, what if i flicker out? What if no one REMEMBERS me? That is the main theme of this anime. Not whether or not you existed, but whether or not you are remembered.\r\nThis is a story about loving someone who isn't necessarily human, but human to you. I warn you, the first three or four episodes are sad, because you will most likely be empathizing with the Torches. But, overall, the anime is enjoyable, meaningful, and somehow, it makes you look forthe silver lining.\\n\\n\r\nWatch the first 4 episodes, and then after that, you can basically assess whether you will enjoy the art style and theme or not.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9\\n\r\nWith many twists and turns, this anime definitely has you addicted to each and every episode. Each episode develops the characters phenomenally each step of the journey, and creates a dramatic tension that could almost be understood as the recognition of one's self and values. The only problem I had with the story was the fact that...   Yuuji never kisses Shana. I waited for that every episode after they mentioned the &quot;oath&quot;. .  Also, i have never heard someone describe the feelings attached to a kiss so accurately and empathetically.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10 \\n\r\nThe effects are... amazing. I will admit i was thrown off by the overly big eyes at the very beginning when i looked at the cover for this anime, but somehow they suit the style and artistic quality of the anime. The effects when Shana has her burning hair are astounding, and the lighting effects are magnificent. I watched a splash in the water, gaping at how intricate and amazingly crafted it was. Art is without a doubt a perfect 10 for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nI loved the voice actors for every character, and enjoyed the OP and ED sequences very much. I would've rather had a slower song for the OP, but when you get to episode 13 (i think), the OP changes and it becomes suitable for the episodes. I enjoyed the ED very much. I'm usually one to skip the credits each episode, but i watched with awe for most of them. And i enjoyed the art in the background =]\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 10\\n\r\nThis is the first anime i have ever given a 10 on characters for. Most characters are flat, that don't change substantially from episode to episode, but SHakugan no Shana shows the difference between Yuuji and his understanding of his own situation, and his own acceptance of him becoming a Mistes, and also Shana's relationship with Yuuji (No matter how many times she avoids it by yelling &quot;Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!&quot;) develops so intricately into the plot. This was one of the most wonderful character development sequences i have ever come across. You will fall in love with Shana and Yuuji for their admirable qualities (and some of Shana's detestable manners). I can guarantee that.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nEveryone loves a good sad anime every now and then. And then to be lifted up from that sad anime into a happier light. That's what this anime does. It makes you involved with every single character, and makes you enjoy every aspect of the visual effects, the sound effects, and the general aura that is exhumed from whatever device you're watching it from. It's got a lot of good moments, though it doesn't have the outrageous &quot;Anime Comedy&quot; animation that i've seen in others (Where the characters get huge teeth to bark with, or their heads get huge and their bodies become small, other effects like that). So if you enjoy that particular aspect of Anime Comedy, i say look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n\r\nI would give this one a perfect 10, but i feel that the storyline could move quicker towards the beginning, and admonish the fact that people want don't want to be put off by the sadness. I think if you watch this, i will give you the same advice that i have given for other animes: Watch the first 3 episodes, and if you like it, watch it, or ditch it (Even if it is &quot;Orphen: The sorcerer stabbing something or other&quot;). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy =]",

            "content": "Pros \r\n+Solid story\r\n+Nice art work \r\n+Great Character development\r\n+Good male and female lead \r\nCons\r\n-Slow pace at times \r\n-Nothing unique\r\n-Little predicable \r\nMy Opinion \r\nAlright let me kick of this review by saying i love Tsundere characters, especially when there voiced by Kugimiya, Rie, so i went into this show with high hopes and ill say there weren't met to the full but it was still a good show that i enjoy'd for the most part. \r\nSo ill start with the story, the story in the first season of Shakugan No Shana is really a lot of explaining and setting the scene for the viewer which is understandableand for the most part i didn't mind listening to story of Shana and how she and Sakai, Yuuji are both coming to term with there new environment. The issue was this is maybe it was a bit to much, i love these shows but even i found myself a little bored at times. \\n\\n\r\nAs for lead characters Shana ticks all the boxes for me as a female lead and really doesn't disappoint though out the show, she's funny strong and prefect for main role of this show. Sakai, Yuuji could have turned into a real mess of a character but he takes on the burden of his new responsibility's well and wants to become stronger, which i found would have been better than hiding behind the Stronger characters in the show. As for a three lead i suppose we have Yoshida, Kazumi who for the most part is really only there to add another twist to the relationship between Yuuji and Shana. The issue i always have with a second female lead in these types of the shows the fact that there isn't any competition for the male lead, keeping in mind when i'm writing this i am only half way though the second season, so i could be dead wrong but normally its pretty easy to see who going to come on with the male lead by her side. So yes they develop the characters well but they do rather slowly and it can damage the over pacing of the show and the overall enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking at this show and expecting it to eat your heart out and make you sit on the edge of your sit, your not really going to get it here. The story although interesting isn't anything we haven't seen before so therefore it isn't going to make you jump out of your seat. \\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch this show? If your are interested in the type of show and have maybe watch and enjoy'd shows like Zero Louise then yes you should, you will find it still rather entertaining as i did. The show has some heart felt moments and so real fast paced action that you will enjoy but for the most part it can be sort of dry, so if you have seen shows with the same sort of premises as this and haven't enjoy'd it then its a safe bet this isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nHope my review was helpful  \\n\r\nMurphy      \\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime.... is just another anime. Nothing spectacular or amazing.\r\nSTORY: it started off extremely slowly, and i think the first half of the series was basically explaining the main concept of how people disappear, who Shana was and what she does. I would have rather liked to see all these elements integrated into the story, because otherwise, it is a huge influx of information. The plotline was predictable.\r\nART: best part of the series. I liked the scenes when there were a lot of red, there seemd to be many shades of red, and it reflected the intensity of battle. NOTE: battle intensity that should bein battles, not, the battles that Shana was in.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: not bad, the OP and ED were kinda catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Yuuji is such a tool. His kind of character annoys me. Shana was more interesting, but her obsession with melon bread and her &quot;shut up&quot; phrase was ALMOST overdone. But for loli lovers, her habits would make Shana an instant win.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: it moved slowly, I had stopped the series for a while because I got bored. I finished it, just to see what the hype was about after the series was complete. Nothing out of the ordinary, a good way to pass time.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like lolis, Shakugan no Shana is a good recommendation.",

            "content": "Spiralsraise's Review: \r\nThe beginning of the series was interesting. You had a character who was conflicted about his place, if he could really be human, and behave as one, yet acts very much like one even though he's a Torch. Often Yuji would hear from Shana that he is \"just\" a torch and it would get to him. Through out the entire story he tries hard to identify and establish some kind of connection to Shana and be as much help to her as he can. To make things just a bit harder for Yuji, Shana's personality leaves her detatched from the world, since herfocus is mainly on being a Flame Haze and how serious she takes it. Aside from the two main characters (Shana and Yuji) there continues to be diversity in personalities of characters.  A fair portion of the time the characters are what are helping to drive the plot, but there are times where that doesn't happen.\\n\r\nThe Plot is interesting and different in some aspects from things i've seen before. It makes you wonder yourself if life where that way, if you were a torch, would you notice? What would your personal conflicts be? Would you still want to do everything on the figurative (and sometimes literal) things you want to do before you die list? Would it actually count if you tried to since you aren't really you and more but an impression of who you are. At the beginning it can pose a lot of personal questions for yourself but seeing how Yuji deals with these sorts of questions (not all of them) and how he tries to reaffirm himself that he still has an identity is the initial hook. You end up wondering where he developed the strength to look at his reality so calmly, yet with conviction. \\n\r\nThe romance that you see in the story isn't overwhelming either. It's there yet it's controlled and the romance doesn't become the plot. One of the more enjoyable things about the romance in the plot is Shana's own confusion and lack of understanding of things. Her uncertainty and balancing the part of herself that is a Flame Haze and the part that she identifies as Shana is an interesting parallel to the story, and shows the growth that Shana goes through once meeting Yuji. However, with that said Shana's feelings for Yuji do become more involved with the plot as it progresses and some may see that becoming more of the focus. \\n\r\nEven though a fair portion of the story is serious there are comedic points that can get you laughing and help lighten up the story and see the characters as those you could identify with to some degree. All in all, It was an enjoyable 24 episode season, and i'm curious to see how they plan to continue the story.",

So please try to read it before knocking down this review lol.\r\nI never really even knew about Shana a couple months ago, the main reason I watched this show was because while browsing wikipedia I saw a pic of Shana and I thought she looked like Konata from LS LOL so I thought why not? In the end I never expected I would find an anime that wouldhook me so much, this show was perfect for me since it had everything I was looking for in a show at the time. And if it was destiny after I finished watching this season I learned of a second season that had just started ON THE SAME DAY LOL I win :)\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story of this anime was definitely a very interesting and complex one as well, the first episode alone I felt was so packed with info shallowing it all was overwhelming, but I wasn't complaining because since episode one this show struck me and kept me interested till the very end. This story at first I thought was going to include action but after seeing Shana's struggle to try to understand her love of Yuji and the heavy drama elements of this show kicked in, that sealed the deal for me since I had found a perfect balance between my favourite anime elements.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm sure everyone will agree when I say the visual highlight of this show is ALWAYS Shana when she is in flame haze mode with her bright red firey hair and her bright red eyes, really pretty to look at ^_^ other than that the show had some pretty decent animation although there were parts where you could see an obvious lack of animation when there were some distorted faces and stuff like that. The visuals were not bad, but they also didnt really overwhelm me. Although there were parts where it really did look great I give it an 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is IMO one of the show's best features, the background songs played during the more dramatic moments felt perfect and during the battles as well. Hishoku no Sora piano version is one of my favourite pieces to date and every scene where it was played I fell in love with &gt;_&gt;\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: OK, I'm going to admit if it wasn't for Shana this show would not be on my favourites. Unlike her, all the other charactes where they main of supporting justs did not feel like they were developed enough for me to care about them, Yuji maybe just a little bit. Shana on the other hand I thought was developed perfectly, watching her change from her rude and cold self into a more charing person because of Yuji's influence was REALLY cool to see, her internal struggles caused by her feelings were IMO really touching moments, Yoshida I felt was only good to make Shana realize her feelings and other than that she just pisses me off lol...Shana is what made this show so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: When I finished watching this show I was overwhelmed by how beautiful it was, I felt like I had watched a show that was made for me and knew that It had become a favourite for me. There I go sounding biased &gt;_&gt; but it was a good show no matter how you look at it anyways...\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was really something I enjoyed and I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy so I STRONGLY RECOMMEND to give this show a try. And since I am currently watching the second season another review will come soon lol if I was not so biased I would prob give this show a solid 9/10 or 8.5/10 but well I'm a fanboy so I'll give it a perfect 10/10 lol\\n\\n\r\n[/fanboyism]",

Staff\r\nPlot (by sirhcle):\r\nShakugan no Shana is set in our world in which everything is fueled by the power of existence. One day a boy names Sakai Yuji finds that he is moving in a time-frozen realm, whilst a monster (called Rinne) ingests blue flames (power of existence) for their masters (called Tomogara). It is here that Sakai Yuji meets a girl who he later names Shana. Shana is a flame haze, responsible for annihilating Rinne and hunting down their masters. Who wish to use power of existence to become stronger, by harvesting thepower from humans and in turn the world is distorted.\\n\r\nWhen a person's power of existence is taken away, they cease to exist. Flame Haze's can produce a torch - an artificial existence that will slowly falter but slowly transitions ones existence to nothing as to ease the sudden shock in disappearance of an individual. Yuji and Shana team up to defeat the Tomogara and their plans of gaining power of existence.\\n\\n\r\nsirhcle's comments:\\n\r\nI've heard a lot about this anime from forums and people, but fail to see how it is so unique. Razz The anime starts off very slowly, but picks up it's pace at the end. I think that the introduction to the world is quite lengthy, although it's concept is not all that complex. The storyline seems to entangle a lot on the relationship side between Shana and Yoshida, but these seem to be premature-junior high school crushes. We are also given 2-whole episodes on Shana's background which helps us understand the role of a flame haze and her behavior in relationships, but it's usually something I'd prefer to pick up along the story.\\n\r\nI found the storyline to be fairly predictable.\\n\r\nNot as great as I'd expected, but still an 'okay' anime. I think the appeal comes from Shana and lolicon lovers. I swear, meron-pan (melon bread?) is selling like hot cakes these days.\\n\r\nI'd recommend people who 'have time' to watch it.",

The excellent switching between action and romance and comedy made me feel really interested in the main story and it also seems like evrything can happen , in other words I couldn't forsee anything that was going to happen storywise . The animation is perfect , the sound isgreat in other words this anime is the kind you like watching alone in the dark with a big bowl of popcorn just relaxing and enjoying it .",

            "content": "Plot\r\nHere's a background check:\r\nShakugan no Shana was originally a light novel series written by Yashichiro Takanashi that started in 2002 and ended in 2012. Since then, it has spawned two manga adaptations, three anime seasons, four OVA episodes, and a movie, of all things. According to Wikipedia, critics \"praised the series for its execution of typical story elements and how it continuously becomes better over time. However, the series is described as having issues with pacing.\" (Pfft... Yeah, \"issues with pacing\", that's totally all that's wrong with it...)\r\nThe story is about a high school student named Yuji Sakai, and he's... well... dead. Okay, he's notreally 'dead', per se, but his original body has ceased to exist because it was eaten by something called a 'Crimson Denizen'. Now a 'Torch', Yuji is saved by a 'Flame Haze' known as the Flaming Haired Blazing Eyed hunter, and-\\n\\n\r\nOkay, okay, stop. What is a Crimson Denizen supposed to be? What's a Flame Haze? What's a Torch meant to be? Where did these guys come from? I don't know what's going on here - slow down and explain things, please.\\n\\n\r\nSee, this is what I was like when I was watching the first episode. And you know what? I was like this the entire time I was watching it as well. Shakugan no Shana has indefinitely and stubbornly refused to answer the most important questions. It has refused to establish what everything is supposed to be; it's like it expects the audience to figure everything out by themselves. It's like telling a child to build his own bed, and you've removed most of the parts to make the overall frame - that's how badly Shana fucked up in giving me a clear definition of what is what. For example, they mention something called an 'Unrestricted Method', and they show it... but they don't outright explain what this 'Unrestricted Method' is supposed to do, because it appears to have more than one use.\\n\\n\r\n...Okay, so maybe it did explain what a Torch was... once. In the entire anime's run as of the first season. In the first episode. In less than five seconds. Seriously, how can they expect me to remember what everything is if they not only don't explain things to me properly in the first place, let alone give a more in-depth explanation as to why shit is happening? Also, perhaps there were more explanations on what a Crimson Denizen was, but I certainly didn't hear it. As far as I know, they probably said it when the stereotypical loli tsundere was changing her clothes. Yeah. How smart of them - I'm totally able to focus on the dialogue in the midst of all the hateful things I was thinking about while watching a 12-year-old body being exploited for the lolicons' entertainment. Way to go, J.C. Staff - that's always a good way to not piss people off.\\n\\n\r\nThey got around to explaining what a Flame Haze was too. Guess when. No, seriously, I'm asking you: Guess which episode is where they got around to telling me what a Flame Haze is. ... Got an answer?\\n\\n\r\nIf you guessed around episode 15-17, you'd be just about right. Yes, I'm not lying - they took over ten fucking episodes to explain what a Flame Haze is. Basically, it's kinda like a soul reaper, in that its mission is to maintain the balance of the world's existence. Got that? Okay, now try to make sense of what they mean by maintaining the balance of existence.\\n\\n\r\nYour guess would be as good as mine, because that's what they use to fight. But it makes no sense, whatsoever. How the fuck can you use existence to fight? Existence is existence; you can't manipulate its essence the way they do in the show. Couldn't they have just called it magic or something and call it a day? Please, some logic would be nice.\\n\\n\r\nActually, yeah, that's another thing this show is missing: Logic. Yuji's love triangle is treated as something important to the story - spoiler alert: it really isn't anything special; it's actually a pathetic mess - yet both girls involved have no logical reason to like him at all. I'll go through what made them start to like him.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female loli tsundere lead, Shana, began to like Yuji after she did a complete 180 degrees on her characterisation when he started watching her getting changed right in front of him. She was okay with it, right until Yuji brought it up and started to not act like a Mystes. (What's a 'Mystes', you ask? To be honest, the show hasn't told me what this is, either.) Apparently, he's so 'human', that she develops self-consciousness around him out of nowhere after being alive for god knows how long. The most annoying part about that scene is that she never had a problem changing clothes with anyone else in her past. Why the sudden change when he's involved? Because, reasons, that's why. \\n\\n\r\nThe other girl - Kazumi Yoshida - likes him because he talked to her. That's all he did, and he ended up making her want his dick. How is that romance? That doesn't work in real life, and it most definitely does not work in anime. What a joke...\\n\\n\r\nThe show also reaches its lowest point at the end of episode 24, the final episode of the first season. Alastar (or Alastor - whatever, the dub couldn't decide which one it is) tells Shana that in order to save Kisami City from becoming a \"fountain of existence\" - whatever that means - he has to be able to take this 'existence' to transform himself from being a pendant into his true form as a Crimson Lord, which is basically a lord of something called the Crimson World. (What's the Crimson World? Again, the show never explains this, let alone shows it to us.) What happens when he transforms is that the Flaming Haired Blazing Eyed hunter dies - always has. That means Shana was going to die, and that there was no way of surviving; they never said there was a chance of survival.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I was like, \"Hey, that actually might be a good way to end the show - it'd be dramatic, I'd enjoy myself... Yeah, this could work.\"\\n\\n\r\n...Then I remembered that I spoiled the ending a long while ago. And that I remembered it extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nYuji decided to die with Shana, and they walk off into the light to save the city . . .\\n\\n\r\n. . . and then wake up on top of a building, the city saved. Oh, and Yuji kept his clothes, but Shana's disappeared for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nYes, that's right, they survived. And guess what? Alastar said this (paraphrased): \"Oh look at that, it appears there was a chance of survival after all.\"\\n\\n\r\n... What. You mention that almost directly after it happens? You expect us to accept this bullshit? This is the worst anime ending ever... At least School Days had a point to its ending. This didn't, other than to say, \"Oh, don't worry guys, they'll be back for the next season!\" Yeah, fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you think this is all I have to say? Oh no, I'm just getting started. *cracks knuckles* Now then...\\n\\n\r\nThe flashback episodes looking into Shana's past are also stupid as all fuck. At this point, she was training to become a Flame Haze on a hidden floating island that we're given no idea where it came from at all (and it was floating over a fucking city), and we're also given no indication as to how old she actually is, but it's been hinted that she's at least over 100. One of her training partners is this skeleton dude, and she decides to pull a prank on him so that she can finally get a hit in, because when they train, she always loses.\\n\\n\r\nShe takes galloons of tomato sauce and pours it into a big hole she dug up, and then sleeps near it to get the skeleton dude to fall into it after jumping off the nearby tree to attack her. It works, and the guy is covered in sauce while Shana gets a training sword and donks him on the head, getting a hit.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what he does? He flips his fucking shit, and then proceeds to unleash all of his power, resulting in a massive explosion that not only revealed the island's location to the enemies, but also destroys it to the point that it starts to collapse after an episode. Dude, calm the fuck down! It's a prank for Christ's sake. No experienced fighter that had been portrayed as this calm, badarse character would all of a sudden change his personality entirely and do something as stupid as revealing the secret location where you train Flame Hazes like Shana. Honestly... \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's not all. They had one villain that I thought was cool, but then he got completely worfed by a Mystes known as the Flame Haze Killer. (I thought a Mystes was supposed to be something else entirely, but it turns out I was wrong.) Said Flame Haze Killer not only looks like a samurai, but also is the most powerful Mystes ever. I'm serious - that's exactly what they said. Guess what happens when he fights Shana.\\n\\n\r\nHe gets defeated in three minutes by a headbutt. And Shana was wearing fucking bandages, and nothing else. Gee, how threatening that guy must be. Shana didn't even use a sword against him. She dodged a few times, punched a hole in his side, and then headbutted him. And Shana didn't get hit once. How come she defeated him, yet gets her arse kicked quicker than you can say \"power inconsistency\"?\\n\\n\r\nI think that's all I'm going to say about the plot, because at this rate, I'm going to write a whole book about how bad the plot is. It could've worked if it tried to be a Bleach rip-off, but it didn't even do that. It is badly written, illogical, and just plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot gets a 0/10 from me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI give zero fucks about pretty much all of them. The only characters I cared about either die or never show up again, if at all. Everyone else is either dumber than a bag of hammers, annoying as fuck, completely useless, or a mixture of all these things and more. If you want specifics...\\n\\n\r\nYuji Sakai is one of the blandest protagonists I have ever seen in anime. He's not only a dumb fuck who can't see how much a girl likes him even if she bit his face off, but he's also way too obviously a character you project yourself into. He has no real personality, he's way too average, and he has the most overpowered treasure in the entire show. It's called the Midnight Lost Child, and all it does is replenish his existence every time the clock strikes midnight. His 'dumb fuck' aspect comes in when he keeps thinking at the beginning, \"I'm going to disappear soon enough\", and he never questioned why he was still alive until an all-powerful bystander points it out to him. Said person told him this in episode 5. Shana explains how the treasure works in episode 7.\\n\\n\r\nShana is probably the biggest disappointment in terms of the show's characters. At first, she started off as this cold-hearted, apathetic Flame Haze - but after episode 3 (or 4), she turns into a stereotypical loli tsundere in literally less than two minutes into the scene where she was changing clothes - oh, and her catchphrase is \"Shut up, shut up, shut up!\". Yeah, that's totally cute...\\n\\n\r\nShana pisses me off because she is pathetically weak when it comes to combat. And she's been training for, what, a few decades? Isn't she an experienced Flame Haze? If so, why is she always relying on Yuji and Alastar to help her out? Why must she be so useless? I was hoping for a C.C.-like personality and character development, with swordsmanship that will make Erza smile. But no, she is a pathetic excuse of a character, and I fail to see why lolicons like her. ...Oh wait.\\n\\n\r\nKazumi Yoshida, the normal girl in Yuji's love triangle, is boring, stupid, and useless. And very, very pointless.\\n\\n\r\nMargridor (can't spell her name) had a moment where she could develop into a better character, but instead she stays exactly the same: a drunk whose ambition in life is never fulfilled in the first season's run.\\n\\n\r\nHer two teenage followers don't develop as characters at all.\\n\\n\r\nYuji's school friend pointlessly falls in love with Yoshida.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the villains are one of the major flaws in the whole anime. All of them, literally all of them, are about as threatening as a fly - and if a villain dares to be interesting, expect him to get worfed twice, by the same dude. If they do something that's supposed to be threatening, it fails to make you feel like it's threatening. All of them are one-dimensional, and none of their goals have any real point to them, other than to be 'For the Evulz'. There's a guy with a doll fetish, and he wants to make her human - but he fails to be an interesting villain, let alone a dangerous one.\\n\\n\r\nAnother 'noteworthy' villain includes an 8-year-old girl named Hekate. What is her goal? She wants to desire something, anything. So, when Yuji is kidnapped by the Balmask - the three main bad guys, and they mostly stand around and talk about fuck all - she decides she wants to literally become him, personality and everything. She does this by 'touching' him in his mind. Said 'touching' comes with being really, really close to his crotch with her own, and making orgasm sounds and blushing while they both glow blue.\\n\\n\r\n...Are they having sex? She's 8 years old! What is wrong with this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you think that's bad, introduce the Crimson Denizen twins that have several make-out sessions multiple times. These 'sessions' are actually quite detailed, with saliva and everything. Feeling sick yet? Here's the reason why they do it: The sister loves her brother. That's why. And judging by the brother's reaction when she's killed by Shana in the most hilariously bad fire tornado ever, he doesn't give two fucks about her at all. I'm not kidding! When she dies, he doesn't even look at her; he just keeps fighting. He doesn't even look like he actually heard her final words.\\n\\n\r\nNot that it matters in the end - the annoying shit dies as well. Good riddance.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even going to bother going through every single character. Why? Because they all suck. The anime might not be as bad if the characters were likeable, but I cannot find it within myself to give a shit about what they go through. I just can't.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters receive 0/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff did a really shitty job with the animation, especially during the fight scenes. They are cheap as all hell, uninteresting, and just . . . bleh... What's the point in even watching them? Fairy Tail's manga fights are better, and they're extremely short compared to other Shonen series like Bleach and Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the only part of the animation I thought was kinda cool was all in the second opening song. It would've been awesome if the fight that happened in the opening was the same standard of animation for the other fights, but Shana being Shana, that wasn't ever going to happen. So, what else is there to say? Nothing, really.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 0.5/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (voice acting, sound effects, music)\\n\\n\r\nI only watched Shakugan no Shana in English, and my thoughts on it are . . . less than praising. There were about three-to-four voices I thought were pretty good, and that's it. Everyone else was either 'meh', annoying, or boring and uninteresting. And to think, Shana is the same person who did Roberta (Black Lagoon) and Rarity (My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic).\\n\\n\r\n'Special' mention has to go to Yuji's mother, however. She is seriously the biggest weaboo voice actor I have ever seen. Instead of just saying Yuji and Shana, she says \"Yu-chan\" and \"Shana-chan\". No-one else in the entire dub says any honourific at all. And instead of Alastar, she says \"Alasutaru\"! She said a name the same way it's said in Japanese, in an English dub! \\n\\n\r\nSound effects are nothing noteworthy - pass.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the music should have been one of the redeeming parts about this show, but even that's been neglected. I honestly almost never notice the music - it's practically forgettable. However, I must admit that one song stands out: the second ending song is actually quite good.\\n\\n\r\nSound gets a 3/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict\\n\\n\r\nShakugan no Shana is quite honestly the worst anime I have ever seen, and will probably stay this way for the rest of my life (unless I finish Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan, but that's another story). The plot is so terrible that I nearly fell asleep on multiple occasions (and that is actually very hard to do with someone like me), the characters are pathetic, the animation is cheaper than a Vietnamese hooker in Las Vegas, and the sound only has one good, memorable song, while everything else is weak. Stay away from this anime; don't ever watch it, because it'll be a pointless waste of time and energy, and you won't get any satisfaction from watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI've never had this happen yet, but I bet there will be some Shana apologist out there that will say something like, \"Oh don't worry about the first season, because the second and third season are a lot better.\" To quote Yahtzee Croshaw: \"You know that's not a point in its favour, right?\" A better second season or third season is not going to make the first season any better.\\n\\n\r\nIf the first season fails to impress me, I am never going to watch the second or third season just to see if I might enjoy myself or not. What's the point in wasting more time on something that wasn't worth wasting time on in the first place? Because of this, I am never going to watch anything related to Shakugan no Shana ever again.\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict for Shakugan no Shana is...\\n\\n\r\nYou know what? This show isn't even worth a final verdict - there are so many things wrong with it that to give it even half a point would be to compliment it. I'm sorry, but taking the second ending out of the show would be the only thing I find satisfying about the entire experience. If it wasn't connected to the show at all, that'd be better. But it's there to stay, so there's no use bitching about it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought School Days was bad, then reconsider your opinion on that anime's ending - from the looks of it, it looks immensely satisfying. Gigguk thought so, and from my first impressions of the first episode, I think so too. If you think the worst anime you can think of is bad, I point you towards this anime, and will leave it at that. Unless it really is worse, but that remains to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I don't get about this anime is that people love the ever-living shit out of it. To which I say, why? What is so good about it? Name one thing apart from the music that is actually good about it, and do it in relation to the first season only. Can't do it? Of course you can't, because it's awful.\\n\\n\r\nI never do understand the way other people think sometimes... and I don't think I even want to.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's a decent series however there is a ton of emotional and time filler. First the good points however and then the filler issue.\r\nThe animation is really nice and the story is reasonably unique. The character design can be summed up as either really good or direly lacking depending on the character in question. The story doesn't move too slow, it's mainly a filler issue. The story has depth though it's not as structured as some others. There is no overwhelming sense of the ultimate structure of the fictional universe...it's more of a perspective of seeing the box from within the box then being ableto view the box from the outside perspective. It could have used more storyline relating to I suppose the \"higher-ups\" as it lacks a sense of origins for the main female protagonist. There are others who fill the role but it's feels like okay, got some good guys and some baddies...but no firm sense of ultimate agendas.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself skipping through episodes (4-20 second intervals) towards the end of the series as I was losing my patience waiting for something to actually happen. Watching scenery slowly scroll by and characters being lost in their emotions gets tiring when it's present in half of all the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is fair though if they removed the overly emotional content and the fillers like scrolling slowly past scenery it would have been significantly more enjoyable overall. If you've got the extra time and don't mind the filler you may enjoy the series more however.",

            "content": "Shakugan no Shana started out as a light novel series written by Takahashi Yashichiro. It's been very successful, inspiring a radio drama, manga, anime, video game, and a movie. The question then becomes whether it's worthy of the hype, fails to meet it or is just over-rated tripe. I don't have time to look at everything related to Shakugan no Shana, so I'm just going to watch the first of the TV anime.\r\nThe story involves a young man named Sakai Yuji who comes to a frightening discovery when time stops around him and monsters appear and begin consuming people. He's saved by a girl witha sword who goes through a long exposition dump revealing that there are monsters called Tomogara who consume existence and she's a guardian of some sort called a Flame Haze. She fights the Tomogara and creates torches to act as a sort of buffer to gradually drain the existence of those eaten by the Tomogara and then disappear and be forgotten. Yuji soon learns that he's immune to the time stopping effect because he's a special kind of torch with a treasure inside. The concept could be interesting, but the execution is horrendous. Everything moves ridiculously slowly. The anime could be ten episodes long, at most, and lose nothing but it's twenty four episodes. That's fourteen episodes of filler and pointless padding. It makes the whole anime really boring and tedious to watch. That isn't the only issue. The dialogue is stilted, there are multiple plot holes and the characters all have competence levels that change substantially based on the power of plot contrivance. The fight scenes aren't even good since there's just a lot of padded build up and then they end really quickly. I will grant that the ending suits the series well since it's also incredibly stupid.\\n\\n\r\nIf the filler and padding were used for character development it wouldn't be filler or padding. The characters are just annoying. They're all complete and utter one-dimensional twits. The only character who develops at all is Shana who keeps accumulating obnoxious traits. She starts out as a typical tsundere. Then she becomes a typical tsundere and creepily co-dependent. If Yuji had any sense he'd get a restraining order at that point, but since he's dumber than a brick that doesn't happen. Then she adds whiny to the list and officially becomes one of the most annoying, unsympathetic characters ever written. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is lazy. The backgrounds are very undetailed and the characters are very plain. Sometimes their lips don't even move while they're talking. If the art is good for anything it's that it's so dull it makes a good sleep aid.They throw in fan service with the main protagonist randomly, which is disturbing since she looks to be about twelve and you get unnecessary scenes of her in the bath.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is bad. Most of the voice actors are type cast and none of them seem to be putting any effort into their performances. Which is either really bad directing or actor apathy. The music is the best part of the anime and it's just stock and mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. The female characters rarely talk to each other except about guys. Seriously, this may be the only anime I've seen with a female protagonist and several female supporting characters that fails the Bechdel test in all but a couple episodes. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Shakugan no Shana is a 2/10. It's terrible. The characters are what really kill it. If they were better written it might just be a dreadfully dull anime, but they're so insipid and obnoxious that it becomes a real chore to watch. I can only recommend it to those people who are dreadfully dull or looking for a quick insomnia remedy.",

As the timegoes, torches disappear completly from the world and people&acute;s minds. But yuji is a special one, he has a treasure that allows him to stay fully recover the existence he lost at every midnight. At the same time he finds the truth about himself, he meets shana, a flame haze, who has the mission to keep the balance of the world. Then the start to stick together and fight against a lot of enemies.\\n\r\nMy opinion, is a well made story, i liked it and i give it a 9...\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (9.0) - Well, at start i didn&acute;t like the fact the characters looked way to childish, but i got used to it, and i ended up liking it..i think the design is good and the details in envyronment and that stuff are certanly in the group of the best i saw..about the effects and animation, well certainly is well devellopped and the producers worked a lot..its not perfect, but i&acute;ve seen much worse for sure..\\n\\n\r\nSound (7.2) - Nothing special indeed..its not something i can say i disliked it, but also i cant say i liked it...its just acceptable..\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacther (8.0) - Well, some charather i noticed no devellopment during the whole series..others like the main characters were well develloped and sometimes it sound like it was way too much..the story goes around yuji and shana, and sometimes it gives way to much attention to it..well, in overall i think its enough to say characters are good but with some flaws..(also, some of them are really anoying grrrr lol)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.3) -  A fine show with moments of action, suspense and mistery..however, there is also the oposite, in some moments i almost slept during some episodes, that if it was me i would just had cut those parts from the series..but in overall i got satisfied and i consider it a good anime to spend some time watching.\\n\\n\r\noverall (8.5)- In the limit between 8 and 9..i have a great doubt about this final rating, since in some way i really liked it, and in another way i dont think it was something special..but i decide to give credit to it and give a 9, plus a recommendation for all thos who like this kind of stuff with magic, abillities, suspense, fights..etc...\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: For the most part this story is pretty original but it does hold its \"Hey, this is ripping this off from *enter anime name here*. The romance, or the lacking of it, was HORRIBLE. The romance between the two characters was ridiculous. I'll more about it in the character section. Other than that the story keeps you interested with plot twists here and there but for the most part, well at least for me, you can't get around how annoying the romance is.\r\nArt: GREAT visuals in this anime. They really do a good job on how it looks other than one thing and thatsthe purple bear, seriously. They could've made it more vicious or something because in my opinion it kinda looked stupid when just standing there. That was really the only downside of this anime when coming to art. It was very easy on the eyes really.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Everything was good other than one thing. SHANA'S VOICE!!!! I remember just watching it thinking &quot;Someone please kill this girl off or at least change voice actors&quot;. Everything else was fine really but someone that is supposed to be legendary should sound a bit...well cooler. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I think they did really well here, everyone was in the anime was extremely enjoyable to watch. They all had their own personalities that developed as the anime went on which is very impressive because it didn't feel like the series was wasting time by introducing these characters. Shana was tooooooOOOOoOO annoying when in came to Yuji. Being stuck up and headstrong only goes so far. There are times where she is tolerable but enter Yuji's feelings into the equation and everything goes under when coming to Shana's character. Too me personally she is a quite annoying character that brought down the series. If she wasn't so powerful then she would be very replaceable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed everything not dealing with Shana/Yuji relationship. Those parts were just too annoying that it made me want to just stop the anime right there. The fights were good though. The supporting cast was awesome as well, saving this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Pretty good, just Shana's voice and Shana/Yuji relationship parts was so annoying that it makes you want to beat children and the elderly but other than that I would recommend it IF the person had already watch a whole bunch of other anime and just wanted something to burn time.",

            "content": "I saw a fire that ignited and blazed strong for an instant.  It grabbed my attention and had me going towards it.  The fire quickly died down however, weakened and became very dim.  I watch the flame, waiting for it to die, but for some reason it stays: weak and flickering.\r\nThis is essentially what I thought about this anime.  It starts off really strong in the first four episodes with really cool ideas and even some thought provoking themes that could potentially be explored.  I was really interested to see where it was all going to go... and it endedup being really disappointing.  But oddly, it was never really bad or terrible.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10 (below average)\\n\r\nIt starts off great, putting the main character Yuji in a shocking realization: he found out that he died a long time ago and has a limited amount of time before he is wiped out of existence.  I loved seeing his denial, I enjoyed seeing Shana initially looking upon Yuji as some object, but realizing through Yuji and his situation that not all people were selfish.  Unfortunately,  something very convenient ends up happening and from that point on, the story descends to mediocrity at best.  The story goes from being unique with cool ideas to incredibly cheesy: protagonist is clueless and is part of an annoying love triangle, girl with superpowers finds boy who holds the key for the bad guys great evil plan,  main villains want to obtain ultimate power.  It also really fails to balance comedy/slice of life with action/adventure, resulting in a really inconsistent experience.  Sometimes they spend way too much time on pointless swimming episodes we have seen a million times or pointless love triangle crap.  Other times when you have an interesting arc they don't explore it as much as I would like, and the arcs that are really boring feel like they go on forever!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10 (average) \\n\r\nShana's character is what kept the weak flame alive for me, even though she is your typical tsundere.  I think the reason I like her is because conceptually her character is very interesting and despite her cliche archetype is the only one that gets any meaningful character development.  Yuji's classmates aren't too bad either.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand...\\n\r\nYuji is a typical clueless, dense, dull protagonist\\n\r\nVillains are almost all one dimensional and are as dull as dishwater.\\n\r\nBig-Breasts-Blond booze drinker and talking book were both incredibly annoying, with just as painful sidekicks to boot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 (good)\\n\r\nIt does its job well.  I particularly like the flame haze look. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 (good)\\n\r\nThe ost is actually pretty good albeit repetitive.  Serieux was an ost I really liked in particular.  A really fitting track for a bad ass red haired chick kicking ass with a sword.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10 (meh)\\n\r\nThis is a very popular series and I am pretty sure a lot of people really like it.  I did see the potential and I do see some of the appeal for this show, but I just couldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.  \\n\\n\r\nHow much you can enjoy this, I think, depends on how much you can tolerate the high school melodrama, cliche shounen action stuff, and some cookie cutter character archetypes.  If you can get past all of this: it does have decent animation, good music, some interesting concepts, and some surprisingly charming moments with Shana.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 (average)\\n\\n\\n",

An anime that takes advantage of that makes a good, interesting show to watch.\r\nSadly, Shakugan no Shana is not one of those.\r\nStory: 6 / 10\r\nSo the setup of Shakugan no Shana was incredible. The ideas behind it were intriguing, and they're the things that made me want to watch it.\r\nHowever, after watching some more episodes, things just begin to drag.\r\nIntense fight scenes become boring snooze-fests. You can tell that the writer(s) had no idea whatto do with this setup, so they basically removed any bit of originality it had; that's quite a feat.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 / 10\\n\r\nMost of the artwork is quite good, albeit generic-looking, and the animators do a decent enough job, but ultimately they can't really salvage anything out of this. It looks pretty boring, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5 / 10\\n\r\nAside from the jingle that plays before and after the commercial breaks, I found nothing amazing in this soundtrack. The opening and ending songs are quite good though, and they fit the show very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3 / 10\\n\r\nOnly one of these characters was interesting. Just one.

They were interesting.\\n\r\nAfter the third or fourth episode though, it just becomes a slow, boring, generic anime with little to no redeeming qualities. I was begging for the 5th episode to end about 13 minutes in, I just couldn't stand how monotonous it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5 / 10\\n\r\nShakugan no Shana's painfully slow and dull execution severely damages its unique concept, which is a huge dissapointment.

            "content": "Story:\r\nHe had thought his normal days would last forever, until they were ended abruptly by an encounter with a girl with red hair and eyes. He named her Shana.\r\nNot long after he enters high school, Sakai Yuji\u2019s normal days come to an end. He sees something bizarre on his way home: people are frozen in a strange fire, and a monster that looks like a large doll is attacking them. Just when he's about to be killed, a girl in a dark cloak wielding a large sword appears, and slices the monster in half. Although Yuji survives the strange encounter, the girl informs him ofa desolate truth: \" 'You' don't exist anymore.\"\\n\\n\r\nShe calls herself a Flame Haze who hunts \"Guze no Tomogara\"; intruders from another world. She explains to him that he is a \"Torch\", a substitute of Yuji whose \u201cexistence\u201d has already been devoured. She also told him that he is a special Torch, \"Mystes\", which contains a precious item in it. When he looks at his chest, he sees within himself a faint flame, just as she said.\\n\\n\r\nIt is in this way that his eternal struggle alongside the girl begins.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art work was enjoyable to watch because the way the character had good details and how you can actually see the real quality of it made it great. The quality is enjoyable but is not the same quality as Clannad or Fate Zero. The art work could of been improve more on the world and the way the fighting animation were. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great, I loved the first and last season intro and outro. The sound was played at the right time and just made me want to watch the anime again and listen to the song over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nSome people can say Shana was suborn because she didn't like to be around Yuji because she felt weird around him. Yuji was the main character who was dragged into the world Shana secretly lives in.\\n\r\nThen you have your supporting characters such as:\\n\r\nAlastor\\n\r\nKazumi\\n\r\nKeisaku\\n\r\nEita\\n\\n\r\nI found Alastor to be like a faster to Shana because he would always be by her side and will always comfort her and try to make her happy and focus.\\n\r\nI find Kazumi brave that she always trying to help even though she can't because humans can not do anything the the Crimson Denizens.\\n\r\nI found Keisaku brave and a person that only care about the present time because he would do everything he can to be a help of Margery.\\n\r\nI found Eita brave and shocked because he would try to be a help of Margery but when the incident happened he stopped talking to Margery since he was in a state of shock.\\n\\n\r\nEnding:\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was not as I expected. Why? Because it was left as a cliffhanger and the audience will not know how it truly ends. But nonetheless it was a great ending with a cliffhanger. \\n\\n\r\nMy rating here:\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a 9 because of how the third season was. The third season took a while to get used to and it didn't explain how it happened until the ending of the anime. I also hate how the ending was because they left it as a cliffhanger that will rise a lot of unanswered questions.\\n",

The art work and character designs are spectacular, and the acting in the show (especially the female roles) are done fantastically. The story moves at a good pace and doesn't leave any holes, as far as i could tell, everything was answered by the end.  \r\nThe only down side is some of the secondary characters can get dumb or annoying and at times i thought they were completely useless to the show but its not so badthat it drags the rest of the anime down.  The battle scenes are done quite well with lots of flashy magic effects and lighting contrasts that intensify the battles.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall excellent and the story does continue in season two so be sure to watch that, and so you know, the &quot;movie&quot; is just a retelling of the first few episodes with some added scenes and a new ending.",

They make this theme work quite well, making it unbelieveable, and yet plausible.\r\nI truly enjoyed this anime, even though it isn't at all original. The story simply takes alot of the already well known \"base\" characters, and stuffs them together in a slightly altered present world. Therefore, nothing new character-wise. The way they \"humanize\" these \"higher beings\" is quite nice though. Merging the two worlds, yet still keeping them apart.\r\nThe art is smooth and \"bended\". Again,not at all original, but just the way I like it anyway.\\n\r\nThe sound fits in, but nothing extraordinary there.\\n\\n\r\nI'll say it again; I really liked this anime. It has all the things I like. Seriousness and drama with a speck of comedy. Also a plausible fantasy-universe, with magic and medieval fighting.\\n\r\nThe only thing that kept it from hitting the top for me, is its simple lack of having something new.",

To be honest the only reason I was able to finish this anime was because I have nothing else to watch and I had to keep skipping those boring images in order to get to the next scene.\\n\\n\r\nRight now I not even sure if I'll go for the 2nd season because the 1st one for sure didn't make me happy at all but hey who knows, tastes are tastes maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did but don't start watching this anime if you are looking for romantic scenes between the main characters because you just won't get any, at least in this 1st season.",

            "content": "Art (7/10) - (8/10 if disregarding quality of video in 2005/2006)\r\nConsidering the fact that I'm watching this almost six years after it originally aired, I don't think it's a surprise when I say the video quality was terrible. On top of that, the quality of scenery was extremely poor, with water and trees looking fake. However, the redeeming quality in the art was the animation quality of the fights. What stood out the most to me was the Nietono no Shana and Shana's blazing hair, both of which exceeded my expectations for a six-year-old anime. Overall, it was watchable; certainly not up to par withtoday's 720p standards. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\r\nAfter 24 episodes, it was evident that both Sakai Yuuji and Shana underwent massive changes in character. First off, the weak Mistes, Yuuji, became much stronger with the help of Shana; although his stupidity never ceases to amaze me. And for Shana, the new feeling of love gave her a newfound happiness, something that she did not have before due to her duties as a Flame Haze. The interactions our two main protagonists make with their peers and acquaintances, specifically Yoshida Kazumi, also help to shape them into who they are. In a more general view, Yuuji and Shana essentially changed each other as they have exchanged a piece of their world with the other - Shana learning about love in humans and Yuuji adapting to the reality of the world. Through their journey, it is evident that the bond these two is unbreakable, no matter how bad the situation may seem. It was also nice to see many of the supporting characters getting developed, even if only slightly, throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nFirst off, I really liked both OPs because they were upbeat, catchy and had great vocals. The two EDs were also decent, but definitely not one of the better ones I've heard. As for the BGM, the only memorable one for me was the piano arrangement of the first OP. While not really significant, I guess the BGM did help enhance my enjoyment slightly. The only two VAs I was able to recognize with ease were Rie Kugimiya for Shana and Mamiko Noto for Hecate. It's nice to see that the voices of these veteran VAs haven't really changed, even after six years. Unlike visuals, sound is more or less able to withstand the test of time so I give this category an 8. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nHaving someone telling you that \"You are no longer human. You are an object.\" is undoubtedly scary. But that is where the whole story for Shakugan no Shana begins. It is an interesting concept that takes skill to masterfully convey. Luckily, the staff was able to pull this off, though there were obviously some flaws. The story itself had great variety of drama/suspense and comedy/laughs while moving forward at a decent pace. Though sometimes too predictable, there were also some twists along the way, which I enjoyed. I think the presence of both romance and action was the selling point of the show, drawing viewers from both those genres. The good balance of these two genres kept things interesting and entertaining. In a more broad sense, I felt that this was a good start to the story, allowing season two, and maybe three, to continue building off of the solid foundation created by season one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nI have to admit it, Shakugan no Shana is a good series. I was quite skeptical at first, even with the countless amount of praise given to it. The conclusion of season one made is making me crave for season two. I have to give the staff working on this project credit for being able to entertain viewers for this many episodes (I'm assuming season two and three will be successful as well). Anime lovers out there, Shakugan no Shana is a must-try if you enjoy romance, action or both. I, for one, wasn't disappointed with what this series had to offer. Now onto season two!",

            "content": "Ok, so lets start with the story,\r\nThe story was a pretty good concept and had so pretty good traits. First it has some action and conflict pretty much right when you start watching, creating an attention grabbing opening. It was pretty slow paced, but at some points in the plot the story progressed a little fast, and could have slowed down a bit and explained what was happening. Another Pro to this anime is that there are very little filler episodes. The story had its simple and complex parts but mainly it was pretty simple to understand and to follow along. The suspense build upat some parts was pretty lacking but still created the feeling of SUSPENSE! The comedy parts of the anime were okay but weren't \"rolling on the floor laughing\" kinda moments. Overall the story was pretty good and the episode fit pretty much perfectly together.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSo, now for the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in this anime was really eye-catching, but that could possibly be because I personally like this kind of art. I've seen the art before so it wasn't anything new which has it's cons but also it something that I know and love. The action scenes were done quite nicely and flowed quite well.  The backgrounds were okay but the weren't anything to remember. So overall the art was pretty good. \\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nAs, for the sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, to me was absolutely amazing. The openings, the endings, were just amazingly done. They stuck in my head for quite awhile after listening to them, but then again the split the ED's and OP's between 2 terrific artists, KOTOKO and Mami Kawada. The background music during the anime weren't anything memorable as for the backgrounds with the art. Overall it was pretty good. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters,\\n\\n\r\nThe characters became well developed by the first episode and the last but Shana the main character was just too strong. Her battles were quite predictable. As for Yuji Sakai another main character he just seemed too weak. I defiantly think that the characters were very well done and are pretty memorable as well. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor my enjoyment, \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed a lot. I absolutely love this genre of anime and hope to see it come for a long time! I think this is a good anime for beginners because the story isn't to complex, the art is too crazy and it is overall just a good anime to watch.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 7/10",

            "content": "Venturing farther into the infinite world of anime, I happened to come across yet another amazing series in my travels.  This one was relatively straightfoward compared to other animes, but it was also captivating, enthralling, enjoyable and certainly unique.  This anime was Shakugan No Shana.\r\nStory: While not the strongest point of this series, I will say that this anime's story certainly shines bright.  It's a little confusing at the most, but I assume that's probably because of how much they could fit in one season.  The actual story content was enjoyable, despite the fact that it's slightly predictable as it involvesthe Flame Haze Shana keeping the world balanced\\n\r\n(with her sword) alongside a newly-made Torch(replacement for a human being), Yuji Sakai.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art of this anime was simply compelling and eye-catching, and the light effects and various energy explosions were phenomenal.  I can totally see the lolita appeal that Shana has.  For one thing, I particually liked the scenes were Shana fires up into her Burning form.  They were particularly well-done, and it's safe to say that the many sword-fights in this anime were both epic and amazingly executed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This anime definitely had awesome music.  All the songs were catchy, and they fit well with the mood of the anime as well.  I personally enjoyed the first opening theme and the first ending theme, but the other two themes were equally as good.  All the songs are iPod worthy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I have to say that this anime has outstanding character development.  From the supposed Torch Yuji becoming \"himself\" again, to Shana turning from a introverted Flame Haze to a much nicer person, this anime certainly delivers in respects to character development.  On a side note, I'd like to say that I really disliked Yoshida-san, but that's probably because she gets in the way of Shana and Yuji, who seem like they're just fated for one another.  Other than that, the rest of the characters were likeable and definitely not in the norm of what you might usually expect.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  While I'll admit that a few episodes are a bit dull, this series will keep you glued to your computer screen and have you asking what happen's next.  I'm not going to ruin the ending, but luckily it's one that does not dissapoint at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: All in all, Shakugan No Shana is a fantastically executed anime, that, despite it's  slight shortcomings in the story, can certainly take a 10/10 for awesome music, character development, art and enjoyment value, not to mention a simply stellar ending.  It takes a place among my favirotes, as #3, and I'm anxious to watch the second season.  Truly, this is anime that I think deserves a spot among some of the best and finest.\\n\\n",

            "content": "You can make the argument that action anime are the guilty pleasures of the medium, as they don\u2019t often have the complexity and depth of the other genres, they are usually faster paced and quite enjoyable.  Shakugan no Shana is a perfect example of this, and I tend to liken it to an incredible chocolate sundae: It may not have a lot of nutritional value, but it\u2019s delicious and you eagerly devour every bite, and find yourself wanting more once it\u2019s all said and done.\r\nStory: Shakugan no Shana revolves around the story of two characters and their fight against evil.  Shana is aFlame Haze, a warrior empowered with supernatural abilities to fight beings from an alternate dimension that feed upon humans called the Crimson Denizens.   Yuji Sakai is dead, how he got that way is less important than the fact that he\u2019s a Torch, or a being of limited existence that slowly fades away so that the rest of the world isn\u2019t shocked when the Crimson Denizens eat people.  Needless to say, you won\u2019t be surprised when Yuji turns out to be special, and thus doesn\u2019t disappear early into the show.  To be honest, you probably won\u2019t be surprised by much in Shakugan no Shana, as the story is fairly typical for a Shonen action series.  Monsters show up for a handful of episodes, and Yuji and Shana fight them off.  Between the fights, we get a bit of the calmer and normal \u201cslice of life\u201d type of setting.  Where I think Shakugan no Shana really succeeds is the fact that they largely don\u2019t fall back on it being a slapstick comedy or fan-service show in these \u201cdown time\u201d episodes.  Instead, they use the time not fighting to further develop the characters, and they do so with exceptional skill.  For being a largely Shonen show, you\u2019d think that the times not spent fighting would be rather boring, but in fact, these portions of the show are as enjoyable as the fighting, or in some cases, are even more enjoyable.  Some of the ideas presented here are quite inventive, with the torches\u2019 and Flame Haze\u2019s, but overall it\u2019s nothing that\u2019s breaking the mold.  The story is adequate in its own right, but it wouldn\u2019t be exceptional without the characters that tend to carry it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The heart and soul of Shakugan no Shana are the characters and how they learn to interact with each other.  Normally, I\u2019d be annoyed with this kind of show, as most of the characters are younger, and thus fumble about almost the entire show as they try to understand and deal with their growing feelings for one another.  However, what would normally be infuriating with any other show comes across as charming and enjoyable with this cast, so it\u2019s a testament to the show and the cast of the show that these characters have such life.  Shana and Yuji are the cornerstones of the entire show, and their relationship is ultimately the most important one that there is.  Shana is your typical super badass chick who\u2019s had no real human contact, and thus has no understanding of her feelings.  Over the course of the show, she has to confront them, and slowly grows and matures in a fairly normal way, one that is refreshing in this genre.  Yuji isn\u2019t too far different, and he has his own strength that makes him a particularly enjoyable protagonist.  He learns early that he\u2019s dead, so the rest of the show is him dealing with that, his desire to still help others and be remembered, and his own changing feelings for Shana and others.  I applaud the fact that Yuji isn\u2019t made into some headstrong nutcase that runs off half-cocked into every fight and causes trouble.  Instead, he\u2019s calm and level headed, and makes for a character you can root for.  Added to these two are the number of side characters that flesh out the whole cast.  You have your standard school-mates, including best friends, rival love interests, and general lackies.  There are also other Flame Haze\u2019s that are introduced throughout the first season, although none really play as big a role as Margery Daw, the \u201cChanter of Elegies\u201d.  I should hate this character, as she\u2019s a personification of clich\u00e9 anime idea\u2019s, being the tall, overly busty blonde with a drinking problem.  Despite being clich\u00e9, I don\u2019t hate the character, I found her to be an enjoyable and light hearted portion to a show that normally takes itself pretty seriously.  There are also the Crimson Denizens, who range from the fairly normal, to the borderline perverse.  If there are characters that tend to break from tradition at least some in this show, it\u2019s them, and they make for genuinely interesting antagonists.  Overall, the characters are the best parts of this show, and that makes it even more rewarding when you get to see them fight.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation: This is a gorgeous show.  It didn\u2019t dawn on me until after I had finished watching it how pretty it really is.  The scenery and more serene portions are well done, and the characters for the most part of drawn with care that brings them to life.  Most of the characters are relatively realistic looking, in anime terms, so the humans tend to look human, and the Denizens tend to look a little more out there.  If I had a complaint, it\u2019s the cowlicks; I don\u2019t understand why so many characters here have them.  Also, I\u2019m sure some people will complain about the \u201cLoli\u201d aspects of Shana, as she looks to be about 10 years old in the show, but that\u2019s a minor concern.  There are area\u2019s the show really excels, such as Shana\u2019s transformation into the Blazing Eyes.  Small touches like the constant flickers of fire that flow from her hair, or the brilliance of her eyes make for a strong impact, and you have to appreciate the intent of such art.  The action sequences are well animated, with a lot of use of fire animation that works well.  It\u2019s not the most fluid show when it comes to the fight scenes, and it doesn\u2019t live up to some of the better fighting shows out there, but the art carries its weight here and doesn\u2019t really disappoint.  The music is also incredibly well done; as I found the opening particularly catchy, and found myself not skipping the intro a few times, which puts it above most anime out there, as I rarely watch an intro more than once.  The ending songs weren\u2019t as good, but they aren\u2019t bad either.  The music used throughout the show is beautiful and well used, adding a lot of impact when it\u2019s needed.  I can actually see this being a CD someone would enjoy having, as the overall soundtrack is pretty damn good.  The artwork might not be the best ever, but it\u2019s damn sharp and it\u2019s got it\u2019s truly gorgeous moments, and the music while not making my ITunes list any time soon, stands heads above the majority of music that I\u2019ve heard in anime recently.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Of all the things I have to weigh when I give a show a rating, my enjoyment at watching the show tends to weigh the heaviest with me.  Shows can be technically flawed, but if you love watching them, they should get a higher rating.  This is the reason I ultimately came down with a 9 for Shana, as I was wavering between that and an 8.  I think the creators managed to strike the perfect balance here between the fights and the character development.  Even when they aren\u2019t in the midst of a critical, life or death battle, you\u2019re still interested in seeing what\u2019s going on with these characters.  I go back to my chocolate sundae analogy.  This show is delicious!  I found myself truly enjoying every second of it, and I look forward to seeing the later seasons.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I truly have to recommend Shakugan no Shana to anyone who\u2019s a fan of anime.  I\u2019m sure that some people may be able to find some things to dislike about it, but that\u2019s the case for almost anything.  In the end, the minor complaints have a bit of merit, and thus why I give his a 9 and not a 10, but it\u2019s still incredibly enjoyable, and if you\u2019re willing to kick back and watch a fun show that\u2019s not overly deep but still deeply enjoyable, then you\u2019ll probably love Shakugan no Shana.",

The artists themselves are all deserving to be included in the OST.\r\nUncanny and hilarious situations are also delved into the storyline which makes it even more enjoyable to watch.\r\nOverall, this is not your regular girls-with-swords-bash-monsters anime series.

            "content": "Shakugan no shana had a lot of potential, but I found it didn't live up to it. It was entertaining, there were some good battle scenes and some interesting characters, but also too much predictable drama. Outside of the predictable romance drama, and the powerful girl teams with a guy that has some sort of special feature theme, it was fairly original. It starts off well, enough to hook me, but then I found that I ended up disappointed with some of the background. \r\nCharacters:\r\nThe characters were ok, but as with similar series (powerful girl, guy who teams up with her), Yuji, the male protagonistwasn't anything special. Shana was by far the best part of the series, watching her adapt to her own emotions and surroundings. And gaining more power as a flame haze. \\n\r\nKazumi is a character I hated-- she's nothing special and pretty much useless, basically she's there to interfere with the main romance between Yuji and Shana. She's annoying, and overall the worst part of the series for me. Especially since Shana has enough to adapt to and overcome on her own that extra interference is not necessary. \\n\r\nMargery was sometimes comic relief, but overall was an interesting character. She too changes throughout the series, gaining some compassion. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is good, like I said before, it had far more potential than it used. It's somewhat inconsistent as well, for example Shana at first had no name, and said that flame haze didn't need names. Yet every other flame haze we meet has a name.\\n\r\nI also found that the story focused too much on the romance drama, when it could have gone more deeply into the background of some of the characters, for example Alastor, the Guze, and so on. I was expecting something more for Shana's backstory, and there are a few things that are never really made clear.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall the series was entertaining, enough that I watched the second season, but not so much as to rewatch it. I tried to, but the whole drama part of it made me stop. It's not done well, and ends up quite predictable.  \\n\r\nIt's a good series for any fantasy fan, as long as you're not expecting something grand and mind-blowing.",

In this anime, the world's balance is guarded by extremely powerful guardians who go by the name of Flame Hazes and as the name suggests they use fire in order to burn away the Crimson Denizens, beings who try to consume the existence of human beings.In order to become powerful, Flame Hazes make contracts with Crimson Lords who wish to maintain the balance. Yuji Sakai is drawn into the war against the Flame Hazesand the Crimson Denizens, forever changing his life. This show has everything, from love triangles to the wise cracking Marchosias, a contracted Denizen Lord in the form of a spell book. The sound tracks of this series is amazing as we have the talented Kotoko, Altima and Mami Kawada lending their awesome songs such as Light My Fire, Ill Believe and Joint. A must watch for anyone and everyone.",

            "content": "This anime gives me strange feeling. I can't say I I really enjoy the show. If there is one thing I have really enjoyed the most, it's Shana's voice actress. She sounds so cute and lovely that it was the only reason why it kept me watching the show. But story itself just lacked the kind of development and flow that makes one keep watching. \r\nIn fact, the story is rather dull. While I understand how it may be interesting to some, the fact that the story is based on one man's value due to what he holds inside just doesn't make it all thatinteresting. They've done their best to protect the man because he is extremely useful. But that's about it. Usefulness, whether in wit or analytic skills, the flow of the story is at times vacuous, filled with half fillers and slice of life, while other filled with actual story line. One of the review wrote they found it boring; I found the same way after watching few beginning episodes. I skipped the boring part with past history and stories that made no sense, and went to the actual meat of the story. And yet, the meat just did not have that feeling of climatic feeling of despair and helplessness as they have made it out to be. And yet, not to mention that such climatic ending is only in the last episode. The rest is filler and building up to that ending. I just do not feel the reward after watching the show. Even the second season was disappointment, to say the least. \\n\r\nThe artwork and sound is quite nice. I would definitely rate it as high as possible if I could as any modern anime nowadays. I certainly have no problem with artwork nor sound. Character requires a bit of work. Perhaps using Osaka person in the show would have made it even more enjoyable. Music is no doubt a great hit in my heart especially in using piano as one of the main instrument. But as stated above, my enjoyment is mediocre; albeit, fair at best.",

            "content": "First review and I usually don't care to post reviews but I just had to for this one.  I watched the Dub of this, and that is the only reason i actually finished this series.\r\nStory:  There was a decent story to this, nothing very original.  It was interesting though.  The pace in the anime was so slow that you really didn't care much though.  It is slow, incredibly slow.  Give it one point up for being dubbed there, you could get up and make a meal or go to the bathroom and still hear the plot.  I skippedthrough half of this and enjoyed it much more than I did watching every minute.  Would have been much more enjoyable if it would have been 12 episodes and they put more effort into the art.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  This was the biggest disappointment in the whole series.  One of the worst animation I have seen, especially for it's time.  If you really pay attention you can really see how lazy they were.  All the effort seemed to be put into making this 24 episodes.  A lot of filler and still scenes.  I enjoyed many 1980 and 1990 anime WAY more than this on the artistic level.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The OP and ending were pretty good.  What really Made this a decent one for sound were the Dubbed VAs.  One of the only reasons I kept one with this series.  They did a great job on such a slow paced plot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Can't say I really cared much.  The pace was so slow that I was blase about every character in the series.  Episodes 14-17 were pointless, just a flashback that didn't make any difference how I felt about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all This would have been a much better series if it would have been condensed to 12 episodes and more effort put into the art, and making the action scenes more exciting.  Yes, even the action scenes were slow.  I didn't get a feel for any of the characters or feel much emotion during the whole series.  There are many anime that I get emotional about, whether excited, angry, or tear-jerker.  This isn't any of those.",

            "content": "Another magnificent anime. The story was addicting. The creators made the episodes that the ending wasn't quite a cliff hanger, but a place that you could leave for a day, and not have to be too worried about what will happen next. The art was great. There were a few awkward looking things here and there, but all togeather, the art was great. Personally, I loved the theme songs and some of the background music. The only thing that bugged me with the sound was the little 'tense' music that plays before and after the commercials. The characters had their own personalities, but some lookeda bit like another. It was fine when it was just Shana, Yuji, and Ike. They all looked different from each other, but as other characters joined the plot line, they started to look a bit more like another. I enjoyed this series a lot. It was a great show, and had a great ending. I loved how the show wasn't just action and fighting. There were a few breaks where the characters calmed down, and there wasn't as much pressure as there is in other shows that just have fight scenes with no breaks. Overall, this series gets a nine out of 10. I loved it enough that I can re-watch it, but not as hooked as some people might get.",

I found this anime had great potential but by midway through i realised that no matter how kickass the main heroine is, it wont take away how frustratingly simple and annoying the male MC is.\r\nThis is what made me rate this so low. i coudnt stand how much potential this show had at the beginning to how much it lacked towards the end.\r\nShana the main MC is amazing. her character development was well thought out and all her surrounding characters really complimented her. I especially liked her guardian Flame of Heaven and the other Flame blaze. they are bothso knowledgeable yet so out of touch with a teenage girls feelings. It was really that element of sweetness that carried the show through for me.\\n\\n\r\nIts the approach to the 'romance' in this show that really disappointed me. typical romantic triangle forms where both girls; who are great in their own way, confess or obviously show their affections to the clueless male MC who does nothing but run around in all his oblivious glory and does nothing to really deserve their unwavering feelings.\\n\\n\r\nI think thats what really bothered me. Yugi didnt deserve their feelings. he was unfortunately a weak male MC. he had moments where he was brightly but overall he was just so bland that i couldnt stand how Shana was falling for him. Although i did appreciate what he stood for as a supporting character. He allowed for Shana to explore her feelings that was unknown to her until she met Yugi. \\n\\n\r\nbut overall i truly enjoyed watching Shana become her own person. ill give the next season a shot.",

It doesn't matter if the art and music is great if you can't follow the plot. The initial setup is interesting, but the rest is just plain incomprehensible. I kept watching this until a little into the second season, thinking it might somehow start making sense, but alas, my hopes were in vain. In fact, I experienced some plot\"whiplash\", as it were. The first season was a somewhat action-oriented plot. The first several episodes of the second season were almost completely slice-of-life. It was so boring I played solitaire while watching it.... SOLITAIRE. Then, when the action picked up, I couldn't follow it at all. One of the side characters even comments at this point that nothing makes sense. Suffice to say, I stopped watching soon after this. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the best thing this anime is for is background noise while you are doing something else.

You might like or hate the anime, it really depends on your personality TBH.\r\nThis is my first review on this page so go easy on me pls ;-;\r\nOkay, so let's start:\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nNothing special, nothing new. Has a few filler episodes. Boring at times.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe art is amazing for a 2005/2006 anime. The anime also had a pretty good budget.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nAgain, nothing special, but I really liked it. Just my opinion.\r\nCharacters: 6/10\r\nNow, this is what really ruined the anime for me. First of all, Yoshida Kazumi. Probably the most hated character by everyone. She just decides tobutt in the relationship of the male and female MC and try to take Yuji (male main character) for herself. It gets really annoying and to be honest, without Kazumi the anime would probably be finished in 12-24 episodes, not FREAKING 72! Second of all, dense male MC (Do I really need to explain?) Third of all, a tsundere. If you're into that sort of stuff, this anime is for you. Don't prefer S3 if you're here only for the romance though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nEven though it had it's boring parts, the anime is really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThe only things keeping this anime from being a 10/10 for me were the filler characters and filler episodes. The plot is also somewhat boring.",

There is a recurring theme of being more than just an object, and a parallel world theme, which is pretty great but again, gets predictable.  \r\nIf it had higher production values and explored more themes, I would have given thisa higher rating.  If it had no themes, I wouldn't have sat through it.  I'm probably not going to pick up season 2 unless someone tells reads this and tells me the production value is higher or has a damned, damned good storyline.\\n\\n\r\nEverything seems so B-list 90's anime about this, even though it's a 00's anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7- as stated above\\n\r\nArt 5- it's HD but fight scenes are really janky and enemies aren't very well designed.

If you're coming into Shakugan no Shana from Zero no Tsukaima because they seem very similar, they are. But SnS is still very different from ZnT in many ways. The character roles are similar, but where ZnT is for the fantasy people, SnS is more supernatural. Also, if you didn't like ZnT just because of the randomly ecchiness, SnS doesn't emphasize as much on ecchi, which I found much more comfortable. SnS also has a lot more character development, while not forfeiting the well thought out plots and events that SnS brings.Shakugan no Shana proudly wheres my 9.5/10.",

            "content": "Shana and Shana II are both popular and have been around long enough that I don't really imagine I will garner a new audience for it through a review. However I myself want to write this, because Shakugan No Shana is, dare I say it, my personal favorite anime. Now, it is not the most stunning, awe inspiring series I have ever seen, however I think it is far from a stretch to say that Shana is the anime I have most enjoyed of all the series I have seen. It is the only series besides Air I can say I have watched three ormore times, and still love. In fact, I think I like Shana more every time I see it.\\n\\n\r\nStory; 9. If it were an original script, this would be a ten; however, it does not take the brightest of bulbs to unravel the generic plot devices that make up Shakugan No Shana. It's a generic fantasy romance spanning the usual length, however the script was well written enough to keep you interested, and this was made better by the incredible cast of characters, whom I will detail later on. However, all said and done, Shana had a story that brought nothing new to the table, yet presented it's tried and true plot elements in a way that makes the show a good, fun lighthearted watch. \\n\\n\r\nArt; 9. Surprisingly rare, Shana is one of few series where I cannot tell which characters will be killed at some point in the shows running. Surely some of you know what I mean, when side characters are introduced so quickly drawn, so generic and so boring, that they simply MUST be killed at some point. However, from main cast to side cast and even then a little further, all character designs, costumes and personalities were handled with care, and each character is ACTUALLY developed. Great art.\\n\\n\r\nSound; 9. Shana's sound is actually befitting, a number of themes are catchy enough to get stuck in the head yet not annoy. The OP and ED are generic, but not too poppy or annoying. Admissable, with a few surprises here and there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; 9. Dare I say, Shana has the most properly developed cast of any anime out there. Remember the model detail I mentioned earlier? They carried this into the personalities, and the whole cast up and down feels like they could at any time fill a main role in the story if it chose to swing that way. They are all likeable in their own way, and I think this makes the whole show together a great experience. Nicely developed and modeled characters are one of Shana's biggest draws.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment;Overall; 9. Shakugan No Shana, Shana II, and the soon coming Shana III are all the same generic plotline rehashed for us over and over again. I wish I could explain why I love Shana so much, why Alastor is such a bad, sweet dude, or why I keep coming back to something admittedly cheesy and overdone. But, I can't. At best I can say Shana is cheesy in all the good ways, spectacularly nice to look at, and most of all, fun. It's fun, so much fun that in fact I could probably see Shana 100 more times and still have that great chemistry with it I did the first time. Truly a wonderful show.",

It kept me hooked enough to make me wonder what would happen next but the only two things that kept me going was \"Who does Yuji end up with?\" and \"Does Yuji ever become stronger?\" There are tons of episodes where the characters just chill and get to know each other rather than fight. They do not balance the action with the romance too well in the anime due to facts that they interact atschool and daily life more. But if you keep a watch at the plot, There will be spikes where the plot is secluded to School Life and Daily Life of the characters or the Battles and Sacrifice the characters take place in.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10):\\n\r\nThe art is how I like it. they don't have frizzy hair... They have cute faces and they are the same age as me. Oh yeah... Same age... Can't keep my excitement...\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\r\nI don't really see the difference in sounds too much in different animes. So I would not know how to rate this. But I do think that they should add music during ALL battles rather than the EPIC battles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nWhy are all the characters so stupid. \"I'll tell Yuji I love him today. I swear.\" When was today exactly? Yuji is also so oblivious to all of the feelings of the other characters especially Shana and Yoshida. He always act on trivial stuff. Don't worry Shana he didn't mean to hurt you. You hurt yourself for picking someone stupid. If you did pick him...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nI enjoyed it thoroughly. Finished it in three days. Damn my eye doctor is not going to be happy when I come for my check up. MOMMY!",

            "content": "Shakugan no Shana I: \r\nWhere do I begin? The story seems like a good place. Yuji Sekki goes from being your average high schooler to end being like a Torch. Residue Humans, who lose their power of existence and fades out to life being as though they never exist. Yuji, despite being told this, continues to act in a way that puzzles the Flame Haze: Blazing Hair Blazing Eyes with Alastor. They eventually learns that Yuji has a special thing inside him called the \"Midnight Lost Child.\" Every Midnight, his existence refills. This means Yuji won't fade away. (But you could guess that as Yuji'sthe main character.)\\n\\n\r\nThe Pacing? It seemed a little slow. Maybe I'm just used to anime with plots that are sleeker like Soul Eater, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and Code Geass. But this predates all of them by 2-5 years. It's not always a bad thing though as it allows characters to fully interact and develop slowly. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: Yuji, Shana, and all the Flame Hazes and the human supporting characters are interesting enough to watch, and written consistently. The villains though are one dimensional. You never get a sense of their modus operandi, and they seem to have many varying ones, and the lone exception, the Professor, has the usual \"FOR SCIENCE!\"\\n\\n\r\nI found my enjoyment to be tempered on and off again, some days I would watch three or four consecutive episodes. Other days, I didn't even want to turn it on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'll give it an 8 which is slightly higher than some ratings, but it seems to warrant that.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking to acquire this series, the dubbed (Geneon) version is available on iTunes. All the seasons are very pricey, but on the plus side, you can buy via episode, reduce the price, and you can either download it or watch it on any Apple device with a good enough wifi connection. (Without ads interrupting the episode)\\n\\n\r\n($44.99 for the whole thing plus tax for HD Season 1) \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend buying without watching the first arc though. And unlike other animes like Unbreakable Machine Doll and The Devil is a Part-Timer, this isn't an instant buy.",

            "content": "Ever had a sense of deja vu? where you think you watch or listen to something that is very similar ? Welcome to my first honest review! Today i am reviewing the 2006 anime known as Shakugan no Shana (Shana of the Burning Eyes)\r\nStory:\r\nShakugan No Shana universe revolves around the conflict between the good and bad creatures of the Crimson Realm known as Crimson Denizens. Denizens that have strayed  away from the right path feast on human souls to maintain their own existence. Denizens that are on the right path of justice form \"contracts\" with humans as a result a creation known a \"FlameHaze\" is created.\\n\r\n( Basically a human that is ageless and has supernatural abilities)\\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of a Flame Haze is to protect the balance of the human world and the Crimson Realm also to destroy anything that would disturbed it such as evil denizens.(Similar to Shinigamis and Hollows from Bleach)\\n\r\nOne fateful day the main male lead Yuji Sakai gets attack by a denizen, and is ultimately saved by a red eyed flaming haired flame haze later to be known as Shana. Yuji and Shana end up forming a friendly relationship with one and another also they become partners. Yuji ends up fighting along side Shana but, there is more that meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 6/10\\n\\n\r\nTo  be honest the story is rather generic, It feels like it is something that you have watched or listened 1000 times. Despite not being as originally as other animes the executions was above average compared to other animes\\n\r\n\"cough cough Sword Art Online cough cough\"  \\n\r\nWith that being said  the story gets a 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nPS THE ENDING THAT YOU MOST LIKELY WANT WILL BE IN THE MANGA!.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nShakugan No Shana Animation was done by a studio known as J.C Staff.\\n\r\nThe animation of the show was average, the only thing that caught my eye was Shana''s flaming hair which was really beautiful, Besides that there was nothing that really made me say \"damn that some good animation. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters but, I am going to review the 3 main ones that the story revolves around.\\n\\n\r\nShana - Flame Haze- Melon Bread Addict \\n\r\n(The only reason why most of us actually continue to watch the next 2 seasons.)\\n\\n\r\nShana stands at 141cm ( 4\"8)  and is the female lead of the series.\\n\r\nShana is introduced into the series as a work alcoholic only concentrating herself with the duties of a flame haze and does not care about others well being. Because of that Shana has very little understanding of the world but, as the story progress little by little she develops empathy for others and becomes a caring person.\\n\\n\r\nYuji Sakai - Mytes - Guy that gets girls\\n\r\n(The person who you are gonna call stupid for the most part) \\n\\n\r\nYuji is your typical teenage boy that goes to high school. Yuji is a kind and gentle person that often thinks about ours before himself. Despite being a nice person this trait usually leads him astray and there is more to him that meets the eye. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYoshida Kazumi - Yuji friend - Nuisance \\n\\n\r\nYoshida presence in this series can be summed up to a phase from star wars.\\n\r\n\" Disturbance In The Force\" she is the embodiment of annoying and a really nuisance to the viewer. Despite being a nuisance to the viewers of the series Yoshida is a caring and nice person , Similar to Yuji she thinks about others before herself.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 810\\n\\n\r\nWhat the story lacks makes up for it in the characters. even so the characters seem generic like the story. Characters of this series feel like it has been done numerous amount of times but, overlooking that they are unique in their own way and ill praise the author for that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nENG DUB VS JPN DUB:\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion Japanese dub  is much better in terms of quality and enjoyment\\n\r\ni feel like it matches the characters much better. For the English dub it tends to be more aggressive when you hear it but. it fits well for Shana in the beginnings of the series. I wish i could elaborate about this more but, it really comes down to personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nOpenings/Soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nShakugan No Shana soundtrack was okay.... there were no tunes or melodies\\n\r\nthat made me wan't to listen to it out of the series.\\n\\n\r\nShakugan No Shana openings were really well  executed. The openings\\n\r\nHishoku No Sora  and Joint by Mami kawada were refreshing to listen to and watch. One of the best openings i have seen and listen to in a while.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 6.5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\\n\\n\r\nSeries Overall: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nShakugan No Shana is a solid title and i like to consider it as one of the best animes to come out in the year 2005. Although the series is rather generic the\\n\r\nshow does have its moments and if you are a fan of supernatural, mystery or romance, this is the show you should pick up and watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: If i have made some grammar mistakes or some flaws that i haven't notice please tell me =)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Yuji and Shana are both really great characters, who have a pretty fair amount of depth (and presumably even moreso later on)\r\nThere was a really strong blend of action, romance, and comedy that you really don\u2019t get too often in a show, and that was a major plus to me. \r\nIf I had one bad thing to say about the show, it would be the THREE episode flashback to when Shana was becoming a flame haze. I wouldn\u2019thave had a problem with them if they were broken up, but having three episodes in a row like that really threw me for a loop and in my opinion it was offputting to the story to do so.\\n\\n\r\nLooking towards next season/series, I hope that Yuji definitively chooses Shana over Yoshida. I hate this! Yushida is cool but nah I just don\u2019t see that happening between them. I think it\u2019s going to involve Yuji learning how to fight and possibly getting control over his power more to help Shana in battle, which would be cool to see them fighting side by side. I hope to start the second season in the next few days!!!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n+ Great characters\\n\r\n+ Good fight scenes\\n\r\n+ Strong story\\n\r\n+ All the plot points made sense\\n\r\n+ Happy ending!!!\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n- the dreaded 3 episode flashback\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend the show to anyone who is looking for something that has a nice blend of action, plot, romance, and comedy in for good measure.

            "content": "I have a lot of mixed feelings when it comes to Shakugan no Shana. I think that's the reason that I'm very glad I watched it. When I'm watching an anime, what I'm hoping to experience is what I like to call \"a roller-coaster ride of emotions.\" I only have a few other anime that I've watched to compare it to, but for clarity let me give an example. When I watched Code Geass, I was on a ride going from adoration to loathing and back for each and every one of the characters. TTGL, for example, I only experienced that with a few charactersand not to a great extent for the series as a whole. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it, but I enjoyed it in a different way.\\n\\n\r\nShakugan no Shana was a roller-coaster in two ways: my emotions towards the characters, plot, etc and my emotions towards the show itself. The first needs no explanation, but as for the second there were a few points where the show was not very appealing to me. In particular, without giving anything away, a particular story arc in the middle of the season I didn't enjoy at all. For 3-4 episodes the show was really a drag, and at the point I almost lost faith in the show itself (if you've seen it and are curious what part this is, PM me and I'll let you know).\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning dragged a bit, and was a bit hard to follow. I consider myself as a quick learner, but it still took me a bit to pick up on all the terms and such required to understand what's going on and enjoy the story as it should be enjoyed. Another part I didn't like at times was the pace: the plot seemed to come to a screeching halt right in the middle. The show's rife with slow-motion explosions and slow drifting camera-sweeps which add to a particular tone the creators were going for, a kind of solemn brooding atmosphere, but when it got to those parts I found my interest waning fast.\\n\\n\r\nSo now you're probably wondering, well if he disliked all that stuff about it why did he give it an 8/10? In my opinion, Shakugan no Shana is amazing at what it does, which the truth be told encompasses just about everything. There's just about every theme I could ever want in an anime, from humor to drama, action to deep, thought evoking moments which you literally needed to pause the show and digest. I really enjoyed all of those things, the premise, the plot (when it was moving), and especially the characters. Rie Kugimiya and Satoshi Hino are brilliant. They really give life to their characters through subtle changes in their voices. Some might consider voice acting to be a sort of sub-art to live-action acting, but I tend to disagree. Voice actors have to work extra hard to put their own personalities into the characters so that they, as actors, can be seen through the mask of the animation. It's no easy task to put your own personal style into a character when the character is just a drawing. These two pull it off, however, and make Shana and Yuuji very lifelike and enjoyable to watch. I wouldn't like to give the impression that the other characters are unimportant, though. The supporting characters are just as brilliant, and I found myself at times even siding with Yoshida over Shana (which is probably forbidden, I know).\\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between brilliantly created characters, whether in scenes of action, drama or comedy, as well as a truly enthralling premise and a plot that despite its occasional stagnation manages to come back just in the nick of time pull this series up from what could have been a train wreck to being one of my favorite anime of all time. I'm earnestly looking forward to the next season. I'm hoping that it can make up for the mistakes this one made and surpass it in every way to become something beyond remarkable.",

            "content": "This is a review of the whole series(all seasons). No spoilers.\r\n3 seasons, 24 episodes each.\r\nGenre: Action, Superpower, romance, comedy, supernatural, school\r\nFirst off, this is an anime that gets better with the sequels unlike others who sort of drop in quality. That means that season 3 is the best and yes, it definitely is but to get to it, you'll have to endure seasons 1 and 2.\r\nI liked and didn't like this anime from time to time. To watch it, you must have a firm resolve because you will definitely want to leave it in between seasons 1 and 2 but season 3 is really good.\r\nThereis not much romance in the first 2 seasons. It is clear who the characters in the romance are but nothing happens. \\n\r\nAs for comedy, not much. I barely remember if I laughed during this series.\\n\r\nAction, there's plenty of it. Almost in every episode but the real action starts at the end of season 2 and during the war in season 3.\\n\r\nSuperpowers and supernatural, both are present. Supernatural being the presence of demons and other mystic beings. And superpowers are according to the character e.g. fire, magic etc.\\n\r\nThe animation and character design looks childish and doesn't give the whole badass feel though some characters may look good. \\n\r\nAnd another good thing is that it's got a complete ending unlike most anime that end with everything returning to how it was etc.\\n\r\nThis is the longest action superpower anime I've seen and all I can say is that it was ok. Not bad but not too great either.\\n\r\nIf you've got spare time and no other good anime to watch, then this would be a good choice. But don't watch it if you're looking for some action with romance. You can watch tons of other romance anime in the duration it would take to get the romance in Shana. \\n\r\nIt is similar to Kaze no Stigma but Stigma is way better.\\n\r\nOverall, if you're going to watch this, don't leave it in the middle because getting to S3 is what's it all about. Otherwise don't watch it, because the first two seasons aren't anything great.",

This is what an anime should be about - an Ass Kicking Cute Girl!\r\nOne of the strong elements of SnS is its presentation - An epic battle between the beings who eats human existence called the Guze no Tomogaras and the beings who restore balance, the Flame Haze. The story kicks off a brilliant start, introducing our main characters - namely Shana and Yuuji -and along the way other characters are eventually introduced.\\n\\n\r\nThe story reveals itself eventually in the story arcs; initially, it's fast paced, but slows in the middle and speeds up again in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead Shana is probably one of my all time favorite characters. She's a tsundere, she is strong physically, mentally, and in will, also she loves to say \"Urusai! Urusai! Urusai!\" with that very cute facial expression and she loves melon pan - sweet! I also love how her character develops in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sakai Yuuji, he's has the generic main male protagonist personality, but not too lame. He just lacks the kicks. That's my initial reaction to him, but along the course of the series, his personally eventually gets a little better.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is quite solid, especially Alastor, Wilhelmina, and Yuuji's mother, they added more depth to the show. I wish Yoshida Kazumi's role could have been better (she's cute too!). As for the villains, they are nicely portrayed, especially the Master Throne Hecate.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style of J.C. Staff for this series is quite adorable, at least for their character designs. The visual detail of the scenery is quite lacking, but the animation is smooth enough. The fight scenes are quite good, they're fast paced. Compared to the other shows of its time (2005), SnS is very top notch!\\n\\n\r\nThe music department is where the anime excels - The OP and ED themes were great, especially the first OP, \"Hishoku no Sora\" by Kawada Mami. The music by KOTOKO is also good. The BGMs is also good spicing up the scenes very well.\\n\\n\r\nSnS is a good show and deserves all the hypes and fan adoration it gets. Who can't help but love our Female main character Shana. There were a few minor annoyances, but overall it's a very good show. Recommended!\\n",

The idea of humans and touches is just mind-blowing, it makes you think what if the world is like this and u are a human and the ppl around you do not really exist! The characters and titles are really stunning and unimaginably amazingly thought of and scripted for an anime that was created long ago. The fights and animation is really good i must say and the plot for the romance is really great. Icant really emphasis on how awesome this anime is.. it's definitely worth your time watching if u like tsundere char and romance+comedy genre, animes like toradora or zero no tsukaima then i strongly recommend u watch this! I could have gone on and elaborate about the characters and plot developments but I think u should see how awesome is it yourself:) DO GIVE THIS ANIME A SHOT!!xD",

It kicks it in the god damn gut until it cannot breathe and then it strangles it. This show aint that violent or graphic in execution, as a standing piece however, this dude is a commando. My main man Yashichiro Takahashi was blessed by Jesus or his choice of religion's top gun to make the absolute best dude-is-actually-deus-ex-machina-and-has-best-girl show. \\n\\n\r\nNow I could go into so much more detail about the fantastically simple yet terribly effective world this show encases, the fucking awesome everything, the top cliches used at the best times ever and intro at the beginning of each episode that is cool as fuck.\\n\\n\r\nBut no, I'm going to go into how well it has aged. You know, when you write something this good in nipland, everyone will jump on the bandwagon, you could probably hate on Shana for starting an absolute clusterfuck train of terrible copies and failed plagiarizations under different names(mind you, if there's two differences in all it means nothingl, a copy is a copy, like Rakudai is of basically everything, and that show that aired the same season, which is like releasing your album about the same time Michael Jackson drops Thriller in the '80s, you'll fuck up your sales) \\n\\n\r\nNow if you're coming that side of the road that started watching anime in 2016 or 2015 or 201x (god have mercy), if you started watching this stuff after having watched Seirei Tsukai or some other thing, boy you are gonna be in a world of pain trying to remember which character is part of which show.  But here's the catch, that's because you've probably watched 20 shows (about as much as every anime expert by the way) so you'll immediately talk smack.\\n\\n\r\nThing is, this series is so damn good that basically every anime the following year copied it in a form or another, Shana started a generation mane sure, it killed one unfortunately (and I think Kugyuu's career with it) but look at all the bloat you've got today on the charts. And who you've got to thank for that? Shana.\\n\\n\r\nShana is this story about this dude who aint a dude really but then he goes on a super cool journey with Kugyuu to save the god damn world.\\n\r\nDude, you don't understand, this thing beats the BOJANGLES out of anything that gets released still, it has that good almost no budget pastel background, the ten on a scale nine voice acting, kataners, (she looks like fucking Blade in the first ep dude! all she needed was them glasses and every vamp in a 10km range would've shat itself. Anime shit.) This show is the very epitome of balance in the sense that one episode you're like \"dude hell yeah rip him to shreds\" and the next you're like \"noooo monica don' rip him he did it for LOVE\" and that's where this show is absolutely  spectacular in writing. Literally everything is driven by the power of love, you think that anarchist was violated as a child by his dad who scalped injuns as a hobby? Nome Sir, he loved too hard. It just does amazing things for that time, worldbuilding is revolutionary, the execution is flawless, background characters get proper roles and don't fade in the eternal blackness of the background(!!!), plot assets are re-used, it has PACING BRAH(and filler, for good measure).\\n\r\nIf you want to travel back in time to a time where anime was fucking anime and not hired korean drawers(someone'll point out how koreans worked on the animation, imma funk you up) this is your time machine. It's set to stop in the year of our lord Jesus Christ 2005, the year when all things were right in the world and God was in his heaven. It gets better every episode, the typical elements are thrown into a blender with so much love and care you'd swear the author was caressing them while the blender was on full speed, overclocked, on fucking fire baby. This show will rock your socks off, you'll have to call the cops and keep you away from screaming like a girl every time someone does something because they're all as fabulous as Dante (with the right hairstyle), they all have STYLE, the EXECUTION dude. Flawless in so many ways it's almost infinite how much praise I have for this title. \\n\r\nTen, that's it, ten, if you don't like it you can choke on a wing ding dingaling down yo throat. \\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, the show used all of the budget on the OP so it looks kinda choco (read: vintage, japan was in a recession), but it still holds up and atleast it doesn't look as bad as that piece of hipster trash Ping-Pong. So give it a shot, you're doing yourself a favor.\\n\r\nA shot with watching Shana, not Ping-Pong. Ping-Pong is gutter trash. \\n\r\nThe music is good shit good shit like all anime except for Ping-Pong. It has better writing than most of the shows today, especially Ping-Pong.\\n\r\nCharacters are fleshed out in the sense that they haven't been deprived of food six months before the drawing of the show, like in Ping-Pong.\\n\r\nOh and it reeks of vintage goodness, unlike Ping-Pong which only reeks of choco, by the way Ping-Pong gets a zero from me, I don't wanna do a review for it since I already showered.\\n\r\nIf anybody downvotes this I will scalp you, let the people see the truth. Shana best girl, if you like Yoshida I'mma bring monicas and fight you in a cage.",

            "content": "Let's have a review starting at the end: Shakugan no Shana is a good show; if you're at all interested in monster-fighting urban fantasy with magic and powers running around keeping the world safe on the secret, you'll probably like it.\r\nMore interesting, I feel, is why Shakugan no Shana works: because it's far from unique.  There are a million other stories like this one, both older and newer, both in Japanese and in Western media.  But in my opinion, Shana does kind of stand apart from the pack as something memorable and good.  So if it's not the core concept being uniqueand engaging, what is it?\\n\\n\r\nIt's... a little bit of everything.  For one, we have the story.  Again, this is sort of every urban fantasy story: something supernatural is menacing the locality of the writers' choice (City, in this case, but country, world, or school grounds would make no difference), most humans are unknowing, but a main character gets dragged into the other world that exists parallel to the one we know, probably as something special.  Shana kind of knows that we don't care too much about what was going on before that point, and gets us pretty much right to our main character, Yuji Sakai, receiving his tutorial on this particular shadowy monster-infested world, followed very quickly by being pulled into further adventures/mayhem by the Flame-Haired, Burning-Eyed Hunter.\\n\\n\r\nBeing thrown into the deep end right off the bat is something of a bold choice: it would be easy to lose viewers who, like Yuji himself, can't quite follow what's transpiring in the first couple episodes, but as I just mentioned, that's actually like Yuji, and there is therefore a degree to which the viewer is forced to share his experience.  Beyond that, the writing is what I might call clean.  It's not simplistic -- not by any means, there are plenty of made-up names, secret histories, and weird rules of the supernatural being thrown around -- but it is easy to quickly understand.  You know, pretty much instantly, what the stakes and drives of the characters are, and the characters are used to draw you deeper into the story.  We care about the city because Yuji cares, and we have a sense of urgency about the danger that denizens present not because they eat nameless faceless masses (which they do; Shakugan no Shana has quite the body count of unnamed characters, even if no one in setting will notice or remember) but because Shana has and properly expresses a sense of urgency in what she does.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the characters.  They're very good, and do a lot of the work of setting Shakugan no Shana apart from its innumerable competitors.  True, they are somewhat typical: Yuji is mostly the special-but-wimpy former unknowing, Shana is the hardened veteran badass, Yoshida is the perpetual unknowing.  The Crimson Denizens are, for the most part, monsters with a theme but not really a relatable human personality.  Margery Daw and her schoolboy minions are a little less archetypical, but they still fit into molds that have been used elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, all these characters grow.  Yuji Sakai starts off frightened and depressed (a natural reaction to his situation, frankly) but as the story goes on, he gains the conviction to fight for what he believes in and, though he's anything but strong, really play the part of the hero.  Shana is in some ways the perfect image of the Tsundere done well: at the start, she isn't in touch with her feelings, but slowly, by growing and reaching some degree of self-knowledge, she comes to terms with them (to a degree) and the nature of and triggers for her flustered outbursts change.  She begins the story not wanting anything, gains desires, and finally gains understanding of what she wants.  It's the kind of transformation you want to see.  Margery Daw goes through some forced character growth earlier, having to address her serious issues in an early arc and find a new balance when some of her world view was shattered, while her henchmen go from random and kind of shiftless recruits to dedicated fellows doing what they can as regular humans.  Even Yoshida, who you'd normally expect to be locked out of the loop, becomes aware of the Crimson World and had to answer for herself how the knowledge she gains might change her wishes or priorities.  No one is static in Shakugan no Shana, they're all characters we see multiple sides of, and who's trials have a real impact upon them.  For a show where the stated mission of the heroes is to \"maintain the balance of the world\", which would seem to lend itself to having a strong status quo, there really isn't much of one to speak of: every adventure sees some fundamental change to at least some of the characters we care about, and their growth and change stick.  That seriously narrows down the competition Shakugan no Shana has to face from the rest of its 'pack'.\\n\\n\r\nAlso of note is the action.  It's a mix of powers and martial arts that's fast and impactful.  On the subject of action, I have a theory: when a show does action poorly, there can still be a lot of technical action (or at least motion), but that motion will lack weight.  Good action needs stakes, drama, and meaning in order to properly convey the intensity and purpose.  Bad action shows a lot of stuff happening without actually doing anything, while with good action will also show a lot of stuff happening (as the complexity of fight choreography can be a selling point) but none of that will be wasted, and every move will represent a shift in the ebb and flow or the fight, or at least properly 'sell' the drama inherent in the moment, rapidly showing the characters engaged in the action going through as many emotional and dramatic moments as a powerfully charged conversation or other 'dramatic' scene, but doing it with the visuals of a life-or-death struggle rather than with words.  In essence, good action speaks to the viewer, and communicates meaning, while bad action just makes a lot empty noise to cover for the fact that it really doesn't have much to say.\\n\\n\r\nBy that metric, the action in Shakugan no Shana is very good.  The drama of the scene will typically support the stakes of the fight, and the movements, animation, and choreography will have that important element of constant and clear communication.  You know why these characters are fighting, and how they fight lets you learn more about them as characters.  More than once, Shana's inner turmoil, or lack thereof, can be clearly expressed in how she handles herself in an action scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting helps too: it's really top notch.  There's a reason Shana's VA has been typecast as characters that are at least a little Shana-like thereafter, despite having an otherwise huge range, and it's because she does an incredible job bringing such a complex character, and most critically that character's growth and change, to life.  The rest of the cast aren't slouches either.  The music, meanwhile, is excellent: all the opening and ending themes were strong and memorable, and the in-episode music and sound was mixed well to augment, not distract from, the events on screen.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I enjoyed the show a ton, and looking forward to watching more of it -- not more of the millions of other stories that might have the same general tropes and patterns, more of Shakugan no Shana, which has done so much to earn my respect and continued viewership.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "In many ways this is your usual shonen story: a plain, unremarkable guy suddenly gets involved in an extraordinary situation when his life is disrupted by a girl that has fallen from the sky (not exactly but I hope you get my point). And yet there's something very special about this series and the way it deals with the emotional issues affecting their main characters. It was just adorable to see Shana struggle with the conflicting emotions she was having. They also were a sign of just how young she truly was despite the great responsibility she bore. I think that emotional struggle is somethingall of us can relate to from our younger years.\\n\\n\r\nOn other accounts the anime is very weak. The enemies \"schemes\" were usually very nonsensical and a very sad excuse for action. I couldn't take any of the enemies seriously to be honest. This makes me fear watching the second and third season because they will probably contain more of this given that the character fundamentals (what I found to be the compelling part of the series) have already been laid out but I guess I can't escape watching them now. I can only hope that they all have something special that make them worth watching besides said the \"action\".\\n\\n\r\nENGLISH DUB observations: I almost forgot to add this. For some reason Yuji says \"Shawna\" instead of \"Shana\" which is kind of weird. Also, on season 2 the voices of some characters seem to have been changed for the worst which is a huge screw up in my opinion. One of the characters now sounds \"bratty\" instead of cool and aloof (what he is supposed to be). Anyways, if you want to avoid the disappointment then please avoid the english dub.",

            "content": "This review will contain every season as I'm to lazy to go through each one.. SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nStory 7/10: Let me just say that was not worth 3 seasons to see how they ended up together in the end.. I knew there was a happy ending because for some reason I'm always looking things up and getting them spoiled for me and I'm cool with that! Anyways.. The story line is decent but not the best I've ever seen and I expected that since episode 1! Alot of people talk bad on season 2 and 3 and I don't understand why? They were just as enjoyableas season 1.. The story did get confuse me at some times and I'd find myself skipping through parts that didn't seem important to the current story line like either when they'd be talking about feelings or just random shit they had done.. Seemed like they dragged out each episode to fit the length and I got bored easily! Although I'm glad they ended up together in the end I still didn't really like the ending.. I was expecting Yuji's plan to fail and cry his eyes out of something, EVEN though I was hoping for him to win because he's the MC and you always have to support the MC! I kind of disliked that they both went off to the new world leaving their family and friends behind.. Something about it just didn't seem right! I was hoping for the Cinderella ending but it never came the way I wanted it.. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: Art seemed decent and I didn't really find anything wrong about it... Obviously it wasn't perfected and it did have some flaws about it but it was still ok!\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: Same goes for the soundtrack/sound of the anime, the soundtrack was decent and nothing seemed out of place on any seasons! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: Each character seemed fairly decent and had a good place in all of it.. All except Kazumi.. I don't know what it was but at sometimes she would annoy the heck out of me! Like \"Oh I can't keep up with his world!\" Or \"I'm so useless, blah blah blah!\" She seemed to just nag on looking for pity everytime.. Also why did you need her for the map thing? You could of grabbed anyone, even yourself to use as the map? I don't know the rules to this thing but damn.. Each character seemed to have a good fit in to all the places they needed to be.. They didn't overuse the supporting characters aswell as not under use them. I also really enjoyed Yuji's mother, I got like a spiritual feeling from her and that she always gave good advice, positive vibes and stuff! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're looking for a romance anime, don't watch this unless you're willing to wait a long ass time for it! DO come for the action and plot(?) Even though the plot isn't as interesting as it could be, I can see a good reason to watch it for these two!",

            "content": "I recently re-watched Shakugan no Shana and am still amazed how much I enjoy the series. Don't get me wrong. It's not perfect. It has quite a number of flaws. But if you can get past the negatives, the show is quite enjoyable. \r\nShakugan no Shana starts out with Yuuji Sekai. He's your average everyday kid with very few problems. One day, he gets attacked by a monster. Luckily, Shana comes to the rescue and saves him. Due to this courageous act, Yuuji and Shana form an unlikely friendship. For the rest of the series, both of them team up to protect one another fromthe monsters, villains, and other beings that are trying to destroy the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation here is very well done, especially during fight scenes. Usually, during a fight scene, the entire show is glazed in bright red. It makes the series seem like some sort of gothic party with insane fighting. Perhaps that's not the best way to describe it, but you get the point. The animation during day scenes are good too. Same with night. It just gets heightened whenever a battle is taking place. \\n\\n\r\nMusic for the series is really nice. Everytime there's a fight scene, the songs used really get you in the mood for what's about to come. It's a pretty amazing soundtrack for a series like this one. The OP is really good, although I hesitate to say great. I mean, it fits the anime and everything, but I've heard much better songs. ED is good too. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation, art, and music are all wonderful, my main love for this anime comes from Shana. She's absolutely amazing. I'm a man, and while I do enjoy girly girls like everyone else, it's nice to have a strong female lead every once in awhile. Shana represents just that. She's a strong character that grows as the series goes on. By the end, I was truly happy with where to ended up (character-wise). Shana also gets a bit of a backstory. While nice, I didn't necessarily think it was needed. Shana wears a magical pendent, named Alastor. He's fine. Nothing really stands out with his character. Every once in awhile, he helps Shana with certain tasks. \\n\\n\r\nYuuji is okay in the beginning. I wouldn't call his character a wimp, but he definitely isn't nearly as strong of a character as Shana. Just like Shana, he grows immensely leading up to the finale. There's also two other characters that I think should be mentioned. One of them is Margery Daw. I don't want to give too much away about her, but I thought her character worked well. She's more fanservice than anything else. Still, it wasn't annoying. Lastly, there's Kazumi Yoshida. Honestly, the first few episodes that she showed up in didn't go well with me. Unlike Shana, her character is the definition of a girly girl. Kazumi had wants and needs that I found a bit ridiculous. Luckily, she kinda redeems herself in the end, although I wouldn't say she grew as a character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Shakugan no Shana quite a bit. It's nothing special, but I just love the character of Shana. If you're someone who enjoys tsundere characters, there's a good chance you'll have a great time with this series. To be honest, even if you don't, I think a lot of men and women will appreciate Shana for being the strong girl that she is. Definitely not a must see series, but should be checked out if you have the time.",

            "content": "Shakugan no Shana, the first season was terrible. I had to force myself to watch through 24 episodes of this boring, dull box of wood blocks. Because that's what this seems like, just staring at a boring box of random wood blocks you'd get at Lowes. This is going to be a hard review. I have nothing to work with, the only term that describes this season is 'boring.' I don't know why so many people enjoy this, you're probably going to hate me but this is my review.\r\nWhile this anime was incredibly boring to me, there were parts where things touched me, and mademe sad, due to some creative romance events that happened. This is where I get into the romance vs the action genres. For some damn reason, they've managed to make both genres conflict with each other by making one suck and the other quite nice. So lets talk about its genres.\\n\\n\r\nStory: First, its romance is beautiful and touching especially when Kazumi entered the picture. The whole school they were at and Ike (Pronounced Ee-kay, not Ike from South Park), Ogata, the original Hirai, and many more, all made good school characters for a good anime and managed to add a bit more realism to it. Now granted, the main plot line has to be one of the most creative and unique plots I've ever seen but when the actual plot was presented as the story progressed, that's when I started having problems. You will be fooled by the first three episodes because is has a great world set up. Deeper in, you'll get tired and even confused.\\n\\n\r\nThe action doesn't make sense, the enemies are annoying, the story is too predictable, the main characters are too dull, and its all \"the hero saves the day over each enemy that shows up after the other dies.\" Oh where do I start? Lets take a look at our enemies because that where our story comes in... There is a good amount so I'm not going into every single one, but they are all so annoying. Friagne, was actually the only enemy I found to be not that bad. He was like our insane enemy who had a weird obsession for this certain doll. His powers? Energy blasts...or raining balls of energy...this is one of the main problems of the story. What are the powers of the characters? Energy blasts? Looking at the wiki...I got a better understanding of their spells they used but examining how they present their battles, nothing is very creative. You really have to look for it and then say, \"Oh so this is what the character does.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe Professor was my breaking point. He is the worst character out of this whole series and he isn't even dead yet. Why is he the worst? Because of the silliness, waving his arms around speaking in a high trying-to-be-comedic voice that sounds like it should be in a little kids show. He's trying to be insane, but fails at it so bad that he's just acting childish which creates a poor, non-intimidating enemy. On top of that, he's a mad scientist, so scary right? He's a joke.\\n\\n\r\nBel Peol is boring, enough said. Sydonay is a creepy old guy that looks like he has perverted fantasies with Hecate. Hecate wasn't too bad except for the end which was understandable but didn't have much of a point. These enemies ruined the show for me. The action is mediocre but the romance is quite nice at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Now onto our main characters. Yes, I saw a little bit of character development with Shana but Yuji, not so much. Their relationship between one another is horrible because of one huge mistake they did. Shana's backstory which they wasted - three! - episodes on. It starts out with the old cliche when Shana and Yuji sit together and she basically thinks about it for a second which expands into three episodes. This was a complete info-dump. You don't do this. This was like, one of the key elements to have the relationship build between Shana and Yuji by letting Yuji get to know her background as things progressed. They could've spread this through the entire story a lot better, instead they compressed it all into one and Yuji doesn't even get to know about it. The romance makes up for it a little, but it just feels like there's a missing piece.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I can't believe I'm getting into this. Almost everything is so robotic and virtual, it makes everything incredibly boring. The mom has some nice things to say sometimes but overall, her voice actor is awful because she's so robotic. Wilhelmina, Bel Peol, Khamsin, and sometimes Ike is the same way. Wilhelmina is suppose to be that character that's all about her destiny as a flame haze, that's fine but you're not suppose to make her look like an android that's just so dead and uninterested. This was my least favorite character. I watched this dubbed, maybe subbed is better. Don't watch it dubbed.\\n\\n\r\nThe music. Three words; add more instruments. The strings and choir sound so synthesized. Sometimes it sounds good, though they have to use different synthesized sounds for the string sections which makes me think its just suppose to be a synthesizer and not an orchestra. I love synth instruments but there's certain sounds that go with certain music and certain music that goes with certain shows. With what I learned in programming music, you can't just make any old synth, you have to have an ear. I think it would've sounded quite nice if there were more things going on but no, just cheap synth ambiance. And the choir is so repetitive, just turn it off. I've never heard music be this bad in anything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Maybe the smallest age range of 13-17 could enjoy this. Any other, I can't understand as there are plenty of better anime to watch than this, ones that have way more interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This was a terrible anime and I don't think I can sit through another season of this. Maybe the second season is better, and makes up for some of the things, but I'm so tired of this anime, I can't do it. It's so boring, I'm giving my final 4/10. Good day.",

            "content": "Okay, as always I want to preface my review with the three things I\u2019m looking for in an anime: I want a really good story (+5), I want really good dialogue (characters/character development, etc.)(+3), and I want really good \u201ctechnicals\u201d (style, sound, etc.)(+2). Also, I\u2019ll remind you my reviews generally encompass the whole series of an anime unless otherwise stated (That is to say that no more seasons are coming out). So let\u2019s get to it!\r\nShakugan no Shana\u2026 I feel that this anime had an enormous amount of potential. With a story revolving around the competing \u2019existences\u2019, i.e. Flame Hazes vs. Crimson Denizens, who resideon different planes of reality, the show hit\u2019s the ground running with a really cool premise. Think about it, battles going on in an unseen world that you\u2019ll never know about, yet the outcomes of which could and does effect your life in unimaginable ways. So much so that you could just be written out of existence! This was going to be the tragic fate of our protagonist, however, as it just so happens he\u2019s not your everyday human. The story continues with his adventures trying to figure out his place now that this whole new unseen reality has been revealed to him. To me, that\u2019s a goldmine of possibilities set up to work with. \\n\\n\r\nEarning 4 points \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ending of this anime decides to throw all that in the garbage. Nearly the entirety of the last season is a mess of epic proportions. Instead of continuing with all the good things the first seasons had built up, the last season goes on its own into the wilderness of horrible endings. By introducing practically a whole new cast of characters, creating nonsensical plot drivers, and just plain ridiculous reasoning by the characters in terms of their decision making faculties, Shakugan no Shana goes out in a pyre of infamy. Frankly, I\u2019m going to be watching it to appear on some top ten list of \u201cMost Unexpected Anime Endings\u201d, because I found it hard to swallow that something so good could become so bad.\\n\\n\r\nDeduction: -1.5 points\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dialogue and character development, I was quite pleased for the most part. The interactions and relationship between the protagonist and Shana were well executed and all in all, the characters were enjoyable. The romantic elements were handled to my liking, and, the protagonist does grow throughout the story as a character (as does Shana). There are some characters (especially towards the end) that are left high and dry in the character development department, but, all main characters have enough in my humble opinion to allow the story to progress relatively unhindered. \\n\\n\r\nEarning 2 points\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\\n\r\nTechnicals are solid. I truly enjoyed the entire OST of this anime, the style and animation were good too. No complaints.\\n\\n\r\nEarning 2 points  \\n\r\n---------------------\\n\\n\r\nBonus points award goes to\u2026 having some really cool Flame Hazes out there! And some cool powers to come with them! \\n\\n\r\nEarning 1 point. \\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nAdd it all up and we have a score of 7.5! If you want my advice, just watch the first two seasons only, then let your imagination make up what\u2019s going to happen next. It\u2019ll be better that way. Trust me, if I had done that, this anime would have been an 8.5 easy.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, since I\u2019m a critic, I\u2019ll round down my score to a 7 because that\u2019s just the way it goes. That way it\u2019ll be better than expected when you watch it! Till next time",

            "content": "Hey guys! This is my first review on this site, so be easy on me!\r\nShakugan no Shana, where should I begin?\r\nYou know, at first glace there isn't much that is really that great about it. It's got one of the most tedious and plot hindering romances of all time, is confusing at times, the art is cool but the eyes take up a third of their head. The characters develop like they were in an RPG, they really only get stronger over time and learn new tricks, and the personalities are very generic. This anime does so much wrong, yet... yet...\r\n...\r\n... it's one of myfavorite anime of all time.\\n\r\nI have no clue how it works but it does and it keeps you hooked. Shakugan no Shana is so stereotypical and so frustrating in some regards that it makes its way into your heart and stays there. But it's not out of pity. This anime is actually good! It's almost a perfect anime while being so aesthetically generic! In fact, i watched all 3 seasons (72 episodes) in 2 weeks! I'll just start the review (general, over all 3 seasons) and I'll show you what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nIt has a pretty unique and cool concept, with a world created around it. The idea of existence being a finite power source is an incredible concept. And the plot line regarding the flame hazes, crimson denizens and the like is a 10/10 story line (which is why I loved the third season). Also, i loved the pacing. It's not like many animes where an episode starts and it feels like nothing has happened then BAM, \"tune in next week to watch the 5th part of the first episode of SAO S2\". It actually has substance. A lot can happen and you check how much time is left for the episode and you are like \"hell yeah! I have 12 more minutes!\" And i love that! And the show is built to watch it for hours straight because of how each episode ends. There is always a moment of suspense to keep you going. There is that boring 3 episode back story that pops up a few times in the series, but its no endless 8. The plot regarding the flame hazes and the development of Yuji is brilliant... so why is this a 9/10?\\n\r\nIt's the biggest killer of any great drama. Romance. The romance in SnS is so bad, but it's still very important to the plot and character development. Shana, normally a cold, steely-eyed, nameless killer begins to realize what it's like to be a real girl, and it takes Yuji to help her with it. Actually, the romance between Yuji and Shana is a great concept, and the actual romance that takes place between them is great. But where the romance gets bad is that every main character seems to get involved. I'm even okay with the triangle between Yoshida and Shana, since it is the catalyst developing Shana's character. It's just the unnecessary little bits like Ike's involvement and Hecate in Season 2. The vanilla romances of Shana/Yuji and Yoshida/Yuji work and actually create a plot. It's just when there is too much romance is where the story loses some points.\\n\r\nSeason 2 is more about Yuji getting stronger and Shana's emotional development and is really good drama. And then...\\n\r\n...\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nSEASON THREE. HOLY MOTHER OF HARUHI. I can't even talk about it cause any detail is a spoiler. Let me tell you one thing. NOBODY EXPECTED THIS. You're in for a treat if you like surprises cause by jove you will get the surprise of your freaking lives.\\n\r\nSeriously, it will blow your mind. It was my favorite season because it changes everything you thought you knew about the Crimson World.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, the art actually gradually improves over time. Only glaring weakness is that the eyes are really big, but hey. It's anime friends. I think it looks fine. Why this is a 9/10 is because of the action scenes early on. They actually don't ever show anyone getting struck or cut and it's a little odd, but the fighting gets better later on.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI am not a dub guy. I think Japanese sounds better over English 99% of the time. However, on my second watch, I did the dub and I was impressed. It sounds really good with the exception of Margery in battle (shudders). But the Japanese is really great too. Soundtrack is what puts this over the top. All 3 seasons have some of the best OPs and EDs in anime, period. Joint from season 2 may be the best song of all time. Many times I will skip an OP or turn it off at the ED, but never for Shakugan no Shana. The OST for this anime is the BEST.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nYou know many of these reviews say that SnS has very stereotypical characters. And that is true partially. You have your tsundere, your kind hearted, selfless male hero, your alcoholic Western chick, the competition in love, and even the side characters and enemies have all been seen before.\\n\r\nBut what Shakugan no Shana does great is that it makes you develop your own personal feelings for each character and that  is what makes this series so good. You personally feel something different for every character and that affects your reaction to the plot. That is really cool in my opinion and brilliant. You get mad, you feel heartbreak, you may even rejoice when a breakthrough happens. In fact, what this show does great, especially when the main \"villains\" get more screen time, is that this show is not about good vs evil, but rather relative good vs relative good. Some characters you hated in one episode may make you sympathize with them later. Even if you think you were on the good guys side, you may reconsider (especially later on). That is why it is so brilliant. You might hate Shana for her early heartless demeanor, but warm up to her and root for her later, then get frustrated at her. You might think Yuji is the nicest guy of all time, but is so dense when it comes to girls and that might make you feel bad for the girls, and then you feel accomplished when Yuji gets powerful, and then season 3 and you're like WHAAAAAT. You might even like Saito and Tanaka, the neer-do-wells who are henchmen for the busty boozer Margery Daw and her comic sidekick Marco. I actually came to love the denizens as well, especially Bol Mask and the Trinity. Even the semi-main characters, like Alastor, Whirlhelmina, Yujis mom, Yoga-chan, and the other flame hazes all have developed personalities and play great roles.\\n\r\nAnd then there is Yoshida. Most people hate SnS for her, but she is one of the most important characters. She might deserve a hate club because yes, she is the losing third part of love triangle. But she is what drives Yuji to become stronger, what drives Shana to learn how to feel and love. She is a pitiful character but I love her character. You don't want her to win because you love Shana more, but you may feel bad for her. I did. Most people don't though, but they seem to oversee the genius behind this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first this show is very generic, but is in reality so freaking deep that I could go on about it. Certainly underrated but the reactions you get from every scenario and character keep you coming back for more. It may seem like it repeats, but the general development of the characters is just so dynamic. I can't get enough of this show as I'm on my first playback and am just now realizing how great this show was. You may see stereotypes, the occaisonal corny dialouge and joke, but underneath that painful romance (and it's painful on purpose) is the deepest character development and largest roster that is actually memorable individually.\\n\\n\r\nI was a little disappointed by the reviews on here, but I think they are all missing the point. I recommend it highly, and give it a rewatch if you saw it before in the same light as I have. Skip the backstories if you find them boring because the rest is fantastic. You may find it predictable early on, but there are plot twists. And one season is actually one big twist. It's awesome. It's almost a perfect anime. It's Shakugana no Shana people. Watch it.",

The first episode is dry but give it time after a few episodes when the story really picks up you will be hooked.\r\nThe characters for the most part are very likable and their interactions are well thought out. The only complaint i have about the series is that the whole love triangle that seems to be forced into most anime takes way to long to figure out. THOUGH the love interests actually use this asa way to become close friends and you end up not knowing who he should end up with. The answer at the end of the last episode is simple and if your not watching you will miss it which is actually nice and kinda heart warming. \\n\\n\r\nIf you watch there are a couple of fun screw ups in animation one scene when shana is defending yuji she is talking puts her sword away and as they change camera angles the sword disappears and reappears.\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended!",

I do not like drama at all, so when certain elements were introduced, I grew very angry at the anime and it got a much poorer rating. Also, the storyline has some major inconsistencies within it where the author introduced certain aspects and then never touches on them again. I really hate inconsistent story lines so when these things happened it got a pretty poor rating.\r\nOverall, I wouldn't suggest it, but it's not a bad watch, IF you stop at this season and justwatch the final 5 minutes of the last season (trust me, you're not missing much).",

Shakugan no Shana is all about a boy who meets up with a girl who poses supernatural powers. Then the boy discovers he has supernatural powers and begins utilizing it. Of course the two then start to realize their feelings for each other, but this only comes to light towards the end of season one and season two. \r\nNow I'll try to be neutral about this as much possible, I've seen the anime and it's nothing special. The action was pretty good, but was often wrecked bythe long dredge of the main characters' emotional problems. This anime's ending was also a little disappointing  with a cliff hanger ending coupled with a love triangle.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10, just watch it. Nothing gained, nothing lost.",

            "content": "Shakugan no Shana had quite the umph in my opinion. However, the way the writers brought up that umph was quite disappointing.\r\nStory - 7. The story itself was very interesting. A boy dies from being pulled into a bizarre war which has been raging right under his nose. Because he's to gradually fade into nothingness after his unlawful death, he's struggles to make a lasting memory with anyone close within his lifetime. It is during this process that he finds that he's actually a much needed asset for the war, and obviously, therein lies our story. Sounds amazing, but the build up to the actualbattle was cheesy and long drawn; this makes the story itself feel boring and underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10. I like art, I like fluent animation, and this show definitely knew how to do it. Everything from pain, to weak knees is definitely see-able in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10. SNS did great with their OP, there soundtrack was also appropriately placed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6. I'd have to say, the characters were kind of bland. The male lead... well it's debatable whether his character developed or not throughout the series, but ultimately, I don't think he did at all. I think he did what he did just because Shana either forced him to, or he was helping shana. As for Shana, her repetitive attitude was not very tasty.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7. I'm fairly satisfied with the series, it was enjoyable in the fact that it had all the things needed to MAKE a good series. SNS just, didn't step up there game enough I guess.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8. To be honest, I liked the series while watching it, but thinking back about it just makes me wonder, what exactly were the fine points? In the end, I don't really feel like it was actually too special.",

Despite the love feud between Sekai, Shana, Ikea and Yoshida, which annoyed me slightly, I think this story was beautiful. I loved how it started with doubts to whether Sekai was even alive, and ended in him knowing that he was Yuji Sekai and it didn't matter what anyone told him.\r\n~Art: 7~\r\nThe art of this anime wasn't unique or sophisticated,but rather simple, yet the action scenes always seemed to surprise me. The art wasn't bad enough to make me stop watching, so I guess it was good.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound: 9~\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, the sound in this anime was superb. the openings and ending themes were really good, and I actually never skipped them when watching. the soundtrack was beautiful, and deserves more recognition.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters: 8~\\n\\n\r\nWow.

            "content": "Shakugan no Shana is very special to me because it is my introduction to the world of anime in the internet. Before, my only access to animes was just by watching our television dubbed by our language. But when I was watching Shana, I thought I might research it by internet and then I found out how much better it is to watch them with their original version. And so my anime experience started there.\r\nDespite by being special to me, the story is absolutely great. There\u2019s so much originality with the plot and so the storyline is very well-made. Almost everything is new to me,from stories about torches to flame hazes to the world of the crimson realm to hougu to denizens and many more. The terminology is so rich with its originality and you really have to research its meanings. I also genuinely love how the characters are named. It is fun and interesting. Setting aside that, it is really interesting how the story unfolds and before you know it you are already involve with the series. \\n\\n\r\nFor a 24 episodes type of series, there are so many characters in here. All of them are very interesting, most especially the non-human characters. That includes flame hazes, kings of guze, rinne, and even the villains from bal masque. They are so mysterious with their background stories on what really they are and how they become what they are. Even though you know that it is somewhat a love story, you still wouldn\u2019t notice it at first because of how the relationship of Yuji and Shana started. It is so misleading yet so original. Even with a titular name, Shana is still not the lead protagonist because it is still Yuji but she is my personal favorite. I like her naivety to the world that usually leads to misunderstandings between her and the other characters especially Yuji. It is also amazing how she can be so strong and powerful with her very small appearance. I so love it whenever she shouts, \u201cUrusai \u2013 Shut Up!\u201d. It is so cute!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is definitely one of the best of today\u2019s anime world. It is really exciting and fun how every scene looks with one of the bests visual effects. Plus, the music is really amazing which is very rare because not all famous anime of today have a very nice soundtracks or music. The great music gives a finishing touch to make the series so amazing.\\n\\n\r\nWith a great story, interesting characters, amazing animation, and nice soundtracks, it is no wonder why this anime is one of the famous animes of today. I am so looking forward to give my review for the sequel. \\n",

First off the story was amazing, and the way that it build was pretty good to. The way that the characters moved along along together was great (how the met back up). The one thing that would bother me was the fighting some times, but once you got over the bad parts of the combat it turned out to be pretty good!!! The way Shana matured was a thing that worked out in this anime because it kinda filledin the story. Now ok the way that shana and yuji fall in love and that whole thing is a great part of the story and if you started watching this anime you BETTER GO DOWNLOAD IT AND WATCH EVERY DAMN EPISODE UNTILL YOUR DONE AND WATCH THE 24 EPISODE!!! Because episode 24 was insane!!!!",

            "content": "Shakugan no Shana is a series that I had long been meaning to watch after being impressed with the battle music and visuals I saw in a video highlighting anime background music some time ago.  Now that I'm finally done with the first season, I can say that it is a very fun and enjoyable show.  It didn't blow me away by any means, but I think it's a very solid series.  If I had to pick my favorite aspect of the series, it would have to be the various supernatural/fantasy elements and characters, especially during the battle scenes.  The charactersrange from amusing and funny to disturbing, and by disturbing I mean that brother/sister Denizen duo.  The story isn't very deep, but still good enough to keep the show interesting and enjoyable.  Now earlier when I said that I was impressed with the visuals I saw, I was specifically referring to Shana during what I would call her Flame Haze mode, which I thought looked cool.  From a technical standpoint, the visuals aren't anything impressive, but they get the job done.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would rate this an 8/10 for \"Very Good\", which gets a high recommendation from me.  If you're looking for the next epic masterpiece, this might not be it.  However, it's a solid fantasy series with some cool characters, great battles, cute romance, and even some nice comedy.  If you haven't seen Shakugan no Shana yet, you ought to at least check it out sometime.",

Main character is shown fighting. Then Shana drops the bombshell that Yuuji Sakai, the male lead is dead. I started laughing thinking like we're in the beginning of the series and he's already dead, how does that work?\r\nFrom there we find out about the Midnight Lost Child treasure tool and how it lets Yuuji live eternally andmore. A great start to the series showing how Yuuji finally understands the struggle between Flame Haze (what Shana and many others like her are known as) and Crimson Denizen.",

            "content": "The world of Shakugan no Shana is a fascinating one. It is rich with lore and completely developed into something surreal yet believable. Unfortunately, there are many times in the first two seasons where we become lost in the \"comedic\" school lives of Yuji & co. or slice of life-esque drama, all of which are irrelevant to the plot. It distracts from the things that make the show interesting, to the point of being boring.\r\nIt doesn't help that there are entire arcs of the show that move at a snail's pace, with episodes of buildup leading to each confrontation. Rather than creating suspense, it losesit. Plus, the villains are forgettable and their motives can be far-fetched. \\n\r\nThe entire third season is just building up to the final battle, where tons of new characters are shoved into the story, forming unnecessary sub plots that pile on top of each other until it's just a giant mess. \\n\r\nShakugan no Shana does have a saving grace though, and it's in the characters. Shana, who first seems to be a typical tsundere, actually sees development through the story. By the time she has formed a true romantic relationship with Yuji, she has grown out of the needless violence and tantrums, and has become a strong, mature heroine. \\n\r\nYuji is neither useless nor overpowered. He begins the story with zero skills, but endures hard work and training in order to grow stronger, rather than being given his powers on a silver platter. He has clear goals of wanting to defend himself so Shana doesn't have to, but instead of always protecting her, they become a dynamic team. \\n\r\nThe minor characters are a bit annoying at first, but as the series progresses, they become an integral (and even enjoyable) part of the cast. Specifically the other Flame Hazes, like Margery and Wilhelmina. Some of the classmates turn out to be great characters too, like Sato. Though, Kazumi, the third point to a love triangle, remains annoying through the entire series.\\n\r\nShakugan no Shana has a decent story, and two wonderful main characters, but it falls short when it comes to execution.",

The anime is overall ok with it's good soundtrack and art, but everything else makes it mediocre. The plot is cliche, the characters have no depth, especially the villains. One thing in my opinion that can destroy an anime's reputation is the protagonist. In this anime we have a wimpy protagonist, who occasionally learns to get better at controlling his powers ( again cliche). The characters are just not likable, except for shana because sheis somewhat of a badass, kinda... My point is... You already know what's goin to happen after the first few episodes, and then I don't know why they decided to even have 3 seasons! I u have nothing to do an just want to waiste ur time on boring cliche junk then u go ahead and watch those three seasons. Their only attempt at making it interesting was deciding to put a twist on the third seasons by making the wimp protagonist into a villain. No you no what I meant when I said even the villains don't have any depth... Honestly... Knowing how much of a wimp the protagonist was, I didn't even want to think about him being a villain... I dropped this anime in the third season because of that... I really felt like I waisted my time...",

            "content": "Shakugan no Shana, or \"Shana of the Burning Eyes\" is an anime within itself to be enjoyed. The story takes the idea of afterlife and brings forth new meaning to it. I have always enjoyed rinne, or spirited away animes. So this was a treat to find that it didn't try to be something that was out there now that has been overdone. \r\nThe story starts off with Yuji Sakai, a young teenager, who finds that the world he lives in is not the world he thought it was. The spirit within him had died a long time ago, and he is now a \"Torch\".He meets a young girl, who calls herself a \"Flame Haze\", and soon learns that she destroys \"Denizens\" who merge into the world within what is called an \"Unrestricted Method\" to steal the Power of Existence from humans, or living Torches. Throughout the story, Shana meets many Denizens who try to invade the world around Yuji, and soon Yuji learns some things about himself that change the way he perceives the world.\\n\\n\r\nShana is a great character, for she has her ups and downs. She is still trying to learn things within herself, emotions she doesn't fully understand, because she's been trained to fight Denizens from a young age. In one of her past story episodes, we learn that the young Flame Haze had no name until she met Yuji -- a friendship that changes her forever.\\n\\n\r\nI was so intrigued with this anime because of two things: 1.) the animation. The textures of the characters were so gorgeous, and Shana's Flame Haze state really made me love the embers surrounding her. Every detail is put into a character, and it made me really thankful to see first hand how delicious foods looked, how items looked great like utensils. Little intricate details that made this anime stand out really took me by surprise.\\n\\n\r\n2.) the soundtrack. Battle themes were amazing, so much that they made me feel like the situation was intense and filled with emotion. Opening and ending themes were done by KOTOKO and Mami Kawada respectfully. I was so intrigued I listened to them each time, never wanting to skip. Battle music was climactic, and set the tone. Little gentle tones were for emotional and happier situations.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really loved most about the series is the character development that takes place within Shana's personality. She changes so much through the series, and her relationship with Yuji changes from slave work to a full on crush and realization that he may mean more to her than she gives credit for. Especially when Kazumi Yoshida comes into the picture.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I did not expect was to like Kazumi Yoshida. Once her character enters, you are feeling rivalry between Shana and Kazumi. Over time, this relationship changes to be more trusting. (Especially in Season Two -- but that's another review entirely, which I will point out then ^_^)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ending finale of this season really was worthwhile. The series gave me fulfillment, and made me realize that the anime I neglected to watch years ago was better than I first imagined.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an anime that is about afterlife, spirits, and romance with shoujo slice of life, then Shakugan no Shana is for you.",

            "content": "Story: 7. When you're at a restaurant and you can't decide whether to get the beef brisket or the roast chicken, what do you do? You get the combo platter. The action-romance genre is that combo platter. You get some action and some romance but overall a little less of each than a pure action or pure romance anime. Shakugan no Shana fits this hybrid description and I think this combination has its share of pros and cons. \r\nShakugan no Shana's story is interesting but not super unique.\r\nAction side: Basically you have a kick ass fighting girl (Shana) who's lacking in the emotional department meetsan ordinary, naive boy (Yuji) who's thrust into a world of magic and monsters. \\n\r\nRomance side: There's a lot of high school drama and a love triangle that spans all three series. \\n\r\nI rated this an 8 because of the action. I thought some of the fight sequences were pretty cool and honestly, I don't need a revolutionary plot to be entertained. The format isn't really monster of the week (which I like) and most of the fights deal with bad guys that last 2-3 episodes and connect to an overarching evil organization. This gives some subtle continuity between episodes which I think is helpful in the context of a romantic anime. If I have a complaint with this anime it's that the romance is frustratingly paced and the love triangle is pretty silly. I'll discuss it more in the characters section but I think they should have done away with the 3rd wheel altogether and just extended Shana's coldness toward yuji. The way the love triangle is set up it just makes Yuji look silly, the 3rd wheel feel like a hollow plot device and the whole story feel a little fluffy.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9: I really liked the animation. The characters are drawn very well and the explosions/energy effects are amazing. Most fights take place inside a \"Seal\" which is essentially a red-colored stasis field. I think it gives the fight sequences an eerie feel.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: Fine\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Shana kicks ass. She's the center piece of the anime and holds everything together. If it was just her I would give the character section a 10/10 but unfortunately other characters drag it down. My complaint come down to the author's choice of setting up a love triangle for suspense rather than going with pure tsundere. The series focuses so  much on Shana that making her compete with another girl who has virtually no back story (Yoshida) is just silly. It makes Yuji look like a dumbass too. The net effect slows the character development down considerably, as Shana/Yuji's near death adventures get swept under the rug when morning classes start and Yuji becomes captivated by Yoshida's sandwiches. I like some of the other side characters they introduce but I feel like they aren't developed enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overal; 7: I think it's critical to go into an anime with the right expectations. If you are looking for a dark, twisted anime to keep you in suspense and rip your heart out at the end then this may not be the right anime for you. Likewise if you want something that's super action packed or super lovey dovey then this may not be a good choice. I liked the finished product because I think the action-romance combo is great, hard to find and really hard to do well. That being said, I think it could have been done a little better in some places.\\n\\n\\n\r\nViolence/Gore: Pretty decent action scenes. Not too much gore but lots of mass destruction.\\n\r\nRomance/Love: slow and frustrating at times. I didn't think this angle was the strongest part of the series\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: none",

He named her Shana.\r\nNot long after he enters high school, Sakai Yuji\u2019s normal days come to an end. He sees something bizarre on his way home: people are frozen in a strange fire, and a monster that looks like a large doll is attacking them. Just when he's about to be killed, a girl in a dark cloak wielding a large sword appears, and slices the monster in half. Although Yuji survives the strange encounter, the girl informs him ofa desolate truth: \" 'You' don't exist anymore.\"\\n\\n\r\nShe calls herself a Flame Haze who hunts \"Guze no Tomogara\"; intruders from another world. She explains to him that he is a \"Torch\", a substitute of Yuji whose \u201cexistence\u201d has already been devoured. She also told him that he is a special Torch, \"Mystes\", which contains a precious item in it. When he looks at his chest, he sees within himself a faint flame, just as she said.\\n\\n\r\nIt is in this way that his eternal struggle alongside the girl begins.",

            "content": "Yuuji Sakai thinks he is just a normal high school student until he finds out the truth; that the world has been deceived from the truth and that he is only a \u201cTorch\u201d. On his way home one day, time suddenly stopped. Shocked, confused and with no time to figure out what the heck was going on, Yuuji is attacked by a demon. Before the demon can actually do him damage, a young girl dressed in black, wielding a sword appears in front of him, slaying the demon. She tells him she is a \u201cFlame Haze\u201d and he is a \u201cTorch\u201d and that her jobis to stop the \u201cDenizens\u201d and any \u201cRinne\u201d they send from stealing human existence and upsetting the balance in the world.\\n\\n\r\nMy thoughts:\\n\r\nI very much enjoyed watching this anime. I love Shana and how she always says \u201cshut up\u201d 3 times. I had a little trouble liking Yuuji at first. He seemed to be in a daze a lot, confused and not able to understand what was happening. But as I watched the episodes, he grew on me. I did like the way the anime slowly gave Shana more emotion. And like all teenagers in anime or real life, these emotions confused and distracted her from her role as a Flame Haze. If the action of Shakugan no Shana doesn't pull you in, the drama will. It\u2019s an anime worth watching.",
