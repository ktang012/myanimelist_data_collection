            "content": "Is it possible to like something that is completely unoriginal?  According to Nisekoi, yes, it is.\r\nWhen Nisekoi was slated for an anime production by studio Shaft, the fans of the manga were torn between elation that it was actually being adapted and complete terror that Shaft would be doing it. If you\u2019re not aware with the common stereotypes of anime studios, a frank description of Shaft would be, \u201cThey do whatever they want.\u201d  Shaft has never been shy of putting their own... unique spin on their adaptions.  And, hey, whatta ya know, it actually works.\r\nThe Shaft visuals are capable of turning afew heads, but they\u2019re never overpowering as they are in many of their other shows, and the story and setting have an inexplicable charm to them despite the fact that literally every character and literally every situation has been done before.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nThe story of Nisekoi is not one of its strong points.  I don't think anybody but the most diehard fans would even bother offering any sort of rebuttal here.  It plays on almost every clich\u00e9 in the book, from the childhood promise, to the fated encounter, to the downright absurd misunderstandings, even to the freaking beach episode, that I can\u2019t help but think that this is all some elaborate parody of the harem genre.  If it is, then the author did a damn good job because it certainly feels like one.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something believable, you won't find anything of the sort here.  I realize that this is fiction, but there is a line up to where I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and Nisekoi clearly crosses it.   I understand that we don't remember that much from our childhood, but do you really expect me to believe that a person would completely forget nearly every friend he had\u2014not just their faces and names, but their actual existence?  Is this where the \u201cmain character gets amnesia from an injury\u201d clich\u00e9 comes in?\\n\\n\r\nI know every harem can get a little ridiculous, and I'm going to criticize it every time.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 9/10\\n\r\nTypically there's not a whole lot of action going on in high school romantic comedies and harems, so the \u201cArt & Animation\u201d category is really just an \u201cArt & Waifus\u201d rating.  Are the girls waifu material?  (Alternatively, are the boys husbando material?)  If so, 10/10, anime of the year, etc.  Jokes aside, it's true that there really isn't much to say other than the art is pleasant.  Everything is just solid and complement the scenes well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I think this section deserves more discussion however simply due to the fact that Shaft is at work.  As I've stated, many fans of the manga were worried that Shaft would take their style too far and that it would detract heavily from the source material, which many believe to be too inherently \u201cnormal\u201d to be deflowered by Shaft's hands, but fortunately that was not the case here.  Sure, you've got Shinbo's signature camera angles and a few strangely elaborate backgrounds (and some intentionally simple ones), but these don't define the show as they might have in Bakemonogatari or Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi is a Shaft show, sure, but it is not definitively so, which comes as a great relief to many, I'd imagine.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe voices are perfect.  That's all that needs to be said.  There was not a single voice that didn't fit a character to the tee.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is neither great nor distracting.  To be honest, I can't really pick out more than one song that I'd actually remember being played, and I usually am a huge fan of background music and pay a lot of attention to it.  It all sort of blended in, and I'm frankly not sure whether that's a good or bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nMy only genuine complaint is that the opening and ending songs are just so generic.  Though, now that I think about it, maybe that was the whole point.  Regardless, I didn't really find myself liking any of them.  ClariS didn't really try to make their tracks stand out from any of their others, and some harsher critics might say that none of theirs are ever original-sounding.  As for the character songs: it's always nice to hear the characters sing, but the songs just weren't that great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nIf the story is clich\u00e9 and generic, could it be possible that the characters rise to the occasion and present themselves as deep, fleshed out vessels complete with compelling motivations and relatable desires and realistic decisions? \\n\\n\r\nNope.\\n\\n\r\nThe tsundere main girl?  Check.  The \u201cgood girl\u201d (a.k.a. the Yamato nadeshiko)?  Check. The perverted best friend that gets his ass handed to him every episode?  Check.  There is literally no character that isn't a practically a carbon copy of a past character or at the very least a blending of two.  On top of that, the main characters are dense as dense can be, which makes it so easy for the ridiculous misunderstandings to manifest.\\n\\n\r\nSo why would I give this an acceptable score of 7/10?  See the next section.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nAll of my complaining might actually convince someone that I dislike this anime because of how generic it is.  On the contrary; I find all of the enjoyment in reveling in just how clich\u00e9 nearly every moment is.  If you've seen even 2 or 3 harems (and I've probably seen dozens), you can call out just about everything that is going to happen in each episode and in each scene.  It's that predictable.  Yet, there is an inexplicable charm which pervades the series.  Yes, I was literally facepalming at nearly every scene in the show, but underneath that palm was a gigantic smile that I just couldn't hold back.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nNisekoi is not a groundbreaking anime by any means, but if it has proven one thing, it\u2019s that originality is extremely overrated. All you need is a little charm, solid execution, and, of course, waifus. There's a reason that this story and these characters have been done before, and that's because they're enjoyable.  Perhaps some of us are just in denial.\\n\\n\r\nHere's for the inevitable season 2.",

            "content": "It is a delightment to be able to write a review for Nisekoi, though the anime was not perfect, it has provided me with significant entertainment during the last few months. Even if my review may seem negative, it is just because I am analyzing an anime by parts and category. As a whole, I thoroughly enjoyed Nisekoi.\r\nStory: (30%)\r\nThe plot of Nisekoi is rather mediocre. With a redundant premise, Nisekoi has nothing new to contribute to the rom-com genre. The creativity of the story and its complexity is minimal at best, non-existent at least. Do no expect to be blown away by the story line,in fact, the plot will leave you wanting in most of the episodes. There are the standardized anime episodes such the festival, the school play, and the beach episodes. None of them adds anything unique to the template, it is just a repetition from what we have traditionally seen. \\n\\n\r\nIt is not as if the premise is weak, though not original, the premise of a MC looking for the girl of his past to open his locket has potentiality for a lot of complexity and twist. This, however, was not done in Nisekoi, and of course this is not directly the anime's fault but rather a representation of the manga. Even when the chance for legit development appeared, the event was squandered by a random, indescribable, improbable set of circumstances. An example would be a girl sitting next to her crush, with her gathering up all the courage to tell her crush that she wants to kiss him....and  actually does say it!! Then it turns out that the guy fell asleep seconds before her confession, and wakes up seconds after the end of statement. One event like this may fly past the radar, but the agglomeration of these types of events prevents anyone from taking the plot and story line of this anime seriously.\\n\\n\r\nEven a young child would face-palm at the irritable progression of the plot. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: (90%)\\n\\n\r\n I did not feel like an episode was lacking in art. Sure, there were some frames that were reused, and the animation wasn't super fluid every scene, but overall the art was good. Since Shaft produced Nisekoi, there is a lot of similarity between this anime's art and previous anime of theirs. I didn't even know Shaft produced this before watching the anime, but a few seconds into the first episode, I could just tell. \\n\\n\r\nIt wouldn't be true that the art style is done better in Nisekoi than in other of Shaft's works, but it was a great fit for Nisekoi. I enjoyed the close ups, the quick glances, and the over dramatization of emotions. I'm really into experiencing the story, and this art style especially focuses on characters more than background. I think this can be weird to some at first, but it really brings the point home that its' the characters that one should be paying attention to the most. Nisekoi did a great job in making the character design shine. I can vividly recall scenes where I felt enamored by some of female design and how they fit. Nisekoi did a great job of letting us see them THROUGH the eyes of  Raku.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: (100%)\\n\\n\r\nMarvelous soundtrack. Soundtracks can make or break a scene, and in Nisekoi, every scene was amply elevated by its choice of bgm. I'm highly receptive to visual and auditory stimulants, so I found myself captivated by a lot of events ,that were poor plot wise, but were done so beautifully that it captured my attention away from the plot but into the art, and even emotions of the characters involved. I think that this is the telos of any soundtrack, to make scenes even more riveting that it would have been otherwise. Excellent soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (80%)\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of Nisekoi may not be its storyline or plot complexity, but instead lies within its characters. Nisekoi has the ability to make all of its characters likable, and this is a very RARE element to have. At the end of the anime, I didn't find myself hating any characters. I do have my preference of who I would like Raku to be with, but this is more of my own personal taste than any loathing that I feel for the rest of the female cast. Of course, this may be due to the lack of complexity of the story, and the author playing it safe with everyone, but there have been anime done with poor plot progression along with horrible and unlikable characters. Nisekoi should applauded for its characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Raku, at first glance seems to be our typical dense lead. He's an average looking person with no particular exceeding talent( maybe besides cooking, but this wasn't developed). He seems to be average in school, his attitude is average of someone of his type, and his character design is slightly different. He has the will to protect his friends, but to be utterly oblivious to obvious signs. He also seems to have the ability to fall asleep in matter of mini seconds, and to wake up just as fast. His redeeming point is that when Raku WANTS to, he can be astute in his observation. There are monologues of his where if given more time, and more info, he would have cracked this mystery surrounding him. Raku is not a stupid generic character, he does have a girl that he is mainly interested in. He acts according to this preference, but again due to poor plot, none of these actions are actualized into substantive events. This is more of a plot issue than a character issue. \\n\\n\\n\r\nChitoge, the blonde bombshell, is the eccentric vivacious main girl. She's loud and obnoxious, and can be unreasonable at times. However, she also have her redeeming qualities. She grew up without having too many friends, and she longs for sisterly companionship. On the inside, she is a compassionate person, that probably has had to put on up a tough mask due to the teasing done to her back in America. It is surprising that she is a strong student considering the shortcomings of the educational system of the U.S, but that is besides the point. If given enough time, Chitoge does become lovely and likable in her own way. \\n\\n\r\nKosaki Onodera seems to correlate with the cute nice shy template. She's not as vivacious as Chitoge, and is too timid to assert herself in the middle of a big crowd. This is not to say that Onodera is complacent, she has willed herself to reveal her feelings numerous times, but again due to improbable and reaching circumstances, these confessions have fell to deaf ears. This is not a character flaw of Onodera, but again a shortcoming of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe remaining cast , in my opinion, just serves to spice up the dynamic between the three characters mentioned above. Tsugumi is a personal favorite of mine, but she doesn't bring any relevance to the plot except for minor details. Maiko is invisible and obscure, besides his sexual tangents, he just brings slight humor. Marika makes a late appearance, however, the appearance is so late that it makes it hard to emphasize with her. Ruri is funny and spices the plot in a good way, but her will cannot beat the incomprehensible twist of Nisekoi. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  (100%)\\n\\n\r\nWith Nisekoi, the parts doesn't equal the whole. There were a lot of details that left me wanting in the first season of Nisekoi, but overall, the anime was quite intriguing and enjoyable. The art and sound compliments each other so well, the characters have an excellent dynamic to leave you laughing and caring for them. There is fan service, but is tastefully done relative to other anime of the same genre. \\n\\n\r\nI do recommend this anime to anyone looking for a strong romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: (90%) With this anime, the categories does not hold the same weight. I am eagerly waiting for a second season.\\n",

            "content": "Childhood memories, a gorilla girl, and Shaft. What do you get when you mix all three together? Nisekoi, or rather False Love by what\u2019s known based on the manga of the same name written by Naoshi Komi. For what\u2019s worth, the title is exactly as it implies \u2013 a love based on illusions. But in a way, it\u2019s not exactly what you think. The main male protagonist Raku isn\u2019t after Chitoge, the girl that accidentally kneed him in the morning during his walk to school. Rather, they are bound together in a seemingly contract-esque direction. With the two rival gangs making a truce in theexchange that their children would be a couple, Nisekoi is a show that crafts love with everything that is fake. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of a fake relationship is nothing new in the anime world. Taking a closer look, their relationship has little chemistry in it, at first anyways. Raku and Chitoge aren\u2019t compatible and neither can they stand each other. But nonetheless, they are forced to become a couple or otherwise risk all hell break loose between the two blood thirsty families. Yet, the show does complicate their relationship by introducing all type of challenges. On the innocent side, we have Raku who has a puppy love crush on his classmate, Onodera. Yet unknown to him, we can easily tell that she also shares similar feelings. But what she doesn\u2019t know is where Raku\u2019s true origins lie, and that is with Yuzuka ancestry for the majority of the show. Coming together as a whole, Nisekoi engineers its plot points with multiple angles. There\u2019s a silly outlook on Raku and Chitoge\u2019s relationship as they are constantly trying to avoid their secret being found out. They even avoid each other at times. At the same time, there\u2019s a curious degree coming out of their interactions. The story develops both characters through their interactions with a seemingly genuine commitment. While both partners seems to dislike each other at first, they show their warmer sides on occasions. Furthermore, complicated situations are solved by both of them in elaborate ways. It may be clich\u00e9 but has a stylish way to the whole trope.\\n\\n\r\nOne other flagship of the story involves a mysterious locket that Raku wears. Or maybe I should correct that and say..used to wear. That\u2019s because he loses it when Chitoge accidentally knees him in the face during one faithful morning. Despite being executed as clich\u00e9 with the whole \u2018running in the morning with a bread in the mouth\u2019 concept, it does set up a driving factor for Raku. He is motivated to find the locket not just because it\u2019s something he treasures but also for a promise involving a girl in his past. The show continuously focuses on this point with its various flashbacks dealing with Raku and his present self. What the show does right here is through its various focal points with a number of candidates who can be the true potential key bearer. This brings about a mystery that fans may be anticipating themselves for when the true bearer is finally revealed. But what it doesn\u2019t illustrate correctly is the purpose, as to why Raku made that promise. It will feel like an arduous trip at times with all the misunderstandings and parts when the mystery becomes so close being solved, yet then seemingly goes back to square one. The show also neglects to reveal its secret with its 2 cour run. In fact, some of the episodes feels fillerish that seemingly focuses another daily life of Raku, as the son from an yakuza.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter directional wise, the show offers a diversity with its cast. And of course, it\u2019s a harem show so expect most of the main characters to be the opposite sex of Raku with a keen interest in him. Love triangles are imminent with characters such as Onodera, Tsugumi, and Marika. They do have different personalities but doesn\u2019t escape the usual gags as seen in harem series. It\u2019s a formulaic throwback with the way the characters progression for most of them. But even as feelings deepen, we don\u2019t see much change in Raku. The only eyes he seemingly have for throughout the series is Onodera and the two often find themselves in awkward situations thanks to a girl named Ruri. It doesn\u2019t help by the fact that his classmate Shu plays almost a partner in crime with the schemes. Other characters often play roles with the misunderstandings and slight progress between our fake couple. But most times, Raku is dense as a rock and his characterization is frozen stone cold.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a staggering predictability for fans that might have been thought up in the beginning. That would be the realization of perhaps a \u2018false\u2019 love becoming perhaps, real. In fact, the developing aspects of Raku and Chitoge is a prominent feature. Despite disliking each other for their circumstances, Raku shows Chitoge genuine kindness and offers her help when she needs it the most. This in return causes Chitoge to question her own feelings. Tossing the clich\u00e9 aside, there is actual development between the duo and furthermore ties together the plot involving the locket. Unfortunately, there is no escape of the jealousy, tsundere reactions, and blander misunderstandings you\u2019ll see in typical harem shows. For what\u2019s worth, Nisekoi demonstrates this in a more violent way with the way the premise is set up. The \u2018transfer student\u2019 gag is still there but has a more edgy taste to it. It\u2019s presented as intentionally silly with nickname calling such as Chitoge being labeled as the \u201cgorilla woman\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nA noticeable census coming with Nisekoi is the way director Akiyuki Shinobo pinpoints the various scenes of this show. The romantic comedy side is obviously presented but he shapes it in a way that is unorthodox. It\u2019s the way the character shifts their heads, the star shape coloring during weird scenes, and recreational subsidies of parodies in the backgrounds during more climatically crafted scenes. Having previously worked on shows such as Bakemonogatari, Arakawa Under the Bridge, and Puella Magi Madoka Magica, it\u2019s easy to tell his innovative ideas here. This can come as a mixed bag as not all fans appreciate this stylish coordination. Given the fact that the show is a romantic comedy also might stir up some mixed reactions. But nonetheless, it can be distracting yet feels creative. \\n\\n\r\nAs a romantic comedy, the other half comes with the fun and laughter. Given the direction of Nisekoi, the show tries its comedy in a variety of ways. With Shaft being the brainchild, expect colorful gags, avant-garde, and a bit of hyperactivity with each episode. Then, there\u2019s the misunderstandings that will draw out both laughs and frustrations with its repetitiveness. The mastermind is usually Ruri that becomes involved since Raku is too shy to make his own move on most occasions. The dialogues can also feel cheesy with the trollish moments the various characters tries to induce.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork should be labeled as unique, not different but a specialty. Shaft handles the production and it\u2019s fairly easy to spot its artistic gags. The head tilts, background cinematic, and even character designs have an innovative way for this rom-com. But for what\u2019s worth, there\u2019s nothing really that stands out with the way Raku looks. As the main male protagonist, he looks just like the average high school student. But for Chitoge, she comes off as a beauty with foreign blood pumping in her veins along with that scarlet ribbon. Then, there\u2019s also Onodera with her cute innocence that serves more as the antithesis of Chitoge. Other characters\u2019 designs also defines their personalities from the surface with their words and actions. In particular, Marika and Onodera are designed with innocent beauty and elegance. Some of the trollish expressions and scenes are also decorated with silliness. But as usual for most harem series, you should expect bits of fan service with the classic onsen and beach episodes. Bring out the fun in the sun, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is noticeable but also feels silly. By silly, it\u2019s exaggerated sometimes with its amateurish tone along with its goofy coordination. But despite this, it mixes with well with comical scenes, which most of the time is as result of a domino effect. Sound director Toshiki Kameyama, known for directing numerous shows of different genres performs the overall OST with balance. Similarly, the OP and ED songs are made well with strengths in its tones. On the other hand, character voices can come off sometimes as irritating in particular with Raku and his stubbornness. The bitter chatter between him and Chitoge will feel repetitive as if they are a married couple already. On the other hand, Onodera\u2019s voice can be sweet thanks to Kana Hanazawa and her performance with more innocent characters. It counterbalances the Yakuza theme with the gangs and trifling violence going on. Marika\u2019s kansai accent can also raise a few eyebrows during climatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi is a show that is hard to fully appreciate. This is probably because of the premise and what fans may expect. And you\u2019re not wrong either because it has the harem gags, fan service bits, and non-sensational dialogues that are easily forgettable. Yet, it does have a plot, one that invites questions and theories. With its small cast of characters, they also become actors and actresses in the story with each of their role holding some meaning. At the same time, the colorful Shaft style will be something that will be memorable. Put yourself into Raku\u2019s shoes and the image will come more clearly. It\u2019s not easy living a life with a yakuza background you know.\\n",

            "content": "[WARNING: Slightly long review ahead. You can get by by reading the \"In short\" sections]\r\nI was not interested in this show. The manga was the epitome of \"Generic Harem.\" I don't think there isn't one cliche that hasn't happened in the series yet. From the characters' reactions to the actual settings of events, everything gave me a sense of Deja vu on the scale of the Endless Eight (only 2000s kids would get this reference!). So I anticipated this adaptation to bring exactly nothing new. It would be another bland series to add to every season's list of bland Harem Anime.\r\nBut then something happened. Ifyou head over to the Nisekoi Anime announcement news article (you can find it here on MAL), you would discover that it began with soft squeals of excitement and nearly uniform cheers by manga fans. As you scrolled along, you would find a chorus-like echo of horror at the studio choice: Shaft. Looking at the thread might even feel like discovering the death of a civilization. IT felt almost as if I were looking at an ancient species discovering a cure to some disease, only to find that very cure would end their entire race.\\n\\n\r\nBut even then, I wasn't interested in this series. After chapter 60 of the manga (when my marathon ended), it felt like a slowly eroding cluster of repetition of cliches and never progressing plot. It wasn't until a whole year after it began did I start watching it. I finished it in two, no, three days after downloading from Nyaa.\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi, despite all of its cliches, is probably the best Harem series in recent years. It is also probably the purest example of the Harem genre. Should harem series ever go out of fashion and end in production, this should be the one harem series to show your grand kids what a \"Harem\" Anime was (I'm sure by then Japan's population will explode to overtake China's).\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a paradox. Its strength is the sheer attention the creators paid to subtle details. Even if you didn't like the manga, you might still find this series enjoyable. And if you haven't been keen on Harem series before, this could be your gateway series.\\n\\n\r\nlet's examine the aspects of the series and whether you will enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nUndoubtedly the most important aspect of a Harem Anime is its cast. And you know the show has done it well when it's know as \"Battle of the Best Girls\" among the online community.\\n\r\nThe character of this series are generic in a sense of the word. All of them are \"Tsunderes\" in various doses of \"Tsun.\" \\n\r\nHowever, there's clear character progression and backstory giving. This is most prominently seen in Chitoge, whose changes in behavior is most apparent. From her discovery of her connection to the main character to her treatment of the main character, all are subtly altered as events unfold. \\n\r\nWhile they can all be labeled with a name from TvTropes, the other characters are no slouches either. \\n\r\nMarika, Tsugumi, and Onodera each have their own respective charm and characterizations. \\n\r\nUnlike most harem series, the characters were clearly not a mash of cliches and actually felt like they EXISTED.\\n\r\nEven the main character, who can be wrote off as the typical \"indecisive and dense male tsundere,\" has his own characterization. His motivations and actions are consistent with his initial personality, and he has enough \"tsun\" to not come off as a bitch (granted, some views might still experience frustrations with him).\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest touch in characterizing the cast is the addition of monologues when they think about something. When their hands touch, when the MC gets horny, they're all given reasons and detailed descriptions on why the character feels that way (which is strengthened by the visuals).\\n\r\nAlso, the girls are often depicted as Moe. The Studio avoided flaunting their bodies and turning show into another Harem-ecchi show where \"characters\" are poor excuses to show off the body designs (they know their audience!).\\n\\n\r\nIn short: the attention to detail, as well as balance of screen time between the girls give the cast vivid characterization(and not to mention more significant side characters compared to the spiritual predecessors).\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Story/Whatever:\\n\r\nHaving a mandatory \"story\" rating is probably the rating system's greatest flaw. The story of Nisekoi is not epic. It's not something that you'd expect to find on Gurren Lagann's level. However, not emphasizing on the \"plot\" is its exact strength.\\n\r\nWith modern Anime often taking the form of 1 cour short series (to lower cost), time is often squeezed. Sometimes, this is worsened by the existence of other sub-plots that don't necessarily help characterize.\\n\r\nEven worse is when producers choose to forgo characterization and instead stuff a bundle of cliches into character, taking up more time and reducing the quality of characterization.\\n\r\nThankfully, Nisekoi has no such problem.\\n\r\nIt's story is simple: Raku Ichijou, the protagonist, made a vague promise with a girl 10 years ago in which they promise to fulfill when the meet. They would verify each other's identities with a locket that Raku keeps, and a key the the girl keeps.\\n\r\nAs a subplot, powerful family members (mobs, police, etc) of the girls are kept in check by Raku having a precarious balance of relationship with all of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nThat was the synopsis, but how did they handle the story? The show never takes its subplot too seriously. The story focuses on Raku and the mystery from 10 years ago with the family problems occasionally pushing the characters to interact. The subplot, however, is never taken \"on a bus.\" It's always there, never too neglected nor too concentrated on. The side characters are given screen time to a certain extent, never to the point where we forget that they exist. They add a wonderful touch. \\n\\n\r\nIn short: The handling of the story is pretty much spot on.  It is used to advance the character interaction and never too central as to detract character growth, but also never taken for granted. Events flew smoothly and felt as if they were REAL.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAudio:\\n\r\nProbably the weakest department, yet still well matched to the series. There's no specific style that can be heard from the BGM. Everything felt like they fit the scene and made them better experiences.\\n\r\nThe OPs are sang by ClariS. I didn't feel too moved by them. The tunes and themes sounded about the same as many other Anime OPs. \\n\r\nVery cheerful, harmonious sounds that borders boring (each to his own, you might like them).\\n\r\nHowever, I have to add that is an ending theme song for each of the girls, so that's something to enjoy.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was perfect, spot on. Every character sounded exactly as I imagined them to sound. Chitoge with her bossy, slightly cheerful voice. Onodera voiced by KanaHana. Claude's authoritative, maniacal voice, and so on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals:\\n\r\nProbably the greatest concern for many manga fans. Famous from their Monogatari and Madoka Magicias series\u2019, Shaft is known for their unique depictions of the series' world. Many feared (especially with the train wreck of Mekakucity Actors) that Shaft would render Nisekoi's world into unrecognizable Pseudo-spaces.\\n\r\nBoy were they wrong.\\n\r\nWhile the now-iconic Shaft \u201cSpin around to do an action\u201d and head tilt are still there, Nisekoi is a far cry from Nisekoi-monogatari. I would say this is probably the greatest improvement the manga has had (the manga\u2019s backgrounds, from what I remember, might as well as have been drawn by Tite Kubo). \\n\r\nThe characters are animated fluidly. The motions sprinkled in by Shaft do nothing to detract the series. Far from it, the exaggerated nature of the source\u2019s plotline (gangsters stop fighting thanks to teenage dating) actually made Shaft\u2019s liberal interpretations appropriate. Tsugumi\u2019s chase scenes are animated with multitudes of guns, a feat that melts into the world of Nisekoi\u2019s surreal world of spins and tilts. Zoom-ins are appropriate, with barely any ecchi (or so it felt) and a lot of focus on character expression. The irrelevant background characters, deservedly, are at times animated as gray blocks similar to Durarara and Mawaru Penguindrum. And the backgrounds are EXTRAVAGANT. I\u2019m talking about 1920s Gatsby-style parties extravagance here. Though this is oddly appropriate due to the nature of the girls (Ojou-samas and generally influential girls). If not extravagant, the backgrounds are detailed and suit the theme. Everythign was beautiful, essentially, and much better compared to the manga.\\n\r\nCharacters are sometimes animated in chibi style, amplifying their moe-ness and comical relief factor.\\n\r\nMany of the backgrounds (such as the forest) are drawn with detail. Shaft certainly didn't cheap out on their background.\\n\\n\r\nIn short: All of these touches made Nisekoi\u2019s world (as much as I hate this word) unforgettable. it stands far and above many other Harem series in atmosphere due to the willingness to be exaggerate the world boldly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLast Words:\\n\r\nWith a consistent and well characterized cast, as well as vivid yet realistic depiction of the world, good enough sound (great voice acting), and a story that recognizes its strengths and but never mistreated, Shaft\u2019s Nisekoi adaptation paints a surreal world that\u2019s grounded in reality by character interaction. It is surely the standard bearer for Harem Anime to come. If they come at all (hint, look at next season\u2019s list).\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I think it\u2019s time for me to hit the bookshelves and download some chapters of Nisekoi.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: After I started to read the manga, I remembered that after the 50 chapters or so, the manga regresses and turns into something close to a CSI TV show: plotless, digestable, short, weekly chapters. For a WHILE. Just saying, the first portion of the manga IS the Anime, but the successive portions are very different. Hopefully it gets better.",

            "content": "It is that time of the season again. Where that legendary anime studio, that every anime fan and their mother knows the name of, Shaft, comes with another adaptation where they put their own technical chops into. Regardless of whatever manga or light novel they want to adapt, especially when Akiyuki Shinbo is head of production, they always want to shift their own spin on it to make it their own unique vision. The results are either really good or very mediocre. Thankfully with Shaft\u2019s recent show, Nisekoi, it is one of those on their filmography that deserves to be on the former side ofthe spectrum.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing really much to criticize or praise about Nisekoi\u2019s plot, under the premise that there\u2019s not much that you could regard as a significant plot. While it isn\u2019t magnificent, the show doesn\u2019t really try to build it up as anything but silly and frivolous in its storytelling, which leads into its comedic writing. Even when Nisekoi tries to be serious and heartwarming, it still has an edge where it comes across as pandering silliness to it to, to the point where it comes off almost as parody. What does save the show from being terrible from this angle is the comedic writing being very spot-on and sharp in its dialogue, and how the show presents it in its pacing. Shaft\u2019s idea of comedy come from Shinbo\u2019s great direction, with his recognizable camera angles and his obsession with putting it directly at a character\u2019s face whenever a significant comedic moment happens. The comedic timing has a great hook to it as well. With the experimental editing, it makes the comedic timing and its pacing stand out very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nDirectly in-conjunction with the comedy in what makes Nisekoi appealing to watch is the characters. All are very diverse in their personalities, based on their own archetype that they fill in for the plot. Right away, you can clearly see how these roles seem very similar in tropes; the loud-mouthed tsundere, the long-time childhood friend who has a crush on the protagonist, the protagonist\u2019s perverted friend and so on. Like I said before, the self-parodied way Shaft implements its comedy doesn\u2019t necessarily put down the characters from having these cliched tropes, with the exception of the perverted friend who doesn\u2019t leave much of an impression. Most of them still have enormous charm and charisma to their personalities, which make them worthwhile to laugh out loud towards. What does make a harem cast extremely well done is the fact that you find all of the characters likable, and in that respect, you wouldn\u2019t mind whoever the protagonist goes out with. I could consider Nisekoi, along with Sora no Otoshimono and Boku wa Tomodachi, to be one of the few that actually fulfills this aspect quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nTo start picking out characters individually, our main protagonist, Ichijou, actually proves to be a likable character in spite what many might point out how he never seems to bat an eye to how certain girls might see him. Chitoge, the beautiful blonde girl and our main heroine, is a ton of fun to see in many hilarious attempts at being entertaining from her charming personality and studious stature, despite being fragile underneath it. Our childhood friend character, Onodera, might seem like the most uninteresting out of the rest at first, but as she grows onto you, she is in no shortage of getting a lot of laughs and cuteness, thanks in part to Kana Hanazawa\u2019s great performance. The tomboy of this lovely harem is named Tsumugi, who has less screen-time than most of the girls. This shouldn\u2019t knock down the significant aura she ushers in Nisekoi, that and I\u2019m a huge sucker for tomboys. Finally we have Marika, the snooty and conniving girl that promised marriage from a childhood oath to our protagonist. Even though I wouldn\u2019t call her out as being kind of dull and overly conniving in too many places, the writers all did a decent job of adding in some twists here and there to make her at least stand out to the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of animation brought by Shaft in Nisekoi is absurd and almost incomprehensible in some places to describe from how they portray certain comedic situations. However, whether it goes through those hilarious situations or not, the animation still has that same spark of creativity that Shaft has been known for since their inception. Their ability to transcend all of the characters\u2019 art designs into deformed designs create a very visceral outlook to the insane amount of wacky humor that is present in Nisekoi. On the technical side of things, there are no obvious signs of corners being cut with the budget that Shaft had to work around with. Characters flow fluidly enough to garner some recognition for the animators who worked hard on making the girls look very cute and funny in motion.\\n\\n\r\nAudio department is in no short of brilliance for Nisekoi, besides the fact that the music is nothing too special from the usual synthesizer instrumentation that you typically hear in most anime shows. Nisekoi gathers some of the best voice actors in the business that all work extremely well together, adding to the characters\u2019 distinctive voices. Kana Hanazawa has definitely redeemed herself after a couple of underwhelming shows these past two seasons by playing the lovable Onodera. Her attempts at being embarrassed are in no short of hilarity and cuteness from her brilliant talent. The recent starlet, Nao Touyama, plays the heroine Chitoge, and she is definitely having a ball with playing her in what can be considered her first tsundere role. Needless to say, she needs to play more in her future career. The last one in the main cast is Kouki Uchiyama, who plays harem protagonists that can be hit or miss, but he actually does a pretty nice job with Ichijou in giving him a nice needed level of sympathy and style to his comedic performance.\\n\\n\r\nObserving the overall basis for Nisekoi will leave people feeling that Nisekoi only adds more on the table of bland romance shows in a harem on the drawing board. The strange truth is that it definitely is, but the show doesn\u2019t try to be what it\u2019s not. It\u2019s proud of being another generic harem show and proudly displays itself out of the rest. That might seem like a strange recommendation at first, but when you have the brilliant team behind Shaft that adds so much layers of depth to the show\u2019s comedy and characters, there are very few things not to like about Nisekoi. This and many other shows that Shaft has made that are similar to Nisekoi are living proof that you can guarantee the talent Shaft has in creating a story that is seemingly done before, but adds fresh twists to it to make it feel exciting enough to sit down and watch it from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "Before you write off my review because of its very low rating I'd appreciate it if you actually read what I have to say first. I'm not about to slate it off for an incomprehensible reason. This is also my first review so I'd appreciate feedback even more. Feel free to disagree with me/point out things I've missed/etc.\r\nIntroduction:\r\nSo, Nisekoi. The anime that left me so badly conflicted I felt compelled to write a review about it. The anime that had me cursing at the screen every five minutes. The anime that had potential and completely failed to live up to it. It's safe to saythat this show left me with a rather bitter taste in my mouth - and for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nStory (1/10):\\n\\n\r\n[potential spoiler alert]\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I want to state about this is that I have absolutely no problem with the premise. You might have considered it your average harem story with zero elements of creativity and nothing new. To be quite honest, I couldn't care less. I enjoy a good romance and I don't completely hate harem shows - so long as they're executed well. Even if it's 'generic', the plot still had potential. The idea behind the key-in-the-lock scenario and the forced relationship I thought was actually a very good one. From the synopsis and the early stages of the show I had high expectations and thought it was going to be a very good show. From there, it all went downhill.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're taking the comedic approach, as this show does, there are times where you need to understand your level of seriousness. This, simply put, doesn't. The example I'll give here one of the times when Kosaki is trying her hardest to convey her feelings to Raku - the one where they get interrupted by that baseball smashing through the window. A scene like that could have been literally perfect. The innocent, shy character gathering up her courage to make her sweet confession. The following reciprocation. How else could you make a scene more golden? It would've even added spice to the plot surrounding his fa\u00e7ade with Chitoge. \\n\\n\r\nYet, the writers proceed to completely ruin it for 'comedic effect'. When that ball smashes through the window it destroys the serious & tense atmosphere completely and contributes to the (supposedly 'funny') running gag where she gets interrupted every time she tries to make her confession. You know, like that one where she kind-of succeeds but Raku is asleep. It's not funny at all. It only served to phenomenally irritate me every time it happened and make me scream \"THIS ISN'T HOW IT WORKS!!\" every so often. Perhaps this might not annoy me as much if she'd actually succeeded in the end - I'd have felt relieved, perhaps. I know there's a second season but by that point the story had already been destroyed beyond redemption. No chance of a comeback there. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're going include elements of seriousness you have to make it work. Nisekoi just tries to be something and fails. You can have serious elements in a comedic/silly show and have them work. This tries to combine the two and suffers horrifically as a result.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of it being destroyed beyond redemption, the next bit I want to talk about is the plot's development & progression. Remember when I said the key-in-the-lock scenario had potential? Yeah, that didn't survive for too long did it? That could have gone places with Chitoge/Kosaki story development. Plot twists, anyone? Instead, it gets stolen right in front of our faces by the mighty Marika Tachibana - who is, in my eyes, the most pointless character ever to exist in anime. She serves no real purpose other than to make Nisekoi a full-on harem when it doesn't actually need to be one. Her, and her involvements, are just large amounts of time wasted. Time that could have been spent writing a better, more progressive plot where things actually happen. \\n\\n\r\nI mean, literally, nothing happens. At all. Time is filled and wasted. Raku, at the end, is practically in the same position as he was in the first couple of episodes - wanting to be with Kosaki but not being able to - just with the addition of a pointless, third character who wants him.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the animation isn't a massive influence on how much a show is likable. In this case it doesn't really matter at all. It is nice to look at though and doesn't feel shabby by any means. \\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nSame thing, really. The music wasn't bad by any means, it just didn't pack any real punch. All the songs were mediocrities. \\n\\n\r\nIf it counts for this section, the voice acting was good as well. Not that I really know any shows with crappy voice acting (excluding dubs).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters were decent, even the secondary ones like Ruri. They were just let down by bad writing. I really liked most of them and it's a shame that this show didn't live up to its potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I have, as mentioned earlier, is with Marika, who is the most unnecessary character ever. The show could've been rewritten without her and become about a hundred times better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10):\\n\\n\r\nYou can't have a good show without a good story. In summary, good characters + a good premise were simply let down by bad writing. The art and music aren't going to make up for an error like that and, as such, lead to a very irritating & disappointing viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't expect the show to be bags of seriousness, it just needed a bit more than it had to do what I thought it should have done. At least incredibly stupid shows don't try to be things they're not.\\n\\n\r\nExtra:\\n\\n\r\nAgain, feel free to disagree with me and thanks for taking the time to read this. I encourage any criticism - it'd help me to write better reviews in the future.\\n",

            "content": "Updated: 13, July 2016\r\nI regret initially writing off Nisekoi as another run-of-the-mill romance-comedy. Though preposterous and frantic at its core, Shaft knew exactly how to exploit the source material using trademark visual and directional cues. The results boast of vivid color and heavenly charm, most evidently in the heat of moments between Raku and Chitoge. Venture beyond the surface of dense personalities and logical fallacies, and what remains to be seen underneath is a love-hate spectacular in its purest state. \r\nTreading back on my mention of density and fallacies, both detriments were loud and clear for much of the run. Ramifications dimmed the lights onwhat could have been a blockbuster showcase between premier rivals. Whenever Chitoge or Kosaki would garner momentum to close in on Raku, the most timely of occurrences or character appearances would quickly separate the participants as a boxing referee would. The supporting members were irrelevant outside of interfering with Raku, Chitoge, or Kosaki, or distracting the audience by means of cheesy punchlines, retorts, and archetypal behaviors. \\n\\n\r\nDivisive components meshed together to form a predictable, cyclic scheme sapping this series of its true potential. Developments were overly reliant on genre stereotypes and misunderstandings. It really is a shame, considering how intimate conversations involving Raku and the main heroines were meaningful, sensible, and even nostalgic in my case. These are all moments that mark a fine reminder to what falling in love should be about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS onward (based on final impressions).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe lock-and-key mystery should have been resolved with more urgency or geared with fascinating implications in the long run. Snapping the key after all that commotion was downright cruel, a wasteful hype charade with little substance or significance. And why keep the clingy and shallow Marika in the dark for so long? Her facile presence lacked sincerity, while her grounds of adhering to events well in the past were baseless.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the cake itself was unsatisfactory, the finale brought its own complimentary spread of flavorful toppings. Tragic for all the wrong reasons, this unconventional spin on a legendary epic fell right into the series\u2019 wheelhouse of comic relief and execution on-the-fly. How sweet it was to watch Raku and Kosaki give the script a second go! The invigorating inclusion really sent this spectacle out with a bang, one that could very well pay dividends in the future.",

            "content": "I'll say it from the get-go that Nisekoi was a highly enjoyable anime to watch and I would recommend it to any anime fans that like shounen comedies and tsundere characters. \r\nNisekoi is about Raku Ichigyou, the son of the head of the Shue-gumi yakuza group, who at 6 years old, met and fell for a girl he now does not remember. The only thing he remembers is that they made a promise to marry each other when they met again, and would identify each other by the locket and key they exchanged. Raku has held onto this locket for 10 years in the hopeof reuniting with her. He currently has a crush on a girl named Onodera, a friend from middle school, and hopes she is the girl he is looking for. His life is turned upside down though when he encounters the pretty but aggressive Chitoge Kirisaki, and though they don't get along, through family circumstances they are forced to act as fake boyfriend and girlfriend. Nisekoi shows this hilarious fake couple as they develop their \"relationship\" in front of their friends and classmates. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nRidiculous, cliche, but utterly HILARIOUS. It is not really unique in any way but man the collaboration of the characters just makes it work so well. It's a \"tale of 2 families\" type story just like Romeo and Juliet (which they cleverly make a reference to) with a lot of twists, turns and love interests. It uses very common storylines; the beach episode, the school trip (and typical ridiculousness that usually happens), the school festival and so on but they are still funny to watch regardless. The story gets an 8/10 mostly because I was not satisfied with the ending but I think this is due to the fact that another season may be coming. If one does come, the score would definitely be bumped up to at least a 9 as there would be a chance for a true ending and resolution between characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely stunning. Such effective use of colour and movement in the animation. CodeProvider (on YouTube) pointed out that even the grass in this anime stood out as beautiful...like come on. You usually don`t hear someone say \"man that`s some sick grass\". The movements are just so fluid it brings a great sense of realism. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe first opening theme is so catchy. It was a real stand out for me. The second opening is pretty nice as well, and ending themes are both alright. But besides that, to be honest I did not notice much in terms of music just because I was so into the story myself, but I guess that is not totally a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters were what made the anime so enjoyable. They had such a great combination of personalities. Raku and Chitoge are absolutely hilarious together. Watching them bicker but watch each other's backs was just an enjoyable experience. Chitoge may tie with Taiga (from Toradora) as my favourite tsundere character, as she is both ruthless and adorable beyond belief. Onodera started off seeming shy and a little boring, but really turned out to be funny and at times pretty aggressive (in terms of love). What I really appreciated was that all Raku's love interests (4 in total...go Raku!!! :P) all had something likable about them, which I find usually isn't the case. My stand-out supporting characters are most definitely Ruri (Onodera's best friend) and Tsugumi (Chitoge's childhood companion) who are funny, smart and just have the best reactions to EVERYTHING. I am hoping for a second season to get further development with all these characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 \\n\r\nYou can already tell that I really enjoyed the series and so there is no need to explain the score given. It's a shounen comedy, so I think it has something for everyone; fan service for the guys, and cute but strong female characters for the independent women out there :P I would recommend if you do watch it, to prepare to read the manga as more than likely you will want to know what happens next. As far as I know, there have been no announcements for a second season but I am eagerly anticipating one. \\n",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of romantic comedies and this anime hit the jackpot for me. This anime is full of cute moments which will keep you intrigued however, i had a tendency to lose interest. I'll start with the story.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nDon't get me wrong, the story is great and keeps your mind predicting what's going to happen next but, it starts to lean away from the whole point of the show. You'll notice that it drags on and some episodes don't even have anything to do with the story, it's just another way for the author to add some 'chummy' moments between the protagonist andone of the girls. If it wasn't for all those cute, romantic moments i would have given it a 8/10. In addition, i finished this anime feeling incomplete so hopefully there's going to be a 2nd season as i don't really like reading manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is so good, but that's probably common for 2014 anime's so I'm not really that blown away. It's as if every 2014 anime now has a 9+/10 art. I like how they emphasize on characters through the simple use of colours. What i mean is that, you would notice that they give insignificant characters in the background a colour/pattern which makes the main characters stand out in contrast.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI liked how the opening was catchy and upbeat which is always nice. Unlike most anime's, with Nisekoi - i watched the whole opening every episode just to appreciate it and increase my morale. There were no soundtracks during the show which actually stood out however, these soundtracks don't really have much of an impact on me. I just think that the opening is key, as it sort of prepares you for what's coming. In addition, the voices are good i didn't notice anything wrong.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nTo be put bluntly, they are very common characters. Almost everyone in this anime is so shy and ignorant. This leaves room for lots of complications. On the other hand, they develop nicely over time as each of them have their own little 'spotlight episode' which allows the viewers to connect with the characters. Due to the common personalities, you feel like you're familiar with them which made it easier to understand them and how they feel.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime gave me butterflies in my stomach due to the amount of lovey-dovey moments there are. You could predict when they were going to happen which was the best part of it. Whenever boredom crossed my mind a wild romantic moment appears! Because of this, i didn't get bored and managed to finish this anime within 2 days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI feel that there was so much potential for this show which is why I'm giving it a 9. But, i made a mistake of judging the rest of the anime based on the first few episodes which got me slightly disappointed. Once i finished it i said to myself \"meh, it was alright\". It's going to be in the top tier on my list though, just not the top.",

            "content": "Nisekoi, or Fake Love, follows a fairly standard romcom template, except done better. \r\nWarning: may have mild spoilers\r\nDisclaimer: did not actually watch 2000 episodes of Nisekoi\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe basis for the story is not exactly generic for a romcom, but isn't extraordinary by any means. A guy meets a girl and immediate hates her after she knees him in the face and they're forced to become a couple lest a gang war breaks out. Throughout the story, a few more characters show up and the main characters get somewhat closer; that's honestly all the plot development that there is in Nisekoi, bar the last few episodes.Thus, most episodes are romcom staples, such as the onsen episode, the cultural festival episode, the beach episode, the pool episode, the test of courage episode, the hanabi episode, etc. All in all, the story is neither really unique nor really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nConsidering it's Shaft, the art and animation were quite excellent. Nisekoi's style was a bit different from other Shaft anime we know and love(or hate), such as the Monogatari series and Mekakucity Actors. While the art tilted to more traditional(or generic?) styles, there were still plenty of signature Shaft touches, such as the abstract pattern backgrounds, etc. I enjoyed especially Chitoge and Raku's many expressions of shock. Regardless of the uniqueness of the art style, the animation was still very fluid, and overall the art is superb.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was not outstanding per se, but it was still fairly decent . The openings and endings were catchy, if not a bit generic, and the background music was fairly standard, with a track for each  corresponding scene (such as a light track for awkward moments between Raku and every other girl).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nEssentially your average romcom characters. You have Raku, the really nice son of a yakuza head who inadvertently gets lots of hot girls in the class (who all happen to be childhood friends) and is pretty much hated by all the guys in the class for this reason. There are 3 main girls- Chitoge, Onodera, and Marika. Chitoge is an academically superior tsundere who enjoys abusing Raku and is the daughter of a the leader of an American gang. Onodera is an extremely shy girl who loves Raku, who happens to love her, yet both are afraid to confess to each other. Marika (shows up later in the story) is a potentially yandere daughter of the police commissioner, who is absolutely obsessed with Raku. There are also minor-ish ones such as Tsugumi, a romantically confused assassin who works for Chitoge's gang. Maiko is Raku's best friend, and enjoys nothing more than to get Raku together with other girls, even though he's in a fake relationship with Onodera. Ruri is Onodera's best friend, and pretty much her goal in life is to get Onodera to confess to Raku and have them become a couple. Overall, some fairly generic characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nDespite its story (or lack thereof), and generic characters, I enjoyed watching Nsekoi. Even though on the surface it looks like a fairly generic anime, I did look forward for the new episode each Saturday. Although the overarching story was fairly generic and made virtually no progress throughout the anime, each episode was fairly interesting and had its comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI guess there's really not much more to say. If you enjoy romcoms, then definitely check this one out. It's much better than the run-of-the-mill romcom (looking at you, Date a Live).",

            "content": "With harem series we have a few rules: \r\n1: The Main character must be dense\r\n2: The side characters are better than the heroines \r\n3: No romatic conclusion \r\nNisekoi strikes the nail on the head when it comes to being generic in most aspects. \r\nLike a doctor I will first deliver the good news then the bad news. \r\nThe art in Nisekoi was quite beautiful. I love it when an anime is as colorful and liberal (in changing art style) as Nisekoi is. My only issue is that the girls are in constant blush.\r\nAudio was good. Didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. I do likeClick the OP.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nRaku- Basic harem MC (dense as a neutron star)\\n\r\nChitoge- Basic Tsundere \\n\r\nOnodera- Basic suck-up character (like Saukura in Fate/stay night, the Fate and UBW routes) \\n\r\nOnodera's sister- Already forgot her name. Don't care anymore really.\\n\r\nMarie- Not enough screen time and was rushed in at the lend of first season. Is actually pretty cool in a perverted manipulitive manner.\\n\r\nChitoge's slave- Unnesesary big boobs\\n\r\nThat's all I can remember\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nPrepare for the bad news.\\n\r\nNisekoi would have been good if it hadn't tried to force a backstory. You know the one. The one with the locket and stuff. For the uninformed plebs, Nisekoi's backstory goes into how Raku and his playmate from his childhood made a promise to marry. The promise is sealed with a key (literally) as the girl locked a locket with a key and gave it to raku as a means for them to find eachother again. 10 years later he's a teenager in highschool. Like most adolesent males he's thinking about girls. The girl he particularly has his eyes on is Onodera. The two had flirted all through middle school and were preping to do the same in high school. That is, untill transfer student Chitoge slammed her way into his life and due to certain family circumstances they are forced to pretend to date. Then to add even more feul to the fire of potential they both have keys. This raises so many questions: Which key is the right one? Is he going to start to love Chitoge or will his flirtationship with Onodera stop him? Is he going to remain true to his promise he made as a kid or will he move on and date who he loves? The anime slowly feeds these questions with dates with both of the girls and signals that both of the girls like him. Then at a climax the show has Chitoge try the locket to see if she's the girl. The locket breaks leaving the questions the show gives us on hold untill the locket is repaired (which doesn't really happen).  This would be no problem to me if the show didn't end the way it did. Instead of bringing he locket back for a great climatic finale that resolves all of the questions invokes upon us the ending features Raku reconciling with Harem Girl A, Chitoge after a fight. This climax has nothing to do with the sideplot whatsoever. Then in the second season the show finally hammers the nail into the coffin by telling us the locket will never be fixed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf it wern't obvoius from the rant above, watching nisekoi was not enjoyable. I would have enjoyed it better if they hadn't included the backstory subplot and just focused on the Romatic Comedy section. Also if they just had all of the girls in the begining intead of adding them every 3-4 episodes that would be great. And every girl doesn't need a key.\\n\\n\r\n**Disclaimer**\\n\r\n **Nisekoi is kinda a show without spoilers cause harems never have a proper conclusion so don't get your panties in a twist with the plot events that I've mentioned.**",

            "content": "Bear w/ me now, I never read the manga, and most likely won't continue on to the 2nd season once it airs. POSSIBLE SPOILERS.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story was your typical bland harem rom-com anime. There was obviously something enticing about it, though, because I watched it through to the end. I wasn't a big fan of the tsundere female lead, however I am a bit biased, because I view tsundere caricatures as filler characters that are very clich\u00e9. Why? Because like in this anime, the tsundere often doesn't undergo real character development. It's often never gradual and happens rather predictably. \"Oh, I'm in love w/ so-and-sonow.\" What? You just suddenly decided this, after many years of self-denial and abusive behavior? And these characters expect to be treated like they were never cruel in the first place. \\n\r\nSecondly, I'm just not a harem fan. Again, there's bias...but I don't like how supposedly average or unnoticed guys in school life anime suddenly have all these new girls introduced, often transfer students, that fawn over him for literally no reason. I get that these characters exist so the audience can sort of \"step in their shoes,\" but I'd much rather have a fleshed out protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10 \\n\r\nCute, nice, colorful...nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nI basically highlighted everything under Story...all the character designs have been done before. Nothing new here, not even the family dynamics (check Ranma 1/2).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10 \\n\r\nDespite all that, I found it entertaining. During times of great distress or simply just boredom, it's nice to kick back and watch a mindless anime. This is one of those.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10",

            "content": "Critic's note- This review has solely been written (rushed) for personal pleasure purposes, I had to put an end to these tickling palms, these hands that itch to write a review for each anime I watch, After a long hiatus, here I break my silence. A review by me is going up after a long time so please go easy on me minna ;) \r\nSome people may be sad that Nisekoi has ended (for now because due to the manga's popularity a second season has been confirmed) but I'm relieved that I won't have to dutifully watch it every week.\r\nEven though this anime is thetalk of the last season, It needs a fresh review, as all the others were done midway. The plot was simple and tranquil from the very start, I haven't read the manga but for those who watch a considerable amount of anime,don't have to read the manga to decide on Nisekoi's future. It still felt unfair to review something in it's incomplete state because I wanted to give Nisekoi a chance.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start by giving a brief synopsis. Two childhood friends make a promise to meet and (marry??) when they grow up, The guy and the girl agree to keep a lock and a key, the guy has the pendant lock and the girl holds the key (to his heart) cliche? I am not going to focus on the protagonist who is a jerk but the two heroines, Chitoge and Onodera as I remember are irritating and stupid, respectively. Onodera being so gullibly foolish it was almost cute. Familiar, heh? So, 10 years have passed, Raku's still holding onto his promise and the pendant, and there's a new (Tsundere) girl at school and they are forced into a relationship for the next 3 years, Hence the name Nisekoi \"False Love\" .\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much of a plot and I didn't come here expecting an adventure but there's that tiniest bit of disappointment, Just because it's SHAFT and because Nisekoi came to me as a recommendation from a very dear friend, the Art is gorgeous, I wouldn't expect any less from them. The background and minor details intrigued me very much but ill try not to drool too much over that. I didn't see much scope for plot or character development. Now, SHAFT doesn't disappoint in its production and presentation but SHAFT has always been discreet.Watch Nisekoi in HD or don't watch it at all. The fact that Nisekoi was made to look pretty and it fulfills the purpose, it targeted that type of audience, but SHAFT u have earned a rep. you do better, for example Bakemonogatari [i am only mentioning it as people wont stop comparing the two] it had great art and a great plot. Nisekoi, is nowhere near that league. \\n\\n\r\nI know there are every kinds of people and every type of anime fans, we all have different likings and it makes the anime community so diverse and awesome, some like pretty art and it's their choice, they will love this anime but to go on and say it's a unique adaption, this can't get any better or that SHAFT couldn't do better. For them, either your only watching anime for it's art or you really need to watch more anime or read more manga before u think you're ready to go and write a review, because u don't want to mislead other viewers, right? As for me, I would rather watch Nodame cantabile (average art style) with a decent storyline than watch something excessively overhyped with these...(you get me)\\n\\n\r\nI don't hate the music but its nothing \"larger than life\" The OP is ok but of the kind that will be skipped, IMO the second OP by ClariS does much better and it's likely that I'll like to listen to it.\\n\r\nI like mainstream anime, In fact I love Slice of Life that has beautiful art and a decent gist but Nisekoi is a mainstream anime that isn't even worthwhile SHAFT's time, It belongs to KyoAni. Lesser number of episodes could have made Nisekoi likable, it's okay to marathon in one sitting but being 20 episodes long it feels like it's just dragging on and on... [what does it matter because I am through already]\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi is not a substantial anime not by a long shot but none of this means it isn't enjoyable, Nisekoi is flawed and everyone sees that, I guess except the delusional fans of the manga. I ain't telling you to remove it (who am i?) from your watchlist but at least move it a few titles down because there's better mainstream anime floating around, than this. Hope my review visits every nook and touches a bit on everything, just an overall picture of what you're getting yourself into and how it'll look like when you start off. \\n\\n\r\nOn a scale of 5, 1.2 feels too harsh for Nisekoi, so 2/5 is my final rating.",

However, the male character is actually in love with another girl and has to try to maintain a good relationship with her while going out with his 'girlfriend'. Over time the girl begins developing feelings for the male.\r\nThis story would have had potential if the male wasn't denser than a brick and if he would stop getting embarrassed with every little action.\r\nArt 9:\r\nThe art is really nice, I actually liked the character designs (Chitoge is very cute). The quality wasquite consistent and was well lit.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7:\\n\r\nOP and ED aren't memorable, soundtrack doesn't seem that interesting either. Voice acting is consistent, unfortunately it cannot be graded properly due to the mediocrity of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3:\\n\r\nWeak male that has the density of a brick. The other characters have very little character as the writers simply decided to apply the 'nice', 'tsundere' or 'support' onto them. \\n\\n\r\nOnodera is the nice girl, she's never hits him nor yells at him.\\n\r\nChitoge and Tsugumi are the tsundere.\\n\r\nShuu and Ruri are the supports, basically they know everything but since they're supports, can't actually influence anything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4:\\n\r\nChitoge's pretty cute and I actually enjoyed her onscreen time. She was well designed and her voice actor made her even cuter. However, seeing a lack of actual development for the protagonist towards any girls was just really boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4:\\n\r\nBasically a non-nude version of To-Love-Ru. Weak male lead that somehow has a harem of followers through his 'sincerity'.",

            "content": "Really interesting, and re-watchable romance & comedy title.\r\nThe story, the plot and well, pretty much the entire concept of Nisekoi were all very interesting. Not the best of the genre however the show was pretty decent. I liked that even though the show was full of cliche's it still retained it's own uniqueness a feat made possible with the support of studio shaft. Now, things got a bit complicated for me during the whole \"Tachibana arc\" or \"Childhood friend arc\" This was because I was so used to the triangle between Onoderna and Chitoge. Not to mention I liked the idea of the mystery girlwho Raku knew only being between Kosaki or Chitoge. For a new character to be dropped so late was a bit unacceptable to me. Then again, when I think more about it, the show is 20 episodes so maybe I'm just making a big deal out of it.  My overall feeling for the story of Nisekoi was pretty good. I must admit that it was a pain in the ass watching the obvious love and drama drag on for so long however and to a certain extent, I think it was all worth it in the end. I mean, it didn't deliver much of a satisfying ending however I still thought it was pretty good. I don't really want to spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\nAppearances visuals and animation was pretty amazing. I mean, it's a shaft production so I expected good quality visuals and special effects. Background settings and objects really stood out. In addition to that, I really enjoyed seeing the Special  effects in the opening song but I digress.  Perhaps one of my favorite features in Nisekoi is the visual appearance. Colorful, vibrant, and great to look at. I am pretty  damn fond of shaft's decisions (for the most part) when it comes to what shows they want to work on.\\n\\n\r\nNow for characters, they were pretty decent. I liked that Raku was similar to Araragi from Nisio Isin Monogatari series. Another infamous show that Shaft has worked on. Albeit he's not too much of a pervert like Koyomi but, butt-cheeks, he's still a pretty likable guy. Moving along, I honestly didn't care for the selection of main characters. Kosaki was probably my favorite, out of the main three. Chitoge  and Raku I just.. I couldn't get into them that much. The supporting characters  felt like they were there just for show, I felt like there was nothing interesting about them. I love the character designs, I mean, I thought Kosaki was adorable! and maybe Chitoge sometimes too. I liked lots of the designs again, mostly for Kosaki's though. Her out of school outfits were always nice. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound was pretty great. I didn't have a favorite song from the soundtrack however, that didn't really change how I felt about the BGM. Seiyuu's, again did a pretty damn good job fulfilling their roles and bringing their perspective characters to life. The queen Kana Hanazawa does a great job fulfilling her role as Kosaki and the other voice actors are alright too. OP & ED songs were okay too. I personally didn't care for em'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that Nisekoi was a pretty enjoyable, and memorable title. It is the type of show that I would recommend if you like slow titles that also have lots of developments along the way.  I gave Nisekoi 8.3/10 because I felt that even though it had its moments of disappointments, It still delivered a great amount of drama, suspense and comedy!",

            "content": "Adaptations are flawed by default. No adaptation will ever captivate the same way as its source material. With that said, they are not superior or inferior from the get-go, one clear example being the anime I'll be reviewing today.  Ever wondered what would happen if you give a competent staff a bad source material? Well... Nisekoi happens.\r\nThis anime is, at its core, a lazy and generic romcom. The premise is a huge excuse to have a bunch of cute girls show up and form a harem. Whoever, despite being so generic, Shaft did an amazing job at this show's art direction and presentation. Needlessto say it's the main reason why my grade is this high.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is weak to say the least, though that's expected from a show like Nisekoi. It's semi-episodic (with short stories taking no more than 3 episodes) starting with a simple excuse for the characters to meet, some kind of misunderstanding or conflict, rounded up by a romantic scene. It needed no more than that, but not much innovation either, very run-of-the-mill.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag. Their designs are interesting and unique and some of them do get development over time. With that said, they are still very simple and stereotypical characters personality-wise. There\u2019s the bland main character for teenagers like me to identify with him, the tsundere, the kind and cute girl, the perverted friend and the energetic girl. Not a single character is in fact original, which is a huge letdown.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about the anime is its artistic approach to direction. Every shot is different, with its unique backgrounds, fluid animation and head turns, classic Shaft signature. It isn\u2019t as absurd as Madoka or Monogatari, but that is a good thing in my opinion. Being a romantic comedy, I don\u2019t think there is any space for that kind of absurd directing. The sound is OK, doesn\u2019t really stand out all that much, though voice acting is on point, Kana Hanazawa\u2019s voice always stands out. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nisekoi has little going for it, but its great execution makes up for its flaws and was quite enjoyable thinking back. I recommend it to those who are fans of the genre, or feel like watching just for the waifu material. Either way, watch it purely for the entertainment, it\u2019s not that great.\\n",

            "content": "Nisekoi! is the anime that can be summarized in one word: GENERIC\r\nThat's debatable of course, it could also be Clich\u00e9d.\r\nIt's kinda like the writers/makers had a checklist of Anime Must-Haves and went and ticked them all off.  This show is a Harem, a Romantic Comedy, and Slice of Life, The story is simple: Boy has a lock, when he was little he promised a girl to marry her, if she kept the key, and he kept the lock. In his teens his dad insists he dates the Tsundere girl to stop a feud between gangsters and the mafia.\r\nThe Episodes:\r\nIt's all there: The Onsen, TheLocked Toghether, The Swimming Pool, The Beach, The Festival, The School Trip, The Birthday, The Sleepover, and of course, the School Play.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music:\\n\r\nI forgot what kind of music the Anime has. Yeah thats right, thats how unoriginal it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nIt's a harem, so the girls outnumber boys 3:1. \\n\r\nThere's The Tsundere, The Boy/Girl?!, The Nice Girl, The Bride/Fianc\u00e9e, The Glasses Character, and The Childhood Friend, and they all fawn over the Protagonist boy who is in no way attractive. And there is The Best Friend. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story:\\n\r\nIt all revolves around his lock, he doesn't remember who he made the promise to, and moreover, he is head over heals with the Nice Girl. But the main focus is on Tsundere, who is a little too convincing in hating the Protagonist, so she is butt annoying. Besides those two girls, the other harem girls come on for one or two episodes before fading to the background. \\n\\n\r\nIt's generic to a fault. They half-assed a Romeo & Juliet theme, which is pretty much the most overused theme in romantic history. And the lock? Like every good oldfashioned anime, they keep you dangling to the end... the open end.\\n\\n\r\nOveral Feel:\\n\r\nI laughed, there are some good jokes. Sadly, between jokes I found myself sighing and planting my face to my hand. This anime goes to show that domestic violence is perfectly okay as long as the girl does it. Also, parents care only about their kids future, as long as they marry a good successor to the family business. It's truly a deep and meaningful message. Told in chewed out clich\u00e9s and overly Generic Anime standards.",

            "content": "Hello, this is my first review. Constructive criticism is welcomed.\r\nNisekoi is an anime of the \"rom-com\" genre, most notably associated with anime like Toradora. These anime mix aspects of romance, situational comedy, and slice of life story elements (financial or family problems). I am grading based on the strength of these components within Nisekoi.\r\nAlthough I enjoyed Nisekoi, it was a series that left me feeling rather disappointed as a whole.\r\nCharacter: 7\r\nOnodera and Chitoge's relationships with Ichijo are both interesting and funny to watch. As Ichijo discovers more about his past, the feelings he has towards people change. He becomes slightly more sympathetic (even for atypical romcom main character who is stereotypically nice) as the show goes on. He stops worrying about doing things and actually takes some action to spend time with the girls he is interested in. The results, however, are to be discussed with the story section of the review.\\n\\n\r\nEvery animation or facial reaction is highly stylized, almost to meme or moe levels of deformation. I do not mean this as a bad thing, the quick wit of the humor (when it introduces itself) is not only welcoming but genuinely funny. The characters make these situations fun to watch because of their well-developed dynamics. These dynamics change over time, especially in the case of Onodera.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe two main story lines revolve around Ichijo, and are dynamic and interesting. I would not call them character arcs, because the focus is constantly switching between the two.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the pacing of the show leaves much to be desired. The argument here is that any adaptation of a manga usually must remain loyal to the vision of the mangaka. This is especially highlighted in the first episode which is divided into shorts. \\n\\n\r\nAs the storylines develop, they begin to decelerate at an alarming rate. \\n\r\nThe writing relies too much upon the internal monologues of every character. This means that a single event may take, in screen time, a full two minutes to fully expose every major character's reaction. This leaves the show feeling rather disjointed and redundant. The fact that most of these internal dialogues repeat subject matter or decisions left me shockingly bored at some parts. Knowing so much about the thoughts of each character causes the viewer to see the romance as an omniscient third person, instead of through the eyes of Ichijo. This ultimately detracted from my personal interest in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs a forewarning, some of the circumstances around the plot twists within this series will make you want to tear your hair out. At least I wanted to.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nIf you have seen any anime produced by SHAFT, you can immediately recognize the style of Nisekoi. Certain scenes are of \"mixed media\", meaning that something like a blue border of frills may appear in the school setting, as if someone placed one in front of the animated characters. Particularly dramatic moments are treated to some gorgeous views of the sky or the city. The \"design\" or look of every character is consistently well-executed.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I had more to say about my favorite part of this anime. Scenes like the gangster/yakuza buildings are like castles from a story book (or popular Shakespearean tragedy? hoho). The aforementioned reaction faces and character dynamics would not be possible if not for the fluid and spot-on animations done hundreds of times each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe voice acting is some of the best I have heard. The dialogue is so natural that one can imagine the voice actors for Ruri and Onodera in the booth together just having normal girl talk. The OP and ED are both catchy but a little too saccharine for my tastes. Background noises and sound effects are delivered at a consistent \"frame\" of each animation, helping make the animated world a little more realistic and consistent.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint is that the story distracted me from enjoying the characters and humor as they were. The monologues constantly bring up the story defining \"who likes who?\" question and force the characters to behave at a molasses pace.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nSeveral personal complaints I have about the show (like the beach episode and the rather pervy drawings shown at the end of each episode) keep me from personally recommending Nisekoi to my friends. From an objective view, Nisekoi is a solid example of the \"rom-com\" anime genre. \\n\r\nIs Nisekoi fun to watch and well-made? Yes. \\n\r\nWill I cherish the memory of watching this show like a childhood promise? No.",

            "content": "Ok here is my in depth review on Nisekoi and why i love Nisekoi so much. \r\nStory\r\nLets start with the story itself before we get into the art, direction, and other elements of the series. While many already know Nisekoi has squandered on its potential of becoming a great romance with harem elements. For some odd, or should i say predictable reasons, Komi felt the need to add fillers as well milk the story. Lets be honest here Komi is no where near Nisio where he can milk a product and make it good. Even some vols of gatari that was made out of whimare amazing. But lemme stop here before i go on a tangent, no cosine. But what the anime adapted was probably the strongest story arc of the series. Notice I used probably and not indefinitely. From the start we already get a love triangle from the get-go. Raku likes Onodera and vice verse, and Chitoge and Raku are forced into a fake relationship. From that point on people should have already knew that cock-blockings from both ends will occur. I mention this because that's one criticism of Nisekoi. The constant cock-blocking and tom foolery is what irritates people. Ima be honest while watching this from week to week i was getting mad as well. Only once they introduced the harem element is when I began to accept the cock-blocking tom foolery. But lemme discuss the characters of this show right now so i can show you what appeals to me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with Chitoge last just because I know ur haterd for her. Lets start with Raku, It wont be long nor do i plan on summarizing the characters.. Raku is a pretty generic harem MC. While enjoyable then most pussies out there he doesn't fall to far from the tree. Shu is best friend is a good wing-man. He is always looking out from him plus he is a great comic relief character. His interaction with Ruri are funny and cute at the same time because of the subtle love interest between them. So basically we have 2 relationships forming. Which is entertaining enough to see. inb4thisshowisaboutshuandruri the whole time :mindfk:. Tsugumi can be irratating at times but her body makes up for all the bs she does. When she has love interest for Raku i guess some could have been slightly irratated. But to all honesty she hides her feelings well enough where it doesn't effect the show at all. Its all part of the harem train. \\n\\n\r\nNow that i got rid of the side characters lets talk about the main three girls in the harem. This is what makes me really fall in [s]false[/s] LOVE with the show. Onodera Kosaki is absolutely the best character my eyes has ever laid on. Ill try to keep this short or else i can go on another huge essay about her. The fact that both Raku and Onodera like each other, the fact that they both have a key and a locket, the fact that they are probably the couple that would actually work out, is all the reasons why she is the strongest character in the series. By strongest i mean the one thats going to/should \"win.\" Her cutesy shy charm is cute af. She isn't an annoying sub character that's just thrown in there. She actually has a lot of personality. In later episodes of the anime we see her getting a little bit more aggressive or should i say assertive with her attitude towards Raku. With Ruri always pushing her we finally see some character development. YES a character development in what many say is a plotless anime where nothing happens. If anything, if we really wanna look at it from a serious stand point, Onoderas character development with Raku alone is what makes this show soo good. We started with Onodera in episode one and we ended with Onodera in the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about your favorite character. Tachibana is a good character. When added to the harem this is where the doodoo hits the fan. Because it is clear that Tachibana is the promise girl from the picture (we are only talking bout the first season). Raku's clear choice would be to go with her. But the thing is when Tachibana is introduced and even after, Onodera and Chitoge has already made so much progression with Raku. As of now Raku already is showing interest in either Chitoge and Onodera. With Chitoge it seems like the classic \"been together for so long u start to fall in love\", wit Onodera he always liked her. So adding Tachibana only seems to be there for harem plot element and an entertaining character. Well Tachibana isn't the one i have to be defending here lemme get to Chitoge or as you like to call her [s]best girl[/s] Shitoge\\n\\n\r\nSo look I'm not here to convert atheists into believers,I'm just tryna say the way anime need Shaft Studio, the way Raku needed needs Chitoge, that's the way I need Kosaki. lel okay I'm done lemme chill before i turn this into a rap. The reason why you (and if this not the reason) why most people hate Chitoge is cause of the following. She is an annoying tsundere. At first she is extremely intolerable. She shows zero interest in Raku and she ruins the mood. But later on when you actually see slight jealously you begin to look at it in a cute way. Personally Chitoge grows on you. Out of every character in the series she has one of the most character development. The arc/scene where she was in the beach and all jealous and shit just proves that she is developing feelings for Raku. That's fucking character development. I mean if u were put into a position you don't want to be in of course you will be extremely intolerable at first. When it comes to love interest she has the biggest shot because Raku also shows somewhat same feelings back. It goes from obligation to actually want to be with each other. Ill give u the fact that she was horrible at first but it is extremely acceptable for her to behave that way. The fact that she eases up so much just shows us that Komi isn't a complete retard and he actually wants to push the story. This is me speaking from the anime stand point. I'm well aware of how the manga likes to diverge from the plot. As a main girl she isn't that bad. It shows a nice, overcoming of obstacles in order to achieve a love interest. Hate it or love it that's a fact and you know it. To tell you the truth I think i defended her well enough as a character. If you have any rebuttals please let me know so i can further expand on any issues you find. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Direction/Ost\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, lets discuss the studio breh. So lets start with this. Nisekoi and shaft studio complement each other well. If this went to a different studio I feel i would have gotten a different show.  Boring backgrounds, not enough exaggeration in motion and movement, and something different all together. With nisekoi shaft actually showed effort. Unlike MCA (but that's another story and im no story teller). Please don't discuss the industry and it isnt shaft's fault that it had a nice budget, I already know! But the art in nisekoi is nice. It gives u a warm feeling at the same not feeling overly complicated. My one complaint would be the BD's butchering some of the bgs for the sake of sparkles. But when we get shaft we expect nice sceneries (even in dance in the vampire bund which felt extremely low budgeted). The character designs are similar if not better than the manga design. Lastly, the overall atmosphere is far more richer than the manga. So if we are comparing the first 50 chapters of what shaft adapted i would honestly say this is an instance where anime exceeds the source material. Shaft, believe it or not adapted the manga pretty well. Aside from inserting their artistic flare from time to time it stayed pretty faithful.\\n\\n\r\nWhile camera angels and cuts aren't as extreme as most of the gatari series Shaft still tends to use these methods. Also with changing animations for funny scenes this has the complete package. I really do enjoy their style and i can go on forever about it but honestly Nisekoi is shafty af but not toooo shafty. its the perfect balance. Its not too tame and not too wild. From time to time its nice to see them adapt something like this. So the reason i mention all this is to add why i enjoy this \"seemingly generic harem\" more than most harems i watch. It isn't because of the story but its because of the art, direction, and characters that draw me into this show. I cant see how one who likes their shows can dislike this show. I cant comprehend 1 character ruining the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nTbh im not the type of guy to pick up on the ost. I overlook it most of the time. But the music in Nisekoi lifts the overall mood of the series greatly. When I re-watched it in BD quality I picked up certain things and i found myself engrossed in the show. When hearing the ost play over certain scenes it just makes things fun for me. Shaft sure knows how to place the ost in scenes and make it work. It really is one of their strong suits and ill be sure to pick that up in more series. \\n\\n\r\nSo here is my ultimatum. Whatever you found wrong, flawed, weak, or needing further expansion on, please let me know. I believe i defended why I like Nisekoi well enough.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Raku should be a Harem president. He should invade a country and name it \"Haremica\". I can see it now...300 Million girls living in his \"Harem\" country and he's the only guy. Oh, how I would love to be him right now. Or better yet, he should be a Harem God and there will be 7 Billion girls around him. The point I'm trying to make in my opener is this show is another one of those protagonists where the girls are mindlessly falling in love with.  \r\nStory: (5/10) \r\nThe story is about Raku, a teenager who made a promise 10 years ago toa girl he met. The problem is he doesn't remember this girl. They both promised that they will get married when they reunite. He wears a pendant that the girl gave him and he never let it go. \\n\r\nNow my opinions on the story. At best, it's mediocre. At the first 3 episodes, the show had an interesting idea. To me, at least. But from there on, it just became a typical cliche, romance and harem moments. Not that I'm complaining or anything. I'm probably one of the few people on this earth who isn't bothered by cliche moments or shows with harem protagonists. I mean, I don't love it but I don't hate it either. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nAt least the show did something right and it's the animation. Yes, the show had a lot of clich\u00e8 facial expressions but I don't want to focus there. I want to focus on the actual character designs, environment designs and the lighting. Character designs, good. Environment designs, great and the lighting is also great. There is one design that I'm really bothered by and it's the way they design the female characters. Yes, I know, it's fan service but it's ridiculous. At school, they have normal boobs but in the beach and swimming pool scenes, the breasts are bigger than my ballsacks. I mean, just look at Tsugumi. She has the smallest breasts of them all and in the beach scene, it somehow gets bigger. This is why some parents think anime is a huge hentai.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nIf the show didn't have interesting OP or ED theme songs then the sound category would have easily been a score of 4 and lower. Why? Because if the show doesn't have(it actually doesn't) interesting music going on in the background then they need to make up with it by making good or great OP and ED theme songs. That's what the show successfully did. OP 1 and  OP 2 are both great. Hell, the only reason how I managed to make it past Ep. 1 and 2 is the OP 1 theme song. Both OP's are sung by ClariS and I'm a fan of her songs. Now, about the ED theme songs. There is a lot that I lost count. How many are there? 4? 5? I forget. ED 1 is the only great ending theme song. I think it was sung by the voice actor of Chitoge? The other ED's can just suck it because they're not even worth listening to. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (6/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are all cliched and they have a stereotyped character personality. There's nothing original about them. Raku is your typical Harem God surrounded by beautiful girls for no reason. Chitoge is your typical tsundere. She always argues and fight with Raku as she is unable to properly express her inner, loving emotions towards Raku. Kosaki is a dandere. The typical shy girl that only really opens up around good friends and the guy she likes which is obviously Raku. Tsugumi is a kuudere. Cool, calm, collected but is at a total loss about what to do with her newfound feelings of love for (again) Raku. Lastly, Marika is a non-violent yandere girl. Obsessed with having the boy of her dreams to the point of completely reinventing her appearance and personality to appeal to him. Great job for the creators. They managed to squeeze in 4 \"dere\" characters in the show and put them in Raku's harem. They're nothing original so why didn't I rate the character category a score of 4 and lower? Because they're hilarious. That's the only reason it saved the characters from being a total flop. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nMy enjoyment category is a perfect score from me not because of the crappy story, not because of the stereotyped and cliched characters but because of how hilarious the show is. Especially the interaction between Chitoge and Raku. This is the reason why I love tsundere girls. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7.8/10)----Rounding it to--(8/10)\\n\r\nThere really isn't anything new or fresh with Nisekoi. It's just a story of a harem protagonist filled with stereotypical girls in a cliched high school setting. At the end of the day, the show really goes nowhere. You'll know what I'm talking about if you watched the show. However, despite all of this, the show is still hilarious as hell. The characters and their interaction towards Raku is what saved this show from being a total failure. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Hilarious Characters\\n\r\n+A lot of funny moments\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Mediocre story\\n\r\n-Stereotyped and cliched characters\\n\r\n-Show goes nowhere (Can I even consider this as a con?)\\n\r\n-Not so great ending\\n",

            "content": "Is it possible to like something that is completely unoriginal?  According to Nisekoi, yes, it is.\r\nWhen Nisekoi was slated for an anime production by studio Shaft, the fans of the manga were torn between elation that it was actually being adapted and complete terror that Shaft would be doing it. If you\u2019re not aware with the common stereotypes of anime studios, a frank description of Shaft would be, \u201cThey do whatever they want.\u201d  Shaft has never been shy of putting their own... unique spin on their adaptions.  And, hey, whatta ya know, it actually works.\r\nThe Shaft visuals are capable of turning afew heads, but they\u2019re never overpowering as they are in many of their other shows, and the story and setting have an inexplicable charm to them despite the fact that literally every character and literally every situation has been done before.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nThe story of Nisekoi is not one of its strong points.  I don't think anybody but the most diehard fans would even bother offering any sort of rebuttal here.  It plays on almost every clich\u00e9 in the book, from the childhood promise, to the fated encounter, to the downright absurd misunderstandings, even to the freaking beach episode, that I can\u2019t help but think that this is all some elaborate parody of the harem genre.  If it is, then the author did a damn good job because it certainly feels like one.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something believable, you won't find anything of the sort here.  I realize that this is fiction, but there is a line up to where I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and Nisekoi clearly crosses it.   I understand that we don't remember that much from our childhood, but do you really expect me to believe that a person would completely forget nearly every friend he had\u2014not just their faces and names, but their actual existence?  Is this where the \u201cmain character gets amnesia from an injury\u201d clich\u00e9 comes in?\\n\\n\r\nI know every harem can get a little ridiculous, and I'm going to criticize it every time.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 9/10\\n\r\nTypically there's not a whole lot of action going on in high school romantic comedies and harems, so the \u201cArt & Animation\u201d category is really just an \u201cArt & Waifus\u201d rating.  Are the girls waifu material?  (Alternatively, are the boys husbando material?)  If so, 10/10, anime of the year, etc.  Jokes aside, it's true that there really isn't much to say other than the art is pleasant.  Everything is just solid and complement the scenes well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I think this section deserves more discussion however simply due to the fact that Shaft is at work.  As I've stated, many fans of the manga were worried that Shaft would take their style too far and that it would detract heavily from the source material, which many believe to be too inherently \u201cnormal\u201d to be deflowered by Shaft's hands, but fortunately that was not the case here.  Sure, you've got Shinbo's signature camera angles and a few strangely elaborate backgrounds (and some intentionally simple ones), but these don't define the show as they might have in Bakemonogatari or Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi is a Shaft show, sure, but it is not definitively so, which comes as a great relief to many, I'd imagine.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe voices are perfect.  That's all that needs to be said.  There was not a single voice that didn't fit a character to the tee.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is neither great nor distracting.  To be honest, I can't really pick out more than one song that I'd actually remember being played, and I usually am a huge fan of background music and pay a lot of attention to it.  It all sort of blended in, and I'm frankly not sure whether that's a good or bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nMy only genuine complaint is that the opening and ending songs are just so generic.  Though, now that I think about it, maybe that was the whole point.  Regardless, I didn't really find myself liking any of them.  ClariS didn't really try to make their tracks stand out from any of their others, and some harsher critics might say that none of theirs are ever original-sounding.  As for the character songs: it's always nice to hear the characters sing, but the songs just weren't that great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nIf the story is clich\u00e9 and generic, could it be possible that the characters rise to the occasion and present themselves as deep, fleshed out vessels complete with compelling motivations and relatable desires and realistic decisions? \\n\\n\r\nNope.\\n\\n\r\nThe tsundere main girl?  Check.  The \u201cgood girl\u201d (a.k.a. the Yamato nadeshiko)?  Check. The perverted best friend that gets his ass handed to him every episode?  Check.  There is literally no character that isn't a practically a carbon copy of a past character or at the very least a blending of two.  On top of that, the main characters are dense as dense can be, which makes it so easy for the ridiculous misunderstandings to manifest.\\n\\n\r\nSo why would I give this an acceptable score of 7/10?  See the next section.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nAll of my complaining might actually convince someone that I dislike this anime because of how generic it is.  On the contrary; I find all of the enjoyment in reveling in just how clich\u00e9 nearly every moment is.  If you've seen even 2 or 3 harems (and I've probably seen dozens), you can call out just about everything that is going to happen in each episode and in each scene.  It's that predictable.  Yet, there is an inexplicable charm which pervades the series.  Yes, I was literally facepalming at nearly every scene in the show, but underneath that palm was a gigantic smile that I just couldn't hold back.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nNisekoi is not a groundbreaking anime by any means, but if it has proven one thing, it\u2019s that originality is extremely overrated. All you need is a little charm, solid execution, and, of course, waifus. There's a reason that this story and these characters have been done before, and that's because they're enjoyable.  Perhaps some of us are just in denial.\\n\\n\r\nHere's for the inevitable season 2.",

            "content": "It is a delightment to be able to write a review for Nisekoi, though the anime was not perfect, it has provided me with significant entertainment during the last few months. Even if my review may seem negative, it is just because I am analyzing an anime by parts and category. As a whole, I thoroughly enjoyed Nisekoi.\r\nStory: (30%)\r\nThe plot of Nisekoi is rather mediocre. With a redundant premise, Nisekoi has nothing new to contribute to the rom-com genre. The creativity of the story and its complexity is minimal at best, non-existent at least. Do no expect to be blown away by the story line,in fact, the plot will leave you wanting in most of the episodes. There are the standardized anime episodes such the festival, the school play, and the beach episodes. None of them adds anything unique to the template, it is just a repetition from what we have traditionally seen. \\n\\n\r\nIt is not as if the premise is weak, though not original, the premise of a MC looking for the girl of his past to open his locket has potentiality for a lot of complexity and twist. This, however, was not done in Nisekoi, and of course this is not directly the anime's fault but rather a representation of the manga. Even when the chance for legit development appeared, the event was squandered by a random, indescribable, improbable set of circumstances. An example would be a girl sitting next to her crush, with her gathering up all the courage to tell her crush that she wants to kiss him....and  actually does say it!! Then it turns out that the guy fell asleep seconds before her confession, and wakes up seconds after the end of statement. One event like this may fly past the radar, but the agglomeration of these types of events prevents anyone from taking the plot and story line of this anime seriously.\\n\\n\r\nEven a young child would face-palm at the irritable progression of the plot. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: (90%)\\n\\n\r\n I did not feel like an episode was lacking in art. Sure, there were some frames that were reused, and the animation wasn't super fluid every scene, but overall the art was good. Since Shaft produced Nisekoi, there is a lot of similarity between this anime's art and previous anime of theirs. I didn't even know Shaft produced this before watching the anime, but a few seconds into the first episode, I could just tell. \\n\\n\r\nIt wouldn't be true that the art style is done better in Nisekoi than in other of Shaft's works, but it was a great fit for Nisekoi. I enjoyed the close ups, the quick glances, and the over dramatization of emotions. I'm really into experiencing the story, and this art style especially focuses on characters more than background. I think this can be weird to some at first, but it really brings the point home that its' the characters that one should be paying attention to the most. Nisekoi did a great job in making the character design shine. I can vividly recall scenes where I felt enamored by some of female design and how they fit. Nisekoi did a great job of letting us see them THROUGH the eyes of  Raku.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: (100%)\\n\\n\r\nMarvelous soundtrack. Soundtracks can make or break a scene, and in Nisekoi, every scene was amply elevated by its choice of bgm. I'm highly receptive to visual and auditory stimulants, so I found myself captivated by a lot of events ,that were poor plot wise, but were done so beautifully that it captured my attention away from the plot but into the art, and even emotions of the characters involved. I think that this is the telos of any soundtrack, to make scenes even more riveting that it would have been otherwise. Excellent soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (80%)\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of Nisekoi may not be its storyline or plot complexity, but instead lies within its characters. Nisekoi has the ability to make all of its characters likable, and this is a very RARE element to have. At the end of the anime, I didn't find myself hating any characters. I do have my preference of who I would like Raku to be with, but this is more of my own personal taste than any loathing that I feel for the rest of the female cast. Of course, this may be due to the lack of complexity of the story, and the author playing it safe with everyone, but there have been anime done with poor plot progression along with horrible and unlikable characters. Nisekoi should applauded for its characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Raku, at first glance seems to be our typical dense lead. He's an average looking person with no particular exceeding talent( maybe besides cooking, but this wasn't developed). He seems to be average in school, his attitude is average of someone of his type, and his character design is slightly different. He has the will to protect his friends, but to be utterly oblivious to obvious signs. He also seems to have the ability to fall asleep in matter of mini seconds, and to wake up just as fast. His redeeming point is that when Raku WANTS to, he can be astute in his observation. There are monologues of his where if given more time, and more info, he would have cracked this mystery surrounding him. Raku is not a stupid generic character, he does have a girl that he is mainly interested in. He acts according to this preference, but again due to poor plot, none of these actions are actualized into substantive events. This is more of a plot issue than a character issue. \\n\\n\\n\r\nChitoge, the blonde bombshell, is the eccentric vivacious main girl. She's loud and obnoxious, and can be unreasonable at times. However, she also have her redeeming qualities. She grew up without having too many friends, and she longs for sisterly companionship. On the inside, she is a compassionate person, that probably has had to put on up a tough mask due to the teasing done to her back in America. It is surprising that she is a strong student considering the shortcomings of the educational system of the U.S, but that is besides the point. If given enough time, Chitoge does become lovely and likable in her own way. \\n\\n\r\nKosaki Onodera seems to correlate with the cute nice shy template. She's not as vivacious as Chitoge, and is too timid to assert herself in the middle of a big crowd. This is not to say that Onodera is complacent, she has willed herself to reveal her feelings numerous times, but again due to improbable and reaching circumstances, these confessions have fell to deaf ears. This is not a character flaw of Onodera, but again a shortcoming of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe remaining cast , in my opinion, just serves to spice up the dynamic between the three characters mentioned above. Tsugumi is a personal favorite of mine, but she doesn't bring any relevance to the plot except for minor details. Maiko is invisible and obscure, besides his sexual tangents, he just brings slight humor. Marika makes a late appearance, however, the appearance is so late that it makes it hard to emphasize with her. Ruri is funny and spices the plot in a good way, but her will cannot beat the incomprehensible twist of Nisekoi. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  (100%)\\n\\n\r\nWith Nisekoi, the parts doesn't equal the whole. There were a lot of details that left me wanting in the first season of Nisekoi, but overall, the anime was quite intriguing and enjoyable. The art and sound compliments each other so well, the characters have an excellent dynamic to leave you laughing and caring for them. There is fan service, but is tastefully done relative to other anime of the same genre. \\n\\n\r\nI do recommend this anime to anyone looking for a strong romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: (90%) With this anime, the categories does not hold the same weight. I am eagerly waiting for a second season.\\n",

For what\u2019s worth, the title is exactly as it implies \u2013 a love based on illusions. But in a way, it\u2019s not exactly what you think. The main male protagonist Raku isn\u2019t after Chitoge, the girl that accidentally kneed him in the morning during his walk to school. Rather, they are bound together in a seemingly contract-esque direction. With the two rival gangs making a truce in theexchange that their children would be a couple, Nisekoi is a show that crafts love with everything that is fake. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of a fake relationship is nothing new in the anime world. Taking a closer look, their relationship has little chemistry in it, at first anyways. Raku and Chitoge aren\u2019t compatible and neither can they stand each other. But nonetheless, they are forced to become a couple or otherwise risk all hell break loose between the two blood thirsty families. Yet, the show does complicate their relationship by introducing all type of challenges. On the innocent side, we have Raku who has a puppy love crush on his classmate, Onodera. Yet unknown to him, we can easily tell that she also shares similar feelings. But what she doesn\u2019t know is where Raku\u2019s true origins lie, and that is with Yuzuka ancestry for the majority of the show. Coming together as a whole, Nisekoi engineers its plot points with multiple angles. There\u2019s a silly outlook on Raku and Chitoge\u2019s relationship as they are constantly trying to avoid their secret being found out. They even avoid each other at times. At the same time, there\u2019s a curious degree coming out of their interactions. The story develops both characters through their interactions with a seemingly genuine commitment. While both partners seems to dislike each other at first, they show their warmer sides on occasions. Furthermore, complicated situations are solved by both of them in elaborate ways. It may be clich\u00e9 but has a stylish way to the whole trope.\\n\\n\r\nOne other flagship of the story involves a mysterious locket that Raku wears. Or maybe I should correct that and say..used to wear. That\u2019s because he loses it when Chitoge accidentally knees him in the face during one faithful morning. Despite being executed as clich\u00e9 with the whole \u2018running in the morning with a bread in the mouth\u2019 concept, it does set up a driving factor for Raku. He is motivated to find the locket not just because it\u2019s something he treasures but also for a promise involving a girl in his past. The show continuously focuses on this point with its various flashbacks dealing with Raku and his present self. What the show does right here is through its various focal points with a number of candidates who can be the true potential key bearer. This brings about a mystery that fans may be anticipating themselves for when the true bearer is finally revealed. But what it doesn\u2019t illustrate correctly is the purpose, as to why Raku made that promise. It will feel like an arduous trip at times with all the misunderstandings and parts when the mystery becomes so close being solved, yet then seemingly goes back to square one. The show also neglects to reveal its secret with its 2 cour run. In fact, some of the episodes feels fillerish that seemingly focuses another daily life of Raku, as the son from an yakuza.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter directional wise, the show offers a diversity with its cast. And of course, it\u2019s a harem show so expect most of the main characters to be the opposite sex of Raku with a keen interest in him. Love triangles are imminent with characters such as Onodera, Tsugumi, and Marika. They do have different personalities but doesn\u2019t escape the usual gags as seen in harem series. It\u2019s a formulaic throwback with the way the characters progression for most of them. But even as feelings deepen, we don\u2019t see much change in Raku. The only eyes he seemingly have for throughout the series is Onodera and the two often find themselves in awkward situations thanks to a girl named Ruri. It doesn\u2019t help by the fact that his classmate Shu plays almost a partner in crime with the schemes. Other characters often play roles with the misunderstandings and slight progress between our fake couple. But most times, Raku is dense as a rock and his characterization is frozen stone cold.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a staggering predictability for fans that might have been thought up in the beginning. That would be the realization of perhaps a \u2018false\u2019 love becoming perhaps, real. In fact, the developing aspects of Raku and Chitoge is a prominent feature. Despite disliking each other for their circumstances, Raku shows Chitoge genuine kindness and offers her help when she needs it the most. This in return causes Chitoge to question her own feelings. Tossing the clich\u00e9 aside, there is actual development between the duo and furthermore ties together the plot involving the locket. Unfortunately, there is no escape of the jealousy, tsundere reactions, and blander misunderstandings you\u2019ll see in typical harem shows. For what\u2019s worth, Nisekoi demonstrates this in a more violent way with the way the premise is set up. The \u2018transfer student\u2019 gag is still there but has a more edgy taste to it. It\u2019s presented as intentionally silly with nickname calling such as Chitoge being labeled as the \u201cgorilla woman\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nA noticeable census coming with Nisekoi is the way director Akiyuki Shinobo pinpoints the various scenes of this show. The romantic comedy side is obviously presented but he shapes it in a way that is unorthodox. It\u2019s the way the character shifts their heads, the star shape coloring during weird scenes, and recreational subsidies of parodies in the backgrounds during more climatically crafted scenes. Having previously worked on shows such as Bakemonogatari, Arakawa Under the Bridge, and Puella Magi Madoka Magica, it\u2019s easy to tell his innovative ideas here. This can come as a mixed bag as not all fans appreciate this stylish coordination. Given the fact that the show is a romantic comedy also might stir up some mixed reactions. But nonetheless, it can be distracting yet feels creative. \\n\\n\r\nAs a romantic comedy, the other half comes with the fun and laughter. Given the direction of Nisekoi, the show tries its comedy in a variety of ways. With Shaft being the brainchild, expect colorful gags, avant-garde, and a bit of hyperactivity with each episode. Then, there\u2019s the misunderstandings that will draw out both laughs and frustrations with its repetitiveness. The mastermind is usually Ruri that becomes involved since Raku is too shy to make his own move on most occasions. The dialogues can also feel cheesy with the trollish moments the various characters tries to induce.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork should be labeled as unique, not different but a specialty. Shaft handles the production and it\u2019s fairly easy to spot its artistic gags. The head tilts, background cinematic, and even character designs have an innovative way for this rom-com. But for what\u2019s worth, there\u2019s nothing really that stands out with the way Raku looks. As the main male protagonist, he looks just like the average high school student. But for Chitoge, she comes off as a beauty with foreign blood pumping in her veins along with that scarlet ribbon. Then, there\u2019s also Onodera with her cute innocence that serves more as the antithesis of Chitoge. Other characters\u2019 designs also defines their personalities from the surface with their words and actions. In particular, Marika and Onodera are designed with innocent beauty and elegance. Some of the trollish expressions and scenes are also decorated with silliness. But as usual for most harem series, you should expect bits of fan service with the classic onsen and beach episodes. Bring out the fun in the sun, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is noticeable but also feels silly. By silly, it\u2019s exaggerated sometimes with its amateurish tone along with its goofy coordination. But despite this, it mixes with well with comical scenes, which most of the time is as result of a domino effect. Sound director Toshiki Kameyama, known for directing numerous shows of different genres performs the overall OST with balance. Similarly, the OP and ED songs are made well with strengths in its tones. On the other hand, character voices can come off sometimes as irritating in particular with Raku and his stubbornness. The bitter chatter between him and Chitoge will feel repetitive as if they are a married couple already. On the other hand, Onodera\u2019s voice can be sweet thanks to Kana Hanazawa and her performance with more innocent characters. It counterbalances the Yakuza theme with the gangs and trifling violence going on. Marika\u2019s kansai accent can also raise a few eyebrows during climatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi is a show that is hard to fully appreciate. This is probably because of the premise and what fans may expect. And you\u2019re not wrong either because it has the harem gags, fan service bits, and non-sensational dialogues that are easily forgettable. Yet, it does have a plot, one that invites questions and theories. With its small cast of characters, they also become actors and actresses in the story with each of their role holding some meaning. At the same time, the colorful Shaft style will be something that will be memorable. Put yourself into Raku\u2019s shoes and the image will come more clearly. It\u2019s not easy living a life with a yakuza background you know.\\n",

            "content": "[WARNING: Slightly long review ahead. You can get by by reading the \"In short\" sections]\r\nI was not interested in this show. The manga was the epitome of \"Generic Harem.\" I don't think there isn't one cliche that hasn't happened in the series yet. From the characters' reactions to the actual settings of events, everything gave me a sense of Deja vu on the scale of the Endless Eight (only 2000s kids would get this reference!). So I anticipated this adaptation to bring exactly nothing new. It would be another bland series to add to every season's list of bland Harem Anime.\r\nBut then something happened. Ifyou head over to the Nisekoi Anime announcement news article (you can find it here on MAL), you would discover that it began with soft squeals of excitement and nearly uniform cheers by manga fans. As you scrolled along, you would find a chorus-like echo of horror at the studio choice: Shaft. Looking at the thread might even feel like discovering the death of a civilization. IT felt almost as if I were looking at an ancient species discovering a cure to some disease, only to find that very cure would end their entire race.\\n\\n\r\nBut even then, I wasn't interested in this series. After chapter 60 of the manga (when my marathon ended), it felt like a slowly eroding cluster of repetition of cliches and never progressing plot. It wasn't until a whole year after it began did I start watching it. I finished it in two, no, three days after downloading from Nyaa.\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi, despite all of its cliches, is probably the best Harem series in recent years. It is also probably the purest example of the Harem genre. Should harem series ever go out of fashion and end in production, this should be the one harem series to show your grand kids what a \"Harem\" Anime was (I'm sure by then Japan's population will explode to overtake China's).\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a paradox. Its strength is the sheer attention the creators paid to subtle details. Even if you didn't like the manga, you might still find this series enjoyable. And if you haven't been keen on Harem series before, this could be your gateway series.\\n\\n\r\nlet's examine the aspects of the series and whether you will enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nUndoubtedly the most important aspect of a Harem Anime is its cast. And you know the show has done it well when it's know as \"Battle of the Best Girls\" among the online community.\\n\r\nThe character of this series are generic in a sense of the word. All of them are \"Tsunderes\" in various doses of \"Tsun.\" \\n\r\nHowever, there's clear character progression and backstory giving. This is most prominently seen in Chitoge, whose changes in behavior is most apparent. From her discovery of her connection to the main character to her treatment of the main character, all are subtly altered as events unfold. \\n\r\nWhile they can all be labeled with a name from TvTropes, the other characters are no slouches either. \\n\r\nMarika, Tsugumi, and Onodera each have their own respective charm and characterizations. \\n\r\nUnlike most harem series, the characters were clearly not a mash of cliches and actually felt like they EXISTED.\\n\r\nEven the main character, who can be wrote off as the typical \"indecisive and dense male tsundere,\" has his own characterization. His motivations and actions are consistent with his initial personality, and he has enough \"tsun\" to not come off as a bitch (granted, some views might still experience frustrations with him).\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest touch in characterizing the cast is the addition of monologues when they think about something. When their hands touch, when the MC gets horny, they're all given reasons and detailed descriptions on why the character feels that way (which is strengthened by the visuals).\\n\r\nAlso, the girls are often depicted as Moe. The Studio avoided flaunting their bodies and turning show into another Harem-ecchi show where \"characters\" are poor excuses to show off the body designs (they know their audience!).\\n\\n\r\nIn short: the attention to detail, as well as balance of screen time between the girls give the cast vivid characterization(and not to mention more significant side characters compared to the spiritual predecessors).\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Story/Whatever:\\n\r\nHaving a mandatory \"story\" rating is probably the rating system's greatest flaw. The story of Nisekoi is not epic. It's not something that you'd expect to find on Gurren Lagann's level. However, not emphasizing on the \"plot\" is its exact strength.\\n\r\nWith modern Anime often taking the form of 1 cour short series (to lower cost), time is often squeezed. Sometimes, this is worsened by the existence of other sub-plots that don't necessarily help characterize.\\n\r\nEven worse is when producers choose to forgo characterization and instead stuff a bundle of cliches into character, taking up more time and reducing the quality of characterization.\\n\r\nThankfully, Nisekoi has no such problem.\\n\r\nIt's story is simple: Raku Ichijou, the protagonist, made a vague promise with a girl 10 years ago in which they promise to fulfill when the meet. They would verify each other's identities with a locket that Raku keeps, and a key the the girl keeps.\\n\r\nAs a subplot, powerful family members (mobs, police, etc) of the girls are kept in check by Raku having a precarious balance of relationship with all of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nThat was the synopsis, but how did they handle the story? The show never takes its subplot too seriously. The story focuses on Raku and the mystery from 10 years ago with the family problems occasionally pushing the characters to interact. The subplot, however, is never taken \"on a bus.\" It's always there, never too neglected nor too concentrated on. The side characters are given screen time to a certain extent, never to the point where we forget that they exist. They add a wonderful touch. \\n\\n\r\nIn short: The handling of the story is pretty much spot on.  It is used to advance the character interaction and never too central as to detract character growth, but also never taken for granted. Events flew smoothly and felt as if they were REAL.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAudio:\\n\r\nProbably the weakest department, yet still well matched to the series. There's no specific style that can be heard from the BGM. Everything felt like they fit the scene and made them better experiences.\\n\r\nThe OPs are sang by ClariS. I didn't feel too moved by them. The tunes and themes sounded about the same as many other Anime OPs. \\n\r\nVery cheerful, harmonious sounds that borders boring (each to his own, you might like them).\\n\r\nHowever, I have to add that is an ending theme song for each of the girls, so that's something to enjoy.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was perfect, spot on. Every character sounded exactly as I imagined them to sound. Chitoge with her bossy, slightly cheerful voice. Onodera voiced by KanaHana. Claude's authoritative, maniacal voice, and so on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals:\\n\r\nProbably the greatest concern for many manga fans. Famous from their Monogatari and Madoka Magicias series\u2019, Shaft is known for their unique depictions of the series' world. Many feared (especially with the train wreck of Mekakucity Actors) that Shaft would render Nisekoi's world into unrecognizable Pseudo-spaces.\\n\r\nBoy were they wrong.\\n\r\nWhile the now-iconic Shaft \u201cSpin around to do an action\u201d and head tilt are still there, Nisekoi is a far cry from Nisekoi-monogatari. I would say this is probably the greatest improvement the manga has had (the manga\u2019s backgrounds, from what I remember, might as well as have been drawn by Tite Kubo). \\n\r\nThe characters are animated fluidly. The motions sprinkled in by Shaft do nothing to detract the series. Far from it, the exaggerated nature of the source\u2019s plotline (gangsters stop fighting thanks to teenage dating) actually made Shaft\u2019s liberal interpretations appropriate. Tsugumi\u2019s chase scenes are animated with multitudes of guns, a feat that melts into the world of Nisekoi\u2019s surreal world of spins and tilts. Zoom-ins are appropriate, with barely any ecchi (or so it felt) and a lot of focus on character expression. The irrelevant background characters, deservedly, are at times animated as gray blocks similar to Durarara and Mawaru Penguindrum. And the backgrounds are EXTRAVAGANT. I\u2019m talking about 1920s Gatsby-style parties extravagance here. Though this is oddly appropriate due to the nature of the girls (Ojou-samas and generally influential girls). If not extravagant, the backgrounds are detailed and suit the theme. Everythign was beautiful, essentially, and much better compared to the manga.\\n\r\nCharacters are sometimes animated in chibi style, amplifying their moe-ness and comical relief factor.\\n\r\nMany of the backgrounds (such as the forest) are drawn with detail. Shaft certainly didn't cheap out on their background.\\n\\n\r\nIn short: All of these touches made Nisekoi\u2019s world (as much as I hate this word) unforgettable. it stands far and above many other Harem series in atmosphere due to the willingness to be exaggerate the world boldly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLast Words:\\n\r\nWith a consistent and well characterized cast, as well as vivid yet realistic depiction of the world, good enough sound (great voice acting), and a story that recognizes its strengths and but never mistreated, Shaft\u2019s Nisekoi adaptation paints a surreal world that\u2019s grounded in reality by character interaction. It is surely the standard bearer for Harem Anime to come. If they come at all (hint, look at next season\u2019s list).\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I think it\u2019s time for me to hit the bookshelves and download some chapters of Nisekoi.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: After I started to read the manga, I remembered that after the 50 chapters or so, the manga regresses and turns into something close to a CSI TV show: plotless, digestable, short, weekly chapters. For a WHILE. Just saying, the first portion of the manga IS the Anime, but the successive portions are very different. Hopefully it gets better.",

            "content": "It is that time of the season again. Where that legendary anime studio, that every anime fan and their mother knows the name of, Shaft, comes with another adaptation where they put their own technical chops into. Regardless of whatever manga or light novel they want to adapt, especially when Akiyuki Shinbo is head of production, they always want to shift their own spin on it to make it their own unique vision. The results are either really good or very mediocre. Thankfully with Shaft\u2019s recent show, Nisekoi, it is one of those on their filmography that deserves to be on the former side ofthe spectrum.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing really much to criticize or praise about Nisekoi\u2019s plot, under the premise that there\u2019s not much that you could regard as a significant plot. While it isn\u2019t magnificent, the show doesn\u2019t really try to build it up as anything but silly and frivolous in its storytelling, which leads into its comedic writing. Even when Nisekoi tries to be serious and heartwarming, it still has an edge where it comes across as pandering silliness to it to, to the point where it comes off almost as parody. What does save the show from being terrible from this angle is the comedic writing being very spot-on and sharp in its dialogue, and how the show presents it in its pacing. Shaft\u2019s idea of comedy come from Shinbo\u2019s great direction, with his recognizable camera angles and his obsession with putting it directly at a character\u2019s face whenever a significant comedic moment happens. The comedic timing has a great hook to it as well. With the experimental editing, it makes the comedic timing and its pacing stand out very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nDirectly in-conjunction with the comedy in what makes Nisekoi appealing to watch is the characters. All are very diverse in their personalities, based on their own archetype that they fill in for the plot. Right away, you can clearly see how these roles seem very similar in tropes; the loud-mouthed tsundere, the long-time childhood friend who has a crush on the protagonist, the protagonist\u2019s perverted friend and so on. Like I said before, the self-parodied way Shaft implements its comedy doesn\u2019t necessarily put down the characters from having these cliched tropes, with the exception of the perverted friend who doesn\u2019t leave much of an impression. Most of them still have enormous charm and charisma to their personalities, which make them worthwhile to laugh out loud towards. What does make a harem cast extremely well done is the fact that you find all of the characters likable, and in that respect, you wouldn\u2019t mind whoever the protagonist goes out with. I could consider Nisekoi, along with Sora no Otoshimono and Boku wa Tomodachi, to be one of the few that actually fulfills this aspect quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nTo start picking out characters individually, our main protagonist, Ichijou, actually proves to be a likable character in spite what many might point out how he never seems to bat an eye to how certain girls might see him. Chitoge, the beautiful blonde girl and our main heroine, is a ton of fun to see in many hilarious attempts at being entertaining from her charming personality and studious stature, despite being fragile underneath it. Our childhood friend character, Onodera, might seem like the most uninteresting out of the rest at first, but as she grows onto you, she is in no shortage of getting a lot of laughs and cuteness, thanks in part to Kana Hanazawa\u2019s great performance. The tomboy of this lovely harem is named Tsumugi, who has less screen-time than most of the girls. This shouldn\u2019t knock down the significant aura she ushers in Nisekoi, that and I\u2019m a huge sucker for tomboys. Finally we have Marika, the snooty and conniving girl that promised marriage from a childhood oath to our protagonist. Even though I wouldn\u2019t call her out as being kind of dull and overly conniving in too many places, the writers all did a decent job of adding in some twists here and there to make her at least stand out to the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of animation brought by Shaft in Nisekoi is absurd and almost incomprehensible in some places to describe from how they portray certain comedic situations. However, whether it goes through those hilarious situations or not, the animation still has that same spark of creativity that Shaft has been known for since their inception. Their ability to transcend all of the characters\u2019 art designs into deformed designs create a very visceral outlook to the insane amount of wacky humor that is present in Nisekoi. On the technical side of things, there are no obvious signs of corners being cut with the budget that Shaft had to work around with. Characters flow fluidly enough to garner some recognition for the animators who worked hard on making the girls look very cute and funny in motion.\\n\\n\r\nAudio department is in no short of brilliance for Nisekoi, besides the fact that the music is nothing too special from the usual synthesizer instrumentation that you typically hear in most anime shows. Nisekoi gathers some of the best voice actors in the business that all work extremely well together, adding to the characters\u2019 distinctive voices. Kana Hanazawa has definitely redeemed herself after a couple of underwhelming shows these past two seasons by playing the lovable Onodera. Her attempts at being embarrassed are in no short of hilarity and cuteness from her brilliant talent. The recent starlet, Nao Touyama, plays the heroine Chitoge, and she is definitely having a ball with playing her in what can be considered her first tsundere role. Needless to say, she needs to play more in her future career. The last one in the main cast is Kouki Uchiyama, who plays harem protagonists that can be hit or miss, but he actually does a pretty nice job with Ichijou in giving him a nice needed level of sympathy and style to his comedic performance.\\n\\n\r\nObserving the overall basis for Nisekoi will leave people feeling that Nisekoi only adds more on the table of bland romance shows in a harem on the drawing board. The strange truth is that it definitely is, but the show doesn\u2019t try to be what it\u2019s not. It\u2019s proud of being another generic harem show and proudly displays itself out of the rest. That might seem like a strange recommendation at first, but when you have the brilliant team behind Shaft that adds so much layers of depth to the show\u2019s comedy and characters, there are very few things not to like about Nisekoi. This and many other shows that Shaft has made that are similar to Nisekoi are living proof that you can guarantee the talent Shaft has in creating a story that is seemingly done before, but adds fresh twists to it to make it feel exciting enough to sit down and watch it from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "Before you write off my review because of its very low rating I'd appreciate it if you actually read what I have to say first. I'm not about to slate it off for an incomprehensible reason. This is also my first review so I'd appreciate feedback even more. Feel free to disagree with me/point out things I've missed/etc.\r\nIntroduction:\r\nSo, Nisekoi. The anime that left me so badly conflicted I felt compelled to write a review about it. The anime that had me cursing at the screen every five minutes. The anime that had potential and completely failed to live up to it. It's safe to saythat this show left me with a rather bitter taste in my mouth - and for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nStory (1/10):\\n\\n\r\n[potential spoiler alert]\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I want to state about this is that I have absolutely no problem with the premise. You might have considered it your average harem story with zero elements of creativity and nothing new. To be quite honest, I couldn't care less. I enjoy a good romance and I don't completely hate harem shows - so long as they're executed well. Even if it's 'generic', the plot still had potential. The idea behind the key-in-the-lock scenario and the forced relationship I thought was actually a very good one. From the synopsis and the early stages of the show I had high expectations and thought it was going to be a very good show. From there, it all went downhill.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're taking the comedic approach, as this show does, there are times where you need to understand your level of seriousness. This, simply put, doesn't. The example I'll give here one of the times when Kosaki is trying her hardest to convey her feelings to Raku - the one where they get interrupted by that baseball smashing through the window. A scene like that could have been literally perfect. The innocent, shy character gathering up her courage to make her sweet confession. The following reciprocation. How else could you make a scene more golden? It would've even added spice to the plot surrounding his fa\u00e7ade with Chitoge. \\n\\n\r\nYet, the writers proceed to completely ruin it for 'comedic effect'. When that ball smashes through the window it destroys the serious & tense atmosphere completely and contributes to the (supposedly 'funny') running gag where she gets interrupted every time she tries to make her confession. You know, like that one where she kind-of succeeds but Raku is asleep. It's not funny at all. It only served to phenomenally irritate me every time it happened and make me scream \"THIS ISN'T HOW IT WORKS!!\" every so often. Perhaps this might not annoy me as much if she'd actually succeeded in the end - I'd have felt relieved, perhaps. I know there's a second season but by that point the story had already been destroyed beyond redemption. No chance of a comeback there. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're going include elements of seriousness you have to make it work. Nisekoi just tries to be something and fails. You can have serious elements in a comedic/silly show and have them work. This tries to combine the two and suffers horrifically as a result.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of it being destroyed beyond redemption, the next bit I want to talk about is the plot's development & progression. Remember when I said the key-in-the-lock scenario had potential? Yeah, that didn't survive for too long did it? That could have gone places with Chitoge/Kosaki story development. Plot twists, anyone? Instead, it gets stolen right in front of our faces by the mighty Marika Tachibana - who is, in my eyes, the most pointless character ever to exist in anime. She serves no real purpose other than to make Nisekoi a full-on harem when it doesn't actually need to be one. Her, and her involvements, are just large amounts of time wasted. Time that could have been spent writing a better, more progressive plot where things actually happen. \\n\\n\r\nI mean, literally, nothing happens. At all. Time is filled and wasted. Raku, at the end, is practically in the same position as he was in the first couple of episodes - wanting to be with Kosaki but not being able to - just with the addition of a pointless, third character who wants him.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the animation isn't a massive influence on how much a show is likable. In this case it doesn't really matter at all. It is nice to look at though and doesn't feel shabby by any means. \\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nSame thing, really. The music wasn't bad by any means, it just didn't pack any real punch. All the songs were mediocrities. \\n\\n\r\nIf it counts for this section, the voice acting was good as well. Not that I really know any shows with crappy voice acting (excluding dubs).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters were decent, even the secondary ones like Ruri. They were just let down by bad writing. I really liked most of them and it's a shame that this show didn't live up to its potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I have, as mentioned earlier, is with Marika, who is the most unnecessary character ever. The show could've been rewritten without her and become about a hundred times better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10):\\n\\n\r\nYou can't have a good show without a good story. In summary, good characters + a good premise were simply let down by bad writing. The art and music aren't going to make up for an error like that and, as such, lead to a very irritating & disappointing viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't expect the show to be bags of seriousness, it just needed a bit more than it had to do what I thought it should have done. At least incredibly stupid shows don't try to be things they're not.\\n\\n\r\nExtra:\\n\\n\r\nAgain, feel free to disagree with me and thanks for taking the time to read this. I encourage any criticism - it'd help me to write better reviews in the future.\\n",

            "content": "Updated: 13, July 2016\r\nI regret initially writing off Nisekoi as another run-of-the-mill romance-comedy. Though preposterous and frantic at its core, Shaft knew exactly how to exploit the source material using trademark visual and directional cues. The results boast of vivid color and heavenly charm, most evidently in the heat of moments between Raku and Chitoge. Venture beyond the surface of dense personalities and logical fallacies, and what remains to be seen underneath is a love-hate spectacular in its purest state. \r\nTreading back on my mention of density and fallacies, both detriments were loud and clear for much of the run. Ramifications dimmed the lights onwhat could have been a blockbuster showcase between premier rivals. Whenever Chitoge or Kosaki would garner momentum to close in on Raku, the most timely of occurrences or character appearances would quickly separate the participants as a boxing referee would. The supporting members were irrelevant outside of interfering with Raku, Chitoge, or Kosaki, or distracting the audience by means of cheesy punchlines, retorts, and archetypal behaviors. \\n\\n\r\nDivisive components meshed together to form a predictable, cyclic scheme sapping this series of its true potential. Developments were overly reliant on genre stereotypes and misunderstandings. It really is a shame, considering how intimate conversations involving Raku and the main heroines were meaningful, sensible, and even nostalgic in my case. These are all moments that mark a fine reminder to what falling in love should be about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS onward (based on final impressions).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe lock-and-key mystery should have been resolved with more urgency or geared with fascinating implications in the long run. Snapping the key after all that commotion was downright cruel, a wasteful hype charade with little substance or significance. And why keep the clingy and shallow Marika in the dark for so long? Her facile presence lacked sincerity, while her grounds of adhering to events well in the past were baseless.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the cake itself was unsatisfactory, the finale brought its own complimentary spread of flavorful toppings. Tragic for all the wrong reasons, this unconventional spin on a legendary epic fell right into the series\u2019 wheelhouse of comic relief and execution on-the-fly. How sweet it was to watch Raku and Kosaki give the script a second go! The invigorating inclusion really sent this spectacle out with a bang, one that could very well pay dividends in the future.",

            "content": "I'll say it from the get-go that Nisekoi was a highly enjoyable anime to watch and I would recommend it to any anime fans that like shounen comedies and tsundere characters. \r\nNisekoi is about Raku Ichigyou, the son of the head of the Shue-gumi yakuza group, who at 6 years old, met and fell for a girl he now does not remember. The only thing he remembers is that they made a promise to marry each other when they met again, and would identify each other by the locket and key they exchanged. Raku has held onto this locket for 10 years in the hopeof reuniting with her. He currently has a crush on a girl named Onodera, a friend from middle school, and hopes she is the girl he is looking for. His life is turned upside down though when he encounters the pretty but aggressive Chitoge Kirisaki, and though they don't get along, through family circumstances they are forced to act as fake boyfriend and girlfriend. Nisekoi shows this hilarious fake couple as they develop their \"relationship\" in front of their friends and classmates. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nRidiculous, cliche, but utterly HILARIOUS. It is not really unique in any way but man the collaboration of the characters just makes it work so well. It's a \"tale of 2 families\" type story just like Romeo and Juliet (which they cleverly make a reference to) with a lot of twists, turns and love interests. It uses very common storylines; the beach episode, the school trip (and typical ridiculousness that usually happens), the school festival and so on but they are still funny to watch regardless. The story gets an 8/10 mostly because I was not satisfied with the ending but I think this is due to the fact that another season may be coming. If one does come, the score would definitely be bumped up to at least a 9 as there would be a chance for a true ending and resolution between characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely stunning. Such effective use of colour and movement in the animation. CodeProvider (on YouTube) pointed out that even the grass in this anime stood out as beautiful...like come on. You usually don`t hear someone say \"man that`s some sick grass\". The movements are just so fluid it brings a great sense of realism. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe first opening theme is so catchy. It was a real stand out for me. The second opening is pretty nice as well, and ending themes are both alright. But besides that, to be honest I did not notice much in terms of music just because I was so into the story myself, but I guess that is not totally a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters were what made the anime so enjoyable. They had such a great combination of personalities. Raku and Chitoge are absolutely hilarious together. Watching them bicker but watch each other's backs was just an enjoyable experience. Chitoge may tie with Taiga (from Toradora) as my favourite tsundere character, as she is both ruthless and adorable beyond belief. Onodera started off seeming shy and a little boring, but really turned out to be funny and at times pretty aggressive (in terms of love). What I really appreciated was that all Raku's love interests (4 in total...go Raku!!! :P) all had something likable about them, which I find usually isn't the case. My stand-out supporting characters are most definitely Ruri (Onodera's best friend) and Tsugumi (Chitoge's childhood companion) who are funny, smart and just have the best reactions to EVERYTHING. I am hoping for a second season to get further development with all these characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 \\n\r\nYou can already tell that I really enjoyed the series and so there is no need to explain the score given. It's a shounen comedy, so I think it has something for everyone; fan service for the guys, and cute but strong female characters for the independent women out there :P I would recommend if you do watch it, to prepare to read the manga as more than likely you will want to know what happens next. As far as I know, there have been no announcements for a second season but I am eagerly anticipating one. \\n",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of romantic comedies and this anime hit the jackpot for me. This anime is full of cute moments which will keep you intrigued however, i had a tendency to lose interest. I'll start with the story.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nDon't get me wrong, the story is great and keeps your mind predicting what's going to happen next but, it starts to lean away from the whole point of the show. You'll notice that it drags on and some episodes don't even have anything to do with the story, it's just another way for the author to add some 'chummy' moments between the protagonist andone of the girls. If it wasn't for all those cute, romantic moments i would have given it a 8/10. In addition, i finished this anime feeling incomplete so hopefully there's going to be a 2nd season as i don't really like reading manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is so good, but that's probably common for 2014 anime's so I'm not really that blown away. It's as if every 2014 anime now has a 9+/10 art. I like how they emphasize on characters through the simple use of colours. What i mean is that, you would notice that they give insignificant characters in the background a colour/pattern which makes the main characters stand out in contrast.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI liked how the opening was catchy and upbeat which is always nice. Unlike most anime's, with Nisekoi - i watched the whole opening every episode just to appreciate it and increase my morale. There were no soundtracks during the show which actually stood out however, these soundtracks don't really have much of an impact on me. I just think that the opening is key, as it sort of prepares you for what's coming. In addition, the voices are good i didn't notice anything wrong.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nTo be put bluntly, they are very common characters. Almost everyone in this anime is so shy and ignorant. This leaves room for lots of complications. On the other hand, they develop nicely over time as each of them have their own little 'spotlight episode' which allows the viewers to connect with the characters. Due to the common personalities, you feel like you're familiar with them which made it easier to understand them and how they feel.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime gave me butterflies in my stomach due to the amount of lovey-dovey moments there are. You could predict when they were going to happen which was the best part of it. Whenever boredom crossed my mind a wild romantic moment appears! Because of this, i didn't get bored and managed to finish this anime within 2 days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI feel that there was so much potential for this show which is why I'm giving it a 9. But, i made a mistake of judging the rest of the anime based on the first few episodes which got me slightly disappointed. Once i finished it i said to myself \"meh, it was alright\". It's going to be in the top tier on my list though, just not the top.",

            "content": "Nisekoi, or Fake Love, follows a fairly standard romcom template, except done better. \r\nWarning: may have mild spoilers\r\nDisclaimer: did not actually watch 2000 episodes of Nisekoi\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe basis for the story is not exactly generic for a romcom, but isn't extraordinary by any means. A guy meets a girl and immediate hates her after she knees him in the face and they're forced to become a couple lest a gang war breaks out. Throughout the story, a few more characters show up and the main characters get somewhat closer; that's honestly all the plot development that there is in Nisekoi, bar the last few episodes.Thus, most episodes are romcom staples, such as the onsen episode, the cultural festival episode, the beach episode, the pool episode, the test of courage episode, the hanabi episode, etc. All in all, the story is neither really unique nor really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nConsidering it's Shaft, the art and animation were quite excellent. Nisekoi's style was a bit different from other Shaft anime we know and love(or hate), such as the Monogatari series and Mekakucity Actors. While the art tilted to more traditional(or generic?) styles, there were still plenty of signature Shaft touches, such as the abstract pattern backgrounds, etc. I enjoyed especially Chitoge and Raku's many expressions of shock. Regardless of the uniqueness of the art style, the animation was still very fluid, and overall the art is superb.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was not outstanding per se, but it was still fairly decent . The openings and endings were catchy, if not a bit generic, and the background music was fairly standard, with a track for each  corresponding scene (such as a light track for awkward moments between Raku and every other girl).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nEssentially your average romcom characters. You have Raku, the really nice son of a yakuza head who inadvertently gets lots of hot girls in the class (who all happen to be childhood friends) and is pretty much hated by all the guys in the class for this reason. There are 3 main girls- Chitoge, Onodera, and Marika. Chitoge is an academically superior tsundere who enjoys abusing Raku and is the daughter of a the leader of an American gang. Onodera is an extremely shy girl who loves Raku, who happens to love her, yet both are afraid to confess to each other. Marika (shows up later in the story) is a potentially yandere daughter of the police commissioner, who is absolutely obsessed with Raku. There are also minor-ish ones such as Tsugumi, a romantically confused assassin who works for Chitoge's gang. Maiko is Raku's best friend, and enjoys nothing more than to get Raku together with other girls, even though he's in a fake relationship with Onodera. Ruri is Onodera's best friend, and pretty much her goal in life is to get Onodera to confess to Raku and have them become a couple. Overall, some fairly generic characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nDespite its story (or lack thereof), and generic characters, I enjoyed watching Nsekoi. Even though on the surface it looks like a fairly generic anime, I did look forward for the new episode each Saturday. Although the overarching story was fairly generic and made virtually no progress throughout the anime, each episode was fairly interesting and had its comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI guess there's really not much more to say. If you enjoy romcoms, then definitely check this one out. It's much better than the run-of-the-mill romcom (looking at you, Date a Live).",

The promise is sealed with a key (literally) as the girl locked a locket with a key and gave it to raku as a means for them to find eachother again. 10 years later he's a teenager in highschool. Like most adolesent males he's thinking about girls. The girl he particularly has his eyes on is Onodera. The two had flirted all through middle school and were preping to do the same in high school. That is, untill transfer student Chitoge slammed her way into his life and due to certain family circumstances they are forced to pretend to date. Then to add even more feul to the fire of potential they both have keys. This raises so many questions: Which key is the right one? Is he going to start to love Chitoge or will his flirtationship with Onodera stop him? Is he going to remain true to his promise he made as a kid or will he move on and date who he loves? The anime slowly feeds these questions with dates with both of the girls and signals that both of the girls like him. Then at a climax the show has Chitoge try the locket to see if she's the girl. The locket breaks leaving the questions the show gives us on hold untill the locket is repaired (which doesn't really happen).  This would be no problem to me if the show didn't end the way it did. Instead of bringing he locket back for a great climatic finale that resolves all of the questions invokes upon us the ending features Raku reconciling with Harem Girl A, Chitoge after a fight. This climax has nothing to do with the sideplot whatsoever. Then in the second season the show finally hammers the nail into the coffin by telling us the locket will never be fixed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf it wern't obvoius from the rant above, watching nisekoi was not enjoyable. I would have enjoyed it better if they hadn't included the backstory subplot and just focused on the Romatic Comedy section. Also if they just had all of the girls in the begining intead of adding them every 3-4 episodes that would be great. And every girl doesn't need a key.\\n\\n\r\n**Disclaimer**\\n\r\n **Nisekoi is kinda a show without spoilers cause harems never have a proper conclusion so don't get your panties in a twist with the plot events that I've mentioned.**",

            "content": "Bear w/ me now, I never read the manga, and most likely won't continue on to the 2nd season once it airs. POSSIBLE SPOILERS.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story was your typical bland harem rom-com anime. There was obviously something enticing about it, though, because I watched it through to the end. I wasn't a big fan of the tsundere female lead, however I am a bit biased, because I view tsundere caricatures as filler characters that are very clich\u00e9. Why? Because like in this anime, the tsundere often doesn't undergo real character development. It's often never gradual and happens rather predictably. \"Oh, I'm in love w/ so-and-sonow.\" What? You just suddenly decided this, after many years of self-denial and abusive behavior? And these characters expect to be treated like they were never cruel in the first place. \\n\r\nSecondly, I'm just not a harem fan. Again, there's bias...but I don't like how supposedly average or unnoticed guys in school life anime suddenly have all these new girls introduced, often transfer students, that fawn over him for literally no reason. I get that these characters exist so the audience can sort of \"step in their shoes,\" but I'd much rather have a fleshed out protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10 \\n\r\nCute, nice, colorful...nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nI basically highlighted everything under Story...all the character designs have been done before. Nothing new here, not even the family dynamics (check Ranma 1/2).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10 \\n\r\nDespite all that, I found it entertaining. During times of great distress or simply just boredom, it's nice to kick back and watch a mindless anime. This is one of those.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10",

            "content": "Critic's note- This review has solely been written (rushed) for personal pleasure purposes, I had to put an end to these tickling palms, these hands that itch to write a review for each anime I watch, After a long hiatus, here I break my silence. A review by me is going up after a long time so please go easy on me minna ;) \r\nSome people may be sad that Nisekoi has ended (for now because due to the manga's popularity a second season has been confirmed) but I'm relieved that I won't have to dutifully watch it every week.\r\nEven though this anime is thetalk of the last season, It needs a fresh review, as all the others were done midway. The plot was simple and tranquil from the very start, I haven't read the manga but for those who watch a considerable amount of anime,don't have to read the manga to decide on Nisekoi's future. It still felt unfair to review something in it's incomplete state because I wanted to give Nisekoi a chance.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start by giving a brief synopsis. Two childhood friends make a promise to meet and (marry??) when they grow up, The guy and the girl agree to keep a lock and a key, the guy has the pendant lock and the girl holds the key (to his heart) cliche? I am not going to focus on the protagonist who is a jerk but the two heroines, Chitoge and Onodera as I remember are irritating and stupid, respectively. Onodera being so gullibly foolish it was almost cute. Familiar, heh? So, 10 years have passed, Raku's still holding onto his promise and the pendant, and there's a new (Tsundere) girl at school and they are forced into a relationship for the next 3 years, Hence the name Nisekoi \"False Love\" .\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much of a plot and I didn't come here expecting an adventure but there's that tiniest bit of disappointment, Just because it's SHAFT and because Nisekoi came to me as a recommendation from a very dear friend, the Art is gorgeous, I wouldn't expect any less from them. The background and minor details intrigued me very much but ill try not to drool too much over that. I didn't see much scope for plot or character development. Now, SHAFT doesn't disappoint in its production and presentation but SHAFT has always been discreet.Watch Nisekoi in HD or don't watch it at all. The fact that Nisekoi was made to look pretty and it fulfills the purpose, it targeted that type of audience, but SHAFT u have earned a rep. you do better, for example Bakemonogatari [i am only mentioning it as people wont stop comparing the two] it had great art and a great plot. Nisekoi, is nowhere near that league. \\n\\n\r\nI know there are every kinds of people and every type of anime fans, we all have different likings and it makes the anime community so diverse and awesome, some like pretty art and it's their choice, they will love this anime but to go on and say it's a unique adaption, this can't get any better or that SHAFT couldn't do better. For them, either your only watching anime for it's art or you really need to watch more anime or read more manga before u think you're ready to go and write a review, because u don't want to mislead other viewers, right? As for me, I would rather watch Nodame cantabile (average art style) with a decent storyline than watch something excessively overhyped with these...(you get me)\\n\\n\r\nI don't hate the music but its nothing \"larger than life\" The OP is ok but of the kind that will be skipped, IMO the second OP by ClariS does much better and it's likely that I'll like to listen to it.\\n\r\nI like mainstream anime, In fact I love Slice of Life that has beautiful art and a decent gist but Nisekoi is a mainstream anime that isn't even worthwhile SHAFT's time, It belongs to KyoAni. Lesser number of episodes could have made Nisekoi likable, it's okay to marathon in one sitting but being 20 episodes long it feels like it's just dragging on and on... [what does it matter because I am through already]\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi is not a substantial anime not by a long shot but none of this means it isn't enjoyable, Nisekoi is flawed and everyone sees that, I guess except the delusional fans of the manga. I ain't telling you to remove it (who am i?) from your watchlist but at least move it a few titles down because there's better mainstream anime floating around, than this. Hope my review visits every nook and touches a bit on everything, just an overall picture of what you're getting yourself into and how it'll look like when you start off. \\n\\n\r\nOn a scale of 5, 1.2 feels too harsh for Nisekoi, so 2/5 is my final rating.",

However, the male character is actually in love with another girl and has to try to maintain a good relationship with her while going out with his 'girlfriend'.

The quality wasquite consistent and was well lit.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7:\\n\r\nOP and ED aren't memorable, soundtrack doesn't seem that interesting either. Voice acting is consistent, unfortunately it cannot be graded properly due to the mediocrity of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3:\\n\r\nWeak male that has the density of a brick.

She was well designed and her voice actor made her even cuter. However, seeing a lack of actual development for the protagonist towards any girls was just really boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4:\\n\r\nBasically a non-nude version of To-Love-Ru.

            "content": "Really interesting, and re-watchable romance & comedy title.\r\nThe story, the plot and well, pretty much the entire concept of Nisekoi were all very interesting. Not the best of the genre however the show was pretty decent. I liked that even though the show was full of cliche's it still retained it's own uniqueness a feat made possible with the support of studio shaft. Now, things got a bit complicated for me during the whole \"Tachibana arc\" or \"Childhood friend arc\" This was because I was so used to the triangle between Onoderna and Chitoge. Not to mention I liked the idea of the mystery girlwho Raku knew only being between Kosaki or Chitoge. For a new character to be dropped so late was a bit unacceptable to me. Then again, when I think more about it, the show is 20 episodes so maybe I'm just making a big deal out of it.  My overall feeling for the story of Nisekoi was pretty good. I must admit that it was a pain in the ass watching the obvious love and drama drag on for so long however and to a certain extent, I think it was all worth it in the end. I mean, it didn't deliver much of a satisfying ending however I still thought it was pretty good. I don't really want to spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\nAppearances visuals and animation was pretty amazing. I mean, it's a shaft production so I expected good quality visuals and special effects. Background settings and objects really stood out. In addition to that, I really enjoyed seeing the Special  effects in the opening song but I digress.  Perhaps one of my favorite features in Nisekoi is the visual appearance. Colorful, vibrant, and great to look at. I am pretty  damn fond of shaft's decisions (for the most part) when it comes to what shows they want to work on.\\n\\n\r\nNow for characters, they were pretty decent. I liked that Raku was similar to Araragi from Nisio Isin Monogatari series. Another infamous show that Shaft has worked on. Albeit he's not too much of a pervert like Koyomi but, butt-cheeks, he's still a pretty likable guy. Moving along, I honestly didn't care for the selection of main characters. Kosaki was probably my favorite, out of the main three. Chitoge  and Raku I just.. I couldn't get into them that much. The supporting characters  felt like they were there just for show, I felt like there was nothing interesting about them. I love the character designs, I mean, I thought Kosaki was adorable! and maybe Chitoge sometimes too. I liked lots of the designs again, mostly for Kosaki's though. Her out of school outfits were always nice. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound was pretty great. I didn't have a favorite song from the soundtrack however, that didn't really change how I felt about the BGM. Seiyuu's, again did a pretty damn good job fulfilling their roles and bringing their perspective characters to life. The queen Kana Hanazawa does a great job fulfilling her role as Kosaki and the other voice actors are alright too. OP & ED songs were okay too. I personally didn't care for em'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that Nisekoi was a pretty enjoyable, and memorable title. It is the type of show that I would recommend if you like slow titles that also have lots of developments along the way.  I gave Nisekoi 8.3/10 because I felt that even though it had its moments of disappointments, It still delivered a great amount of drama, suspense and comedy!",

            "content": "Adaptations are flawed by default. No adaptation will ever captivate the same way as its source material. With that said, they are not superior or inferior from the get-go, one clear example being the anime I'll be reviewing today.  Ever wondered what would happen if you give a competent staff a bad source material? Well... Nisekoi happens.\r\nThis anime is, at its core, a lazy and generic romcom. The premise is a huge excuse to have a bunch of cute girls show up and form a harem. Whoever, despite being so generic, Shaft did an amazing job at this show's art direction and presentation. Needlessto say it's the main reason why my grade is this high.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is weak to say the least, though that's expected from a show like Nisekoi. It's semi-episodic (with short stories taking no more than 3 episodes) starting with a simple excuse for the characters to meet, some kind of misunderstanding or conflict, rounded up by a romantic scene. It needed no more than that, but not much innovation either, very run-of-the-mill.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag. Their designs are interesting and unique and some of them do get development over time. With that said, they are still very simple and stereotypical characters personality-wise. There\u2019s the bland main character for teenagers like me to identify with him, the tsundere, the kind and cute girl, the perverted friend and the energetic girl. Not a single character is in fact original, which is a huge letdown.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about the anime is its artistic approach to direction. Every shot is different, with its unique backgrounds, fluid animation and head turns, classic Shaft signature. It isn\u2019t as absurd as Madoka or Monogatari, but that is a good thing in my opinion. Being a romantic comedy, I don\u2019t think there is any space for that kind of absurd directing. The sound is OK, doesn\u2019t really stand out all that much, though voice acting is on point, Kana Hanazawa\u2019s voice always stands out. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nisekoi has little going for it, but its great execution makes up for its flaws and was quite enjoyable thinking back. I recommend it to those who are fans of the genre, or feel like watching just for the waifu material. Either way, watch it purely for the entertainment, it\u2019s not that great.\\n",

            "content": "Nisekoi! is the anime that can be summarized in one word: GENERIC\r\nThat's debatable of course, it could also be Clich\u00e9d.\r\nIt's kinda like the writers/makers had a checklist of Anime Must-Haves and went and ticked them all off.  This show is a Harem, a Romantic Comedy, and Slice of Life, The story is simple: Boy has a lock, when he was little he promised a girl to marry her, if she kept the key, and he kept the lock. In his teens his dad insists he dates the Tsundere girl to stop a feud between gangsters and the mafia.\r\nThe Episodes:\r\nIt's all there: The Onsen, TheLocked Toghether, The Swimming Pool, The Beach, The Festival, The School Trip, The Birthday, The Sleepover, and of course, the School Play.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music:\\n\r\nI forgot what kind of music the Anime has. Yeah thats right, thats how unoriginal it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nIt's a harem, so the girls outnumber boys 3:1. \\n\r\nThere's The Tsundere, The Boy/Girl?!, The Nice Girl, The Bride/Fianc\u00e9e, The Glasses Character, and The Childhood Friend, and they all fawn over the Protagonist boy who is in no way attractive. And there is The Best Friend. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story:\\n\r\nIt all revolves around his lock, he doesn't remember who he made the promise to, and moreover, he is head over heals with the Nice Girl. But the main focus is on Tsundere, who is a little too convincing in hating the Protagonist, so she is butt annoying. Besides those two girls, the other harem girls come on for one or two episodes before fading to the background. \\n\\n\r\nIt's generic to a fault. They half-assed a Romeo & Juliet theme, which is pretty much the most overused theme in romantic history. And the lock? Like every good oldfashioned anime, they keep you dangling to the end... the open end.\\n\\n\r\nOveral Feel:\\n\r\nI laughed, there are some good jokes. Sadly, between jokes I found myself sighing and planting my face to my hand. This anime goes to show that domestic violence is perfectly okay as long as the girl does it. Also, parents care only about their kids future, as long as they marry a good successor to the family business. It's truly a deep and meaningful message. Told in chewed out clich\u00e9s and overly Generic Anime standards.",

            "content": "Hello, this is my first review. Constructive criticism is welcomed.\r\nNisekoi is an anime of the \"rom-com\" genre, most notably associated with anime like Toradora. These anime mix aspects of romance, situational comedy, and slice of life story elements (financial or family problems). I am grading based on the strength of these components within Nisekoi.\r\nAlthough I enjoyed Nisekoi, it was a series that left me feeling rather disappointed as a whole.\r\nCharacter: 7\r\nOnodera and Chitoge's relationships with Ichijo are both interesting and funny to watch. As Ichijo discovers more about his past, the feelings he has towards people change. He becomes slightly more sympathetic (even for atypical romcom main character who is stereotypically nice) as the show goes on. He stops worrying about doing things and actually takes some action to spend time with the girls he is interested in. The results, however, are to be discussed with the story section of the review.\\n\\n\r\nEvery animation or facial reaction is highly stylized, almost to meme or moe levels of deformation. I do not mean this as a bad thing, the quick wit of the humor (when it introduces itself) is not only welcoming but genuinely funny. The characters make these situations fun to watch because of their well-developed dynamics. These dynamics change over time, especially in the case of Onodera.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe two main story lines revolve around Ichijo, and are dynamic and interesting. I would not call them character arcs, because the focus is constantly switching between the two.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the pacing of the show leaves much to be desired. The argument here is that any adaptation of a manga usually must remain loyal to the vision of the mangaka. This is especially highlighted in the first episode which is divided into shorts. \\n\\n\r\nAs the storylines develop, they begin to decelerate at an alarming rate. \\n\r\nThe writing relies too much upon the internal monologues of every character. This means that a single event may take, in screen time, a full two minutes to fully expose every major character's reaction. This leaves the show feeling rather disjointed and redundant. The fact that most of these internal dialogues repeat subject matter or decisions left me shockingly bored at some parts. Knowing so much about the thoughts of each character causes the viewer to see the romance as an omniscient third person, instead of through the eyes of Ichijo. This ultimately detracted from my personal interest in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs a forewarning, some of the circumstances around the plot twists within this series will make you want to tear your hair out. At least I wanted to.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nIf you have seen any anime produced by SHAFT, you can immediately recognize the style of Nisekoi. Certain scenes are of \"mixed media\", meaning that something like a blue border of frills may appear in the school setting, as if someone placed one in front of the animated characters. Particularly dramatic moments are treated to some gorgeous views of the sky or the city. The \"design\" or look of every character is consistently well-executed.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I had more to say about my favorite part of this anime. Scenes like the gangster/yakuza buildings are like castles from a story book (or popular Shakespearean tragedy? hoho). The aforementioned reaction faces and character dynamics would not be possible if not for the fluid and spot-on animations done hundreds of times each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe voice acting is some of the best I have heard. The dialogue is so natural that one can imagine the voice actors for Ruri and Onodera in the booth together just having normal girl talk. The OP and ED are both catchy but a little too saccharine for my tastes. Background noises and sound effects are delivered at a consistent \"frame\" of each animation, helping make the animated world a little more realistic and consistent.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint is that the story distracted me from enjoying the characters and humor as they were. The monologues constantly bring up the story defining \"who likes who?\" question and force the characters to behave at a molasses pace.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nSeveral personal complaints I have about the show (like the beach episode and the rather pervy drawings shown at the end of each episode) keep me from personally recommending Nisekoi to my friends. From an objective view, Nisekoi is a solid example of the \"rom-com\" anime genre. \\n\r\nIs Nisekoi fun to watch and well-made? Yes. \\n\r\nWill I cherish the memory of watching this show like a childhood promise? No.",

            "content": "Ok here is my in depth review on Nisekoi and why i love Nisekoi so much. \r\nStory\r\nLets start with the story itself before we get into the art, direction, and other elements of the series. While many already know Nisekoi has squandered on its potential of becoming a great romance with harem elements. For some odd, or should i say predictable reasons, Komi felt the need to add fillers as well milk the story. Lets be honest here Komi is no where near Nisio where he can milk a product and make it good. Even some vols of gatari that was made out of whimare amazing. But lemme stop here before i go on a tangent, no cosine. But what the anime adapted was probably the strongest story arc of the series. Notice I used probably and not indefinitely. From the start we already get a love triangle from the get-go. Raku likes Onodera and vice verse, and Chitoge and Raku are forced into a fake relationship. From that point on people should have already knew that cock-blockings from both ends will occur. I mention this because that's one criticism of Nisekoi. The constant cock-blocking and tom foolery is what irritates people. Ima be honest while watching this from week to week i was getting mad as well. Only once they introduced the harem element is when I began to accept the cock-blocking tom foolery. But lemme discuss the characters of this show right now so i can show you what appeals to me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with Chitoge last just because I know ur haterd for her. Lets start with Raku, It wont be long nor do i plan on summarizing the characters.. Raku is a pretty generic harem MC. While enjoyable then most pussies out there he doesn't fall to far from the tree. Shu is best friend is a good wing-man. He is always looking out from him plus he is a great comic relief character. His interaction with Ruri are funny and cute at the same time because of the subtle love interest between them. So basically we have 2 relationships forming. Which is entertaining enough to see. inb4thisshowisaboutshuandruri the whole time :mindfk:. Tsugumi can be irratating at times but her body makes up for all the bs she does. When she has love interest for Raku i guess some could have been slightly irratated. But to all honesty she hides her feelings well enough where it doesn't effect the show at all. Its all part of the harem train. \\n\\n\r\nNow that i got rid of the side characters lets talk about the main three girls in the harem. This is what makes me really fall in [s]false[/s] LOVE with the show. Onodera Kosaki is absolutely the best character my eyes has ever laid on. Ill try to keep this short or else i can go on another huge essay about her. The fact that both Raku and Onodera like each other, the fact that they both have a key and a locket, the fact that they are probably the couple that would actually work out, is all the reasons why she is the strongest character in the series. By strongest i mean the one thats going to/should \"win.\" Her cutesy shy charm is cute af. She isn't an annoying sub character that's just thrown in there. She actually has a lot of personality. In later episodes of the anime we see her getting a little bit more aggressive or should i say assertive with her attitude towards Raku. With Ruri always pushing her we finally see some character development. YES a character development in what many say is a plotless anime where nothing happens. If anything, if we really wanna look at it from a serious stand point, Onoderas character development with Raku alone is what makes this show soo good. We started with Onodera in episode one and we ended with Onodera in the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about your favorite character. Tachibana is a good character. When added to the harem this is where the doodoo hits the fan. Because it is clear that Tachibana is the promise girl from the picture (we are only talking bout the first season). Raku's clear choice would be to go with her. But the thing is when Tachibana is introduced and even after, Onodera and Chitoge has already made so much progression with Raku. As of now Raku already is showing interest in either Chitoge and Onodera. With Chitoge it seems like the classic \"been together for so long u start to fall in love\", wit Onodera he always liked her. So adding Tachibana only seems to be there for harem plot element and an entertaining character. Well Tachibana isn't the one i have to be defending here lemme get to Chitoge or as you like to call her [s]best girl[/s] Shitoge\\n\\n\r\nSo look I'm not here to convert atheists into believers,I'm just tryna say the way anime need Shaft Studio, the way Raku needed needs Chitoge, that's the way I need Kosaki. lel okay I'm done lemme chill before i turn this into a rap. The reason why you (and if this not the reason) why most people hate Chitoge is cause of the following. She is an annoying tsundere. At first she is extremely intolerable. She shows zero interest in Raku and she ruins the mood. But later on when you actually see slight jealously you begin to look at it in a cute way. Personally Chitoge grows on you. Out of every character in the series she has one of the most character development. The arc/scene where she was in the beach and all jealous and shit just proves that she is developing feelings for Raku. That's fucking character development. I mean if u were put into a position you don't want to be in of course you will be extremely intolerable at first. When it comes to love interest she has the biggest shot because Raku also shows somewhat same feelings back. It goes from obligation to actually want to be with each other. Ill give u the fact that she was horrible at first but it is extremely acceptable for her to behave that way. The fact that she eases up so much just shows us that Komi isn't a complete retard and he actually wants to push the story. This is me speaking from the anime stand point. I'm well aware of how the manga likes to diverge from the plot. As a main girl she isn't that bad. It shows a nice, overcoming of obstacles in order to achieve a love interest. Hate it or love it that's a fact and you know it. To tell you the truth I think i defended her well enough as a character. If you have any rebuttals please let me know so i can further expand on any issues you find. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Direction/Ost\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, lets discuss the studio breh. So lets start with this. Nisekoi and shaft studio complement each other well. If this went to a different studio I feel i would have gotten a different show.  Boring backgrounds, not enough exaggeration in motion and movement, and something different all together. With nisekoi shaft actually showed effort. Unlike MCA (but that's another story and im no story teller). Please don't discuss the industry and it isnt shaft's fault that it had a nice budget, I already know! But the art in nisekoi is nice. It gives u a warm feeling at the same not feeling overly complicated. My one complaint would be the BD's butchering some of the bgs for the sake of sparkles. But when we get shaft we expect nice sceneries (even in dance in the vampire bund which felt extremely low budgeted). The character designs are similar if not better than the manga design. Lastly, the overall atmosphere is far more richer than the manga. So if we are comparing the first 50 chapters of what shaft adapted i would honestly say this is an instance where anime exceeds the source material. Shaft, believe it or not adapted the manga pretty well. Aside from inserting their artistic flare from time to time it stayed pretty faithful.\\n\\n\r\nWhile camera angels and cuts aren't as extreme as most of the gatari series Shaft still tends to use these methods. Also with changing animations for funny scenes this has the complete package. I really do enjoy their style and i can go on forever about it but honestly Nisekoi is shafty af but not toooo shafty. its the perfect balance. Its not too tame and not too wild. From time to time its nice to see them adapt something like this. So the reason i mention all this is to add why i enjoy this \"seemingly generic harem\" more than most harems i watch. It isn't because of the story but its because of the art, direction, and characters that draw me into this show. I cant see how one who likes their shows can dislike this show. I cant comprehend 1 character ruining the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nTbh im not the type of guy to pick up on the ost. I overlook it most of the time. But the music in Nisekoi lifts the overall mood of the series greatly. When I re-watched it in BD quality I picked up certain things and i found myself engrossed in the show. When hearing the ost play over certain scenes it just makes things fun for me. Shaft sure knows how to place the ost in scenes and make it work. It really is one of their strong suits and ill be sure to pick that up in more series. \\n\\n\r\nSo here is my ultimatum. Whatever you found wrong, flawed, weak, or needing further expansion on, please let me know. I believe i defended why I like Nisekoi well enough.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Raku should be a Harem president. He should invade a country and name it \"Haremica\". I can see it now...300 Million girls living in his \"Harem\" country and he's the only guy. Oh, how I would love to be him right now. Or better yet, he should be a Harem God and there will be 7 Billion girls around him. The point I'm trying to make in my opener is this show is another one of those protagonists where the girls are mindlessly falling in love with.  \r\nStory: (5/10) \r\nThe story is about Raku, a teenager who made a promise 10 years ago toa girl he met. The problem is he doesn't remember this girl. They both promised that they will get married when they reunite. He wears a pendant that the girl gave him and he never let it go. \\n\r\nNow my opinions on the story. At best, it's mediocre. At the first 3 episodes, the show had an interesting idea. To me, at least. But from there on, it just became a typical cliche, romance and harem moments. Not that I'm complaining or anything. I'm probably one of the few people on this earth who isn't bothered by cliche moments or shows with harem protagonists. I mean, I don't love it but I don't hate it either. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nAt least the show did something right and it's the animation. Yes, the show had a lot of clich\u00e8 facial expressions but I don't want to focus there. I want to focus on the actual character designs, environment designs and the lighting. Character designs, good. Environment designs, great and the lighting is also great. There is one design that I'm really bothered by and it's the way they design the female characters. Yes, I know, it's fan service but it's ridiculous. At school, they have normal boobs but in the beach and swimming pool scenes, the breasts are bigger than my ballsacks. I mean, just look at Tsugumi. She has the smallest breasts of them all and in the beach scene, it somehow gets bigger. This is why some parents think anime is a huge hentai.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nIf the show didn't have interesting OP or ED theme songs then the sound category would have easily been a score of 4 and lower. Why? Because if the show doesn't have(it actually doesn't) interesting music going on in the background then they need to make up with it by making good or great OP and ED theme songs. That's what the show successfully did. OP 1 and  OP 2 are both great. Hell, the only reason how I managed to make it past Ep. 1 and 2 is the OP 1 theme song. Both OP's are sung by ClariS and I'm a fan of her songs. Now, about the ED theme songs. There is a lot that I lost count. How many are there? 4? 5? I forget. ED 1 is the only great ending theme song. I think it was sung by the voice actor of Chitoge? The other ED's can just suck it because they're not even worth listening to. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (6/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are all cliched and they have a stereotyped character personality. There's nothing original about them. Raku is your typical Harem God surrounded by beautiful girls for no reason. Chitoge is your typical tsundere. She always argues and fight with Raku as she is unable to properly express her inner, loving emotions towards Raku. Kosaki is a dandere. The typical shy girl that only really opens up around good friends and the guy she likes which is obviously Raku. Tsugumi is a kuudere. Cool, calm, collected but is at a total loss about what to do with her newfound feelings of love for (again) Raku. Lastly, Marika is a non-violent yandere girl. Obsessed with having the boy of her dreams to the point of completely reinventing her appearance and personality to appeal to him. Great job for the creators. They managed to squeeze in 4 \"dere\" characters in the show and put them in Raku's harem. They're nothing original so why didn't I rate the character category a score of 4 and lower? Because they're hilarious. That's the only reason it saved the characters from being a total flop. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nMy enjoyment category is a perfect score from me not because of the crappy story, not because of the stereotyped and cliched characters but because of how hilarious the show is. Especially the interaction between Chitoge and Raku. This is the reason why I love tsundere girls. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7.8/10)----Rounding it to--(8/10)\\n\r\nThere really isn't anything new or fresh with Nisekoi. It's just a story of a harem protagonist filled with stereotypical girls in a cliched high school setting. At the end of the day, the show really goes nowhere. You'll know what I'm talking about if you watched the show. However, despite all of this, the show is still hilarious as hell. The characters and their interaction towards Raku is what saved this show from being a total failure. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Hilarious Characters\\n\r\n+A lot of funny moments\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Mediocre story\\n\r\n-Stereotyped and cliched characters\\n\r\n-Show goes nowhere (Can I even consider this as a con?)\\n\r\n-Not so great ending\\n",

            "content": "Ahhhh Nisekoi.\r\nI first heard of Nisekoi via its popular and very long running manga (130 chapters so far), which when it heard it was being adapted and by Shaft no less (madoka and the monogatari series) I was very excited. Was I looking forward to the strong romance? The emotional situations? The satisfying ending? Nope. Because Nisekoi has none of this. Do not come here looking for a plot as this show has practically nothing to offer in that regard!\r\nSpeaking of plot...\r\nStory-5\r\nGiving the story of Nisekoi a score of 5 is probably a bit too generous. The show is practically the gold standard of whatwhat you should expect from a Harem Rom-Com. Lots of girls. One oblivious guy. Amusing situations ensue. Job done. The entire show is essentially filler with maybe... 5 events happening which have any relevance going forwards? Nothing happens. Be very aware of this when you go into this show and maybe just resign yourself to enjoying each episode as it comes.\\n\r\nIn general the show is a reverse Romeo and Juliet with the there being two warring factions. The twist however comes that the two youngest children are forced to pretend they're in a relationship to stop the war hence \"nise\"-fake and \"koi\"-love. However the leads don't exactly get on well and keeping this pretense up in front of others makes things rather complicated quickly.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nIts shaft. I'm sorry I'm a Shaft fan boy and I like their art style a lot. See bakemonogatari.    \\n\r\nLuckily for some its not quite as unusual as some of their works or as rushed. Character designs and movement are solid as you would expect. Comic moments are assisted by lots of chibis and art style changes and all the standard Shaftisms are such as the sholder look, unneeded twirls and camera pans and cuts seemingly at random. As an aside I loved how coughs had their spit inserted as a cardboard cut out on a lollipop stick, ticked my fancy and I love those little details.\\n\r\nIf you don't like it suck it up as there's a lot of it. \\n\r\nOh and serious congrats for making a rat tail cute.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nNo real complaints here. Both OP's and ED's were really solid. Both OP's were by ClariS one of the very few j-pop bands I can stand. They all came with fairly interesting animation with the second OP being my personal favorite. Background music was also fantastic and I found myself humming along to a number of them which i was impressed with.\\n\r\nVA was also solid. I can't speak a word of Japanese but I enjoyed most of the voices. Special props go to Kana Hanazawa (-every cute girl in every shaft show ever-), Kouki Uchiyama (Soul and Ichika from IS) and Nao Touyama (from absolutely nothing I've seen). In general no glaring flaws I could hear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\nIts a harem. Don't expect much. At base characters consist of -insert your own name here- protagonist, rich girl Tsudere, shy girl, even bigger tsudere and self insert girl just trying to get the protagonists d**k wet. \\n\r\nHowever I really quite enjoyed some of the support characters and the show spent quite a bit of time developing people's back-stories compared to most harems. Despite not much development happening to any of the characters I can't honestly say I dislike them or that there was much more room for it. Though I might be spoiled by having read the manga first.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nYes. \\n\r\nLooking at this show objectively has made me realize just how bad elements of it are. The mad art style. The absurd ass pulls to ensure the plot did not progress. The blatant obviousness of how some episodes were going to go and how stereotypical so many of the events were. Its all so bad!  \\n\r\nHowever it is really good fun. I look back on all this absurdity fondly as 20 weeks well spent waiting for the next episode of blandness. Nothing suprises me in this show and I didn't want it to. \\n\r\nThe show is full of all the ridiculousness that I want from a Rom-Com harem but if you don't like that stuff then don't watch this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\r\nThe key to this show is that you will probably enjoy it. Its silly, unrealistic, has nothing to surprise you with and the romance goes nowhere.   \\n\r\nHowever its fun and quirky and for those coming off the Monogatari series and wanting more of it this will probably do until they get around to Kizumonogatari. Or Hanamonogatari. Oh Shaft.\\n\r\nHope it gets a second season!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nisekoi is an adaptation from a manga of the same name, which I have read all 125 chapters that have been released so far. It is still publishing, so I can only wait for more. There are 20 episodes as of now that I have seen, and more are coming (hopefully in a season 2!). For those who just want to know whether to watch or not, I will lay that to rest now: WATCH IT. Anyways, formalities aside, let's get into it.\r\n Story: 7\r\n The story isn't something unusual, but it also isn't an overly clich\u00e9d idea either. While it may lack complete originality,it does its job perfectly. Unlike some romantic comedies, which take a few plot points and only use that, Nisekoi embraces its plot and it plays a large part of every episode, though not for the entire thing. The story, up to now, has introduced new points, but quite honestly isn't really going anywhere. For that reason, it receives a 7.\\n\\n\r\n Art: 10\\n\r\n WOW. It's a good thing I was sitting down when I first saw this because it blew me away. That is something to be proud of. While there aren't any real action scenes, you knew it had to be good coming from Studio Shaft, well known for its Monogatari series, as well as its Ef Tale series, Arakawa Under the Bridge, and Puella Magi Madoka Magica, all which have amazing art.\\n\\n\r\n Sound: 7\\n\r\n The music works well to set the scene, and the OP and ED are both catchy and upbeat, following the nature of the show. However, for me personally, there aren't really any stand out tracks, and beside the OP and ED, nothing really left a lasting impression.\\n\\n\r\n Character: 8\\n\r\n The characters for the most part fit very unoriginal stereotypes. However, they fit those stereotypes very well and bring the best out of the roles. There is the shy, innocent one, the tsundere, the other tsundere, and another who is hinted at the end of 13 (no spoilers). The character designs are all very good and the voice actors did a perfect job of bringing these characters to life. My personal favorite is Onodera, but based on the recent manga chapters, I'm not too sure how my list will pan out.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment: 10\\n\r\n This anime fits all my favorite genres, it has amazing art, good music, a compelling story, great and lovable characters, and an overall smooth and enjoyable feel. What's not to love? This anime is definitely the one to watch for the rest of the Spring season which begins soon. \\n\\n\r\n Overall: 9\\n\r\n While my enjoyment is a perfect 10, it is easily understandable that some may not enjoy this because of its light hearted nature and its lack of overly serious or complex ideas. However, taken at face value for what it is, it is a great romantic comedy slice of life, and definitely one that lovers of this genre should watch.\\n\\n\r\n Note: Leave a helpful or not helpful, they really help!",

            "content": "So I was skeptical when I started this show, I thought it would be a dumb harem show. Instead it left me pleasantly surpised, it was a show that just always made me smile.\r\nThe story in Nisekoi is not anything amazing as you expect, there is one but it progresses slowly. The main character Raku made a promise to a girl when he was younger that they would get married when they grew up. Raku had a lock and the girl had a key so they can verify each other's identities when they are older. \r\nThe Art and Audio of the show is great. Ireally like the art style and the music fits perfectly into scenes, no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what makes Nisekoi. I really enjoyed seeing all the characters, and as a harem anime they fight for Raku. Now the two main girls are Chitoge and Onodera, they are both amazing in their own ways and I often don't know who to root for. I love them both!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Nisekoi is really enjoyable, it has to be one of my favorite shows. If you haven't seen it yet you need to. You'll fall in love with the characters. I can't wait to see what they have store in season 2 in April!",

Raku belongs to Yakuza family but doesn't have any fighting power, a complete hopeless guy with Amnesia and sympathy for girls.\r\n2. Chitoge, this character is so annoying. have you seen any other anime where a girl in love beat the person she love on a regular basis ?? just how muchenduring power Raku has ??\\n\r\n3. Kosaki, a girl with 0 will power. no matter how much support she get, there will be no confession for sure. For last 2 years she only said good morning and good bye, that's the only conversation she had with Raku. what is this ? hinata from naruto ??\\n\r\n4. Marika, this girl have some guts. not so disappointing, i'm actually happy to see a character who can do something to express her feeling.\\n\r\n5. supportive characters are way too good for main characters I must say. they are mature and logical while the main characters are childish.\\n\\n\r\nA main character who understand everything expect the fact girls have feeling for him, unimaginable overpowering heroine, hinata(from naruto) as kosaki, decent support character, plot that makes you sick for thinking too much - -  we present NISEKOI !!!!\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi OVA 2 - This one is absurd. Raku get ravaged by 4 girls and he just passed out and didn't remember what actually happen. Isn't that refer to rape in general term ? losing victims memory, that's the best think author came up with ? instead of telling what happened and apologising,  heroins tend to keep that a secret. wow.. is there anyone who think the story on right path ?\\n\\n",

            "content": "*CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\n(This review was edited because I kind of violated some of the rules so please enjoy reading it.)\r\nHave you ever had that feeling when you haven't watched an anime for like 6 or 8 months or so?\r\nWell, I have.\r\nFinishing Nisekoi, so far it had become quite an exclusive journey to laughter, mystery and loads of astonishment. It finally helped me quench my thirst for anime. \r\nTo begin with, just for fun, I shall make a review about this series in a reverse way; from, my overall perspective about this anime to the thoughts about the synopsis and its story line. Having said this Ishall begin my point of view.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part I can't autonomously say that this is a GREAT and OUTSTANDING anime because it is a shoujo theme kind of anime. For starters, I am a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I am getting real tired of the on and on blabbing about school motif kind of shoujo because almost all shoujo anime pertains to large high school groups and settings so let's not forget that love is in the subject of every girly anime. However, I didn't hesitate because I wanted to see more of it after reading its plot. I kind of enjoyed witnessing every scene of nostalgic thought and I kinda felt happy that there is an anime that is funny and comfortable to watch. All in all, it may have some unoriginal attributes but the modern classic of Japanese anime shows that has a cute storyline of harem with a modern twist, became a true cup of tea.\\n\r\nThis is getting way too old to answer, did I enjoy it? Yes but sometimes there are parts where you just want to skip it. Like the long and odd stares that just takes too much time to harness the main idea of the episode. There are also annoying gossip mongers in and out of the circle of the main characters and the subordinating characters. Too much for the secret convos. The longevity also of the anime itself takes too much for a very simple plot but on the lighter side, the manga is still under construction so no worries for the ending IN THE MANGA. I know that the ending of the anime has missing holes and is very disappointing so it ruined everything for me.\\n\r\nOkay, this might sound bipolar, but all I'm trying to say is that it is an anime which will make your time worth spending. It's just that how can you put all the awesomeness in just 20 episodes? Seriously, HOW?! A piece of advice, watch it while you can and read the manga while you still have time because God knows how busy we are in the future. Just saying.\\n\\n\r\nYes, my all time favorite topic, THE CHARACTERS IN THE STORY.\\n\r\nFirst off, some of the characters exactly resemble the personality and looks of the characters in the anime,Toradora. In my opinion, I think these characters are like them but the story, not so much.\\n\\n\r\nRaku Ichijo kind of looks like Takasu and is also a bit of a neat freak and a magnificent cook (Although Raku's neatness can be only seen in some episodes). He is an incredibly nice guy and he is a bit unmanly for some reason. Both of them share an ultimate crush for someone who has short hair. For Raku, it is Onodera and Takasu for Minorin. They both are average students but they are chick magnets for some reason and to top it all out, their hair color are both dark blue. . (how's that for a dejavu.) \\n\\n\r\nChitoge Kirisaki, the rich girl who always have a brute strength and punches people because she just hates them so much. Kinda rings a bell doesn't it? Alright, you may or may not guessed it but she is like Taiga.\\n\\n\r\nMaiko Shu has glasses and also has the tendency to think of evil schemes. Much like Kitamura but on the latter side, Kitamura only made a few evil schemes and Shu isn't that smart.\\n\\n\r\nAgree or Disagree? Well, I don't care. Setting aside the Toradora characters and Nisekoi Characters similarities they have awesome features too. \\n\\n\r\nRaku can be a loud mouth but he talks funny and thinks funny too.\\n\r\nChitoge is loved by many people and she has a phobia in some stuff.\\n\r\nShu has a perverted personality which is kinda surprising.\\n\r\nOnodera is a personality of a typical shoujo dream gril who is shy and cute.\\n\r\nRuri has a creepy aura sometimes but tries her best to help her friend, Onodera.\\n\\n\r\nPeople would often have an interest to Chitoge Kirisaki, the girl with yellow and purple hair (I think) but, My favorite character is between Raku and Shu because they are extremely funny.\\n\r\nFor girls, without a doubt it has to be Ruri because let's face it, every woman wants to have her as a friend (example, yours truly :))\\n\\n\r\nThe music has a tangy and lively vibe to it. It has background music for drama and comedy as well. School background effects are highly anticipated in this anime. For the opening and ending, I haven't cared for it since episode 1 and I haven't heard the whole song because I'm about the anime's synopsis. But Claris did a good job for the opening.\\n\\n\r\nThe drawing is modernized 2D animation which supplied a massive enjoyment to my eyes and view on the series. Love the color of the characters' hairs and their clothes too. The eye design surely captivated the emotions of the characters. Playful crafts of the background like for example making the classroom all green and only highlighting the character\u2019s talking. \\n\\n\r\nStory is very good although there are some points that aren't original however it has some exceptional writing too. Imagine a world where you will have a fake relationship with someone who you've met for the first time and actually you hated each other and treat each other like enemies and call each other names that are \"honey\" and \"darling\" but in reality you call each other \"bean sprout\" and \"gorilla\" which is obviously different. Nisekoi or fake love did just that. Two characters involve themselves in a mistaken couple love which is just for pretend. If failed to make it real, gangsters ad yakuzas will eventually destroy a city. Sounds weird? Yes that's weird. True love is indeed the answer for peace, sounds disgusting for me. On the other hand, both have an ideal boy for themselves but what if chemistry eventually shows up?\\n\r\nThe diegesis is like the one from Maburaho when in time, the guy will pick one among the 3 girls who made his heart skipped a beat which I will not mention who but you have to wait for it. This anime builds a love story like no other. It is actually surprising to know and intriguing because who knows which girl will Raku end up with. It is a mystery. There is also a weird locket and multiple keys that will show a really systematic construction on Raku's destiny. It is all up to him whether he will choose the girl he's been crushing on for like his whole school life, or the girl who is tough at first but kinda sweet, or the fiancee slash the girl who may be the promise girl. Sounds complicated doesn't it? The only option to know is to see the beauty of this mystical anime. No magic just marvelous happenings. \\n\r\nNot convinced? GET A LIFE! :D\\n",

Each episodes are fine, pacing are good, balance in both of romance and comedy. At the first I do not think it would be as funny as it, but it turns out vice versa.\r\nFor the chara design, it's all good, I like them. And I think their expressions was exceptional, truly amaze, if you have seen this show, you'll get what I thought, but I don't like the idea of \"sprinkling\" part, itkind of weird for me.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it better is there's Hanazawa Kana-san as one of MC seiyuu. I like her voice that sounds really lovely. As ussual, she fitted well with the chara voice. Other's seiyuu was not bad too.\\n\\n\r\nA bit disappointed at the ending (final eps), cause I think the story isn't near to the end at all. But when I found out the 2nd season will soon be aired, it makes me a little relieved. I can't wait for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I like this anime because it tells humorous school live romance, you should watch this show if you like comedy romance genres, I bet you'll be crazy about it.",

            "content": "I chose to give Nisekoi a score a score of 6 because it fits my perception of the show: Fair. \r\nI thought Nisekoi was simply okay. Every episode had its funny parts that made me smile or giggle audibly, but I felt it was just sorely lacking in in the overall story line and characters. \r\nTo preface: I do not have a problem straying from reality and adding fantasy and mystery to shows. Some of my favorite animes are Shinsekai Yori and Madoka. I do however get frustrated when the characters and their motivations are unrealistic, and this is the main reason that kept mefrom enjoying this how to its full extent.\\n\\n\r\nThe major plot point is a locket that symbolizes a promise Raku made to a girl when he was 5 or 6 years old. 5 or 6 years old. The fact that he thinks this promise holds any weight in his future love finding endeavors is just silly and entirely unrealistic. No one in their right mind would hold that to any real significance. The other members of the promise had the same issue for me. \\n\\n\r\nChitoge was an extremely tropic tsundere. She was nothing original and if you have seen any typical rom-com tsundere, you already have a full character bio on Chitoge and her attitude towards Raku. Not to mention the fact that another one dimensional tsundere is added a third the way into the series that adds little more to the situation. \\n\\n\r\nOnedara had a bit more of a role to play as the folly to the fake relationship between Chitoge and Raku, but an opportunity was missed. She had the most potential to be a well developed character and strengthen the plot, but she ended up being very static and one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast was hit or miss. Shuu was a thoroughly creepy fellow that I felt was overdone, and often tipped the scale of playful versus sexual harassment in favor of sexual harassment. Ruri on the other had... Ruri is great. Easily the most enjoyable character in the story by a long shot. Every scene she is in is hilarious and her antics always left me laughing out loud. \\n\\n\r\nI felt that this show was simply average and is over hyped. The characters, and dodgy character motivations and plot put a damper on an otherwise hilarious show with a lot of potential. If you want a show that you can enjoy for a laugh, but not get too invested in the characters, watch away. Otherwise, I recommend you skip it.",

            "content": "Coming to this anime I didn't really knew what it is going to be about, but the first three episodes made it clear, that this is going to be a cliche harem anime. At first I was kind of dissapointed, but I decided to give it a shot, since the episodes that I saw, were enterntaining enough.\r\nStory/Plot (2*6)\r\nPlot is one the most important thing to me. This anime on the other hand were not very original with its plot, making it predictable for a harem anime. There are some plot holes, or purpose plot decisions, that the creator makes to get a certain situation andthe viewer can clearly see them. Not to mention some unnecessary dialogue. However, it manages to sustain the tension, between main characters, which gives a fair evaluation of 6 to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (1*8)\\n\r\nWhen it comes to animation, you can clearly see, which scenes had a bigger budget, even certain episodes. Most of the animation was really good. There were comedic relief animation, that really brakes the tension, which some viewers might dislike it. One of the things that I disliked on my own, were a few scenes taken directly from manga, couloured, and put into anime, this really got me dissapointed, seeming that there was no effort put in those. Overall the art and the chosen artstyle was pretty good and it deservers an evaluation of 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music (0,5*9)\\n\r\nMusic can often create certain atmosphere, and set of emotions, which it really did in this anime. I've got no complaints for opening and ending sountracks, they were pretty decent. When it comes to sounds itself in the anime, you could say, that they were realistic enough and not disturbing. The one thing that might be discomfourtable is constant screaming of the main characters in some certain scenes. Though the music does pretty good job and gets a 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1,5*6)\\n\r\nIn this anime we've got a bunch of characters, with different, though cliche personalities. Three main characters, that are dense, distrust in oneself, shy and other most predictable character traits. However, the main male character gets his development at the end of the series, and we could probably say about the two girls. If you are expecting something new, don't get your hopes too high, characters get only a 6, due to the predictability.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2*9)\\n\r\nAs for the whole anime, I must say it was pretty enjoyable. Funny situations, character expressions, stupid dialogues, made it all together, to create one heck of a ride. Even though, we didn't get so see which girl gets to be with the main male character, it is clrear that we'll have to wait for season 2. My rating of enjoyment is a strong 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7,35)\\n\r\nAfter the calculations, this anime gets a 7,35 out of 10. For this type of anime I think this is pretty high rate and it surely deserves it. There is that spark, that keeps wanting to know what is going to happen, which really sucks you into the show. It may be not good storywise or have some interesting character, but it really gets the job done, if you want to relax, not think about anything and just to watch anime.\\n\\n\r\nI hope everyone's waiting for second season, \\n\r\nCHEERS!",

It seemed that every few episodes there would be a new girl introduced that falls for our main characters massive donger. It was really unnecessary. the main conflict and dilemmas between girl A and B were more than enough to keepmy donger raised. I wish they took this show in more of a slice of life category, expanding on their school life and their peculiar family backgrounds. My favourite episodes of this show did this e.g. the open air school episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, having the guy ending up with either Girl A or Girl B would not feel complete. I hate Girl A's guts and i hope her grandmother falls down the stairs and breaks her reconstructed hip as she loses control of her excretionary organs. i hope she is the middle human of a human centipede sandwiched by fat miley cyrus and obese tom cruise.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a total dick tho, he is as annoying as Angelica Pickles from rugrats . Despite being a virgin so obsessed with finding his promised girl, he is incapable of interacting with the opposite sex despite all these 10's throwing their huge/ gleaming titties in the general direction of his swelling donger. He really cant make up his mind and seems to prefer a different girl depending on what theyre wearing and if they made physical contact in the past 5 minutes. He deserves to lose his donger and should commit sudoku ASAP.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a pretty fun and enjoyable show nonetheless but you probably arent reading a review so focused on dongers by carlton banks expecting it to be good/positive.\\n\\n\r\n\u30fd\u0f3c\u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88\u0f3d\uff89 raise your dongers \u30fd\u0f3c\u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88\u0f3d\uff89",

            "content": "(Pretty long review, I guess.)\r\nA twisted Romeo and Juliet story with the touches of harem and comedy, Nisekoi surprisingly is one of the best harem series I've seen. Whether you aren't a fan of harem romcom series or not, you'll definitely enjoy this series.\r\nThe main character thinks that his crush is the one that will unlock the locket from 10 years ago. However, after some unexpected twists and turns, 2 more ladies come in the scene making it more complicated. The story is amazing and every episode wasn't a miss. The last two episodes are pretty much the best episodes of the series and theending was an amazing touch itself, especially the talk between Raku and Chitoge, describing the Romeo and Juliet play to their false love. \\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are superb for me. Chitoge and Onodera's endings and the first opening theme are really catchy, that I end up listening to it about 3-4 times a day. Instrumentals also add a nice feel to the scene, prompting you to react to the scene, whether it's comedic or romantic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the standout of the series and the voice actors seemingly made the scenes to life. Kana Hanazawa's voice of Onodera makes her the sweet and innocent character everybody in the social media talks about. \"If girls wanted a real-life Usui Takumi, then guys want a real-life Kosaki Onodera.\"\\n\\n\r\nChitoge Kirisaki is the energetic heroine of the series and probably will end up with the main character. (We know a wrong key wouldn't turn if it's put in the wrong lock and seeing it, the key was accidentally broken. That's a hint given to us already.) \\n\\n\r\nRaku Ichijou is different from the other harem MCs. He wanted to have a normal life and ending up with his crush but after a surprising turn of events, he became a harem MC.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana and Tsugumi's roles will improve probably in the next season, and Ruri and Shuu are looking like the next big couple everybody's talking about. \\n\\n\r\nShuu depicts the happy-go-lucky, intelligent and perverted bestfriend. He's one of the best characters I've seen aside from Onodera and learning the voice actor, no wonder why he's amazing (Yuki Kaji, who voiced Issei in High School DxD is his VA). He's pretty observant at everything he sees and every reaction he makes are priceless and funny.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the series and I'm looking forward to the next season and the season after that. There wasn't one episode that I didn't watch and I watch the whole series again and again. In short, I'll watch the whole series until its end. \\n\\n\r\nYou'll be asking where the art is in this review. The art is pretty simple and something you've seen in any kind of anime. However, art is just 10% of what makes up a good anime, so there's no need to explain about it. I just care about the story, character and enjoyment of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nisekoi adds a different feel to the harem genre yet it is surprisingly amazing. You have a son of a Yakuza leader, daughter of a gang boss, and daughter of a police commissioner as the characters, and that's something you don't see very often. Most harem series are based of just students and something magical. Yet, the scenes, adding with the character's VAs and the instrumental within those scenes makes Nisekoi an amazing series to watch. \\n\\n\r\nYou'll be watching this season.. and the next season (which is out now, by the way.)... and the next season.. and the season after that.",

I cannot express how this anime went to my liking as planned and if I could I could have went out and thanked all the creators and producers..etc there is. My favorites are when Raku shows his kindness and selfless towards others, he is such a gentlemen. I also like when he cooks for his Yazuka Clan. It makes me scream \" I want you for my husband!\" That fact that Chitoge is clueless of lovealso makes the plot and everything around interesting. The art is wonderful with everlasting effects. I've cherished every episode out there on it, I can't wait for the second season to come out. If I could I would even buy merchandise, but unfortunately it's impossible, my parents don't allow it. Something similar to this would maybe be Special A or Black Bullet but they are not even close to the perfection of this series. Hehe. Raku and Chitoge always fight and Raku is always wondering where this girl that made promises ten years ago was. It makes the watchers marvel the progress the characters undergo. It exceptional as an anime. No one can top this except maybe Attack on Titan? Am I being hypocritical? Nah..peshh",

            "content": "Nisekoi is a romantic-comedy anime adaptation of a Weekly Shonen Jump manga of the same name. I admit I was reluctant to watch this because I'm not usually into the romance genre, but I'm glad I watched this to the end.\r\nThe story is pretty straightforward. The main character, Raku Ichijou, is a teenage student and is part of a Yakuza family. He carries around a lock, from a promise he made with a girl a decade ago, who holds a key to the lock. However, he's unsure (and doesn't remember) who exactly this girl was. He currently has a crush on a deredere, but thensuddenly a tsundere enters his life, and under some circumstance, he has to pretend to be in a relationship with her. The anime eventually becomes a harem, with more -deres entering Ichijou's life.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the anime is fine, and it has no filler episodes. The humour is where the anime truly shines. It's amusing to watch Ichijou and Chitoge Kirisaki arguing with each other, and throwing insults. However, the anime does have its serious/dramatic moments, but nothing that'd make you depressed or anything. Even though the anime has some predictable twists, the story is overall executed well.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending doesn't wrap things up. Even though it doesn't end on a cliffhanger, the anime looks open to have a second season. The final episode, though unique, just felt like another episode of Nisekoi.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was produced by SHAFT, so if you enjoyed other avant-garde anime produced by SHAFT, like Bakemonogatari and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, then you should enjoy the artstyle of Nisekoi's. Basically, studio SHAFT anime use bizarre artstyles with the anime they produce, and this anime is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nSHAFT really brought the anime to life, and I cannot imagine how generic this anime would've looked if another studio had produced it. The quality of the animation stays consistent throughout. Because it's studio SHAFT, the backgrounds look like wallpaper, and other stuff looks like it had been cut out from sugar paper.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have nice designs, and there's a lot of blushing from the main characters throughout the anime. I feel that the female leads' clothing look too similar to each others, but they're school uniforms and a lot of anime consists of characters wearing school uniforms, therefore having similar appearances.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting is superb. Nao Touyama in particular gives an excellent performance as Kirisaki, and fits the role perfectly. The background music is minimal and isn't distracting, and suitable music is played at the right moments. A lot of usage of the accordion. The openings and endings are your typical upbeat J-pop. The first opening is quite memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead is shown to be caring and thoughtful, but tends to hold a grudge. I wouldn't call him a dumb harem protagonist. The female characters reinforce their -dere stereotypes. Typical for gag anime, there's a lot of shouting and silly-looking facial expressions from the characters, which I find funny. There is some character development here and there. The supporting cast appear when they need to. The tsundere (Chitoge Kirisaki) is the character I'd remember the most from Nisekoi in the future.\\n\\n\r\nI think people who like harem anime will enjoy this the most, because of the cute girls in it and a particular episode that has sexual fanservice in it. I mostly enjoyed it because of the comedy. For people who have never watched an anime before, this works well as a gateway anime. But like most anime set in high school, it's more of an otaku anime, and will never be a mainstream one.\\n\\n\r\nThe series will be memorable because of Chitoge Kirisaki. The artstyle made it unique, and I had fun watching it.",

            "content": "I never thought I\u2019d see a Shaft adaptation of a romantic comedy, but they have gone and done one. If you\u2019re not familiar with Shaft and their trademark style, found in shows like Madoka Magica, Hidamari Sketch, and the Monogatari series, I\u2019d call Nisekoi a relatively gentle introduction to their absurdist, post-modern style. However, as for the story itself, which originated in the manga by Komi Naoshi (which for the record, I am not familiar with), I\u2019d say Nisekoi is an occasionally entertaining harem-y romcom, but about average at best. Let\u2019s break it down.\r\nThe Good\r\nThe first thing that jumps out at me in most Shaft-producedanimation is the visuals, and Nisekoi doesn\u2019t fail to deliver. Shaft\u2019s trademark exaggerated camera angles, surreal background art, higher-than-average detail and frame-change rate, and of course, head tilt are all present and as fun to watch as ever. The visual style is more realistic than the ultra-sparse and very surreal Monogatari series, or the artsy mixed-media presentation of Madoka, but contains elements of both the realism and the absurdism.\\n\\n\r\nI also really liked the voice acting in this show. Chitoge and Onodera (above, left to right) were both excellent. Chitoge\u2019s VA, Touyama Nao, has a couple of starring roles in romcom type shows (Oregairu and Hataraku Maou-sama, for instance), and I appreciated how she well she handled Chitoge\u2019s wide-ranging emotional registers in this show. Onodera\u2019s VA, Hanazawa Kana, is practically ubiquitous but is perfect as usual in the role of the more easily-embarrassed shy girl. I also liked Raku\u2019s VA, Uchiyama Kouki. He did a fine job with the very hammy role, playing very nicely off Chitoge\u2019s temper and Onodera\u2019s palpable kawaii-ness.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve been anywhere around my blog before, you\u2019ll know I don\u2019t like harem-y shows very much. The whole point of harem is stagnation of the romantic status quo, or possibly just exploitation of an increasingly complicated love polygon, but regardless, the point stands. Harems don\u2019t end up anywhere, and Nisekoi, similarly, ends up going nowhere. The final episode is about as frustratingly awkward as the first one, with the main exception of Chitoge having admitted her feelings for Raku to herself. (She\u2019s literally the only one left at that point so\u2026yay, progress?)\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t even to mention the other two (frankly extremely annoying) girls who show up and end up with crushes on Raku. I guess they\u2019re pretty inconsequential, since Raku dates Chitoge for the whole show and harbors a crush on Onodera from the first scene to the last, and mostly just brushes the other two off. The fact that the finale of the show has two otherwise very \u201cromantic\u201d scenes between each of the two female leads and Raku just cements the fact that this is really a romantic comedy with a love triangle at its center\u2026and a harem ending as its finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ugly\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really pissed me off a lot of the time. Especially the supporting cast and that obnoxious Tachibana girl, who basically latches onto Raku midway through the show like a crusty barnacle. It doesn\u2019t help that she has the most obnoxious speech patterns in the show (a self-styled ojou-sama register full of \u201cwatakushi\u201ds and \u201cdesu wa no\u201ds) and, well, she hits on Raku harder than a jackhammer. And that servant girl and Raku\u2019s guy friend at school were pretty annoying, too. Onodera\u2019s friend Ruri was okay because she was quiet and rather hilarious, but otherwise inoffensive.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the main characters were mostly bearable. Raku and Onodera\u2019s mutually unadmitted (to each other, I mean) crush is the heart of the show, and Chitoge\u2019s \u201cfake\u201d relationship with Raku provides the slapstick and the laughs (and the ship fuel). In short, if they hadn\u2019t added the needless supporting \u201charem\u201d characters, and if the show had provided some kind of closure to Raku\u2019s struggles in romance, this could have been a much stronger show. Oh, and maybe if the last episode hadn\u2019t been such a disaster.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict\\n\\n\r\nA mixed bag for a cast with fun leads and some really obnoxious side characters. A silly love story that goes nowhere, and a terrible final episode that just brought the whole story (and the school, from the looks of it) down in shambles with its harem-ish and completely unresolved ending. Brilliant and hilarious Shaft animation, quality voice acting and fun theme music, and some touching romantic moments for the main triangle. All in all, I kind of enjoyed Nisekoi, but I wish it had been a lot better.",

If you enjoy romantic comedies with a touch of harem, this is the perfect anime for you. \r\nLike every male leads in any other harems, the protagonist is dense. But there are some differences. Like how he has a crush on one of the female protagonist. How he's pretending to dateanother one of the heroine due to certain circumstances while also being \"engaged\" to another female.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also involves childhood promises that were made 10 years ago by each of the protagonists. It seems as though their childhood promises are connected to each other.

            "content": "If every boring dude gets his own harem...then where's mine?\r\nStory:\r\nTo say that Nisekoi has a story would be wrong, it's more like an excuse. An excuse that gets thrown out the window as quickly as possible. Actually, if you started watching halfway through, you would probably not even know about the lock and the keys. The forced couple-plot is also pushed aside more and more and only comes up again if needed for the next shenanigan. All the coincidences will stretch your suspension of disbelief and so will the behaviour of the characters (but that's a different point). Nisekoi is a vanilla harem and nothingelse. It has no compelling story, no development at all, no surprises, no conclusion, just the very, very basic stuff. That's not enough for the n-th harem anime, it has to have something...but it doesn't.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNisekoi doesn't look bad, but seeing how it is a modern SHAFT anime, it is not as special as it could have been. Maybe that's an unfair assumption and they simply didn't want to go there. Solid, but not breathtaking.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOpenings and endings were pretty forgettable, but that's often the case, so I won't hold it against Nisekoi. The voice acting was good, especially the main girls. I have somewhat of a crush on Kana Hanazawas voice.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOh boy, here we go...The male lead is a generic idiot like in almost every other harem. He starts out liking only Onodera, but in the end he doesn't seem to care about her anymore and fully embraced the Chitoge route. Why? Chitoge is the basic tsundere love interest, though they forget the dere part untill the final two episodes, so I have absolutely NO idea why anybody (Raku as well as the viewers) would like her. All she says, all she does, she is just being a bitch with no reason. Anyway, how about the other girls? Onodera is a big ball of cuteness, but she is just as stupid as Raku. She takes every opportunity she gets to DENY her love for him. Wtf? Her friend even outright tells her that she's an idiot for not taking the chance, but that doesn't seem to help. Untill a certain point, such a behaviour is cute and funny, but Nisekoi crosses that line very fast. So we have two major contenders who have no right to win. Tachibana feels completely out of place. She appears out of nowhere and just interrupts what SHOULD have been a love triangle. She doesn't even feel like a main character, so why even have her? Tsugumi...well, she's as unimportant as any other side character two episodes after her introduction, so why is she even there? That makes a stupid ass hero (even for harem standards), two female main characters who don't get me to root for them at all and two more girls who add nothing to this anime. This cast is a complete failure and they make me not care about the outcome at all.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSome of you will think that I'm just hating on Nisekoi, but I'm not. I was preparing to like this show before I started watching, as the premise sounded interesting and I heard a lot of good things about it. And to be honest, I did enjoy it for the first couple of episodes. But the further the show gets, the more I got angry about it. In the end it made me so angry that I couldn't watch any more anime for the rest of the day after watching an episode of Nisekoi. And that's sad.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n3.8/10",

            "content": "As the plot suggests, you cannot get a more typical beginning to a RomCom anime. The sweetheart become sweetheart's' soon and the anime takes a stroll in the harem lane. The disappointment about this anime is how suddenly the genre changes perspectives among the viewers. It started as a normal romance-comedy combo but sooner or later girls galore and the main character finds himself enclosed in a dreamy harem.\r\nThe story is majorly unrealistic and the plot is one of the poorest that you will come across. Totally dingus-ish first episode only leads to mayhem for the next the next few episodes where the male MCand the 'supposedly' female MC are forced to make a contract for three years to be each others' companion due to their families being on deep waters. The predictability percentage of the story skyrockets as the episodes pass by. The stunning predictable nature of the plot has many weak links for this anime. The traditional scenes viz., summer festivals, cultural festivals, x-mas, school trips and many more that you see in a normal romance manga came into existence in this anime too but with a severe repetitive rate when taking the manga of it into consideration too. Overall, a letdown when it comes to story-telling.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were well endowed and the characterization was proficient. As is the case in some romance manga, the male MC Raku Ichijo seems to be a student who is studious and good-natured guy while the 'supposedly' female MC, Kirisaki Chitoge is a blonde but smart (  ) girl who is a half with some blaring tsundere traits. Marika Tachibana who gets her introduction in the second half of the anime is a cute, over obsessive and a daring girl who openly expresses her feeling for Raku-sama unlike Kosaki Onodera who is just a polar opposite to Marika. Onward we go to describing Kosaki (my best girl, my love, my life, my wife). Kosaki is a normal girl who has a laudable attitude and is cute to add to that. Sometimes she plays the role of a 'divine damsel in distress' as she is unable to express her feelings for her first and the only love Raku who in himself is madly in love with Dera. She is an introvert and kind and does not have the courage to tell how she feels but during the moments she tries to step up and have the courage to convey her feelings to Raku, unforeseen (meh, you can totally see what is coming. Scumbag Naoshi Komi not giving the chance for Dera-chan) incidents occur which can make the viewers (viewers = TeamOnodera members) get irritated with fuming rage. Nothing much to tell about the remaining girl Tsugumi Seishirou who at first is portrayed as a boy. Genuine trap material, I tell you. Genuine trap. Shuu who is a pervert and a childhood friend of Raku is so vital for the progression of the story, Same is the case with Kosaki's best friend Ruri Miyamoto (glasses |m| ) who plays the role of supporting Kosaki in attaining Raku.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was good. Nothing less to expect from Shaft and its elastic neck insignia. The trademark 'bending their necks in unimaginable angles' and the 'looking down on people' pose were duly present in this anime too. At some points, the animation was kind of over-exerted and was out of place. I always had this doubt on how well Shaft can animate for a RomCom anime without adding weird backgrounds and effects but apparently, they completed the task really well. Shaft's array of funny faces continues in this anime too from where it let off in S2 of Monogatari. The marble eyes, the color tones and all other aspects were well covered while the art style was reasonably unique and exotic for a romance anime. Well, considering it is Shaft, it is no surprise that the animation was gradually different.\\n\\n\r\nNothing much to say about the voicing crew as you all know how the Japanese roll. The fact that HanaKana voiced for Onodera Kosaki makes her to be the solid winner of the best girl of Nisekoi award (at the least according to me). All the characters have been voiced well. Near to attaining flawlessness.\\n\\n\r\nComing into the enjoyment aspect of the anime, it is a given that there will be scenes of frolicking and laughter since the manga is being serialized in Shonen Jump. Nisekoi is no different too. The anime had its fair share of comical scenes and was jovial-natured. Good to watch but sadly impossible to be experienced in reality. If the best girl for you is Kirisaki Chitoge, you can enjoy the anime to your heart's fullest without any qualms. Didn't concentrate much on the music part as I was too busy taking screenshots of Dera-chan and adoring her. Both the openings performed by ClariS (damn them.. a pair of highschool gurls  ) are good. Do ClariS have a knack of performing in harem related anime? Last time I saw their songs getting adopted as the opening for an anime was in OreImo . Some of the background music gave the anime a shoujo-ish vibe while some were relatable to shonen.\\n\\n\r\nMy ratings:\\n\r\nPlot 6/10\\n\r\nAnimation & Art 9/10\\n\r\nMusic 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 (if Dera is the best gurl) 9/10 (if Chitoge is the best gurl)\\n\r\nOverall 7.4/10 (if Dera is the best gurl) 7.8/10 (if Chitoge is the best gurl)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: \\n\r\nOnodera is the best\\n\r\nFuck the rest. \\n\r\n\u202a#\u200eTeamOnodera\u202c for eternity. \\n\r\nTill I lose sanity. \\n\r\nAll hail Kosaki \\n\r\nCause, she too has the key. .\\n",

            "content": "Nisekoi Review:\r\nThis show is sure to get wildly mixed opinions due to 2 things: it's plot is the most cliche, stereotypical thing imaginable..... and Shaft. Both of these \"factors\" will split many people over how good this show really was. To keep those with short attention spans satisfied, here is a summary of my review: Nisekoi was cliche, but still very entertaining, not ground-breaking, but still enjoyable, and Shaft was... well... Shaft (curious as to what that means? read on to learn more!). \r\nStory - 6.8:\r\nI won't delve too much into what the story of Nisekoi is about because you could just look to thetop of this page and see the synopsis so yeah... Now although the premise is nothing new it is still very entertaining to watch. I love me a good high school harem, and Nisekoi's plot embodies the ideal high school rom-com plot. The execution of it all is really what keeps the simple plot of Nisekoi interesting. The multiple \"mysteries\" the show presents keep you engaged, and the character relationships do the same. Whether it's the keys, who Raku likes most, or the introduction of new characters, Nisekoi always has something in its plot to keep you entertained. The singular stories in each episode were also quite good as well and the show honestly could have done fine as an episodic show with no key plot device. However, I was a bit disappointed in the complete lack of resolution in the ending and I'm praying there is a season 2 to fix this. Also, the plot seemed to lose its focus quite often, particularly in the 2nd half. The characters all seemed to have forgotten that the entire point of the show was to find out who's key fit in the locket. These problems aside, for a harem, Nisekoi definitely had a good plot, but it's nothing that breaks any grounds.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7.9:\\n\r\nBefore we move onto the more interesting part of the Art portion of the review, I want to say that all of the character designs by Naoshi Komi were absolutely fantastic. Now.... Shaft. Akiyuki Shinbo. The 2 driving forces in the animation department for this show.\tI have a love/hate relationship with these two, because at times I have loved their work (Madoka), and others it has just annoyed me (Mekakucity Actors, Monogatari). What was really surprising is how Shinbo was working on such a simple show like Nisekoi. However, I can say that (for the most part) they did a great job with this show. Awkward backward head leans aside, the animation in this show was very impressive. This was most evident when they were trying to show exaggerations to make a comedic effect or show how Raku is picturing a girl. Close ups of characters' mouths when they talked were also shockingly fluid. There were of course some unnecessary additions to the scenery by Shaft, but not so many that it became annoying like in the now airing Mekaku City Actors. I can't give the art department too high of a score because the show didn't really demand a high production value due to its lack of action or scenery, but it was definitely good none the less.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.4:\\n\r\nLike the art, the sound of Nisekoi was very good, but not brilliant by any means. This is due to very similar reasons. The show just didn't demand a booming soundtrack or intense, emotion-filled voice acting, and so the ceiling for its sound category was lowered. However, there really wasn't anything to hold against Nisekoi in terms of its sound. The voice acting was actually very good and especially enjoyable during comedic moments or cute moments with the girls. The OPs and EDs were all very good as well. The soundtrack in general was nothing special, but still enjoyable on its own. Overall I'd give the sound department a B for doing its job and then some.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7.5\t:\\n\r\nMuch like the story of Nisekoi, the characters are all obvious cliches. The beauty of it though, is that the show knows this and does a great job of making the characters a joy to watch. The most impressive part of the characters was just how loveable they all were. I honestly didn't care who Raku would choose to be with because I loved all 4 girls about the same amount. At times Onodera would take the lead, but then Kirisaki would take it right back. They all had their own charm and nailed their stereotypes perfectly. The side characters were also just flat out hilarious with notable stars being Shu, Claude, and Ruri. Whenever one of these three got the spotlight, they never failed to make the scene funnier. On the negative side, as expected, none of these characters really have any development. Also, Raku can be really annoying at times with how clueless he is and his horrible ability to read the situation. The characters all actually lack common sense most notably when it comes to their feelings for Raku. These negatives aside, the characters in Nisekoi were a very fun bunch to watch over the 20 episodes and I hope I get to see more of them in a second season!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8.0:\\n\r\nThe one absolute truth with Nisekoi was that it sure as hell was enjoyable for me. It was funny as hell and kept interested just enough in its overarching plot to make me excited each saturday for a new episode. The simplicity of the show actually gave it an advantage, because it really didn't have anywhere to screw up. The characters were an absolute joy to watch and I have rarely found a show to make me flip flop over which girl is my favorite as much as this show did. The only real downside in terms of enjoyment was that the show lacked enough substance to bring it into that emotional level of enjoyment that you would find in a more epic or dramatic show. However, if you want an easy-going romcom that will make you laugh, this show is for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.52:\\n\r\nI must say that Shaft did a wonderful job with Nisekoi. No it wasn't filled with meaning or substance. No it wasn't unique plot wise. It was \"just\" another cliche harem. However, the execution of the show along with the pretty aesthetics and wonderful characters made Nisekoi a show well worth the watch. With romcoms like this, all you need for it to be enjoyable is a good set of characters, and a decent plot, and Niskoi absolutely had those in check.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nA simple romantic comedy anime set in high school filled with humor, and cute girls that was well worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Shaft stayed faithful (enough) to the source material\\n\r\n+ The main girls are all wonderful\\n\r\n+ Side characters are hilarious\\n\r\n+ Doesn't try to do too much\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Lacks emotional substance\\n\r\n- Inconsistent plot with no resolution\\n\r\n- Characters lack logic at times\\n\\n\r\n7.52/10 - Great\\n",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nCan we, just the two of us, have a little heart to heart? Come now. Let's sit down at the table, look each other in the eye, and speak without veiling what we both truly mean. Okay, I'll go first. I don't want you to hate me. Please don't. My self-esteem is low as it is, and I don't think I can handle having my own readers turn on me, so, please, hear me out.\r\n     What I need to say is this. Nisekoi is not a good anime. It's predictable. It's aimless. It is, by merely existing,the epitome of every single cliche school-life harem romance that the anime industry has been saddled with more for as long as I can remember. There's no innovation. It has no ambition to be, pretend, or fool the audience into thinking, it is anything more than self-regurgitated slop that it will be forced down our gullible throats, because it knows that it doesn't need to try to be more than that, as Nisekoi knows that its audience will come and make it popular no matter how bad it is. Now let me say a second thing. I love this anime.\\n\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, and it's time to get out the flame-shields, waifu banners and shipping containers, because today, it is one of my guiltiest of guilty pleasures: Nisekoi. Now then, let's get started.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we start the debate of who \"best girl\" is, let's talk technical shall we? Nisekoi was animated by renown studio Shaft, who are famous for their work on the Monogatari franchise, Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei(which basically instantly puts them into the top tier of my favorite animation studios). The anime was directed by Akuyuki Shimbo, directer of the Monogatari franchise, Puella Magi Madoka, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei... huh. Okay, just to save time, let's just say this man has basically directed everything Shaft have animated in the last 10 years. Finally, it aired from January 10th to May 23rd of 2014, a span which gave it a total of 20 episodes. Now, the plot. Or whatever you should call it.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to \"Bland Generic Japanese Highschool That Is Located In A Suburban Town That Remains Nameless No. 8593#\". Here, we meet \"Generic Highschool-Age Harem Protagonist Who Lacks All Semblance of Personality But Still Somehow Attracts A Group of Waifu-Material Love-Interests Who Follow Him Around Like a Lost Puppy No. X#\", in this case, who goes by the name of Raku Ichijou. \"But wait!\" yells Nisekoi, \"we have something new... look! The plot of Love Hina!\" Yes, as it would turn out, Raku has a couple of secrets. The first one is that he just happens to be the son of the leader of the Yakuza, which somehow doesn't interfere with his everyday life at all, and the second one concerns the key-hole shaped pendant that hangs around his neck. See, 10 years ago when he was still a child, Raku made a promise with a girl he met one faithful summer. They exchanged the locket and a key, and swore to each-other when they met again, the girl would unlock the pendant hanging around Raku's chest, and they would get married. Aw... how romantic. But unfortunately for this romance, Raku appears to have forgotten to ask the girl a few essential questions, like what her name is, or where she lives, or anything that may have been helpful in ever finding her again.\\n\\n\r\n     So, as Raku lives out his adolescence searching for his long-lost childhood sweet-heart, he has yet another faithful encounter with a girl, and by encounter I mean collision, as in her hurry to get to school on time, the girl: Chitoge Kirisaki slams directly into Raku. Needless to say, this starts their relationship on rocky footing, and it doesn't help when later that day, Chitoge is introduced to Raku's class as their new transfer student from America, and the following interaction fans the flames of conflict between the two even more. So, you can imagine Raku's reaction when his father informs him that Chitoge is actually the daughter of an enemy mafia faction. But since neither Chitoge or Raku's fathers really want to fight(and since they are apparently incapable of just, I don't know, calling their respective forces off from the turf war), they come up with, what I assume, is the next best possible way to quell the tension between their two sides. See, neither side will want to fight each-other... if the son and daughter of their leaders are boyfriend and girlfriend. You probably can see where this is going. Even though they only need to act like they are romantically involved, Raku and Chitoge are still at odds with one another, a situation not helped by the fact that Raku already has someone he likes: the shy and beautiful Kosaki Onodera, who unbeknownst to him, returns his feelings enthusiastically, but doesn't know that Raku's and Chitoge's relationship is a mere act. And, simply put, highschool high-jinks ensues.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think I've sounded a little sarcastic during those last two paragraphs, congratulations, your sarcasm-detector is working just fine. This is my way of acknowledging that I know perfectly well how dumb this all is, how cliche and fulls of holes the plot is, and how superficial the whole anime is, so... why do I not care? Well, if I had to express it... I'd say Nisekoi is perfect. Okay, let me start over. I am not saying that Nisekoi is a perfect 10/10 masterpiece that deserves unrivaled recognition from the community and trumps such petty competition like The Tatami Galaxy, Kara no Kyoukai or Welcome to the NHK. No, I'm definitely not saying that. But what I am saying is that, as a romantic comedy meant to be easily digested and enjoyed, Nisekoi does its job and does it... kind of perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest piece of why lies in the comedy, namely, Nisekoi is freakin' hilarious. It's a perfect mixture of comedic timing, character interaction(which particularly shines between Raku and Chitoge), and self-aware ridiculousness, which all culminates in a final episode where the class holds a Romeo and Juliet play: an episode where I'm pretty sure I never stopped laughing once. And needless to say, you don't really have time to think about how stupid it all is if you're too busy laughing. Things happen in the series that are borderline fantasy, like when a cross-dressing assassin/bodyguard transfers into the class, or how seemingly every single girl Raku meets seems to have a mysterious key and vague memories of a childhood promise, but all anybody seems to know for sure is that they were all on top of a hill together and someone made a promise to someone at some point but we're not quite sure.\\n\\n\r\n     And for those of you seeking cute romance with no actual emotional connection involved, Nisekoi has you covered as well. To start, all the girls look like walking marshmallows with arms and legs, so f*cking \"kawaii\" that you just want to squeeze them till they concede to being your waifu. See, Nisekoi has more than an adept grasp on how the keep the shipping wars going. It throws in a couple adorable girls, gives them all one episode of development with the main character, an archetype of a personality, then gives all of them a few moments of absolute adorableness that make you just love them anyway despite how bland most of them are. Oh, is Chitoge a tsundere so run-of-mill it borders on aggravating? Just give her a moment where she apologizes for her actions in English which is so goddamn cute that it makes you want to keel over and die from moe-overload. Does Onodera have the personality of a chair with moe eyes on it that can't express other traits besides from shyness and a crush on the main character? Have Kana Hanazawa make the cutest squeaks ever from behind her micro-phone when she's embarrassed and watch the legion of fans defend her honor from the \"evil team Chitoge\". Then rinse and repeat this process until you have a perpetual \"best girl war\" that threatens to tear apart the fan-base, and simply watch the dreams be crushed underneath you as you sit upon your huge pile of money. And it works. Amazingly so.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you need to give Nisekoi credit for is that it wholeheartedly understands this concept, and also realizes that this anime will only work if it is kept in this limbo, and if anything as audacious as \"plot-development\" should become unavoidable, it's Nisekoi's solemn duty to prevent it at any cost. Is one of the harem members confessing? Have a baseball fly through the window to cut her off half-way. Is she trying again? Oh no, the main character fell asleep and missed it completely. Are we finally about to find out if one of the girl's key's fits Raku's locket? Oh how unfortunate, she got nervous and twisted it too hard, breaking it in the lock. Somehow.\\n\\n\r\n     It's times like that when Nisekoi does begin to try my patience. Usually, I'm enjoying it too much to mind the stupidity, but when things like that happen it's a harsh wake-up call for me, reminding me to once again put on my pretentious analytical glasses and stop having fun. But the series is so completely in love with itself, and so innocently fun, that I can't help but forgive it every time. Of course, this means that the anime will probably run out of novelty(for lack of a better word) soon, as the plot annoyances begin to overshadow the mindless fun, and, as it turns out, that's exactly what happened in the second season, but as for these first 20 episodes, viewing season 1 on its own, Nisekoi pulls it off, I think. 20 episodes, that unless you have the sense of humor of a rock, you should find more than entertaining enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI consider myself above the petty squabble of the \"Best Girl Wars\", because who is best girl and who is not matters not to the analytical lens of which I peer through to evaluate an anime on unbiased merits. Therefore, I shall not let any sort of embers from the flames of conflict throw off my completely objective summary of these characters, I shall trade no insults, and will take no cheap shots(because Chitoge is obviously girl and anyone is disagrees is clearly wrong). Seriously though, let's talk about characters.\\n\\n\r\n     If you've met the protagonist of nearly any harem anime ever made, you've probably already met our main character Raku Ichijou. He is the clueless nice guy that can, at random intervals do something epic for the sake of the plot, and that's all he really gives off as he wanders the school with a parade of attractive girls behind him. For whatever reason, I find I don't mind his lack of personality as much as I do with other main character's of this nature, and I think I can owe that to the comedy for mostly making his interactions with the other characters greatly enjoyable, especially with his friend Shu, or as I like to call him: The Best Wing-man in The World and MVP for the anime in general.\\n\\n\r\n     Chitoge Kirisaki is the main love interest, a blond and beautiful American transfer student that ebbs \"tsundere\" from every action she takes and word she says. And as tiring as that can get sometimes, her rare moments of clarity as a character surprisingly do a lot in the long run, and it also helps that she somewhat \"drops the act\" by the end of it. The only times the anime gets even remotely close to something tangible involves Chitoge, and that's enough to earn the \"best girl\" medal in my heart.\\n\\n\r\n     But of course, a harem would not be worth anything without a secondary love interest, so here we have Kosaki Onodera, the shy and eloquent girl who Raku has been crushing after ever since middle-school. While I don't mind her at all, she pretty much epitomizes the most frustrating element of Nisekoi: the aimless plot. The story literally could have ended at any point if Onodera got over her shyness and told Raku she liked him back, but since she doesn't have any sort of development in that that sense unlike Chitoge, that somewhat cute shyness is all she really has going for her. It helps that she has a no nonsense friend named Ruri who is basically there to call her and Raku out on just how tiring their current relationship is and one of them should just confess already, but unfortunately Nisekoi, just because you're aware of how stupid it is that this premise can be stretched for 20 episodes without any real progress being made, that doesn't make it any less stupid.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation & Sound\\n\\n\r\nI know a lot of people have a love-hate relationship with the eccentric art-style of studio Shaft's anime, but ever since I first saw it in Bakemonogatari, I will admit I fell completely in love with it, and Nisekoi has everything you'd expect from them: great backgrounds, cool aesthetic and character design, and a schizophrenic camera that can't seem to stop panning upwards or cutting around to eyes rapidly. So yeah, I personally think Nisekoi is top-notch in the animation department. The one complaint I will accept about it though, is that Shaft's quirks don't exactly gel very well with what is essentially just a romcom; this is no Monogatari or Zetsubou Sensei after all. If you're not well acquainted with Shaft's works in the past, the first episode of Nisekoi may take some getting used to, what with the unique cinematography and animation techniques. But... I do think an average viewer will get used to it relatively quickly; it by no means ruins the experience and becomes basically the norm a few episodes in. If you're worried about it, don't be, it's really nothing to be fussed about. \\n\\n\r\n     The OST for Nisekoi was handled in majority by Tomoki Kikuya, who has done previous Shaft soundtracks like Hidamari Sketch. To be honest, I don't think I ever really registered the background music of the anime, and copyright troubles have made finding the soundtrack in its entirety quite hard to do, but from what I scavenged and what I remember, it's not great. Far from bad of course, there's quite a variety of instruments and tones being expressed by Kikuya's music, but nothing is really worth listening to on its own. Which I suppose is expected for a harem anime, but what with Shaft's impressive OST collection, it does seem a little underwhelming. But there is a silver lining. I never really was found of either ED, but both OP's: \"Click\" and \"step\" are absolutely joys to listen to: 90 second jingles that worm into your ears and have you singing along after you've sat through them a number of times, and that shouldn't take long if you marathon this anime like I did.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\\n\r\nI realize there's no particularly substantial reason for me to put Nisekoi on this pedestal that no other anime of its genre will likely ever reach. Nisekoi is not special. There was anime similiar to it before and there will be anime similiar to it in the future, that did or could do what Nisekoi tried and better. So why do I love it so, and why will I be giving it such an, arguably undeservedly high score at the end of this review? How to put it... If I had to explain my feelings towards this show, it's the show I decided to fall in love with, despite its problems and despite its convention. It somehow managed to force its way into my heart despite so many shows similiar to it not being able to. And yes. I know that's na\u00efve, and I know that's shallow. I know I'm just being fooled by the anime's enduring personality and pretty colors that hides the truth behind Nisekoi: that an entry in the ever vast anime medium, it's a show that truly has no new ideas to offer. But for once, just in the case of this anime, I find that I'm perfectly happy to be fooled. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Ruru x Shu is OTP\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "Nisekoi is a melting pot of frustration and patience testing but I wouldn't call it boredom by any means. What the show lacks in plot it makes up for with its eye-catching art style and characters that - despite all inexplicably falling for the protagonist - are at least distinct and have a variety of personalities that are fun to watch come into conflict. On paper it's your standard harem and though it isn't an exemplary show a combination of the above factors at least put it well clear of average. \r\nOur story follows Raku Ichijou and his search for a long-lost childhood love, atleast it starts out that way. When Chitoge Kirisaki arrives on the scene tensions boil over when the pair are asked to pretend to be boyfriend and girlfriend. The childhood love, which was always at the back of Ichijo's mind, suddenly comes to the fore when he realises that the past could be catching up with him. The unwelcome coupling also hurts his dream of asking out his crush Kosaki Onodera and so we now have our main conflict. \\n\\n\r\nAt least it's an interesting spin on the harem situation and allows even just a little bit of extra complexity to creep into the relationships between everyone involved. The situation between the leading pair is the fodder for the show's comedy, usually revolving around the act of trying to keep up appearances in front of some rather deadly opposition. I found myself laughing often enough to get me through the lack of anything of story value actually happening.\\n\\n\r\nIt's story 'progression' goes something along the lines of \"awkward situation\" -> \"misunderstanding\" -> \"learn something new about each other\" -> \"can't bring themselves to act upon this information\". In other words, no progression. However it doesn't mean the show can put out its share of fun moments. Despite probably not working as a complete package, due to little being achieved on the plot front, a mix of individually strong episodes and moments mean my time was definitely not wasted. In fact, I really wanted more.\\n\\n\r\nI believe the show manages to avoid ever becoming completely stale. Some of the reasons for this feel a bit cheap though. If the pace starts to drop off, the show introduces a new character and lets them take control for the next few episodes until the balance is restored. Then that cycle repeats until the series ends. It works to an extent. Each character brings a new level of drama to the situation and it brings out its share of amusing moments. Some characters are certainly more interesting than others. Chitoge tends to command the scene every time she's around and also shows the most amount of development across the 20 episodes - if we can call it development.\\n\\n\r\nThat unmistakeable Shaft art style is an attention grabber, and another reason why things kept feeling fresh. Brightly patterned background elements, long range establishing shots, wacky reaction faces, quick cuts, unorthodox camera angles. It definitely all has an element of charm to it. This show is very, very vivid with its colour selection and suits it well. There's little actually carried out in the animation department that is of a stand-out level, but in something less action focused that's perfectly fine. All the VA's also do a really good job and go a long way at helping to bring life to their characters.\\n\\n\r\nI went in with relatively low expectations but they were surpassed. I can recommend Nisekoi to anyone who's after a couple of laughs but not for anyone who wants romance. It draws a parallel to Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun in that it's a show where the romance is simply used as a device to hand out large doses of comedy instead. If you go in with this mindset you'll get much more out of it.",

He isn't special. He isn't smart, not really good at psychical activity, not a good fighter (He is a part of yakuza family, so we expected him to be a goodfighter.) The only thing that is good on him is, he is a good cook. He can cook a decent food. And, lot of girls attracted to him. almost all of the main girls character like him.\\n\r\nBut, the protagonist is a dense character, he doesn't even know that kosaki likes him. But this anime is a fun ride, i recommend this anime for a newcomer to anime world, because this anime is easy to watch. Plus the mystery about who is the real key holder who made promise with the protagonist make you crave for more episode each week lol.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9.5/10\\n\r\nI personally like this anime art. all character are drawn beautifully, for example like chitoge and onodera. the background of each scene also carefully drawn, and the quality of each episode never disappoint me.\\n\r\nThe season 2's art is better, so i just want to say this, good job shaft!, you just did a really great job adapting nisekoi manga.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI really like the OP and ED songs in this anime. Claris did a a really great job singing both OP 1 and OP 2 for this anime. the background music also nice, and for the voice actress, they choose the right person for each character in this anime. for example, Kosaki. Hanazawa Kana really fit Kosaki's shy nature, other character such as shuu is hilarious when teasing his friend.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nMaybe the character is this anime weakness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8.7/10\\n\r\nI really enjoy this series, romcom lover must watch this anime..\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 8.4/10\\n\r\nThis anime is easy to watch, and a really fun ride.\\n",

            "content": "Nisekoi is a trope-filled, cliche, completely unoriginal romance anime wrapped in Shaft's signature style. However, despite it's complete and utter unoriginality (which I can not stress enough), it is still an enjoyable watch. But let me break it down:\r\n~~STORY~~\r\nMinor spoilers? I guess? You can't really spoil Nisekoi, since if you have watched a single high-school romance anime you'll instinctively know most of the story. Childhood promises of marriage where no one remembers who, no one ever successfully confessing to the other, hot-spring episode, beach episode, a whole lot of misunderstandings. Is there a festival? Of course! Is there a test of courage? You bet! Thepremise is fine... probably the only original-ish thing in the whole series - but its more of a background reminder as to why the main pairing are forced to be together at all. If you're looking for a romantic story, Nisekoi is NOT for you. There isn't anything special at all about it. Convenient and inconvenient timing, chance and coincidence are what control the plot, nothing else.\\n\\n\r\n~~ART~~\\n\r\nThis is where opinions will differ greatly about Nisekoi, as Nisekoi is definitely a Shaft anime. Expect bright colours, changing backgrounds, fast sporadic cuts, head tilts, close zooms into character's eyes, random blocks of text, etc, etc. If you're into Shaft's style Nisekoi will not disappoint you, but if you don't like their previous works (probably most comparable would be Arakawa under the bridge), then you won't like this one.\\n\\n\r\n~~SOUND~~\\n\r\nNot bad, not good, just there. I literally just finished the series and I don't remember any of the music. Not remembering is better than hating though.\\n\\n\r\n~~CHARACTERS~~\\n\r\nOh boy, here we go. This is where this review will get its most dislikes. The main (romantic) cast are well executed but completely cookie cutter tropes. This is an issue because I really REALLY don't like Tsunderes - and as per usual one of the main girls is one of the biggest I've seen. Oh, and she's also scared of the dark and of lightning, so let's not forget those cliches as well. Other main romantic interest is the flawless moe girl who has a crush on the main character... and of course she can't cook. Oh, and they introduce a third girl mid-way who pursues the protagonist in a more obvious way of course (most shows wait till season 2 to introduce her). They're well executed, but they're all so... typical. Of course my favorite characters in these shows are the best friend characters, both of which were the best part of Nisekoi for me. They were also the only ones who weren't completely brainless. The other side characters are also enjoyably quirky as well. As long as people recognize that Miyamoto is best girl, I'll be happy.\\n\\n\r\n~~ENJOYMENT~~\\n\r\nDespite my criticism, I did enjoy the show. While the story is oh so bland and cliche, it is still funny. When it wants to be cute, it is cute. When it wants to be tense, it's tense. When it wants to be funny, it usually succeeds. It's well executed if nothing else. The people behind Nisekoi KNOW how to make anime, they just chose a cliche IP to work with.\\n\\n\r\n~~OVERALL~~\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't require your full attention - it's a good show to have on in the background as you do something else. The story is cliche and hits all the tropes of a romance anime, but if you like that sort of thing, go nuts. But if you're looking for a unique look at romance in anime - move along.\\n\\n\r\nToodles~",

Thought it may be another one of those harem themed animes, such twist however does deliver such uniqueness, to this anime's story plot.\r\nArt: Poor 3.\r\nOk, Chitoge isthe only one who wore knee high socks, I guess it's a give that every anime should have a character who must wear such garment, but it was kinda unfair to only limit it to her, also there is Tsugumi where I would never understand why she has to be in a school boy's uniform combine with a hair ribbon that make her look like a straight guy who is trying hard to be gay, what even worse was that she sport a different guy's school uniform where if I were this anime/manga's illustrator I would have her wore a gakuran, then again I might have her wore a girl's school uniform since she looks hot in it. About Tachibana, I also a bit disappointing as to why she has to be in her former school's school uniform that makes her look like a granny and frankly she would have look cute wearing the same school uniform that Onodera wore. There is that long yellow tie thingy in front of the girls school uniform where I can's say if it's a noose to hang themselves with or some kind of useless, dorky and embarrassing accessory that them girls have to wear, now c'mon why couldn't  this anime/manga's illustrator just limit it to a certain length? Then again, just leave it to them Jap's to come up with some dorky school accessory for an anime/manga school girl's uniform.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nI just love the two opening songs of this anime where I can't wait to download it as soon as it hits \"Gendou.Com.\" Oh yeah, it's already in \"Gendou.Com.\"  \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI think it would be better to explain each of the cast as to why I give it a 6.\\n\\n\r\nRaku- basically your typical harem boy, but unlike any harem boy, this guy has someone in his sights and yes it's Onodera. However, he is also a dichotomy where he plans to keep his promise to a girl who has the key to the pendant he's been holding for 10 years. The problem, was that he is in a situation where there are 3 key holders to the pendant he's holding. What irks me about him was that there is a clear indication that whoever has the key to his pendant he will still go for Onodera. Frankly, I would have given this part an 8, but since this charater may be funny at one point, I also find him annoying.\\n\\n\r\nChitoge- a typical tsundere girl......she and Raku may have had some sweet moments with each other but  I kinda love to hate her. Oh and her hair ribbon kinda make her look like a she devil, in fact \"Gorilla\" isn't a good moniker for her, in fact Raku should have referred to her as \"Yokai onna\" or \"devil girl.\" \\n\\n\r\nOnodera- what I like about her, was that she really has that girl friend material for Raku and I'm glad that there is the end arc where she gets to be with him. But it ain't enough to give this part an 8.\\n\\n\r\nMarika- ok, she is actually my 2nd choice if ever that Raku X Onodera arc doesn't come forth, to me I personally believe that she is the actual holder of the key that will open Raku's pendant, however, I can't seem to fathom that Raku was a bit reluctant to be near her....where I'm thinking that he maybe a masochist where he has gotten hooked with Chitoge's physical abuse. Frankly, I kinda pity her.\\n\\n\r\nSeishirou- ok so she is this tough girl, but more like a girl who is trigger happy, she may look cute.......if she were to be in a girl's school uniform, but, too bad that her role is just limited to such extent, and I don't know what else to make of her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very Good.\\n\\n\r\nThe romantic comedy was very good, and very enjoyable. There were of course the sweet moments where the guy get's to spend with each girl, that I find sweet and just just sweet, but very sweet indeed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nIt maybe enjoyable to watch, but let's not forget that this anime has failed to show us audience as to what is inside Raku's pendant, which unfortunately leaves this anime to have a crucial open ending, and I'm not impress that such open ending has left us audience's curiosity be hanged.   \\n",

Doesnt feel right in an romance-anime which this is \"trying\" to be.\r\nNot sure why, but both main charachers feels a bit off the entire plot. The series might be good, i watched this around when it came out with subs. Now that im re-watching it im realising how BAD it actually is.\r\nIm really trying my best to watch all the 20 episodes, but the girl feels just too dramatic and violent to actually make much sense. Andontop of it all the fanservice seems to be a bit annoying.\\n\\n\r\nNot much more i want to say about this \"trash\" anime. But its one of the few anime's i saw as manga form, then searched it up and remembered it was anime. It might be fun watching these old ones, but i wish there wasnt that much violence again..\\n\\n\r\nI felt this anime was good without the excessive violence. Im at episode 7 now as im writing this, i dont remember much since i first watched it anyway (7-8 yrs i think ago).\\n\\n\r\nWould not watch again if it wasnt for the romance, now im done writing, its 00:38 and i gotta wake up in 5 hours.\\n\\n\r\n-Multi aka John.",

We'll use the key to open the lock and then... We'll get married!\"\r\n~The Promised Girl\r\nNisekoi is a story about a promise. What this promise is exactly and who all is involved is what the entire series revolves around.\r\nOur story begins with Yakuza heir Ichijo Raku sometime between spring and summer in his first year of high school. Following typical anime cliches he has a chance and violent encounter with a girl who happensto be the new transfer student: Kirisaki Chitoge. Raku, like any high school boy, has a crush on a girl. However, that causes issues when various and largely irrelevant plot elements force Raku to be in a fake relationship (Nisekoi means fake love) with Chitoge.\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi is largely a harem show. So, like any harem show the largest strengths lie in the characters. First and foremost we have our male lead Ichijo Raku. Raku is a kindhearted individual who is easy to like but hard to relate to. He does what you would expect from a male protagonist but is able to feel unique though within the genre to be refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls all fill common niches and talking about them too much could potentially spoil things. So I'll make this light. First up is Chitoge, your classic tsundere with a foul mouth. However she is thoroughly entertaining. She has the most development out of anyone in the show. Her interactions with Raku are some of the best I've seen outside of Monogatari. They aren't as memorable individually but each one is quite hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOnodera is the timid girl with a crush. Onodera is easily one of the best and worst aspects of this show. The way her development and progression is handled is enough to make you want to pull your hair out. However, she is still enjoyable to watch whenever she is on screen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two girls added later on but they have absolutely no contribution to the plot of the anime in any way shape or form, other than to simply boost numbers in the harem.\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi is a harem that knows it's a harem, often making fun of other harems. The plot feels gimmicky at times, and the pacing can be frustrating. However, if you can look past all of that and accept the show for what it is it's quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is typical Shaft, mirroring the Monogatari series in many ways as far as style goes. Everything looks great. The backgrounds are crip, the characters look beautiful, and the animation is fluid. Considering how undetailed the manga was Shaft did a phenomenal job bringing this anime to life.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack on the other hand is pretty mediocre outside of the OPs and EDs. Each track is able to add emotion to the scene but none are particularly well done enough to enjoy on their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime however does come with it's own share of issues. Being a manga adaptation many things are bound to be lost or cut. Some of these severely hampered the show. First and most obvious are the two girls added later on. Each one has lost many of their individual chapters making them simply feel like numbers in a harem rather than a compelling characters to move the plot forward. To go along with this many chapters explaining Chitoge's development were also removed making the events in some scenes lose their impact.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Nisekoi is a very good anime, easily my favorite harem. It does have it's faults and it ends with the promise being entirely unresolved but there is hope for consecutive seasons.\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi is a show that completely surprised me, and now I find myself wanting more.",

            "content": "This is my first review so please be kind on me ;A;\r\n(WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SMALL AMOUNTS OF MILD SPOILERS)\r\n\u201cZawsze in love\u201d \r\nWould you remember the promise you made to the person whom you loved 10 years ago?\r\nNisekoi is a school romantic comedy with an interesting storyline that grasps my attention weekly and has been my routine for my Sunday morning for over 20 weeks. It follows a very standard romcom routine except it has been executed better in terms of gripping me to see who the girl Ichijou had made his promise to be.\r\nNow, enough with the summary, let\u2019s go to the rating.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nOkay, beforeanyone asks why I put the rating for the story to be so high, let me explain. I am a sucker for romantic comedy and have watched several recommended romcoms circa joining MyAnimeList and I have to say, romcoms always follow a certain template, more or less, in introducing the characters/ couple. However what I found interesting about Nisekoi was that they were forced into their pairs and we all know what THAT would lead to, the mutual hate for each other which results to the violence between the two which also plays as the comedic relief, at times. If you were like me, and had watched several romcoms, you\u2019d know the routine about test of courage, hot spring, school festival and what not. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not too sure about this part but I\u2019ll try my best to elaborate this section and the reason for my score. The animation is similar to that of the other Shaft\u2019s production such as Bakemonogatari (which happens to be the only other Shaft production I have had the pleasure of watching). I\u2019m not too picky about the art so anything that\u2019s simple and appeals to my eye gets the point. The constant pattern background when Chitoge lays her tsundere moves or Ichijou\u2019s reaction that happens to be more of a side event appeals to me as a viewer as it is colourful and abstract. The character\u2019s expressions aren\u2019t the best but hey, so long as it isn\u2019t terrible I\u2019m fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters you see in the show are what you\u2019d expect from any romcom, or if this is your first romcom, it may be what you think it is. Ichijou Raku, the son of the Yakuza, is a kind-hearted individual with a pervy friend, Maiko, who acts as the comedic relief and the mediator, at times.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we move on to Chitoge. She is more or less your average tsundere who is REAAALLLY adorable wants her dere side shows (such as Inaba from Kokoro Connect). Next, we have Ichijou\u2019s pseudo-harem made up of his childhood friends who know each other, Marika and Onodera. The two are somewhat unique characters that got me looking forward to the next episode to find out their personality. I wouldn\u2019t go talking about them as it may be a very big spoiler for some of you who appreciate character development so\u2026 moving on!~\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA catchy opening and an ending which suits how each episode ends is what appeals to me. Nisekoi has, without a doubt, a catchy opening that constantly plays in my head. The background music suits the situation, more so the awkward ones than others, nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe character\u2019s voices are what catches my attention more. Each character has a voice that, I would say, is perfectly suited to the characters\u2019 personality such as Onodera being innocent and Chitoge being the violent-yet-cute tsundere. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nAs stated, so many times, I have yet to refine my taste in romcom and what I enjoy is simplicity itself. Nisekoi, however, is not simply a romcom anime. In the show, it injects colourful gags and a little slice of life later on in the series. Earlier in the anime, the rather interesting storyline grasped my attention every Sunday morning. A special shout-out to the supporting characters such as Maiko and Miyamoto for making the series brighter when I needed to. I especially enjoyed the later few episodes in the series as it made me feel as though I could relate to Ichijou\u2019s situation and that\u2019s what piqued my interest in seeing how it ended.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.8/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom start to end, Nisekoi has been nothing but wonderful, apart from having to wait a week for the next episode which made me hooked on it. Other than that, there\u2019s nothing left to say which is spoiler-free. If you\u2019re like me and love romcoms, I\u2019d recommend Nisekoi. Especially so if you\u2019ve watched Toradora.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I hope you guys enjoyed my review, SANKYU!\\n",

            "content": "Favorite Quote: \"I may just be your fake boyfriend, but if anything happens I'll be the one to protect you.\" -Raku Ichijou\r\nNisekoi or should I say False Love in the English translation. I originally done a review on this romantic comedy on my old account, son714, but I lost the account information.  Anyways, I've always connected alot more with the kind and caring characters in romantic comedies. Actually to be honest, I've always done this in almost every anime. I guess one could say I'm a very kind person. Hence, the reason why I identify with that specific quote from Nisekoi and as someonewho has personally done this as well.  So how do I feel about Nisekoi? Here's the my review of why I really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: As the summary suggests it's about two gang families who attempt to stop the ongoing conflict by faking a relationship between two of our main characters. Simple right? Actually, not quite. The story adds a rather interesting twist to it with the key locket and the promise that the main character kept in his childhood years. I thought that this would make the storyline rather overwhelming, but surprisingly, it wasn't. I felt that the overall plot was still retained after introducing the fake relationship between Raku and Chitoge. However, one thing to note is that the romance in this series didn't offer us anything new. It was a generic all girls like the guy type harem. But what I did like was the approach they took to develop this. Instead of using a simple high school setup, the author used the gang family conflict and the locket as a way to develop the romance. It wasn't painfully obvious like other romantic comedies. It had me second guessing alot at times.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Nisekoi was actually very well done. Some parts are just so colorful and lively, but despite that, it didn't distract me from the overall story.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I loved the soundtrack and the opening alot. The soundtrack perfectly captured the mood of many parts of the segment. For example, there are times when Raku had to go save Chitoge countless times. The soundtrack goes from being comical to being serious. It helps build tension and the romance.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in this series was also very well done. As I watched the series the anime does a good job of introducing new characters. They did it in a way where it had me constantly wonder whether or not this will effect Raku's fake relationship with Chitoge. One other thing that I liked about the characters was how they developed over time. This was especially true for Raku and Chitoge. As dense as the main character is, the fake relationship with Chitoge actually made him question who he liked. We also see him show his true character towards the people around him.  Gradually however, he began to realize his feelings which shows character development.  I thought that was pretty cool. Other than that, the character didn't offer us anything new in the romantic comedy genre.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion: Honestly, Nisekoi is the my second favorite harem and romantic comedy. It is also one of my favorite animes of all time. I understand opinions may differ, but I think everything that we would expect from a romantic comedy is here. Not only that, it was hilarious and serious at times.  The writing was done extremely well to convey this to the audience. It sure hooked me in and wanted me to continue the series. So much that I was continuing the manga. But there are times when it fell short from being a masterpiece. The characters would be something you would expect from a harem series. If there was a 9.5 rating I would definitely give it that. Loved the anime and hope to see more of from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. I hope this persuaded you guys to check out this anime. You will get tons of laughs, I promise that! A great anime that is worth a watch.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

Well welcome to oreimo minus incest. Where the best girl wars are so fierce you can't help but laugh at the idiocy of it all. This series is basically a combination of Oreimo and Golden time (though instead of ghosts no one can remember what the hell happened 10 years ago as if that somehow makes a cohesive plot). The story is awful, you know the ship from the start. You also know exactly how it's going to playout with the dopey main character doing exactly what protaganistkun should (winning all the time ayup).\\n\\n\r\nThat being said it's a cute show if you can get past the fact that it's been blatantly ripping off its own genre (much like MHA and shounen). It does combine the elements well it's just not especially interesting because of it's lack of originality though.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets +3 for 2 OPs by ClariS though. That's about the only redeeming thing about this show.",

            "content": "TL;DR:\r\nA high school boy, the heir of a yakuza gang, is forced into a relationship with a girl from another gang, when his heart is actually set on finding his dream girl; a girl he made a promise to 10 years ago but whose identity he no longer remembers. The story had so much potential, but the circular plot that resolved nothing in the end, became a disappointment. The question, \"who was the girl 10 years ago\" was never answered, and it dragged on too long it kinda makes anyone lose interest in actually finding out the answer in the second season.\r\nI would say, thisAnime is good enough to make you enjoy it till the end, but not so much that you would consider continuing with season 2.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, Art and Voice acting isn't really a problem. It was well executed, but not overwhelmingly good that it merits an Oscar Award.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI must say, anyone, including me, would have really high hopes considering the unique concept of the story. The premise of a fake and forced relationship due to gang wars definitely might sound original and cool, but I must say, the story fell a little bit short and didn't deliver to it's full potential.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone would want to know who the mystery girl 10 years ago is, and its fun to see that her identity isn't too straightforward. However, as the producers wanted to make the mystery complex, it ended up involving too many people and the confusion just ends up losing the interest of any watcher. It's fine to have 2 potential girls who could be the mystery girl, but to suddenly and abruptly introduce another girl in the middle of the series (and reveals that this new girl is also potentially the one), it became very messy and cluttered. Not to mention, it became unrealistic. A coincidence could happen twice, but three times? That's too much of a stretch for anyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe aren't any fillers or plot holes that were obvious to the average viewer, however, the plot was very circular because what you knew as you started the series, remains the same even when you end the series.  \\n\\n\r\nART - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to talk about here. I know that art is subjective and it depends on your preference, however, I will generally describe the artistic value of this piece as neutral as I may.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are drawn well enough to draw out emotions and feelings from the viewers. For example, the girls in the Anime are drawn good enough for anyone to believe that this is what a 'beautiful' girl looks like.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation panels were consistence and the style didn't seem to deviate as the series progressed. The fluidity of each passing scene felt natural and worked well in telling the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe colours in the Anime are also not a problem. There were no blinding colours as observed in some bad Animation out there, (ahem, Pokemon) but were vibrant enough to keep the story alive, cheerful happy. This tone suits the story and didn't feel unnecessarily forced.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds were to a certain extent good, but definitely not special. Not something worth remembering, and certainly doesn't make you pause the video and say, \"wow\". It's not bad though, I must say, as the backgrounds didn't interfere with the telling of the story.\\n\\n\r\nOne unique point of discussion in this Anime is the flashbacks. The flashbacks are made to look like a playback on a 1960's black and white film. I had no problem with this, in fact, I kinda liked it as it made it obvious that this unclear film was a depiction of the main protagonist's poor memory over the events that unfolded 10 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst, let's talk about the opening themes. All three were in my opinion, perfectly suited to the tone of the story. The cheerful, fast paced melody is in a way a metaphor to show the cheerful, ever-so-happy attitude of high school kids and the innocence of love. The opening themes might not land in everyone's Itunes playlists, but if you hear it, even once, you would already be able to guess what the story is about.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the closing. This is a bit more interesting as the tone is not just cheerful, but it is to a certain extent, kawaii. This kawaii melody compliments the cheerful and playful attitude of the story and doesn't make you forget what you are currently watching.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the voice acting. BEAR IN MIND, I WATCHED THE ANIME IN JAPANESE AUDIO. The Japanese voice actors fit into their roles very well. In fact, the tones they had were appropriate to how their characters were portrayed in the series, so much so that you can easily tell apart who's voice belong to who even if the screen went black. Never in the series did the voice acting sound unusual, unnatural and forced. Not once. Kudos to the voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nHere's where I had a problem. The character development. In any Animation series, we want ALL the major characters to grow as a person and reveal who they are as a person naturally, without forcing it. This means, we would like to observe how a character behaves, not be told how they behave. The development of some characters were severely lacking, and it was obvious too. I know that in any Harem, it's hard to balance the screentime of every girl, however, if the series were to introduce a major and important character so late into the series, and not bother to develop that character, they might as well not introduce the character at all. What's the point of having such an important character be unnaturally forced to fit into a plot if it just clutters everything and ruins the character as a person?\\n\\n\r\nThis asymmetry of influence that each protagonist have resulted in unbalanced development. Often we had seen too much of one character and at the same time, we saw too little of another character. The relationships between the characters felt alien and illogical as a result. This made the love dispute unbelievable and sound corny.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite having some major setbacks in terms of character development, the concept of the story was already fundamentally strong, strong enough to support the interest of any watcher to continue watching till the end. It didn't necessarily become boring or repetitious at any point although it might have become quite confusing near the end. The presence of some fan service as well as drama is enough to draw the attention of any average anime fan, and the mystery was compulsive enough to make us stay curious throughout 75% of the whole series. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the Anime was good but could have been better. Worth a watch but not worth a rewatch.\\n\\n\r\nFake Love? Doesn't look Fake to me.",

            "content": "Nisekoi makes me question what it really is that separates a good anime, from a bad one. Objectively speaking, there are various criteria one uses to justify the aforementioned verdict; standard criteria such as Art, Story, and so on. However, Nisekoi is the perfect example of how it is possible to enjoy something that isn't really all that original, or amazing, or groundbreaking. Perhaps the best thing about Nisekoi is that it is just... enjoyable to watch, somehow. You could take a pen to paper and put down all of it's shortcomings, but this isn't a show that makes you want to do that.\r\nNow whyshould one watch Nisekoi? if you're looking for some lighthearted comedy with extremely cute girls, this should probably be first on your list. There's nothing spectacular about the plot, which actually starts off kind of interesting, but meanders around and goes nowhere really. It reverts back to the status quo which was set at episode 1 so frequently that if you're interested to see where this \"romance\" that's frequently advertised leads, you will be rather disappointed. However, that's not to say that this show isn't entertaining. And there are a few reasons why it is. \\n\\n\r\nEye-popping is what I'd call Nisekoi. I've always found Shaft to have a very unique and personalized approach towards making anime and Nisekoi doesn't receive any less effort in that regard. The art of this show is simply gorgeous whilst staying true to the source material by Naoshi Komi (which was great to begin with when compared to regular manga), and might I even go so far as to say that it enhances it. Scenes are drawn well, there is interesting camera work that goes on, and this show is just really colorful and easy on the eye. If you want evidence for the above, just watch Nisekoi's opening track \"CLICK\" by ClaRIS and you will know what I'm talking about. There's so much interesting art work going on in that OP itself that advertises this show's beautiful visuals. I'm frankly in love with that OP and I've never once skipped it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Nisekoi is also pretty darn good. I rarely go so far as to collect a show's soundtrack, but I enjoyed almost every track on this one's OST. Each girl has their own little theme song which reflects their personality rather well, and they're all very refreshing to hear.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, Nisekoi is very, very well done, and I can only wish that other far superior shows in terms of plot substance had received such treatment. As a viewer, you will enjoy what this show has to offer in this regard. However, be prepared to deal with the rather shallow, non-progressive plot in favor of everyday comedic interactions. Also, there's a decent amount of fanservice going on but nothing too overboard.\\n\\n\r\nWatch and enjoy Nisekoi for the cute girls, the art, and the music. Plot annoyances aside, and the fact that this is one of those harems where all the girls love the main character for little to no reason, I think Nisekoi is worth a shot if you're looking for lighthearted comedy once in a while. I'll give this a 7.5/10, rounded down to a 7.",

            "content": "So basically, my thoughts on the series should wait until I see season 2, but think of this as a checkpoint. But from what I've seen in season 1, it has a personable artstyle, the music is good, production quality is top notch. My main issue goes to everything that's wrong with cliche high school anime, in how the main character has a selection of girls to choose from, but ends up doing nothing in the end, oh goodie. BUT, what I do like is that you see the conflictions that Raku goes through, he likes Onodera, but over time starts to take aliking to Chitoge. That's something that's realistic and I could see that happening. I also didn't get the usual \"He's a total dumbass\" going through my head as often as other series (believe me though, he does do some pretty fucking stupid things). Even with that, his inability to take confidence in himself as well as read Chitoge's feelings bogs down Raku into my category of \"alright\" protagonists. Not unbearable, but not great either. I'd put him on the same level as Kodaka from season 2 of Haganai, where it's a slightly more fleshed out protagonist that doesn't quite escape the grips of average-ness. Onodera is pretty much the \"Oh I like Raku, but I'm too shy to confess my feelings\". Nothing much more than that. It's even more infuriating that Raku also likes her but he does nothing as well. Chitoge is essentially Kirino with no eroge playing. Like, that was the exact vibe I got from her. A more stark comparison would be Azusa from Henneko. Still, that makes Chitoge one of the more interesting characters in the show, and thank Sonic 3(my version of God) the series is aware of that because she gets the most screen time out of every girl. Marika sort of shows up near the end, you expect something to happen with her, but nothing does, I guess until season 2. She brings along with her a major rift in the plot, but nothing was ever done with it here. The supporting cast is also generic. Perverted best friend, short girl with glasses that shows little emotion, etc. The comedy is also alright. What Nisekoi does well is create a great setup, and the way things play out is generic, but it's not offensive. It was a decent watch, but probably something that's not going to stick with me after finishing the series. I'd recommend giving it a watch if you're bored and want one of the better high school animes.",

            "content": "(This review contains spoilers - read at your own risk)\r\nOh where to start with Nisekoi? This anime was all over the place from the very start but it definitely became worse towards the end. It wasn't all bad though, so keep your mind open.\r\nThe storyline was non-existent, at best. There was little effort put into actually making it believable and worthy of anyone's time, and it definitely showed. So two students are \"forced\" to pretend to be boyfriend and girlfriend in order for their mob families to get along. That was such a cheap trick to create romance I could barely swallow it. But thatwas ok, it was just a fluke in the storyline and I was expecting everything else to be charming enough for me to ignore it. \\n\\n\r\nI was wrong. The characters were more or less charming... At first. They were likeable and cute and funny but it got old fast. It actually got very annoying for some of them. The typical love triangle: tsundere girl, shy girl, oh which one should the main guy choose? \\n\\n\r\nIn no moment was I given any reason for Ichijo to care for any of them. Sure, they were pretty and \"kawaii\" but that was about it. Rarely was I given any glimpses of personality, and when those were presented, they made no sense at all or seemed thought up on the spot to make them more human. Of course, I didn't get what either of them saw in him, either. Soon enough more girls come forward about their feelings for him, which is just insane, and the whole thing becomes your typical harem where everyone is confused and unaware of everyone else's feelings - except they make a lot of (wrong and kind of forced) assumptions and you, the viewer, become paralyzed by the amount of mindfuck.\\n\\n\r\nOnodera was the most annoying of them - she was so bland, ditzy and impossibly sweet. She never took initiative, never challenged herself, and when she did, she stepped back right away, afraid of the consequences. I really wanted to have a soft spot for her since she was so kind and considerate... But I never did. She did earn some compassion, but nothing else. She was basically on the way for me, so I could care less about her presence most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nChitoge was the opposite. A complete mess. She was definitely modelled after the tsundered clich\u00e9, although a bit overdone in my opinion. I could never understand why she hit Ichijo instead of whom she was supposed to hit. Sometimes, it was not his fault! And he always took it well, which after the fifth or sixth time, would have been hard to imagine. She just needed some balance,  which I think she got at the end, although I wasn't too convinced. Out of all the characters, she was the one who at least seemed to grow a little, and was actually likeable. Her dilemmas and inner conflicts were somewhat real to me, and they hit home. So maybe that was why.\\n\\n\r\nIchijo... He was a very hard case for me. In one hand, I despised him since he could not make up his mind. In one moment, he liked one girl and on the other he was already fantasizing about the other one... From the beginning, it felt like he was two-timing even though his relationship with Chitoge was just a sham. But he should at least have honored his deals! Then, on the other hand, he was caring and a good friend and worried about everyone else. \\n\r\nStill, he could have been a good character given the right amount of development. If only he didn't act like an immature brat whose only thoughts are about ditzy girls, I would have liked him more. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters were mostly forgettable. Shu was fine and he made me giggle with his antics, but other than that, nothing too interesting. I did like his voice actor, though, I thought it gave him a nice personality. Tachibana was very, very annoying (even more so than Onodera, if that's even possible) and I couldn't wait to see her gone from the whole series. Tsugumi was ok, I guess, considering everything.\\n\\n\r\nI could never complain much about the art, although the animation team could have been a bit less lazy with their recycling and less enthusiastic with their sparkling and kawaii layouts. Sometimes the characters would get a big shot of themselves in very sexy/moe positions and animations for no reason at all. It was like Sailor Moon's transformations all over again. Other than that, everything was great. The voice actors really made it come to life, despite all the flaws, and converted me to a certain point. \\n\\n\r\nNisekoi would have never been a brilliant anime but it could have been so much better. I mean, one could have made it seem like some thought had actually been put into its creation, but alas, it was not. Everything seemed rushed and predictable.There was room for a lot more to be done or at the very least, polished. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it immensely in the first few episodes, then got extremely annoyed, then bored, then towards the end liked it a bit more. But when it ended, I felt no spark. No accomplishment. No climax. It was just \"that's it?\" for me. I expected it to at least have some sort of closure, but no. We got no resolve at all. I understand that it only comprises the first 50 chapters of the manga, and there's a lot more to read after that. But unless there's a follow-up to this, I see no real point in watching it unless you're a very visual person and enjoy Nisekoi. Otherwise, just stick to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSo the rating I'm giving this anime is not great. However, it was cute enough to make me smile a bit, so I'll cut it some slack. The last episode was especially amusing. But unless you're willing to go through 20 episodes, most of the time not really knowing what's going on, rooting for things to happen and in the end not being sure of your feelings anymore, then give it a try. It's very japanese in the sense that it revolves around young love and doubts and all those tragedic teen aspirations. It's not deep at all, and will have you shaking your head way too often, but it's not the worst thing on earth if you have some free time.\\n\\n\r\nNeeded more episodes to satisfy me, but overall it was ok for the genre. Anyone into harem, comedy and romance should give it a try and judge for themselves.",

The last what 3/4 episodes gave me cancer. And I'm on SS Marika and SS Kosaki.\r\nLet me rant a bit before I go into the review proper, because I need to get this out the way. In all honesty the manga was way better. I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a ton of time and a ton of patience.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story is unoriginal (obviously) but with the characters having way out-of-this-world backgrounds. Which makes it interesting, for like 5 chapters,then you realise it doesn't make that much a difference. Since the anime follows the manga closely in terms of plot you don't actually get any plot progression besides a larger harem because that's essentially what happens in the duration of the first season: more grils with different character tropes to suit pretty much every type of girl you could be into (except lolis). Nisekoi or plot, choose one.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nThe animation/artwork is very SHAFT-ish, which means its 80% fine, with 20% being seemingly awkward looking characters, and a ton of head tilts. I didn't like how the lock was 3D (felt like it to me at least) but everything else wasn't and it distracted me a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nEeeeeeh sound was normal I guess. Kosaki's and Marika's VAs were HNNNGGGGG.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nOh damn. I'm trying to not be as much as an anti ship girl as possible but holy crap Chitoge properly made me cringe. Her character was half the time okay and the other half annoyed me. I almost couldn't stand watching episodes with her, but I pushed through. And I regret all the time I wasted. Kosaki on the other hand is the queen of cockblocks. Very very very cute and adorable character but literally she doesn't get anything done plot wise. BUT HER SMILE DOEEE SO INNOCENT AND PURE. Tsugumi felt like a less annoying tsundere. And finally Marika. Single handedly carrying the plot progression. Ruri and Shuu were great supporting characters though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI didn't really like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nRead the manga, watch the OVAs if you wanna hear your favorite girl with sound",

            "content": "It was all the hype back then. The Jump romance series is getting an anime! By SHAFT nonetheless!\r\nWith people jumping right and left, did it live up to its hype?\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nThe story revolves around Ichijou Raku. The heir to some kind of Yakuza family. One day, on his way to school, he was kneed-to-the-face by a transfer student Kirisaki Chitoge, who later is revealed to be a gangster family's daughter. After a few things happened, he and Chitoge must fake being lovers to stop a turf war.\r\nAnd the other side of the plot involves Raku's promise with a girl from his childhood, a pendant,and a few keys.\\n\\n\r\nSo it's a usual \"two-people-must-fake-being-something-they're-not\" kind of story. It appears to be pretty boring at first, but there's something about it that comes out as... refreshing somehow.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why, it's just... maybe it has something to do with the art style, but the way that the story is told is just so... I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the ever-dragging manga, since the anime is just parts of it, the pacing felt like a normal Romance Comedy series.\\n\\n\r\nWith the usual stuff. You know, hot springs, homestay, beach, and others.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Nisekoi is the anime with the most monologue I've ever watched. like, seriously.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of Nisekoi is somewhat colorful. Like really, most of the color for the backgrounds consists of patterns. Only the characters look normal to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nThat's what gives this anime the feeling of fluffiness. The cuteness goddamnit.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic-wise, Nisekoi is on the average side. The music is mostly soft and light, befitting of the series' personality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, Nisekoi's characters are nothing too unique or new. They all have their archetype. But they live up to it wonderfully, with just enough knicks and knacks to make themselves different.\\n\\n\r\nRaku is a Harem protagonist. Therefore, he will be nice and caring. He's a bit clueless, but not that much. He also  have something that most protagonists lack, self-awareness! Even if just a bit.\\n\\n\r\nChitoge is the main heroine. So she takes the Tsundere card. What's a bit different about her is that as the series progresses, she's mostly Dere and less Tsun. Meaning, she's more in-touch with her feelings than most Tsunderes\\n\\n\r\nOnodera is the generally shy one. She doesn't have much backstory or anything, but she's my personal favorite. SO MUCH GODDAMN KAWAII!!!\\n\\n\r\nTsugumi, by herself is quite the Tsundere, actually. She appears to be a guy at first, but as we all know, if there's a new guy in a harem, it's most likely a trap. As such, she's the reverse-trap.\\n\\n\r\nMarika, is actually quite interesting. You would think that she's the princess, but after a few events, her character is quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if you're wondering who's the childhood friend character is, fear not! For everyone is basically a childhood friend in a sense.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, Nisekoi characters are quite dry, but they still have some juice to make it more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi isn't terribly deep, and it's not pretending to be deep. It's a light-hearted show that focuses mostly on the character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a fluffy Romance Comedy series with an open-ended finale, this might just be perfect for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a deep series with a real plot progression, you might have to look elsewhere.",

In too many harem anime, the MC is portrayed as some Jesus figure who is good at everything and is the main obsession of the girls in the show. However, Nisekoi does something special by having the girls be the main characters, and the guy a reflection of what they value in a person. Even though it is kinda uncomfortable to have all these attractive girls like one guy, it never becomes creepy because the reason they like him is not becausehe is good at everything, rather it's because of their specific characterizations. Each girl likes him for separate reasons, due to the fact that all of them approach their relationship differently, but the reasons are consistent enough with a single personality that it never feels as though their view of him is disjointed. \\n\\n\r\n(This is for the manga, Definitely read it.) \\n\r\nI also really enjoy how they chose the final girl that the guy wanted to be with, as it paints a complex portrayal of what love actually is, namely not something that is felt but something that one deliberately chooses so that their partner can be happy. However, I am not giving this anime a 10 simply because it didn't make me as emotional as other shows that I have watched.",

And I don't say liberty with a compliment, more like indulging. \r\nColorful art with good looking characters, with a really forced plot to make the two main characters stuck with each other, and a very predictable development of how their fake love relationship would turnout in the end. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite that, you could still enjoy the ride with with the nice art and sound and voice acting. In particular, I really like Onodera's voice, it is very feminine yet mature, and it really fits the character so well, but the voice standalone is sooo nice, I can't help myself to listen to it again. She is personally my favorite heroine, her gentleness contrasts from the other heroines; one who is hot tempered and flashy character design, and the other girl who is all over the main for no good reason. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a good anime for you to just turn off your brain and just enjoy some aesthetics. Nothing that original, just taking cliche elements and abusing them to a huger degree that you might find yourself face palming several times.",

            "content": "This is my first review ever, so please bear with me. \r\nIt's been so long since I last watched a harem anime that genuinely pulled at my heartstrings that I am compelled to write a review for Nisekoi. If you're looking for lighthearted romance with quirky characters, then this is the show to watch. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story of Nisekoi is nothing particularly special. It's just your typical harem fare with four beautiful girls vying for the attention of a hopelessly dense guy. However, I do appreciate the fact that there is some self-depricating humor thrown into the mix to break the monotony of all ofthe anime cliches. The comedy is one of the show's strongest features and pulls it from the depths of mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThere are very stunning visuals in Nisekoi and all of the details really came together to make every scene appealing to the eyes. There were a few places where Shaft's quirky style of animation and color did detract from the overall mood, but for the most part the art was well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nTo be entirely honest, I don't really pay attention to the soundtracks of anime unless there's something that really stands out. I do have to say that the opening and ending themes were pretty great though, and Nisekoi has A LOT of ending themes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were really the best part about this anime. I has my misgivings about them at first since harem characters tend to be very one-dimensional but the characters in Nisekoi felt very real, or at least as real as harem characters can get. Despite the fact that they all fall into typical harem character archetypes (the clueless guy, the tsundere, the nice classmate, the tomboy, the childhood friend... the list goes on), they still have unique characteristics that set them apart from the pack. The side characters also definitely helped to add comedy to the entire show, and I felt that at times the side characters were just as important as the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nDefinitely an enjoyable show if you don't mind romcoms.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nAll in all, Nisekoi is a pretty fun romcom harem anime, with genuine characters and a somewhat interesting (and exceedingly ridiculous) premise. The drama isn't overbearing, the comedy is never too over-the-top, and the romance is twinged with the perfect mix of bittersweet memories and the blossoms of newfound love. There is truly never a dull moment in this anime.",

The chemistry between the characters is notable, and the benign (and not so benign) machinations of the deadly duo, Shuu and Ruri, are guaranteed to make you laugh. This must be the first anime for which I've liked the supporting characters significantly more than the main. This is not to say that the main characters aren't likeable, for they surely are, but the side characters - in particular Shuu and Ruri - are simply hilarious.\r\nOn the romance front, there is an overarching plotline about the past of the MC that hasn't yet beenresolved at episode 16 (of 20). It would not be wholly inaccurate to call this a harem anime, but as of episode 16 it looks like there will be a single-girl ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharming characters, a multitude of laugh-out-loud moments, great art, and the unique animation/direction style of the Shaft team (which made me erroneously think this was a poor Bakemonogatari rip-off in the first episode) make this a must-watch show in my book for anyone who enjoys a zany slice of life romantic comedy. The first episode isn't that strong though, and I would recommend you give this two or three episodes to grow on you before you decide whether or not to keep watching.",

If you're like me and love harem, this will definitely end up on your favorite anime of all time.  \r\nStory: I don't usually like anime where people pretend to be lovers, but Nisekoi is the exception to the rule. Especially when the girl is a tsundere! The other characters like Onodera and Tachibana really add to the story and make the \"slice of life\" enjoyable to watch and very entertaining.\r\n8/10\r\nArt: The art style of this anime is something you just fall inlove with. The character's movements and how the art conveys emotion are definitely what I look for in all anime. And of course the overall looks.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack really suits the situations in this anime, which is a defining factor in whether many romance anime are good or not. Voice acting in this anime also really suits the characters. The lively characters in animation have a lively voice etc.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As I stated before I love tsundere. Chitoge Kirisaki is one of my favorite characters in this anime. The other characters like Raku and his harem also have great personalities. They are all unique and there is definitely controversy over who is \"best girl.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall I really liked this anime and had a great time watching it. I can't wait for season two and am up to date with the manga. But until the GO TEAM CHITOGE.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10",

            "content": "\"So much UGH with this\" \r\nUsual complaints about the harem genre are understandable. Add a dozen other genres, add one guy with no personality, add a bunch of sexy girls, and make a love triangle with the two top gals duking it out (With a clear winner on some occasions). Sometimes this formula becomes ether fun, or a little frustrating. Nisekoi is nether....... Nisekoi is actually BEYOND frustration. It dives too much into torture territory. And here's why....... \r\nIt all starts beautifully enough. Vivid colors, and crisp animation. The characters have really funny facial expressions during some episodes. Everybody is having fun. Everything is lollipops,and gumdrops. And then....the nightmare begins. It goes crashing head first into some filler, then into more filler, and then finally half asses everything right into a cliffhanger. The plot gets tossed away immediately in this show (During the middle), and it does not coming back. Usually a show would have filler, however a show would go back to its original story after going through the evolution (Or dozens of panty shots) of its characters. Not Nisekoi though. It literally tosses the point right out the window. That is the huge problem that just will not leave. And it is the reason over how Nisekoi is frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it keeps adding more girls, and romance pointlessly. One episode it is a love triangle, then another it is a love square. Then eventually it turns into a love pentagon, and then yes..... they will add another girl during season two! So it will be a freaking love hexagon! Even the added unique quirks get forgotten. The show explains that the families of the two main characters are actually mobsters. And yet that added seasoning to make this a unique anime gets barely used, and then tossed away later on. What is the point of even explaining who their families are? They are only around for one purpose (\"These two better get married, or throats will get slashed!\"). And where are the drug deals? And the hookers?....... A mob life can't be about sipping tea, and fapping to hentai at home while the kids are away at school. \\n\\n\r\nMore annoyances appear in Nisekoi. The characters give out model-esc poses/looks. They always wonder \"why\" for no reason. \"Why am I in love?\", \"Why did she say that?\", \"Why did this person breathe?!?!\", etc. And the *big* praised treasure trove of funny facial expressions eventually runs out, and the show sticks with the same spit takes (And the same animation of heads of the characters being bouncing around in bubble form with a single color background) as the main source for comedy. There are tiny fragments of ecchi elements. And sadly those fragments are not memorable at all.\\n\\n\r\nWith the ax being put away after grinding, and before the metaphorical chopping off of the head. There are a few good things about Nisekoi that have to be praised. The girls are charming, and they each have their own personality. This show is fantastic through out the beginning. And music in this show is always ever changing, but really sweet to hear. Comedy during the finale is fantastic. The final moments do not exactly make it worth while, there is a cliffhanger as mentioned once before in this review, however it at least ends with a pretty funny big bang. \\n\\n\r\nOn a personal note: This show is a complete massive waste of time. If you want to watch this show. Then ether watch the first 8-10 episodes, skip everything between 10-19, then watch the last one, and call it a day. Or wait a few dozen years when this show ends, and then marathon everything in a week. Or watch this show, and don't follow the plot at all during the whole twenty episodes. Or read the entire manga series instead, because from what I hear you can actually get a chance to know how it will all end. Sorry for being complicated, Im just giving out good game plans here. I was disappointed with the mafia aspect not being used. That was the main reason why I bothered to tune in. It would have been fun seeing that aspect being used more, since it could have been a far more interesting story. There are OVA's you say? Well, then.....those are a bunch of middle fingers in the a**hole as well. I would have given this show a higher score. I just could not, because it is not the type of show that is re-watchable. The animation, the comedy, the designs, and the music. They are all good. It is just that if there was some follow through with the plot. Then I would have at least bumped it up 2 points. I mean even really terrible nonsensical anime shows would try to go back to its main purpose, and finish. Nisekoi just loves dangling treats in front of your face, until you accidentally trip, and slam into a wall. I might give the manga a shot one day. As for this show, I rather forget about it. Believe me. There are fun times to be had here, but if you are going to assume that it's all about the story. You will be frustrated. And if you have your theories ready to be answered, then get ready to toss everything away in the trash. \\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, it won't be a fun time.",

            "content": "Neko here! Another review from me, filled with very much personal point of view opinion. Let's try to be subjective with this one, why? I mean, it's Nisekoi, where you weekly dosage of cuteness served.\r\nI'm not really into talking about studio or director. But this one is quite SHAFT-ed. Does anyone here remember Zetsubou Sensei, Madoka Magica, EF series, and Denpa Onna plus Monogatari series? It's all about metric figures in your background, much flash-based animation, vector image flying, something like that. (with due all respect, I'm sorry. I'm not mentioning that was bad. I'm a design student who studies those form too. But, ifyou are the kind of people who hate things like those filling the background, please restrain from blame everything to the anime. For our own good.)\\n\\n\r\nThe story tells about Ichijou Raku, a son of a yakuza gang boss. He was arranged into some kind of 'dating' condition by his father to his arch-enemy gang leader's daughter. That condition was made because they want to stop their gang member bloodshed. Sounds like Romeo & Juliet? Sounds very deep? Not really.\\n\\n\r\nThis is your typical harem situation, but quite safe for work, yet very much cute girl intensifies. Yes, very cute. Reallyyyyy cute.\\n\\n\r\nDid I said \"cute\" three times before? Oh, no kidding, I'm serious, it's very much really cute. Make it five.\\n\\n\r\nKirisaki Chitoge, with her Tsundere trait makes Raku more confused about who he's falling in love with. Onodera Kosaki, with her naturally cute attitude, especially when she's shy around Raku. Seishirou Tsugumi, a male with cute gap moe and also hidden BIG secret await to be revealed. And after few episode you can see Tachibana Marika with her loyalty to somebody she loves. Every girl here has their own good point, and it makes them really cute.\\n\\n\r\nLooking for Moe? Cuteness? Romantic Teenager Comedy? Lucky bastard who surrounded by many cute girls? Yes this is anime for you. HAREM BANZAI!\\n\\n\r\nVanilla tasted harem. That's what on my mind about this anime, maybe only for now. Later? Dunno, ask the comic artist.\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to rate down here, yes, around down there.",

            "content": "\"I want to eat octopus balls.\"\r\n-Chitoge Kirisaki, Episode 17\r\nMy god, this show is cringe-worthy. First of, all of the main characters (except Raku) are fucking tsundere. Second, all of them except for Marika are always too shy to say what's on their mind, leading to the same scenario happening over and over and over and over and over again. And when they finally work up the courage, they're interrupted in one way or another. Over and over and over and over again. This gets sickening.\r\nThese characters are some of the most dense fucks I've ever seen, especially Raku (which reminds me of Ragu). It onlytakes him 19 episodes to finally identify what someone else is thinking. Only 19. He is a very painful protagonist..\\n\\n\r\nThe threats of Claude and Marika were interesting concepts that I was very upset to see forgotten an episode later with just a rare mention of them later.\\n\\n\r\nI personally am not a fan of harems as they often leave me yelling \"Come on! Don't be so fucking stupid, pick someone and get on with your life\". While this show was not as bad as I expected it to be, I still managed to lose my voice after yelling profanities every time someone did something unbelievably stupid..\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character was Tsugumi, only because her naiveness and shyness was justified. However, I loathe Onodera, seeing as she had PLENTY of opportunities to make some moves, yet most of the time decided not to.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it just felt like everyone was stalling. A war of attrition. I hope the second season isn't this miserable..",

            "content": "Nisekoi is like playing a game of League of Legends.  You don't know why you enjoy it.  It's super addicting and although it isn't the best anime around, you enjoy it way too much.  Nisekoi should be garbage.  I shouldn't like a rom com harem, but it just is.  It definitely is hard to describe.  What makes Nisekoi work so well?  We'll find out in this terrible review.\r\nPresentation (Art, Sound):\r\nShaft does well with its presentation in general.  The art is very colourful with beautiful character designs and just Shaft backgrounds.  Without previous exposure to Shaft works(man that sounds dirty af LMAO), the backdrops will probably not feel as nostalgic and memorable than someone who has watched for example: the Monogatari series.\\n\\n\r\nSound is pretty good.  The openings are alright from what I have heard, but I didn't really pay attention to any of the EDs.  Soundtrack is standard slice of life with one certain good theme that occurs repeatedly a few times.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThe story is pretty generic.  I can't tell if Nisekoi is based around Romeo and Juliet because the stories are pretty similar.  It's decent I guess.  The plot is what you would expect from any romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe girls are what carry this show.  Almost every girl in the MC's harem is best girl material.  (Chitoge best girl, Marika worst sorry).  Raku himself is kinda bland, but his seiyuu does a good job of making his reactions funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI don't think I've ever joined a rom com so much.  In Nisekoi, so little happens, but I still loved it!  Whenever there was a cute blush by Chitoge, I was like DAMN, nosebleed starts.  The banter and conversations are done very well.  The comedy is freaking TOP NOTCH.  I was laughing super hard at many moments.  Sure, some situations are cliche and full of tropes, but to me, they didn't get too bland and generic.  There is also so much frustration while watching this anime.  The awkwardness and hesitation in this anime boggles my mindShaft had their over the top visuals to completely persuade me to love Nisekoi.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nNisekoi is a generic rom com harem that CAN come off as likable due to its intensely beautiful art and fun characters.  If you don't mind any plot progression and just want an anime with a ton of comedy and cute beginnings of romance, Nisekoi will be perfect for you!  Also it's great to just  insert yourself into Raku's place and think about how epic your life would be with a beautiful harem like his.  Have fun picking your best girl! :D",

            "content": "Nisekoi is a very interesting anime, I thought it was going to be average at best but instead I was hooked immediately and ended up really enjoying the show.\r\nStory:\r\nNisekoi follows Raku, the heir to a Yakuza clan who just wants to live a normal life. Raku along with his classmates have to deal with regular highschool life, but for Raku and the female lead, Chitoge, there is more than meets the eye. Chitoge's father is the leader of a rival gang and to prevent a gang war Raku and Chitoge are forced to pretend to be lovers. Of course all would be alright, if theydidn't hate each other and if Raku wasn't in love with someone else. The main focus, along with Chitoge and Raku's fake relationship is Raku's quest to find the girl he made a promise to ten years prior. This all unfolds nicely and catches the viewer's attention early on. My main problems are that the pacing is off at times, the plot twists complicate the romance, and the romance develops very slowly. These are the biggest detractors to an otherwise great and interesting story.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's SHAFT, so the style is colorful and abstract. The characters are all well designed and the environments and backgrounds look amazing. I can't think of anything I don't like about the art of this show.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is really well done, the voice actors fit the characters really well, especially Chitoge and Onodera's VAs. The music is great as well, except the opening songs which are average at best. Overall I do really love the sound.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNisekoi is primarily a romance, and thus it needs good characters or it will fail. Nisekoi has very good characters. Every character has a good personality and develops well (for the most part) over the course of the show. Chitoge develops well and the ending is incredibly heartwarming and develops the relationship between Chitoge and Raku well. It does so for Raku and Onodera also. Shu and Ruri do not develop well, but they're side characters so it doesn't matter as much as the main characters. One gripe is that the characters are just so inept at confessing love, they just don't do it, and when they try the confession is interrupted.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNisekoi really surprised me, the story was deeper than I expected and I could not stop watching once I started.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI recommend Nisekoi wholeheartedly, just make note that the romance may not go in your favor and you could finish the series feeling empty, but thats what season 2 is for.\\n\r\n8.4/10",

            "content": "Here's my advice. If you like romance, comedy, slice of life, animes that take forever to finish but have good animation, sound and characters, then this anime is for you.\r\nMy Review:\r\nI have to say that Nisekoi isn't really one when it comes to bringing something new to the table, considering the plot is something that has been done already (*Cough... Love Hina) but for some reason, this anime / manga series really brings, something interesting to the table, something that wasn't done in Love Hina or other animes / mangas that had a similar plot.\r\nFirst off. Nisekoi's animation is quite interesting for me. It hasall of these bright and vibrant colors along with a very slight fade to it. Especially those scenes when Raku and Onodera have a \"moment\" . Those scenes look the best to me, I don't why. Along with the drawing style of the characters just seem to work so well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is okay. Its really nothing but mediocre material that all of us have seen before, but I like it so far so I don't really care.\\n\\n\r\nI would have to say that the characters are the highlight of this anime in my opinion. First theres Raku, obviously the guy that every single teen girl in this series is in love with. Some took slower to realize their lover for him (*cough Tsugumi / Haru) then you got that classic perverted and annoying best friend of the main character that gets the shit kicked out of him everyday by a tsundre for just being there or being perverted. Then we got supporting characters like Raku's and chitoges dads where, if they weren't in the anime / manga, the plot wouldn't have happened. \\n\\n\r\nWith a nothing but mediocre plot, average but fun characters, and with all of us doubtfully waiting for a season 3, I have to award this overall anime with an 8. Only cause I had a lot of fun watching / reading both the anime and the manga, and only cause the story could've been a little different and a little more original.",

The MC made a promise to her that she will see his schlong and get kids and yadayadayada. \r\nHim clearly being demented at such a young age, doesn't remember this and never in the show contacts a physician.

            "content": "Nisekoi was an anime that I made fun of with my friends for the longest time. I personally think harems are just hilarious because of the fact that the MC is absolutely clueless and the girls all fight over one guy BUT I personally do in fact enjoy harems. Maybe I'm a bit biased because I enjoy harems but Nisekoi was very enjoyable for me. I have not read the manga yet so purely just basing my review on the anime I give it a 9/10. At first I was very surprised that the studio that made this was Shaft. I thought that Nisekoi wouldhave some weird visuals and wasn't really sure if Shaft could pull it off but wow, I'll never doubt Shaft again. Their art and animation is all top notch and it really made me enjoy Nisekoi.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10:\\n\r\nStory is unique but nothing really compelling. The main MC apparently makes a promise to a girl 10 years ago that if they were to meet again they would marry but he doesn't know who he gave it to and that's basically the premise of the story. Every girl has some sort of connection to the past and the audience is trying to determine who the girl is. Overall, this story is honestly perfect for a harem, it helps introduce different characters without making it seem TOO forceful. Of course there are instances where a girl just appears out of nowhere but it's far better than other harems that I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\nI'll say it again, Shaft makes pretty good art. Actually scratch that,they are insane with their art. All the characters look brilliant, they're very detailed and you can totally tell all of them apart. The backgrounds are amazing. I know Shaft is known for some weird backgrounds but everything fits so perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nTo be honest, I dont really know much to write about sound in a review besides the fact that I really like the OP and there are A LOT of EDS. I really enjoyed all of them and also the voice actors fit perfectly with the characters so yeah 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\r\nLike any romantic anime, the characters are the most important part of the story. I'm not particularly fond with the main MC as he's the typical harem MC who is clueless about everything and does not say what he wants to say but he isn't the worst. The girls are awesome tho. Chitoge is the typical harem but she's really adorable! She's my favorite girl because she actually feels real. She gets jealous, she gets mad, she gets irritated and she just shows normal human reactions. \\n\r\nOnodera is also one of my favorite heroines in this anime. She's absolutely a precious angel that isn't about revenge and just wants best for other people. You know, I'm sick and tired of romantic rivalries between girls but Nisekoi doesn't do that. This anime allows the MC to be able to choose through experience rather than the girls fighting till the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm sad that I misjudged Nisekoi. I thought it would be garbage but no, it was actually pretty enjoyable. The characters were all pretty cool and Shaft did a great job with it. Honestly if it were not for Shaft I would've probably gave this an 8.",

            "content": "How to make a love story getting more and more complicated? Nisekoi\r\nFor a head start, I never read its manga so I will not be comparing the anime and its manga. This review should be based on the anime itself only.\r\nStory: 6\r\nWell, the story itself isn't original but not too bad. We have our male protagonist (Raku) having a promise with his childhood friend (an unknown girl). 10 years later as a teenager, he had forgotten how she looked like and the only thing he knew is the girl has a key which can unlock the pendant given. The story goes on with Raku tryingto find clues about this promised girl, while being swarmed with a lot of problems.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nIf you know Shaft you should expect better quality in art and animation. I will not be writing too much in this section.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nOPs (both sung by ClariS, the \"old\" one) and EDs (sung by VA themselves) are nice so just go ahead and grab them. I personally don't pay too much attention on the OST since they are pretty common in romcom series (and hence easily forgotten).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\n#TeamOnodera or #TeamChitoge?\\n\\n\r\nRaku is the typical dense male protagonist who is always caring to his friends. Kosaki (or Onodera) is the typical nice and very shy girl and Chitoge (or Kirisaki) is the typical bossy girl with some good (yet hidden) personalities. While it seems like Onodera has the upper hand in terms of (almost) everything, Chitoge improves a lot throughout the series and is able to compete with Onodera to win Raku's heart.\\n\\n\r\nNot going to tell you who will win, of course :P\\n\\n\r\nRegarding side characters, Tsugumi and Marika are pretty much redundant in this series to be honest. Maiko (Raku's friend) and Ruri (Kosaki's friend) are the supportive duo who always try to find chances to get Raku and Kosaki together.\\n\\n\r\nPS: I haven't sided towards any \"teams\" since I have yet to finish Nisekoi season 2. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoy the series in terms of harem and comedy, but as a romance series I just don't feel like there is \"enough\" romance here. Most of the romantic scenes end up with issues e.g. someone is going to confess after hiding his/her feelings for a long time but suddenly \"something\" happens and interrupts the confession (derp). \\n\\n\r\nThis is probably how the manga plot goes so the issue is with the plot itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the series is enjoyable (albeit with a few fan service scenes). I will give a score of 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~\\n\\n\r\nThis is NOT relevant or important but is still bugging me: Why did the community name #TeamOnodera and #TeamChitoge instead of standardising their first/last names? (i.e Kosaki/Chitoge or Onodera/Kirisaki) :|",

Very engaging and makes your heart beat every second! It could of been a 10 though I didnt find the ending very satisfying as said about the \"story\" !

            "content": "This anime has a GREAT kick off, right from the beginning, but it's really sad that they have to ruin it with the consistency. The main story is suppose to be Raku Ichijou finding the love of his life: the girl he made a promise to ten years ago and sealed with a pendant and a key. The problem is that he is stuck in a situation where he must pretend to be the fake lover of Chitoge Kirisaki, who he does not like, for the sake of his and her family.\r\nThe first half of the anime is really good. The beginning, especially, is amazing.The plot is focused, very interesting, and I laughed a whole bunch. I really enjoyed it. However, after awhile, the anime became very unfocused and it started to feel like I was being dragged. It wasn't as funny anymore, the art got lazy, and the main story was lost. The idea of finding his \"mystery girl\" was completely forgotten. Also, his affections for Kosaki Onodera is also inconsistent and frustrating. Their relationship NEVER develops, although I do understand that they keep it \"neutral\" to keep his relationship with the other girls balanced. But if they're trying to keep a \"balance\", they completely failed at that part as well. There is too much screen time with Chitoge and too little with the other three girls. I get that Chitoge is the main female character, but if she is, they could have at least made her a bit less annoying. A successful anime TO ME would have wonderful, complex main characters who I grow to love. But honestly, I like Kosaki and Marika a lot more than Chitoge. It is kind of depressing to have an anime where I don't even root for the \"main couple\".\\n\r\nThe ending is funny and enjoyable, but not satisfying. We don't find out who he ends up with nor does it seem like he cares anymore. The pendant got broken and that's the last we heard of it.\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi is very inconsistent and at times, frustrating. Great artwork, but became lazy and sloppy. Unsatisfying ending. Although I am pretty disappointed with it, Nisekoi is still a funny and enjoyable anime. In my opinion, the beginning deserves a 9/10, first half deserves an 8/10, the rest would probably be a 6/10. Average for me is a 7/10.",

            "content": "oof this is my first review so please go easy on me. \r\nSo nisekoi really means a lot to me, it was one of my first harem anime's and definitely wont be my last. From Raku to ondodere to chitoge this anime just wont get out of my head!\r\nArt-10\r\nNot going to lie, watching this anime on my crappy phone in 2015, being shocked by how pretty anime looked, was a pretty good felling. Charters look expressive the animation most of the time is well shot with some actually impressive shots for anime. The charter models look great and honestly are unforgettable. Art is subjective sotheirs probably someone out their who hates this style. (Also this is my favorite style so you know collise)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY-10000\\n\r\nHoly shit for a fucking harem anime this anime's story is lit (no spoilers's) but omg i was blown away by the twist and turns (especially by the 2nd season) Obviously you know what kinda the plot is by know but omg, the premise which seems generic and haremy on paper, is executed so well. Even though in the end my best girl didnt win in the end (in the manga at least) i was still Rooting for all the girls in my heart.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\ni mean what is there to say? its good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nA charters a anime's bread and butter(especially a harem) and damn are these charters amazing. Onodera, chitoge, Raku, marry, all these charters and in my head vividly and i watched this anime 3 years ago. Even though my best girl wasn't chosen all the charters were so likable that i was rooting everyone on unlike a lot of harem anime where i only like one girl exclusively. (onodera for life fam)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\\n\r\nthis anime is pretty good most of the time, but damn is the filler bad. (like really bad) and charters can take FUCKING Forever to bond. Some times i would scream at the charters to fucking fuck already\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10 \\n\\n\r\nIn one word this anime/manga is a experience, and if i had to describe it in one word Unforgettable. thanks and out harem fam \\n\\n\r\nyours truly -the harem king \\n\\n",

            "content": "Nisekoi can be seen as another generic harem romance show, or it could add to the genre, making it shine through the malignant mass of harems.\r\n Personally, it didn't do it for me. A sheer lack of story and generic characters makes it another square harem show, adding no sustenance to the already trash genre. What brings the score up is the overall animation and sound, which is expected coming from the same studio that animated the Monogatari series.\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nSometimes you look at the genres of an anime before watching, and you see various tags, such as slice of life, comedy, romance, harem, etc.What do you think? You haven't read the synopsis, and only saw the cover art for the series. You may think, \"wow, this sounds like another generic series,\" or something along those lines. For Nisekoi, you would be right.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the overall premise of the show is something I'm not too accustomed with, as I haven't seen too many series with the yakuza or gangs being involved, especially in a harem anime, so I guess you could say it was a breath of fresh air for me. But that was the only redeeming thing the series could muster up. It only played as a driving force for any sort of conflict during the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, this series is animated by Shaft. That being said, there of course is going to be givens, like the amount of head tilts in a given episode. All seriousness, they did a wonderful job animating dialogue, and kept a more dialogue heavy episode interesting, similar to what they did in the Monogatari series. The only thing that really irked me regarding the art-style is that every girl in the harem has the same exact facial structure and smile, only differentiating from from hair color/style and eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNo character in this series had a voice that didn't sound like it matched them. With that, the soundtrack for the show was also good, matching the mood of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nFor the OP and ED though, I cannot say anything about, as I ended up watching the open-less and credit-less mode of the show, somehow.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, this show also lacks, comparatively to the story. The same fault lies in the characters, as we have our generic tsundere (two really), perverted male friend of the MC, and square \"good girl\" that of course the MC has a crush on. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall - 8/10 & 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story and characters were very lackluster, the series somehow kept me entertained and even a little captivated with it. I didn't have issues in wanting to take breaks in between chunks of episodes, and I wanted to know what happens next, from the beginning to the end of the season. This plus Shaft-y animation and decent soundtrack and voices, I feel this series would deserve its score.\\n\\n",

            "content": "ADDITIONAL: (After I make review Nisekoi: I got something important to say)\r\nTRY NOT TO BINGE WATCHING NISEKOI. You may enjoy it more since the core story is expanded in the series of high school life of Raku.\r\nDon't forget again...I recommend you to read the manga first (at least until Chapter 100) then you can happily watch this. Cheers! Chapter 100 is the last episode of Nisekoi: if don't make mistake.\r\nNISEKOI Review:\r\nI fix my previous comment about Nisekoi being a shoujo anime while it is characterised as shounen. I honestly can't decide it belong to which genre hoenstly...but it might be good in both realm (shoujo& shounen). Well...I leave it to you guys.\\n\\n\r\nFirst thing I REALLY notice from Nisekoi is....ANIMATION brought by SHaft.\\n\\n\r\nHaha...seriously, Nisekoi is Bakemonogatari Series in less dark and more casual appearance. A shoujo version of Bakemonogatari Series in term of visual (and less harem so I say)\\n\\n\r\nI am a big fans of bakemonogatari and the entire story, up to marvellous Kizumonogatari. Shaft have done a great thing with its eccentric art and style and it was so awesome I could cry.\\n\\n\r\nWell...but...I just don't seem to be in a much click to fit those styles with Nisekoi tho. I am not saying it's not good..but the story is too casual to get an eccentric kind of presentation. And the way character drawed (which is resemble the Nisekoi manga by a lot that I don't find it matching as well woth the presentation) Altho I still love that small detail in term of character presentation and camera focus, gestures details (like them spinning around, sparkling, over-colored, I found it very nice)\\n\\n\r\nComparing with Tonari no Kaibutsu-Kun which I am much more fond with. I think that image more fitting IMHO.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nHmm..hard to say, but I found it great but not that masterpiece. But...for younger audience (for example high schooler shoujo) it is very perfect imo. But not so for more mature audience. I prefer a straight forward love relationship like in the Tonari Kaibutsu-Kun (sorry to brought that up again). I like how Shaft brought up the first episode, I was so curious about it (I haven't read the manga yet up until I finish the Nisekoi: ) The idea of love story from 10 years ago with the only link is a pendant and a key (but even you know 5 years old talking about love and getting married is something that I can't never understand) How chitoge make the first entrance and meet Raku, it was unique. And then one by one new character appears, and make the mystery a tad more complicated. How they ended up with Nisekoi (Fake Love) between Chitoge and Raku (which is I found it to be forced in terms of story)\\n\\n\r\nBut then.....the story stray\\n\\n\r\nThey essence of those pendant story and the fake relationship is fading halfway. And it turn to be a daily high school love life with a coward way of expressing their own feelings (Seriously, Onodera and Raku maybe the DENSEST anime character I have ever watched, I will be in the Ruri teams and shout \"JUST MADE UP COUPLE ALREADY!) It may be cool for anime (since manga I don't really bother with extended plot and long story, but for anime I prefer straight forward story) ..again..it might be cool if Raku and Onodera get together as a couple without knowing the pendant and then boom! Chitoge appear with the key (oh well but then it broke the nice manga) Yeah I am just saying some plot twist, hha.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much scenes that make my heart skip beat or beat faster like in any other love genre anime (let say Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai and Tonari no Kaibutsu) which is I found it sad. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt was great. Shaft love ClariS and so do I. It is matching with the genre, fun and catchy. The soundtrack also ok, casual for slice of life (I found it similar with Umaru) But it is lacking in terms of romance ambience. But well...that again following the story which happen to have less romance climax. I love STEP, TRICK BOX, and CLICK.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs I said, they are high schooler and I can understand if they are too shy to say their own feelings but Raku and Onodera is WAAYYY to DENSE and they can't read the atmosphere at all (so many time I just wanna scream \"JUST CONFESS NOW,AHO!\") Chitoge kept on lying to herself and everybody. Oh well...I can get along with them anyway.\\n\\n\r\nI like Tusugumi by the way (Tsugumi team yey!) I haven't read the manga to finish so I don't know how this long extended plot ended but I got my own plot twist where actually the girl with key is actually Tsugumi (shot myself in the head) Go Tsugumi.\\n\\n\r\nI watched Nisekoi: with hope that the story get more mature but yeah...it still the same. The first 3 episode get my expectation up with Chitoge acknowledge her own feeling but then she keep on doing stupid things (like punching Raku to the moon) instead of showing her affection to Raku.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor Note:\\n\r\nI just follow the manga from Chapter 62 and I notice a missing story or not sure, but it is not in the Nisekoi: Hope the story is going good and I don't ended up realising that Nisekoi: is a filler or whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nNisekoi story is too long with rather slow progression in the core story but I enjoy it a lot. There are so many time I laugh with the comedy and so many time I wondering about the core relationship mystery.\\n\\n\r\nJust like Kyoko sensei said \"It is nice to be young!\"",

Each character has their own unique characteristics and they all develop further on the story. In my point of view, it's an original set of romance and comedy style. The art style is very neat and doesn't hurt my eyes too much (even though it is very bright) but it's not too extreme. The humor is top of the line in this! Each episode has a story where you get to know more of the characters. Honestly, one thing disliked about the anime wasthat season 2 didn't really follow enough of the manga and just jumped really fast.\\n\\n\r\nMAY contain SPOILER:\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I love this anime is that it has an actual story behind everyone. All the girls come together in having feelings for Raku. The ending also isn't a cliche harem ending.",

            "content": "STORY - 8\r\nART - 8\r\nSOUND - 8\r\nCHARACTER - 9\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\r\nIt really is tough to maintain the facade of love. To act like you're in love with this partner who you hate, well, it'll definitely stir up some volatile scenarios that other people might get enjoyment out of. Nisekoi is an overblown version of this and despite its clich\u00e9s, it did a pretty damn good job at doing just that.\r\nStarting off with two comically frightening families who wanted to strangle each other's neck, a truce was formed when the son and daughter from both families was forced into a pretend relationship. The boy has amysterious pendant of childhood origin, has his own puppy crush on a quite timid girl, and is just about the most densest object in the entire universe. Very familiar qualities but I must say, they were what made this anime enjoyable. You see, the hateful relationship between these two teens opened up the chances to admire their stabilizing chemistry. Added with the suspicions and mishaps that arose between misunderstandings, it led to many comedic greatness while having that sweet progression as they gradually realized the seeping warmth over time. That pendant with a lock was a key element for the girls present in his love life. All of them have a similarity in that they're in one way or another related to the childhood memories and promises of the boy. Each had a charming personality which was, yes, generic, but you don't have to be original if your show revolves around crazy antics. And it worked here. The love perception in the eyes of the girls, who had events of falling in love in their own ways, developed an infatuating crush on the boy. They tried handling their feelings, but that only guided them towards a lot of entertaining gags in the levels of silly and stupid. There were so many times where I screamed \"Aho!\" at them in my head but it's all good. Among this ruckus of hilarities, the inner monologuing delved into their true feelings which gave insights to them as characters. There's not much of a story other than the pendant giving backstories and some anticipating mystery but the progress was there and it's sincere. It was just halted numerous times by fun amusements.\\n\\n\r\nEverything I said will be blind if not for the distinct style produced by Shaft. While it was an interesting spin for a rom-com, it worked remarkably well here. Having geometric designs in the background with cases of more detailed ones created a mostly simplistic feel that emphasized the characters. There were also the visual motifs, such as head tilts, acting as an extra medium. Combined with a strong animation, this became what I call the master of exaggerations. Particularly for the facial expressions in embarrassing scenes, the moe factor mixed in with crazy faces so crazy was a solid source of laughter. Add all these styles together and the comedic scenarios were greatly executed. No doubt that the visual contributed immensely with the humor. They're both highly correlated with each other. Bright and vivid uses of colors splashed the scenes with vigor, pulsating the atmosphere with energetic vibes. The girls have something in them that was especially endearing to me. A certain semblance. Take the tsundere for example, with her hateful appearance contradicting with her blossoming feelings. That facade only made her even more cuter. They all have great character designs fitting for their archetype, portraying mannerisms through body language and luminescent blushes over love bubbles. In the midst of these beauties, great voice acting provided one other supplementary factor to go with their personality. Much of the background soundtracks blended in well with the scene so noticeability wasn't a main factor for them. That said, I loved a couple of the humming melodies filled with all kinds of fun. Opening songs were catchy by the way, loved them too.\\n\\n\r\nFakery is thin when it's bounded by the reality of love. It's a backfiring effect for people who have little experience with their fondness for that other person, generating tons of amusing behaviors along with some cute interactions. Which is good for us in the sidelines, as we can be indulged by it with Nisekoi being a prime example for this kind of entertainment.",

It has this tendency to make you feel at ease, you just relax with the characters, the light-hearted jokes, and the soft hints at romance.\r\nCalling them hints would not entirely justify them, but to say that there's 'real' romance in here would be exaggerated. It has this tendency to break up every single meaningful attempt at romance, something apparent in a lot of harems. I suppose that ifthere would be actual decisions, the show would end rather soon, but this does make it somewhat unsatisfying at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are portrayed rather well, each one having a very distinct personality. Therefore I wouldn't really say there's a whole lot of character development, but then again, that's not really needed if the story doesn't progress.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is an enjoyable experience. Your typical harem, you can be the judge on whether you would enjoy such a show or not.",

            "content": "I wonder if they ever fixed that locket...\r\nNisekoi! An anime about childhood memories, high school crushes, and crazy family's. The story revolves around Ichijou and one \"mystery\" girl who gave him a locket ten years prior. At the same time we have two gangs: the yakuza's, and the American Bee Hive Gang. Each who are about to go to war with each other. But suddenly they all find out that their heir's are both in love with each other, and postpone the war due to their \"love.\" The lovers are Ichijou and a girl from the ABHG, named Kirisaki; who both, by the way, hateeach other.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is quite good, but ends on a sour note that slaps you in the face saying, \"yeah, cliffhangers are still a thing.\" Because this anime, is a whole lot of filler; but it does it well. The characters have enough about them to make the entire experience a great watch. But be warned, there are many tropes here that might deter some, as the characters follow that instinctive \"harem\" vibe. Other than that, they're all very well done and keep the flow nice.\\n\\n\r\nNow I was really put off that this anime doesn't (usually) have any OP's or ED's, which is strange (besides few episodes here and there). I guess it's better to be put straight away into the action, but I do love a good OP. Aside from that the art and animation are decent for the age. Definitely nothing over the top, but it has it's moments.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall this anime isn't for everyone. It has the typical cliche characters that we've seen many times before in harem plots. But with the pretty good humor and good character relations, I can see myself watching the next season to see where this all leads. If you enjoyed anime like To LOVE-Ru, then I think you'll love this too.",

Maybe because of my first time watching harem.\r\n2. The main boy (Ichijou Raku) already has a his dream lover (Onodera) but I don't find the girl attractive enough, but of course, as he says, he likes sweet, cute long-haired girls.\r\n3. I like him with Kirisaki Chitoge better. She is not as sweet, but super cute, and kind, smart also. She found his pendant (although she is the cause of trouble), fixed his pendant, she... um OK no more to think of now.Raku did so much for the girls and in return, he gets nothing, but \"weird feelings\" - as we know it's love, to be honest. In this entire anime, I just remember Chitoge helping him a little, but I still love the girl. I hope the next season couple them up with more chemistry. \\n\r\n4. Too many harem is just time consuming. But of course, it's a harem anime anyway, and I didn't tend to watch, but invited.\\n\r\nEverything was just funny moments, blushing moments, the secret unsolved, and I wonder if Raku still likes Onodera or not, because the last episodes were kind of confusing. I count for the next season. The overall score is 7, because of the things above. \\n\r\nBut I enjoyed watching it, really.",

            "content": "Will fake love become real love?\r\nStory: In all honestly. There are plenty of pros and cons about the story line. Truly, its a good thing though. The story is something that you don't see often. Yes you see a lot of anime with people having a childhood friend(s) and sometimes they dont remember them, or they fall in love with them. But, Nisekoi is a bit different. The story was given spunk and excitement to it. They made the childhood friend a total mystery, and keeps you guessing on who was the person Raku made the promise to. The story's suspense keeps on increasing moreand more and keeps you wondering where the romance and everything else is headed. I gave it an 8/10. Reason is, some certain things in the story get kinda cliche, but overall, they did a good job on making sure its something fresh. The episodes aren't rushed, they go at a smooth pace, and its easy to understand what going on. The plot keeps getting better and better and after reading the manga, for people who are watching the anime, get ready to be surprised. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I give the art 9/10 because honestly, if you pay attention to how the mouths move, or how all the background or foreground art is, even the characters and everything else itself, its really good. I love the way they have been drawn, the feeling is so HD like. Also looks well done. It might just be my opinion but, anime in 2013-2014 has really gotten so much better since better technology is here for people to draw with. I think that this anime was drawn extremely well though, even down to the littlest detail. I might be over exaggerating, but I just really like it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I really love the music in the anime, and I have to say my favorite is when whenever Raku and Chitoge are doing their little play when pretending to be dating, the music that comes on for those parts is perfect. It makes you laugh with the scene that just happened, and it gives a good feeling to it. The OP to the anime is amazingly done too. The art is fantastic, but the song is also very good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The voices for each of the characters fits well in my opinion. In my head while reading the manga, I thought Raku's voice would be just a bit deeper, and same with Chitoge, but there voices are pretty damn close to what I would of thought. As for Kosaki, her voice is very girly, just what I would of thought. I think they did a good job. The characters themselves can be so funny, cute, serious, and great. I would have to say that their looks fit their personality great as well!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I honestly love romance/comedy/highschool animes/mangas. I dont know why, but I do. This is one of my favorites by far. Its hard for an anime to get me attached to it, but this one did a great job. I just keep reading the manga until the next episode comes out, and I just read the most recent issue that came out. So yeah, Im pretty well hooked. This does a good job with making you want to know whats going on, who is Raku gonna end up with, where is the story gonna head to. Its weird, but addicting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. I seriously love this anime, I think a lot of people will like it once the story gets deeper. The beginning is sort of slow, but its still good. I wouldnt give it any higher than a nine.. for now. Although my review makes me seem just an obsessive person. Remember, although it has a lot of my opinions in it, and a lot of you wont agree, but I hope a lot of you will give it the chance, and hopefully some of you will like it as much as I do. The story is original, the characters are original, and it's funny, cute, and addicting. Now that I feel lame, I hope you enjoy the rest of the episodes that come out!\\n",

If there's an anime you want to watch for simple bliss and happiness, Nisekoi is the one to watch. Hopefully thesales will warrant a second season, as the ending left too many questions to be answered, even if it was a pleasant enough. Just watch it.",

            "content": "Nisekoi is a fun-filled anime that is very upbeat and lively! It provides the audience with a great atmosphere, and a comforting romance story. Let's get into the fundamentals and the specifics:\r\nStory: The story was very enticing! The complex romance between characters provides the audience with a craving for a conclusion to the romantic \"journey,\" and throws upbeat twist and turns to provide entertainment. The reason I liked this anime was because the story provided a light romance that was not overly complicated (ex. romance stories that just make you say \"OMG this is so annoying\"), and that romance, was the main driving factor thatkept the story moving.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fantastic, one of the bests I have seen. The anime studio kept the art very close to the manga, which are both very good art styles! If you are looking for a unique art style that sticks very close to the manga, Nisekoi is a great option!\\n\\n\r\nSound: Now, the sound, is one of the bests I have heard!!! This is probably one of the main reasons why I loved this anime! The anime provides numerous different OPs and EDs so you are never bored with just 2 OPs or 2 EDs, and they are each very good in their own way. The OST is what stands out for me, because the OST is SO UPBEAT! The sound makes you feel good, and personally, for some reason, it made me feel like a young child again. The sound provided a very nostalgic tune for me, and I just loved it!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Throughout the anime, my overall enjoyment was good! Again, the nostalgic sound track kept me feeling upbeat, and the enticing story kept me craving for more. However, at some parts, I did feel a little bit bored because I felt as if they put a lot of filler in some episodes just to \"attempt\" to entertain the audience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: *NOTE I am not going to write as much here, there isn't more I can say that I haven't covered :O* Overall, the anime itself was very good! The main reason I liked this anime was because of the OST, and a bit of the romance. The romance keeps you craving for more, and a conclusion to the complex romantic relations between characters. Although it gets boring at some parts, I highly recommend this anime to any who want to experience a excellent \"feel-good/romance\" anime.",

            "content": "Favorite Quote: \"I may just be your fake boyfriend, but if anything happens I'll be the one to protect you.\" -Raku Ichijou\r\nNisekoi or should I say False Love.  I've always connected alot more with the kind and caring characters in romantic comedies.  Actually to be honest, I've always done this in almost every anime.  I guess one could say I'm a very kind person.  Hence, the reason why I identify with that specific quote from Nisekoi and as someone who has personally done this as well.  Anyway how do I feel about Nisekoi? Here's the my review of why Ireally enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: As the summary suggests it's about two gang families who attempt to stop the ongoing conflict by faking a relationship between two of our main characters.  Simple right? Actually, not quite.  The story adds a rather interesting twist to it with the key locket and the promise that the main character kept in his childhood years.  I thought that this would make the storyline rather overwhelming, but surprisingly, it wasn't.  I felt that the overall plot was still retained after introducing the fake relationship between Raku and Chitoge.  However, one thing to note is that the romance in this series didn't offer us anything new.  It was a generic all girls like the guy type harem.  But what I did like was the approach they took to develop this.  Instead of using a simple high school setup, the author used the gang family conflict and the locket as a way to develop the romance.  It wasn't painfully obvious like other romantic comedies.  It had me second guessing alot at times.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Nisekoi was actually very well done.  Some parts are just so colorful and lively, but despite that, it didn't distract me from the overall story.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I loved the soundtrack and the opening alot.  The soundtrack perfectly captured the mood of the many parts of the segment.  For example, there are times when Raku had to go save Chitoge countless times.  The soundtrack goes from being comical to being serious.  It helps build tension and the romance.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in this series was also very well done.  As I watched the series the anime does a good job of introducing new characters.    They did it in a way where it had me constantly wonder whether or not this will effect Raku's fake relationship with Chitoge.  One other thing that I liked about the characters was how they developed over time.  This was especially true for Raku and Chitoge.  As dense as the main character is, the fake relationship with Chitoge actually made him question who he liked.  We also see him show his true character towards the people around him.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Other than that, the character didn't offer us anything new in the romantic comedy genre.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion:  Honestly, Nisekoi is the my second favorite harem and romantic comedy.  It is also one of my favorite animes of all time.  I understand opinions may differ, but I think everything that we would expect from a romantic comedy is here.  Not only that, it was hilarious and serious at times and the writing was done extremely well to convey this to the audience.  It sure hooked me in and wanted me to continue the series.  So much that I was continuing the manga.  But there are times when it fell short from being a masterpiece.  The characters would be something you would expect from a harem series.  If there was a 9.5 rating I would definitely give it that.  Loved the anime and hope to see more of from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review.  I hope this persuaded you guys to check out this anime.  You will get tons of laughs, I promise that! A great anime that is worth a watch.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Who knew something that was done to death can still be as refreshing as this?! Yeah Nisekoi is that kind of story. So don't expect a compelling story like Steins;Gate's or a Haruhi Suzumiya's XD\r\nStory 7: First of all its story is basically a Modern Romeo and Juliet story with a twist because both Raku and Chitoge's family's are feuding but the way to end it is to have them be \"boyfriend and girlfriend.\" The story doesn't end there. There is a conflict with the memories of our beloved protagonist as he tries to remember the girl whom he made a promise with 10 yearsago. Very Convenient amnesia bros XD Still pretty neat anyways\\n\\n\r\nArt 10: Damn Shaft, you make everything look so grand. I dont mean it in a bad way, honestly that's what other animation studios should aim to be. Excluding Kyo-ani and Production I.G. Shaft I believe is in that Big 3. The way it is animated may confuse some of the viewers but worry not, that's just Shaft doing its magic. \\n\\n\r\nSound 5: I personally am not a fan of ClariS because the way she sounds so generic. Honestly this is the weakest part of the show because even the BG Music is so dull it makes you bored. Nonetheless that's just Shaft for you but if you want a Shaft animated show that has god-tier music, try the Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That was where ClariS hit the right notes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7: The characters were really something you would see from a typical harem show. A normal looking guy who every pretty likes. There are so many types of girls here XD There is a tsundere, an obssessive girl, a quiet shy type, a loyal servant, and a big sister type( you will find her later if you read the manga). Yeah nothing original but it just feels so refreshing. XD\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: No matter how generic the plot may be as long as you really enjoyed just like I did, It wont really matter because it is really FRESH! In short, I am saying that you will forget how done to death the story is because you enjoyed it so much.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: A 9. I AM EAGER FOR THE SEASON 2. GO NISEKOI, THE MANLIEST SHOJO LOVE STORY! :D",

            "content": "When this anime was announced, I was extremely excited. Although I hadn't read the manga, this anime actually sounded quite good to me. On top of that, it was to be animated by Shaft, the studio behind several shows I love (Madoka, Ef, etc). As the show began, I wasn't disappointed. I liked the characters and the setup was more than adequate. I thought there'd be a great show coming. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The show is good, but far from great. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story begins with a decent, although somewhat generic, setup where two people are forced into close proximity to each other for anextended period of time, with love being a clear objective of the show. Over time, though, the plot devolved into a very generic harem and became quite boring. Nothing moved in a positive direction at all. The story is the single most disappointing aspect of this show. Also, the plot with the lock and key is just terrible.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in this show is quite good. Although certainly not the best art I've ever seen, I really do like it. The characters look great, and there surroundings also look really good. You can almost always count on Shaft to give you something fun occasionally in the art, and they didn't fail here (although they certainly didn't go overboard like in Monogatari). \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNot too much to say here. We have ClariS singing openings, which is always good. The endings were also fun. Music has a decent, though not incredible role throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are a bit hit and miss. We start with three main characters, Raku, Chitoge, and Onodera. Raku is a good character. Compared to most harem leads, he is amazing. He has a real personality and isn't simply there as a target for romance. His thoughts are usually pretty decent and he is pretty likable overall. Chitoge is also a pretty good character. She seems the popular type, but is actually quite vulnerable. She puts on a strong face, but a front is all it is. She develops pretty well throughout the show (although she does get a bit annoying towards the end) and is likely my favorite character in the show. Onodera should have been a good character, but her role in the story works against here a bit. Her actions end up seeming more frustrating than anything. There are times where I really like here, but there are also times when I wish she wasn't in the show. \\n\\n\r\n-Spoiler-\\n\\n\r\nEventually we get a third girl added to the harem and the show really takes on a harem like quality. We lose the feeling of a love triangle or a romance and instead get harem nonsense. This third girl is also a terribly annoying character that I absolutely hate. I think  this has been the single largest detriment of the show.\\n\\n\r\n-Spoiler End-\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters in this show aren't that great. I liked them in the beginning, but felt the roster got much worse over time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFor the reasons mentioned above, this show's enjoyment was good, but not great. I was not looking for a harem when I started this show, but by the end that was all I got. The comedy was sub par, the characters hit and miss, and the situations somewhat boring. If the beginning of the show hadn't been as enjoyable, I would have rated the show a worse.",

            "content": "So boy meets girl, they hate each other but are somehow forced to be together for utterly unrealistic circumstances. To top it off after this event, several girls just \"happened\" to appear and fall in love with our main character which is supposed to be a super dense and ordinary high school student. The anime is about the daily crazy things that happen around these characters and how their relations develop.\r\nI probably just described a ton of anime. There is simply nothing new that this anime has to offer. the Harem formula has been completely exploited over the past years and yet this series managesto stand out over the others. Nisekoi its a great example of why something being overdone doesn't mean its bad as long as you do it right. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically set up to force our characters to be together but they managed to do it in a very comical way. The characters are the usual archetypes but they are all very enjoyable and very easy to relate to. I specially enjoyed that there is a fair amount of exposure even for \"secondary heroins\" (The manga is still ongoing so who knows).\\n\\n\r\nThe scenarios are and settings are crazy enough to be very entertaining but not so much that it becomes ridiculous or forced. Yeah, it might be super predictable after a bit and some situations are SUPER improbable but who cares if its not that realistic? this show acknowledges that and manages to laugh at itself.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically speaking there is not much to say. The art is great, it's pretty and comical which matches the atmosphere of the series remarkably good. Same goes with the soundtrack, it might not be the best and memorable one but it matches the atmosphere very well. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series. If you are something light, something where you don't need to think but just accept everything and laugh then I recommend this a lot. It might be a romcom harem but its very well executed with all the strong points that made this such a popular genre these days.",

            "content": "While everyone likes to say that harems these days lack originality and are quickly getting stale, I think that Nisekoi is an exception. A lot of the elements in the anime are very comparable to things others have done before (such as the story), yet it's still an enjoyable watch. \r\nWhy, you might ask? I feel that having a female mangaka has helped Nisekoi despite its status as a Shounen anime. Instead of overloading on the ecchi moments and panty shots, Nisekoi shows a lot about the personalities of the girls vying for Raku's love, plus the feelings of Raku himself. Their character designs areall adorable, and their motives are all (for the most part) pure. Without the pretty outfits, hairstyles, and animation, this anime would not be the same. The cutesy style is approachable and perfect for the feeling that it's supposed to give off. As a female anime watcher, this is one of the few harem anime I actually feel comfortable watching. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the approachability of the anime for all genders, I find the music to be absolutely wonderful. I've always been a fan of openings and endings sung by seiyuu, and Nisekoi does not disappoint in that area. I particularly enjoyed how if an episode centered on one of the girls, the ED would be sung by her seiyuu and include lots of nice dreamy visuals. \\n\\n\r\n For me, the best part of watching this anime was Raku, the adorable MC, and the beautiful yet catchy soundtrack.",

            "content": "Doki doki doki doki. I understand this as the written sound effect of a beating heart. It was my normal beat. When walking and sleeping, that rhythmic sound is what I'm familiar with, but curiously, different as I watch Nesikoi. Doki do- doki. Skipping beats, my heart does, as I watch along, scenes after scenes, portraying an interesting mixes of characters. It skips as these unsuspected meetings in the story takes place. Then the beating would be like as if I were running 2000 miles non stop (lets assume I'm still alive by then) as the main characters talk. Misunderstanding, Jealousy, Wants, Likes usually interplayin between. Afterwards, with a held breath expectation, I would laugh. It was frequent enough that if you were listening beside me as I watch, you could probably hear all sorts of laughs a person could possibly create. All-out laugh, sad laugh, happy laugh (?), as well as creepy laugh (that laugh goes like, \"he... he... he...\", just remembering this made laugh)\\n\\n\r\n== Story ==\\n\\n\r\nYakuzas and gangs would play as a base motivation for the boy and the girl (the blond one). As they were forced to act a play to please the people around, and so avoid a deadly disaster, the couple would learn loads of things. And since this is primarily a romance dominating series, the learning would be directed to their innocent untrained hearts (woot!). Every episodes were interesting, same as each chapter in this manga version. Most episodes sometimes end with a cliffhanger, leaving you wanting. \\n\\n\r\n== Art ==\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was unreal. There were stars up above a character's head after he/she is in a daze, some impossible scenes to depict emotions. To me, there would be no other way for Nesikoi to be better other than this style of animation. Introductions and close ups would include a 3d-like imaging for the character's person, thus maximizing their cuteness as much as possible. Though there is a kind of similarity in them. If you get rid of the hair, clothing, color, eyes, 99%, you'd have a hard time differentiating each. But of course, this is no news to me. This is anime.\\n\\n\r\n== Sound ==\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of great things to say about the sound in this series. With my novice but vast experience as an anime fan, I believe the sound ranks as one of my top 3. Those solo instruments playing at the background for the sweetest scenes and hilarious comedy bits. Wow. I've observed in other series overdoing it with the sound, but not Nesikoi. If a punch is coming in the act, the sound people (yes, I'm ignorant to the right term) somehow finds the perfect fit, for a serious one or a comedic approach. It was a major factor in this series' success/charm.\\n\\n\r\n== Character ==\\n\\n\r\nThe boy knows how to cook. With dozens of yakuzas vacating his house, all brawl and muscles, the boy was provided with the job to cook for them, making him good at it. And like any other cooking-capable dudes, he depicts a self-reliant character, with loads of chances in the series, he practices this as he helps, advices them gals in distress. I think he has bad, perhaps average grades.\\n\\n\r\nThe blond-girl (BG) is tomboyish, but later, her character would unravel. Showing all pink, girlish colors beneath. She has a character that is approachable, unintimidating aura but was not the case at the start.\\n\\n\r\nThe short-haired girl (SG) has a perfect, friendly neighborhood kind of vibe. She is the most shy of the girls that ever existed in this series, I believe. Together with her best friend, she would initiate confessions and lots of close calls that would always fail. Making us viewers pause, full of exhilarating imagination of what would happen next.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no need for me to say how much shyness these characters incorporate. Though sure, one or two would project a well-built confidence, most of them here are shy, sometimes dull, incapable of taking hints. But what could be expected. Other kinds of characters would only see this story an abrupt, short end.\\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment ==\\n\\n\r\nhalf part funny and half part romance, creating a full part riot. Every episode was drug against boredom. Memorable and re-watchable. Teenagers would surely love this, excluding of course those that don't. Kids still not in the character's grade-level would perhaps look forward to a possible romance, drama experience in the near future. \\n\\n\r\nBut one thing that keeps bugging me in the corner of my mind as I come to like every characters in this series. I only hope there is a happy ending in everyone of them. This is a great challenge for the writer I believe and since the manga is still an ongoing translation, I'm hopeful still.\\n",

            "content": "I don't like giving numerical ratings to the shows I watch so that's why they're all 10s. ^^\r\nWarning: The following review will contain spoilers for the ending as well as specific moments of Nisekoi. This is a review of the anime and manga so yes, that means I will be discussing all the way until the manga\u2019s conclusion. If you wish to skip over the spoilers, I will provide timestamps which will allow you to do so and will also give a warning beforehand. So now without further ado\u2026\r\nNisekoi was not the best. I mean, it wasn\u2019t horrible. I have some praise to give itand also have a fair amount of problems with the it. I've been with the series since the manga was first released in the U.S. and own every volume, so I've been pretty committed to it since I was 15 years old. As for why I committed so hard to it, well it was honestly pretty hilarious and the series had a lot of potential. It\u2019s unfortunate how it didn\u2019t really do anything with that potential.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who haven't seen or read anything related to Nisekoi yet, the story is about a high school kid named Raku Ichijou. He\u2019s the son of the leader of a big Yakuza gang. On his way to school, he meets a girl named Chitoge Kirisaki. She and Raku later meet up at school and come to hate each other\u2019s guts because of their inability to get along. Raku, instead likes a girl named Kosaki Onodera, who also has a crush on him. Neither have admitted anything to each other, however. Later, Chitoge is revealed to also be in a Yakuza gang, which just so happens to be rivals with Raku\u2019s gang. In order to maintain peace and keep both gangs from destroying each other, Raku and Chitoge are both forced to date in spite of their conflicting personalities. Raku also made a promise with a girl 10 years ago where he and a her had planned to get married. Whoever the girl was now still possesses a key to the pendant Raku always wears around his neck. And of course, several of the main characters possess a key that could potentially unlock this pendant.\\n\\n\r\nSo what are my thoughts on the series? Well there's one major criticism I hear a lot that I want to address. If you\u2019ve seen or read any Nisekoi review, you probably know exactly where I\u2019m going with this. Nothing happens whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nI'm case you're unaware, despite such an interesting premise, the series takes forever to actually get things to happen in the story. It constantly teases the audience by making it seem like something very important is about to happen, and proceeds to backpedal and pretend like nothing ever did happen in the first place. I\u2019ll go ahead and list a few quick examples to demonstrate this point.\\n\\n\r\nMinor spoilers ahead. Nothing related to the ending, just some examples of how a few less important scenes play out\\n\\n\r\nVolume 1 Chapter 5: Onodera drops her key to Raku\u2019s pendant. She says it\u2019s just a key to a bookcase. Raku believes her.\\n\r\nVolume 2 Chapter 14: Onodera is about to confess her feelings to Raku. Right before she does, though, a baseball comes flying in through the glass window, ending the conversation.\\n\r\nVolume 3 Chapter 22: All the main characters are playing a card game. The loser has to reveal their first crush to everybody. Chitoge ends up losing. Before she can reveal anything, however, everybody is interrupted by being called to dinner.\\n\r\nVolume 4 Chapter 29: Chitoge decides to finally put her key into Raku\u2019s pendant to see if she was the girl Raku made the promise with. The key twists and breaks inside the keyhole without any information being discovered.\\n\r\nVolume 5 Chapter 39: Onodera was about to send a text telling Raku she liked him in Junior High. She decides to not send it.\\n\\n\r\nThe list goes on and on. But the thing is that this blatant teasing is not unintentional. The series will actually go out of its way to make sure that the plot makes no progress, even sacrificing character believability.\\n\\n\r\nI noticed this when reading volume 8. Onodera had given chocolates to Raku on Valentine\u2019s Day after lots of mental preparation. When she did, he told her that it\u2019s platonic to assure that she didn't have special feelings for him. But she replied with \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a special platonic.\u201d This was the perfect opportunity for Raku to at least get at least a little bit suspicious of whether Onodera has feelings for him. But no, the series, like always, just ignored this and never mentioned the scene again.\\n\\n\r\nThis was when it dawned on me on how shameless the series is with its whole \u201cnothing happens\u201d fiasco. It's so obvious that Onodera likes Raku. She goes as far as practically confessing her feelings to him. But somehow Raku is so clueless to that fact and continues to wonder if his feelings are unrequited throughout more of the series. It's ridiculous and makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nWatch out, big spoilers ahead!\\n\\n\r\nEven the manga knows how obvious it is that Raku likes Onodera. Marika was able to call them out on it in volume 22 change volume number to chapter number. Is there some reason why Marika\u2019s able to notice this and not anyone else? Oh yeah Chitoge knew about it to. After Onodera confessed her feelings to Raku\u2026\u2019s unconscious body.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe teasing the manga does when it tries to get you to believe that something is important is obnoxious. So many times will the manga have nice big panels with a black bold font, zoomed in onto a character\u2019s face. It becomes this stupid Boy Who Cried Wolf situation where when something noteworthy does end up happening, like towards the end, the stupid zoomy effects are ineffective.\\n\\n\r\n\tIt gets really frustrating how nothing happens, too. I mean, if you sat through the anime you\u2019ve seen some nice story arcs but that\u2019s about it. Lots of the story arcs are filler anyway. But if you\u2019ve read the manga, then you\u2019ve sat through dozens of chapters that meant absolutely nothing to the overall story. The series is honestly a long grind that doesn\u2019t really pay off in the end.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow when the series actually does decide to get things done, it\u2019s usually related to the overall love story. Guess what? The love story isn\u2019t all that great either. Look out, spoilers! Chitoge just decides to like Raku in chapter 51. No really, she literally thinks to herself that she likes Raku without any buildup. It felt like it was just thrown in there. If you want your characters to develop feelings for each other, there\u2019s obviously going to have to be a part of the story where you find out that someone likes another character, but you can\u2019t just throw it in willie nillie. It\u2019s a big deal that Chitoge likes Raku now. The manga should at least act like it. Instead it felt like the author had forgotten to check off the \u201cChitoge likes Raku\u201d box so he just threw it in real quick without putting any thought into it. There might as well have been a page in all black that said \u201cHey guys, Chitoge likes Raku.\u201d because that\u2019s just how effective this chapter was.\\n\\n\r\n\tThen besides that, there\u2019s really nothing special to the love story at all. Raku and Chitoge end up getting together in the end because they were truly in love the whole time. Onodera was just Raku\u2019s crush, Chitoge was someone he deeply cared about. Wow haven\u2019t ever seen that done in other anime like Toradora before. (For the record, Toradora\u2019s amazing tho) The message is cliche.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnother thing that bugged me is how all the other girls ended up confessing their feelings to Raku toward the end, which is so pointless. It\u2019s okay for the other girls to not end up with the main guy. He\u2019s obviously just going to be with one girl in the end anyway. All of their confession scenes really just felt like a compromise between the reader and the storyline. If your favorite girl ends up not being chosen for being with Raku in the end, then hey, at least they worked up the courage to confess their feelings to him. So in a way, they\u2019re kind of half-with Raku I guess.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe worst confession scene award has to go to Tsugumi, tbh. It\u2019s insane how it\u2019s even remotely supposed to come across as emotional or satisfying. She puts her hands over Raku\u2019s ears so that he can\u2019t hear a word she\u2019s saying. She proceeds to confess her feelings. Then for some reason she now feels satisfied with herself and like she can move on after getting this big secret off her chest. Um, what? He didn\u2019t hear a thing you said. How are you supposed to feel better now after having nobody listen to any part of the confession you just made? That\u2019s as secretive as telling yourself that you like Raku in your head.\\n\\n\r\n\tThese confessions are really all just fanservice, even Onodera\u2019s. She just confesses her feelings at the end and Raku\u2019s like \u201cAlright, see ya! I like Chitoge more, though.\u201d It\u2019s crazy that even after 24 volumes that during this scene Raku just finds out that Onodera likes him.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo in all actuality, the series is really just a harem that tries too hard to make sure everyone reading is satisfied, even if their favorite girl didn\u2019t end up with the main character. Toradora has unrequited love in it, but nobody complains about that.\\n\\n\r\n\tI bet after everything I\u2019ve said, some of you might be thinking I loathe Nisekoi, but that\u2019s not the case. A common argument you\u2019ll get if you put a negative opinion about something out for people to hear is \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it then why do you watch/read/play/etc. It?\u201d And to that I will give 2 answers when it comes to Nisekoi.\\n\\n\r\n\tOne reason is because of the potential it had. Such an cool premise is bound to get people interested. I mean, it was able to convince my 15-year-old brain that the series was good. With the premise Nisekoi has, there\u2019s so much potential for what kinds of interesting situations can happen. Will Chitoge and Raku get so fed up with each other that they break up despite the pressure from their family? Will Onodera confess her feelings so that she and Raku somehow end up in a secret relationship? Will the girl Raku made a promise with be revealed soon? The locket is right on Raku\u2019s neck and every single girl has a key that could potentially open it. This premise kept me very excited to continue reading, at least at the very beginning when things hadn\u2019t gotten frustrating.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe second reason is that there really is some great character interaction to be found in Nisekoi. As annoying as the teasing can get, it\u2019s still funny to see characters stumbling for ways to get out of situations that could potentially reveal details about their love lives. Seeing Onodera and Raku together was what I always looked the most forward to seeing. It reminded me and probably many other anime fans about their high school days when they would be super awkward around their crushes. The scenes with the two characters legitimately made me cringe and laugh. The author captures the essence of being a nervous high school kid really well. This made reading almost every volume bearable, and even occasionally enjoyable to read. That\u2019s why I was actually a fan of Nisekoi at the beginning. The teasing hadn\u2019t gotten to the point where it was happening for chapters on end. Sure it was definitely there in the beginning, but it hadn\u2019t gotten old yet. Add to that the fun character interactions, despite some overused concepts like Marika always clinging way too hard to Raku, it was fun to read at first.\\n\\n\r\n\tIt\u2019s hard to gauge how much I\u2019d recommend Nisekoi to other people. For one, the character interaction is very fun to watch and can be relatable at times. The animation in the TV show is quite good as is the art in the manga. And even if the ending was cliche and had lots of fan pandering, I do feel like the manga wrapped up nicely. It feels complete. I mean, I should hope it feels complete considering it\u2019s a simple love story longer than Monster.\\n\\n\r\n\tOn the other hand, there\u2019s a lot of giant flaws with the series. The love story is no good, the plot is frustrating, even sacrificing character believability, and some ideas were used a bit too much.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo I\u2019ll just say this. Nisekoi is a manga that\u2019s too much of a time investment for such a predictable payoff. Going through chapters and chapters of filler is just a grind a lot of the time and it\u2019s really frustrating. I did, however, enjoy reading watching characters being put in really awkward situations every night I read the manga.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo go ahead. Watch the first season of the anime and see how much you like it. Heck, even drop it if you\u2019re not a fan. Hopefully this review will give you a guide on what to look out for and where you can find the good parts.\\n\\n\r\nBut before you do that, watch Toradora. Watch and read Kimi ni Todoke. Watch Clannad. Watch Your Lie in April. These are all romantic anime that I will always put above Nisekoi. Because, at least those series don\u2019t feel like 25 volumes of filler designed to keep the author\u2019s paycheck coming in every month.\\n",

            "content": "Harem animes aren't a genre I'm too keen on. Seeing as though the main character is denser than the mass of a black hole and the girls refuse to confess their feelings, it gets a tad bit annoying. Nisekoi is no exception, yet in the end, I found myself oddly satisfied with it. While it wasn't the best romance I've seen, it still provided some good laughs and some pretty dramatic moments I wasn't expecting and made it stand out to me.\r\nStory: 5- There's nothing too innovative here. The closest thing to being \"unique\" is the concept of the \"Promise Girl\" and the locket shegave Raku 10 years ago. Sure, it may be fun to try and guess who it might be from the characters that spring up throughout the show, but in the end, it dissolves into a basic harem anime plot for most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8- This is the first Studio Shaft production I have seen, and while it probably doesn't match up to their Monogatari series, it's still pretty dang good to look at. I really love the character designs and just the different types of backgrounds and effects around certain characters depending on their moods.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7- The sound was nothing spectacular, The op and ed were decent, the sound effects sounded fine, and there were a few recurring background tracks in the show that I did enjoy. The voice acting was very good as well, with Raku and Chitoge's voice actors being the standouts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7- The characters in this show give me conflicting feelings. Most of them are basic Harem cliches, but as infuriating as he is, I actually like Raku, even with how dense he is, and I love Chitoge, seeing as she's a tsundere that actually has some pretty good development. The other main girl is the same annoying shy girl that everyone seems to love, and the rest of the supporting cast is just bland, except for Shu. (Oh and this may be about 3 years late but, uh, Chitoge is best girl. #TeamChitoge)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8- I really did enjoy this anime. It gave me the feelings of infuriation, annoyance, and laughs i was expecting, but also threw in some moments and feelings i wasn't expecting or thought the show was going to try and pull off at all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that I'll leave you off with this; the show was neither great nor bad. It was enjoyable, yet predictable. If you enjoy harem comedies, you'll enjoy this show. I would recommend it to anyone who also like romantic comedies, seeing that it also falls into that category. Overall, I liked the show, and Chitoge is still best girl. Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "So, I was debating a few shows to start at the time when I began watching Nisekoi. Honestly the decider came down when I realized Shaft was the producer for the series. I've always been a bit partial to harem romcoms, so keep that in mind while reading my thoughts.\r\nNisekoi starts as a reverse Romeo and Juliet tale, of two warring families who encourage a relationship to quell tensions between Japanese Style Yakuza and American Gangsters. Raku and Chitoge, are the \"victims\" of this relationship, and are burdened with keeping it mostly secret while also trying to appease the gangs suspicious members.\r\nRight off the bat,you'll notice there are plenty of tropes in this anime. There are a lot interrupted confessions, a lot of fanservice, and a lot of plot twists out of left field (one of the major ones for the series comes 3/4 in to the season). New characters crop up constantly and are often there to stay. Overall, if you get blue balls from watching love-confessions broken up 3x an episode, you'll want to avoid this anime. Additionally, if you hate the violent tsundere stereotype, you will also want to avoid this show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this show lacks in originality of character design, it makes up for with the stories, situations, and exploratory adventures it puts the main cast of characters in. Each girl in this \"harem\" show still gets their own episodes, even though it's pretty easy to figure out the \"main\" interests. Additionally, these arcs could occasionally break the mold and flesh out a character even better. Without any spoilers, the bathhouse episode seemed like it would be a typical fanservice episode to me. While it filled those roles, it also became important for showing the trust that Chitoge actually puts in Raku's character. This is a show where actions definitely speak louder than character backstory/personality. Thus, the drive in watching this show is less about a character \"changing,\" and more about revealing their personality through trials and tribulations.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this won't be my favorite anime by a long shot, this show did a few things that I appreciated with regards to story-telling. The art is crisp, the music is decent, the characters are a bit bland, but the situations they're put in allow them to at least appear to be broken out of their mold.",

You might think Nisekoi is different. \r\nNot really. \r\nOf course, there is some sort of guilty pleasure in watching this. Which may make my review a little biased. However, there are some glaring issues with this anime. Such as the story. Besides the key and lock, nothing really goes beyond that. Yes a new girl may be introduced or some event that puts our Beloved Ichijo in some sort of situation, but all of it has no really impact onany of the characters. This show has no goal for the characters. We simply see into their lives. I want a romance and relationship that develops. Not one that wont go beyond being bashful and admiring the other person. The final few episodes did give me that spark. As things had actual conflict between some of the characters, but that quickly ended. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly  my main grip was the story and characters. Everything else didnt affect me. The animation was actually pretty appealing. I spotted some moments in which they didn't just make all of them static for long periods of time, but instead there was rarely a moment in which movement wasn't spotted. Its jumpy at some times, buts till good. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is generic, but it did the job. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this somehow. But that may be due to laughing at some of the ridiculous things that happen here that don't add up, or are just ridiculous. If someone told me it was some sort of parody, I would't bat an eye.",

            "content": "I don't really like Nisekoi, but it was worth the watch.  I'm comfortable giving it a 5/10.  I like harem comedies and this fits the category well.  There's tons of harem action going between all the girls and there's a fair amount of comedy thrown into the mix.  Unfortunately, it's not very interesting.  It can be fun having two characters in a forced relationship, but it doesn't work here.  Raku and Chitoge fight way too often even for their relationship being forced onto them.  Their reactions tend to be too showy too; every time that they accidentally saysomething that could people to find out that they're not a true couple, they would always try to cover it up with an overly affectionate display of actions.  After a while, it just gets annoying.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's even more sad is that my favorite character, Ruri, doesn't really have much screen time compared to the other girls;  if the other girls were more likable, one of them would probably be my favorite.  I love tseundere characters, considering that Asuna Yuki is my 3rd favorite anime girl and she's a tseundere.  Again, this is a point where I think people tried to hard.  Chitoge is more of a tseundere than any other character that I've seen and I can't stand it.  She'll fly off the handle for no reason and than act somewhat sweet the next second like nothing happened.  \\n\\n\r\nI also think that the locket stuff was kind of forced and it made up too much of the first few episodes.  All this information about promises made ten years ago, more than 1 person having a locket key, etc is mentioned;  it was just too much of driving force for much of the early plot and it was really boring.  I think this show had potential, but it just lacked the aspects to make it a more enjoyable show.  I don't regret giving it a shot and I might watch the ova and the second season, but I'm not sure.  I suggest at least giving it a shot I guess, but it's not that good.  I would give it less than a 5, but it was funny enough to at least deserve that rating. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Nisekoi, one of my guiltiest pleasures. Nisekoi was the start of my anime binge watching, and I absolutely, and still, love it. But this review will not be talking about how much I enjoyed the series, but how good the actual story was overall.\r\nNisekoi is pretty much your typical harem anime, in which the main character, Raku, gets the iconic first meeting with the girl of his future, Chitoge. Nothing new really happens in the series, as much of it is just a mix of overused cliches, but that doesn't necessarily mean the show is bad. When done right, used ideas can still make agreat show(such as BNHA), but it's just how well the author can use them.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Nisekoi does contain many previously used ideas, but it doesn't do it poorly. Rather, Nisekoi has an interesting plot, which keeps many of us from dropping the series. Two characters, Raku and Chitoge, are complete opposites, but in order to retain peace in the city, they must overlook their hate for one another. Due to the clashes between their mafia families, they are forced by their parents, who lead the mafias, to get into a fake relationship. This first introduction is actually pretty interesting, as we get to see two people who despise one another develop overtime. For tsundere lovers, Nisekoi will be like a jewel, and for those who despise them, you can at least try enjoying the other girl characters.\\n\\n\r\nNisekoi has a pretty decent overall story, with lots of comedy, and  is an actual anime in which you don't have to deal with every episode being a filler episode(Except season 2).\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: Shaft studios is well known for making some of the most unique, yet entertaining types of animation, as well as a magical soundtrack.  Nisekoi's art was no exception, as it contained a mix of old animation styles from previous projects, while having its own unique style. Nisekoi's art was much more bright and well, \"colorful\". But like any Shaft Studios works, there were still head tilts, so don't worry about missing out on those. The soundtrack was pretty good, as it fit the romantic comedy genre well. The OST isn't as catchy as Shaft's previous works, but that's probably because it's a romcom after all. Art is most likely Nisekoi's strongest point, and if you are looking for some good eye-candy, then Nisekoi might be just for you.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Nisekoi has many diverse characters throughout the story. There's the somewhat dense main protagonist, Raku, tsunderes Chitoge and Tsugumi, sweet and kind Onodera, and aggressive Tachibana. Nothing exactly new, just your average harem anime character cast. This is one of those \"who's best girl?\" animes, so go ahead and pick your style, but be warned, its quite obvious who'll come out on top. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Nisekoi is one of those guilt pleasure animes, for not just me, but for many others. Sure, the story wasn't really that great, characters weren't new, and the only great quality about the series was the art, but it is still one hell of an enjoyable series. Sadly, they kind of screwed up the second season. If you want, you can watch the sequel as well, but it won't be anywhere as good as the first. Overall Rating:8",

Based on my anime-watching experience, it seemed similar to some of the other anime that I\u2019ve watched and for me that made it more fun and enjoyable. However, what makes it really fun and great, is that it took the good parts about Romeo and Juliet and applied them to make it\u2019s own identity. That\u2019s just my own personal perception of what I got out of it. \r\nI thought that the characters were very well written.  To me, Chitoge shares a lot of similarities to Taiga from \u201cToradora!\u201d in how she deals with people, situations, herown emotions, but also shows her own identity as well. All the characters had me laughing and feeling all sorts of emotions based on whatever was going on - so it did an excellent job of evoking my emotions. I suppose, that I do need to include just one bad thing about the anime, and it\u2019s simply that there isn\u2019t a second season. I would very highly recommend this to anyone looking for a really good laugh and a fun experience.",

Chitoge acts like Naru, Onodera acts like a tamed version of Mutsumi-mix-haruna, then we have Tsugumi who is a loosen based on Mokoto.\\n\\n\r\nIs this a coincidence? I think not. Since its been so long since Love Hina was out and only hardcore fans remember it.\\n\r\nBut to Love-ru came out earlier than Nisekoi so that one was fresh on mind.\\n\\n\r\nWhy no one has noticed it?\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the Nisekoi prototype:\\n\r\nA one-shot story about two rival yakuza gangs whose kids were childhood friends/rivals with a slight crush on each other. Both families made a truce to marry their children for peace between the rival gangs.\\n\r\nThen after an argument of the two from a promise Rakku saves Chitoge and both declares the love for each other.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I would had liked for author to keep to this story instead of that cheap imitation of to love-ru and love hina fusion.\\n\r\nBut I do not blame the author mostly... I mostly blame the mother fucking editors who 90% of the time forces the authors to come up with this stupidity to milk a series and gain profit because its what's popular on the market.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I got enough with only one fan-service annoyance with To Love-ru I do not need another.\\n\\n\r\nIf they would had let the author continue with the original idea i would bet Nisekoi would had come up way better than it's actual finished product.\\n\\n\r\nI give Nisekoi a 6 out of 10.",

A super long promise, confession held back for days and it just feels like it's trying to stretch things out so it can last for 25 eps.\r\nArt was pretty decent nothing fancy.\r\nSound was also pretty decent but nothing fancy as well. Voice Actors for the characters were pretty good.\r\nCharacters were designed ok nice uniform mostly for females but then no tie wouldgo past the skirt.

I'm by no means a harem fan, but this is the sole exception. The reason is that one of my favorite animation studios; SHAFT, made this. I was expecting something completely dialogue-heavy with complex humor, and outright random art-style like the monogatari series, however that is not the case. First off,\r\nThe Story:Overall Rating: 8\\n\r\nThe story is by no means original. However, that doesn't make it unenjoyable. Basically, it's boy meets girl ten years ago, boy  get's a locket and girl get's key, they get separated by boy moving. The whole anime is about who gave the boy the locket and who has the key, and basically most of the girls he meets have a key and it's a mystery about who has it. One downside is that the story has little to no plot progression, but it still has more than the sequel which is basically filler. *spoiler* by the end of the anime, it's still undecided who gave the boy the locket *end spoiler* Anyway, time to go onto the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art:                                                     Overall Rating: 10\\n\r\nThe art style in this anime is simply fantastic, and I don't have any complaints about it. It's bright and cheery, and I would expect nothing less from SHAFT.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound:                                                Overall Rating: 8\\n\r\nThe opening and ending soundtrack is very enjoyable, but didn't really pop out to me in any way other than that they are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:                                                Overall Rating: 10\\n\r\nThe character designs and personalities are all really enjoyable, and they all make for some hilarious moments. Chitoge is best girl, and *spoiler* Raku realizes this in the manga *end spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:   10/10\\n\r\nI seriously enjoyed this anime. I dislike harem anime, yet this somehow made me fall in love with the series. I recommend it to everybody.\\n\\n\r\nDon't let anyone else fool you, Chitoge is best girl and everybody knows it.\\n",

            "content": "Nisekoi\r\nArt: As a rule I tend to shy away from things art styles that focus on over-the-top features, but while Niskekoi didn\u2019t have a lot of that, every single character had a unique feature that was well explained and at no point was I trying to figure out why Chitoge always has the ribbon, or why Tachibana has such long hair. Each character was more than just a change of clothes or hair but had different facial features and structures. Sure they are a bit similar but that is just keeping consistency. Another interesting thing was the architecture of the school! It was really uniqueand the intricacies really made me fall in love with the atmosphere of the show overall. If I really worked hard to try and figure out something I didn\u2019t really care for, it would probably be the blue hair of Ichijo (The male lead). In a world where the hair colors are pretty consistent, this just gave me a feeling of inconsistency. But this minuscule detail didn\u2019t stop me from absolutely loving this art. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: I found that the music was more akin to background noise at times. I felt that the introduction animations were funny and showed a lot of charm, working well with the music, but I didn\u2019t really have a problem skipping past the ending sequences. However, as the story began to progress, I feel like the music played a better role in communicating emotions that we were seeing a character portray, but the music takes it to the next step by trying to get us, the viewer, to feel the same emotion that the character is feeling. That kind of sound direction is what separates a good show from a great show. As for the sound, there wasn\u2019t much variation outside of the occasional punch or slap. It would have been nice to hear things like footsteps when it needs to be dramatic, or heavy breathing when a nervous moment comes up. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Season One- I feel like the story was really well put together in the first season. Two kids who only have just met, pushed into a relationship that is just for show, how awkward! Not only that, the main, Ichijo is in love with another girl, and because of this false relationship he can\u2019t pursue Onodera the way he wants to! Not only that he has this mysterious locket that he got 10 years prior after making a promise to someone, but he can\u2019t remember the promise or what the locket holds. It isn\u2019t super original, but the way that it is a mix of Romeo and Juliet (kind of and they even make reference to this in the show) and \u2018What\u2019s in the Locket?\u2019 creates a show that is fun to watch and easy to get invested in. I won\u2019t spoil anything, but things get pretty complicated and Ichijo has to deal with a lot of extra stuff just to keep everyone happy! Season Two - I am including season two in this review because it is largely the same in many aspects but the major difference here is there is no real defined plot, but rather the plot will vary based on the episode. We meet a few new characters and most of them go undeveloped, save for Oondera\u2019s little sister, It is a nice continuation of the story that after a single season I was hungry for more. I must say that I could see myself watching this show for a lot longer if that is the direction they choose to take, the characters are just that likable. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: I really really enjoyed this show. It didn\u2019t take long for me to fall in love with this cast and that is probably why it got so popular. I must say that for the girls that seem to really want to be with Ichijo, I root for Chitoge over all others, and I know that probably isn\u2019t the popular opinion, because Ichijo and Onodera would be so cute, or even Ichijo and Tsugumi would be fun, but I just see the main two as a better couple. As I said in my art section the architecture of the school was just so cool! The openness and the artistic fence design around the pool, I just couldn\u2019t get enough of it. Really, I wish my university would have those kind of open air buildings, however I live in the Midwestern United States and it snows all the time here so maybe not the best idea, but still! I have to say, this show really put me in a good place. I loved being able to come back to it after a long day or have a break and just watch an episode or two, and just enjoy the great story and characters. While I don\u2019t love the way it ended, and there are questions that have been left unanswered, I am only hoping for another season! Fingers Crossed. If you love shows about people that are overly caring about putting others before themselves and girls that are all eccentric and fun, you will love Nisekoi! \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 9.8/10\\n",

            "content": "Nisekoi is just one of those genres of animes that we've all seen and loved. The goofy yet lovable male lead, with various types of girls surrounding him that actually have personality, making this something of a harem, but with much more comedy and respect for women in general. It's silly and easy to watch with fun visuals. That being said, the animation it a bit limited, but that's definitely an artistic choice.\r\nOur protagonist, Ichijo, is a reliable high school boy that cooks, likes taking care of others, and is a bit shy at times, constantly being thrown into rather inconvenient situations, thanks to hisfamily (the yakuza) and the people he surrounds himself with (multiple girls and one comedic male friend). The animation style is similar to Bakemonogatari (as it is also produced by Aniplex and SHAFT), giving the overall look a simple but creative twist.\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the story. It was fairly predictable, but it's the predictability that comforts us, and in spite of that, it still made me laugh. If you want a nice light anime, this is a good choice for you. Things never get all that \"heavy\" or \"deep\" in this anime, and if you like the comedy of not simply a love triangle, but a love pentagon of sorts, then again, this could be a nice option. The series first teases you with the mystery of a locket and the key to a promise, and as the story goes on things just keep getting more and more mixed up.\\n\r\nI enjoyed the simplicity of the story. It's a nice way to wind down. Simple as that.\\n\r\nI'm also a sucker for voice actors and I absolutely loved all the voice acting in this anime. Very fun and vibrant with lots of creative shouting. Hard to explain, but there it is.\\n\r\nThe final episode to me was very...lacking. It was definitely one of those endings that just drop. No promises of a second season, and no hints as to what might happen next. It seemed more like one of the random middle episodes than a grand finale, so, be warned of that.",

            "content": "eapp2017\r\nnisekoi or in english \"false love\", an anime that is about a son of a yakuza gang is enganged to a foreign daughter of a mafia gang in order to make them keep at peace. \r\n\tThe story wasn't the main strength of this anime, it just shows the cliched dramas from childhood promises, to school and family matters, absurd mishaps and misunderstandings, which audiences wasn't expecting it to be about. In my opinion the story is quite not believable, it seems it is too much \"not natural\" at some point because of certain conditions mainly because that it this is an harem anime. Plus thestory is getting nowhere as you progess through the show it just is like that, that is the main  purpose of the show, to not emphasize the gang war but rather the daily lives of the relationships of the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\n\tTypically there is nothing really action happening in highschool romcoms so the expected art was really unexpected, the art  really impressive. the animators where just able to pull great visuals on the characters, the environment and the things that they are interacting with (eg. food). The art was very colorful and pleasant, yes they encorporate a lot of sparkly stuff and it was not that bland because other highschool animes it's not as colorful an appealing rather dark environment (eg. Say I Love You). They were able to emphasize the characters' emotions and feeling though the changing the art of the background, also the character design was spot on for each an every character. They were able to animate what they are really need to do as it says in the manga with some exaggeration (eg. jumping from the 2nd floor of the building), which for me is not a dissapointment because people always hate it when a adaptaion of a book turns into a film. Of all that in art i would give this anime a solid 10/10, from the sparkling, shimmering that the always put to make it more lively and colorful to the characters' form (eg. chibi form).    \t\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters, I loved them. Even though the story was cliched, what I like about this anime is its' characters. From the faces to the attitudes, this anime showed what it needs to show. I just love Onodera as she blushes, being flustered or just straight up being happy. I love her to the point that I keep a framed picture of her in my room. All those aside even though I hate Chitoge due to her attitude, she is just she needs to be or this show would not be Nisekoi. Every character is important for the story to progress, even though the story is getting nowhere. The side characters is also wee done even though they have a minor role in th show. The tsundere main girl? Check, the cute chilhood good girl? Check, the dense main guy? Check, that annoying friend who gets his butt kicked in every episode? Check. There is no character that is not needed in this show to make this show as funny and very lovable as it possibly as it can be. \\n\\n\r\n\tA good anime needs a  good soundtrack and nisekoi did not fail the audiences on providing that. The intro song was really flowy, very cathcy I really like on how songs to make the anime more romcom-ish rather just a normal romcom anime. The background music is superb, there was never a dead air scene and the music is really appropriate for the scene, example when Onodera greets Raku and then Raku blushes like a tomato, with all the sparkly effects, the music made the scene more loveable, enjoyable and complete. Another example, when in some cases drama shows up the music is able to amplify the feelings that the audience feel, it made it more heavier rather if there is no music. The music was great, especially the BGMs and the intro. Another thing that made the music great was the outro songs, it was unique because majority of animes the outro is just  the same all season long but in this show the song changes with a recpective character as the center of that songs and i personally like it that way so I won't skip the outro song every episode.\\n\\n\r\n\tOverall this anime for me is a different but cliched anime, very enjoyable especially for people seeking a romcom genre and really funny anime. The enjoyment factor was so high that you will watch the entire season for just one-sitting like I did and needless to say this anime is raging wars on the internet whether who is the best girl in the anime and if you want to get involve then watch this one. It's not groundbreaking or life changing but it has proven one thing: you need to defend your waifu on those people who are against her. #Nisekoi #EAPP2017 #Onodera4waifu",

The first season was the most romantic thing i've ever seen with Raku X Kosaki being so akward because they liked each other it was kinda realistic.Most anoying thing as i stated is how obvious it is that they like each other.JUST MAKE THE FUCKING MOVE RAKU YOU STUPID FAGGOT! don't make the girl do the work. Huhhh the timings in this where the worst especially the baseball going through the window when Kosaki was about to ask out Raku..it was so fustrating. My favorite and intense part was when Raku waspicking the number for the walk...IT WAS the most intense thing i ever fucking saw holy shit.I love this anime sad that the ending of the manga is so sad and disappointing for the Raku X Kosaki fans. I would really love to see the anime have two different endings a Chitoge ending and Kosaki ending instead of it just fucking coping shit of the mange.I think the anime should have some originality so people can buy it for a certain part..like the multiple endings part i mentioned.Anyway if you liked oregairu then this is the next thing for you \\n\r\n10/10",

The story should of progressed a bit more faster and the characters were just the normal anime character types. All that being said, I did enjoy the anime a lot. If you like light hearted comedies and sliceof life's then I would recommend this to you. However if you want more of a romcom I would suggest you trying it out.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: Review may contain spoilers for Season 2 and the Manga!!!\r\nIf you have a hobby of listening to \u201cintellectual\u201d people on the internet, then you\u2019ve likely picked up on the fact that tropes aren\u2019t a very popular concept among the populace. Typically, overused tropes have a habit of making stories with fascinating premises into something very predictable. They turn characters that could have been multidimensional into entities that lack any sense of growth or development. On rare occasions, however, a talented writer could take stale and overused tropes and wring more enjoyment out of them than one could even begin to comprehend. Nisekoi is afine example of this duality of trope usage, a duality of the majesty of its perfectly executed tropes and the deluge of mediocrity that it would eventually call home.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Nisekoi is probably the most important aspect of its story. The story begins with our protagonist Raku Ichijou finding out that he has to pretend to be in a fake relationship with a girl of his father\u2019s choosing. You see, Raku is the son of a yakuza boss and since his (surprisingly lax) yakuza dad isn\u2019t very good at keeping his boys from picking fights with a nearby American gang, the only rational decision is to force his son to martyr this mess back into shape. This is problematic for Raku as he already has a girl in school that he really likes (though lacks the stones to let her know his feelings and the awareness to realize that the feelings are mutual) and the girl that he has to play pretend with is a violent tsundere that hates his guts, because their first ever meeting was less than stellar.\\n\\n\r\nThis setup, however, quickly takes a backseat with the introduction of Raku\u2019s keyhole pendant which he claims he received from a girl when he was very young. He and said girl made a promise to reunite and maybe get married and be in love forever. Conveniently, Raku has no recollection of any faces or names from this event and all of the girls related to said event that turn up over the course of this series are \u201cseemingly\u201d just as clueless. And with this, the harem anime sets itself up for some \u201ctropey\u201d goodness. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason I said that the initial premise is important is because the story is essentially a near endless regurgitation of these two premises, constantly repeating itself like a broken record. This is barely noticeable in the 1st season, because of the emphasis on introducing the main characters and establishing Chitoge\u2019s feelings. As you move on to the rest of the series, however, you will find an overwhelmingly staggering amount of filler that does nothing to move the story from its standstill. Oh look, Tsugumi found another random spy device that makes her have to be close to Raku. Oh look, Tachibana found a way to rope him into spending more time with her. Oh look, it\u2019s another festival and/or another school club/event that may or may not have already happened during the previous school year. Every iteration of these moments ends up feeling longer and emptier as the show adds more auxiliary characters that it has to forcefully involve in every scene. This continues until the last few chapter of the manga, which I can only describe as dramatic, yet strangely empty. As someone whose \u201cbest girl\u201d ends up being chosen in the end, I was still left feeling very unsatisfied by the ending of this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\n\tRaku is the epitome of the bland harem protagonist. He\u2019s an extremely nice guy, willing to go above and beyond to help a stranger in need, especially if that stranger can be added into his harem afterwards. He\u2019s exceptionally average in both sports and academics so as not to overshadow any of the girls who excel, while also always being there for the girls that don\u2019t. In true shounen fashion, however, this does not stop him from breaking expectation if the plot calls for it. He has no outlandish sense of fashion that might scare the girls off, instead opting for the safe and highly sought-after school uniform/ white shirt and pants. The only things that really make him stand out are his enormous necklace and the unexplained hair clip in his messy bed hair.\\n\\n\r\n\tThough bland, Raku can actually be mistaken for an interesting and multidimensional character whenever he has to interact with Chitoge. This is because, unlike the rest of the harem cast, Raku\u2019s attitude towards Chitoge fluctuates wildly throughout the series, leaving each interaction much less predictable than with the rest of the cast. Towards the end of the series, this was the main aspect that kept me somewhat invested in his character as it\u2019s the only aspect of it that felt somewhat grounded in reality. His nice guy status begins to feel somewhat forced and unrealistic when he walks away smiling from a forced gang infiltration mission, being stranded on a deserted island, and taking on multiple mafia gangs by himself, all because of \u201cfriendship\u201d or \u201cbecause why not?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tChitoge is one of the main love interests for Raku and is introduced as the daughter of a rival gang that Raku has to appease by forming a fake relationship with her. Though Chitoge can be described as just another tsudere, I believe her to be one of the most, if not the most, developed characters in this series. Her main appeal is the very fact that she is an incredibly flawed person. Her uncertain past and problematic relationship with her family has left her to being pretty clueless as to how to interact with people. This makes her constantly waver between trying to be polite and friendly, whilst trying to keep her brash and antagonistic side from rearing its ugly head and screwing up everything for her.  Initially she can come off as extremely unlikeable, but as the series moves on and she begins to learn how to better handle her internal turmoil, she becomes better at reining in her aggressive and standoffish side. It also helps that she is one of the few girls that aren\u2019t immediately in love with the protagonist, as the events that lead her up to that revelation are actually quite humorous, jaw-dropping, and heart-warming.\\n\\n\r\n\tOnodera is the other main love interest for Raku and is introduced as a long time classmate and crush of our protagonist. Though she herself has shared this sentiment since the two were in middle school, Onodera can\u2019t confess these feelings because she suffers from an extreme form of shyness known only as Dandere. Instead she tries to slowly win over Raku with her overwhelming cuteness and sweetness, and that\u2019s an understatement. Onodera is, quite possibly, the very manifestation of sweetness. Just about every scene, in which she is prominently featured, will force a smile to creep across your face.  Unlike Chitoge, her flaws aren\u2019t offensive and aggravating, but are rather quirks that enhance her natural sweetness. She\u2019s shy, but not to the point where she can\u2019t make friends or be sociable. She\u2019s not very smart, but not to the degree that she feels like a moron who needs her hand held through everything. She can\u2019t cook, but has a hidden strength that still lets her shine and compliment Raku\u2019s mastery of the kitchen. Though she lacks any real growth or development beyond her slowly mustering up her courage over the span of way too many chapters/episodes, she is a very likeable character and easily understandable favorite for a huge chunk of the audience.\\n\\n\r\n\tThose three are the pillars upon which this show stands and I don\u2019t think it will be very \u201cspoilery\u201d to say that none of the other girls introduced throughout this series have a sliver of a chance at coming out on top against those two archetypal behemoths. Regardless, I will very briefly run through who they are and my opinion of them. \\n\\n\r\nTsugumi is Chitoge\u2019s bodyguard and is initially introduced as a double agent with the mission to uncover the falsehood of her relationship with Raku. Though she develops feelings for the boy in time, she does her best to cast them aside and aid Chitoge in her ventures. The conflicting nature of her personal and professional position was an interesting idea, but the series does nothing with it that is of note. She herself, while fine and likeable, is very predictable and this gets rather repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana is quite possibly the worst character in the series and the first nail in the coffin that is Nisekoi. She is extremely aggressive with her pursuit of Raku, often forcing herself into scenes seemingly out of nowhere as she screams \u201cRakuuuu-samaaaa!!!!!!\u201d She is loud, obnoxious, needy, rude, and thirsty as hell. The show tries to make her likeable by making her suddenly turn shy when her cringe worthy tactics actually work (because that makes sense) and by being extremely sickly and frail in every other scene, but the above. It\u2019s a cheap attempt at forcing the audience to care about such a repulsive character and it only gets worse the further you go.\\n\\n\r\nHaru is the little sister character and spends the vast majority of the series being very misguided about her choices in love. Yui is the older sister character and spends her short time with the series being very overconfident about her capabilities and very oblivious of her impending rejection. Both are introduced to seemingly draw out the length of this series as I honestly can\u2019t think of any ways that these characters contributed to the story. Technically Haru helps Onodera with her pursuit of Raku, but technically Ruri already does that. Technically Yui holds a piece of information about Raku\u2019s past, but technically so does Tachibana, his dad, and seemingly every other adult in this universe. Gutting these two characters would have done wonders for the pacing of this series, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some reoccurring side characters that appear throughout the series, but the only ones worth even mentioning are the best friends of Raku and Onodera, Maiko and Ruri respectively. Maiko is a lovable goofball/pervert with a secret and \u201cmature\u201d passion, as well as a heart of gold. Ruri is the no nonsense smart girl with a penchant for comedically-timed death stares. Both are fairly entertaining characters that get a little arc dedicated to each of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\n\tDespite the harshness with which I\u2019ve approached the series, I do absolutely adore the 1st season of it. The best that Nisekoi has to offer to its viewers is frontloaded into that first quarter of the story. That, combined with Shaft\u2019s general style of producing anime, results in an absolute treat for anyone willing to just have fun and not think or expect too much. The same can be said for the 2nd season as well, though to a lesser extent as that is where the filler starts to crop up. It is, at least, worth watching if you\u2019ve enjoyed the 1st season.\\n\\n\r\nIf after all of that, you are still interested in seeing the story through, I highly recommend looking up the online chart that tells you which chapters of the manga can be skipped. There will be a lot of questionable content in the manga even without the filler, but I imagine that it will be much less painful of an experience. That said, it should be clear who the \u201cwinner\u201d is going to be by the end of the 1st season and the finale isn\u2019t particularly stimulating, so skipping the manga altogether is a plausible decision as well. For me, the manga was a massive disappointment of mind-numbingly boring proportions and I can\u2019t stress enough the caution with which one should approach it.\\n",

I know that Nisekoi has a large following on this site but just know in advance that my opinions of this piece do not represent a particular active dislike of this anime or it's fans, just why it isn't for me and why like-minded people may not enjoy it.\r\nLet me start off with the good things about it: It has a very nice art style and sound design and I can tell a lot of work went in to make this aesthetically pleasing, however, this is about the extent ofmy enjoyment of this particular anime. I will say however that the art is of very, very  high quality and is amazing if you're someone who enjoys anime which are very colorful and have an atypical art style.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with Nisekoi is that the main character is incredibly unintelligent, to the point where it was sometimes painful to watch him make such poor choices and ignore such obvious answers to his own inquiry. If you are the kind of person who finds themselves yelling at their screen when characters ignore the obvious or make unfounded conclusions then Nisekoi will probably damage your vocal chords.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Nisekoi is neither here nor there when it comes to quality. It's a story that's been done before a million times, and unless you like the specific type of story being presented it might be worth passing on this one, because the characters just weren't memorable for me. They fit archetypes that have been done before and you can pretty much predict their lines in advance if you've seen a lot of comedies or harem anime.  Nobody really \"stood out\" to me and no scenes stood out as particularly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind the above and just want another comedic harem anime then you may enjoy this. I just didn't find myself able to get invested in it at all and often times it lost my attention completely.",

Surely it is a harem, but two of the four protagonists are almost always in the background, to complete the scene or to make more or less serious interludes. And this is what I love, a well-defined triangle in which feelings are clear, but at the same time evolving. The protagonist is not the usual stupid that do not understand anything, but it's the perfect mix of innocence and romance that makes nisekoi an absolute gem.Onodera, Kirisaki and Tachibana are fantastic, I still can not decide who to root for. Speaking of drawings, personally I find them really well done. Excellent soundtrack, but the closing theme songs, are exceptional. I see no reason not to laugh and get excited with Nisekoi. Highly Recommended.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n168/5000\\n",

            "content": "Bobduh (certain narrative connoisseur) dropped it right away and claims the writing is crap, so just to get that out of the way. Now for my take on it (and hell if I'm not bigger expert than him in this particular subgenre!). What's great about this? Visual design of characters and especially their expressions, the background art which has just the right amount of shaft added to it, the Shinbo direction, and hence the perfect pacing and punctual humor. Seriously, I laughed out loud pretty much every single episode, often multiple times per episode. So this can get compared with shows such as Sakurasou orToradora, as it's a rom com with one guy and 2+ girls. So harem undertone, while not really being a harem. Except Nisekoi later departs from that and falls more in line with general harems. \\n\\n\r\nBut unlike mentioned, Nisekoi focuses on the comedy element, while downplaying drama and romance. That's not to say drama and romance aren't there or important, it's just that it's more about humor instead. And I think it even uses that to justify it's lack of progress and bad writing in romance and drama departments. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for a time it's all good, it's really funny and you just keep counting how many times drama and romance got thrown under a bus to maintain the status quo while covering it up with humor and just a little bit of perceived progression. And in the first half, it really feels like there is progression, even though for every two steps forward we keep taking one step back and then also sidetracking for a bit. In the second half however, the amount of time some random shit excuses the progression just to maintain status quo just gets old and no longer something that's easily forgivable. \\n\\n\r\nManga is still ongoing so at least saying this isn't technically a spoiler: Writing feels biased towards a particular girl, and if that's the girl you're cheering on, and you're just here for some humor, pretty visuals and emotional fanservice, then more power to you, and you'll probably love this show if you aren't bothered by cheesy writing. It might make you realise how good Sakurasou actually is when it comes to actually having themes and drama! Bashing continues in spoilers section: \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD:\\n\\n\r\nThis show is written completely in favor of Chitoge. Most of the moments shared between Onodera and Raku come about from Onodera mustering up her courage to ask him for something, and there isn't any conflict to build chemistry from. Instead there's a lot of romantic tension which gets misinterpreted because they're not supposed to like each other. On the other hand, whenever there's a crisis, Raku always resolves it by dashing to Chitoge. All his agency is directed towards showing Chitoge that he cares. Raku and Onodera will never have any chance to have a genuine emotional connection, while Chitoge get generous helpings every episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhat bothers me most is I know how it's gonna end and there's no suspense. The show is basically: watch as we tease Onodera and slowly ruin her dreams of ever being with Raku, while Chitoge achingly slowly learns to be honest with herself. And that becomes more and more apparent as the show goes on, making me as an Onodera fan, more and more unable to enjoy the show at all, even though I found the first 5 or so episodes supremely entertaining, and whole first half generally quite enjoyable. By the time of last two episodes, I found it borderline unwatchable. I don't think I'll be picking up the sequel in any form. The way show is now treating Onodera is just too painful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEdit: I bumped this up to 7 and picked up the second season. Yes ladies and gentlemen you just witnessed someone on the internet change their mind. It comes down to expectations really. Once you make peace with this being an eternal tease where nothing ever progresses, it's possible to detach from romantic drama and enjoy it for its humor, craziness and cute girls, where it excels!",

            "content": "Nisekoi, a story about how Shaft can continually deliver an experience that proves production value is not an issue when you want to deliver something absolutely magnificent.\r\nWell if you're reading this review, you should know what the show is about based off of the official synopsis.\r\nStory: The show doesn't deliver a breath-taking or exhilarating story that'll change your mind about the main theme. That being said, it does what it has set out to do- Be a romantic comedy. It doesn't overstep its bounds or tries to be a uniquely themed romcom. This is where it stands strong enough to appeal to the general audiencewith the tease of each girl and the antics that ensue with each singular arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt: What can I say? If you're a Shaft fan or if you've read the original source, you'd know what to expect based off of the original art style that works in tandem with Shaft iconic landmark animation. If anything, this is definitely the strongest part of the show if not the signature Shaft head tilts.\\n\\n\r\nSound: From packing a load of silly sound effects with each episode to the catchy and very appropriate soundtrack to the unbelievably popular openings done by ClariS who also sang the openings for Madoka Magica, it's no wonder why Nisekoi in the sound department did not disappoint. While it isn't on Kill la Kill or Attack on Titan level of awesome, this anime delivers plenty enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each character has been built with a quite noticeable stereotype. This is probably the weakest part of the show because most characters do not break out of their own shell. The other side of the coin is none of the main characters ever shy away from screen time and the side characters are not one bit forgettable. All around the cast of characters is small enough for the show to concentrate on and not have to worry about who gets the limelight.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Honestly, this show is one to be watched more than once for its divine comedy. You give Shaft a show like this and they can really execute how the show is done. Between the fan service and the romance, all characters despite their cliche upbringings, bring a level of excitement and seriousness that ultimately balances out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Given how well this show has done and the fact that this isn't the perfect show, it delivers on a level that has got me saying- \"This is a must watch.\" Between the fabulous voice acting of all the memorable voice actors and their quirky personality and unique art style that carried the show, it is enough to earn a overall score of 9/10.",

            "content": "My anime Review of: Nisekoi! (Note: this is my first time reviewing so if I missed anything important, I apologize in advance)\r\nStory-5.7\r\nIt\u2019s just simple! 2 Families are fighting! In order to Stop it, the son/daughter of the 2 Gangs have to fake dating each other! Hence the title \u201cNisekoi\u201d. But there\u2019s one catch. They don\u2019t like each other! Thus the beginning of a generic Rom-Com anime! Seriously? They have to fake date each other in order to stop the fighting? There are more EASIER ways to solve that! The 2 Boss of the gangs don\u2019t want to fight but their men hate each other thatmuch that they don\u2019t obey their boss? Really? And the only way to solve this is for the son/daughter of the 2 boss has to be in a fake relationship? That Totally Makes Sense. And about the key thing. I think it\u2019s just an excuse for the harem to happen.But they did one thing in the story right. The Phasing. The Phasing of this anime is well executed. And I like when instead of making it 23 or a 24 episode anime, they made it 20 instead. They knew that they couldn\u2019t Prolong the Anime more because they might fuck shit up. That or Shaft just got tired animating it. Other than that, I really have nothing to say anymore.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8\\n\r\nYes! Another Dense Main Character! Well, he isn\u2019t really that dense but\u2026\u2026 Another Dense Main Character! Moving on. The characters are really likeable. Although they\u2019re all a little bit generic. Just a little bit. All of the characters\u2019  development is\u2026.. meh. By far the weakest one is Marika. She has little screen time and development. I wish we could\u2019ve explored her a bit more. I got to give props for the supporting characters. They did a great job. How about Raku and Chitoge you ask? The Main Protagonist and the Main Female Lead? No DOUBT, ONE OF THE BEST anime couples I have ever seen. Their chemistry is just so good. TeamChitoge All the way!. The characters were the key factor to this anime. Good job Characters\\n\\n\r\nMusic-7.5\\n\r\nThe openings are the type of \u201cIt\u2019s good but nothing more\u201d. How about the ending songs? Man, they have a lot of ending songs. My personal favorite one is Recover Decoration because Bitch it\u2019s KAWAII. They all have different ending songs for different characters. And I really have to give Shaft props for the Animation. The using of different bright colors and shapes. It\u2019s just amazing. The soundtrack are good. Nothing much to say. Over all, the music in this anime is Good. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-8.5\\n\r\nAs you have may known, This was animated by Shaft. And Shaft has never ceased to disappoint me. Not until Mekaku City Actors came along. The animation was gorgeous. Using of different styles and colorings. It\u2019s just wonderful to the eyes. The animation itself is fairly average compared to the animes this time year. But they style is what it makes it beautiful. And off course, It\u2019s not shaft if there\u2019s no Legendary Head Tilt.   \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment-9\\n\r\nI Enjoyed The Fuck out of Nisekoi When it was in its first weeks. I stopped it because I got bored of it. After watching it again and finishing it. I still enjoyed it.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score-7.74\\n\r\nIt is not something amazing. In the end it is just another Romance, Comedy, Harem anime. And what does romance, comedy, harem anime does best? Is to make your day happy (And in some cases, make you have a boner) And I couldn't wish for anything better   \\n",

            "content": "Nisekoi is a twenty episode anime centred on the life of Raku Ichijo who is the son of a Mafia leader. Due to tensions between a rival gang Raku is forced to stage a relationship with the opposing Mafia leaders\u2019 daughter Chitoge Kirisaki. Thus begins the awkward fa\u00e7ade whilst he pursues his actual crush Kosaki Onodera, deals with Chitoge\u2019s overly violent and love stricken bodyguard Seishiro Tsugumi and the forced fianc\u00e9 Marika Tachibana.\r\nI initially started to watch this show upon its release back in January 2014. I had decided to put this on hold after being less than impressed with it due to the TsundereChitoge who was a consistent thorn in my side up until episode six. Come the end of the show, Chitoge was still a major hindrance rendering the show further un-enjoyable for me. The main protagonist certainly didn't help matters with his obliviousness to realize that Onodera has feelings for him.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Raku Ichijo the son of a Mafia leader who enjoys his normal high school life despite his unusual upbringings around many gang members. On the way to school he is kicked in the face by a blonde transfer student Chitoge Kirisaki who would later in turn be forced into a fake relationship with Raku in order to stop the violence between the two gangs much to both parties dismay.\\n\\n\r\nThe two then go about putting on a front for the rest of the series in front of the gang members and school students alike.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is frankly not great. Throwing the two into a no win situation where they have to be together for lengthy periods of time when they don\u2019t necessarily get along makes for bad comedy at times. Chitoge\u2019s Tsundere act is quite annoying as she only throws anger at the direction of Raku despite his efforts to be nice and help her out on multiple occasions. Other comedy elements stem from misunderstandings which is horribly distasteful and the best friend Shu Maiko who does well on his part for the show being the most rational yet comedic trouble maker.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nRaku Ichijo is your standard guy. He just wants to live peacefully without the hassle of Mafia breathing down on him. He has a long time crush on Onodera which is sweet and all, but his inability to realize that Onodera has feeling for him infuriates me. I remember at the beginning when Raku didn't notice a substantial clue about his childhood sweetheart which was so blatantly obvious that I questioned how he can be so completely oblivious to the matter. I hate how he cannot make up his mind as to which girl he is in love with. Raku states Onodera, but his relationship progression with others would just tell you he is indecisive.\\n\\n\r\nChitoge Kirisaki is the main lead who in general can be a bitch at times. Coming back from America Chitoge is introduced and initially struggles to read Kanji amongst having a hard time making friends. Despite Raku\u2019s dislike of her he does his utmost to help her study and make friends. Chitoge does have her moments of kindness, but it is usually thwarted by her embarrassment to admit she is wrong or thank Raku for his help. I personally wouldn't root for her in pursuit of Raku.\\n\\n\r\nKosaki Onodera is our second competitor for Raku\u2019s heart. Onodera is a sweet and very shy girl and close friend to Raku. She has a hard time putting her feelings out towards Raku which is difficult to understand as it is painfully obvious to see. I like when she and Raku spend time together as it is very awkward but sweet to watch. The episode in which they are together at Onodera\u2019s shop is a nice bonding episode, but in all fails to amount to any substantial development in their relationship, its as if they are as they started.\\n\\n\r\nOther mentionable characters include the comedic and perverted best friend Shu Maiko who seems to be one of few people who knows what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. Next is Seishiro Tsugumi who is a violent bodyguard for Chitoge, who can have her cute side. Lastly is Marika Tachibana the elegant lady who reformed her strange accent in order to be Raku\u2019s ideal girl.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was well done; it had a good variety of colour and lighting which made it good to look at. The character designs were nothing spectacular just clean cut, cute girls. Animation was ok I hate when it uses the clich\u00e9 tropes such as blushing faces and drastic change in the characters designs to fit comedic and awkward situations in this scenario I wasn't pleased.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe few soundtracks that I managed to find on-line were very decent actually and a little quirky, much better off accommodated in a more comedic anime. The use of guitar and piano was very good. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nOverall I had a hard time with this show. It sums up why I dropped it in the first place. While the show has its moments with comedy and a fraction of development with Raku and the females, ultimately it fails to justify the lengthy time spent watching it. This is the sort of show you shout at the protagonist to make up his mind, becoming much more commonplace these days.\\n\\n\r\nIf you hate rom-coms with little to no progress I suggest you steer clear. No characters are worth sticking around for and no episodes really stuck out to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Nisekoi a low 6 out of 10 \\n\\n\r\nI suggest giving it four episodes to see if it sways you.\\n\\n\r\nAlternate recommendation is Highschool DxD a harem with an indecisive main character, but this centres around supernatural circumstances.",

            "content": "When you promised to your childhood sweetheart that you don't clearly remember that you'll marry each other someday by unlocking a locket, will you still fulfill it even if you are in a relationship? How about a fake relationship?\r\nNisekoi or False Love is just another cliche animes right there. Its all about promises, girls that are involve to a guy's harem, the guy being oblivious to his crush's feelings for him and fake relationship. What can you expect? Raku Ichijou, a yakuza's father son is forced to have relationship to a rival gang's daughter, Chitoge Kirisaki to avoid war between the two for 3 years.They have this 'hate at first sight' relationship. How can they manage their relationship if his classmate-ex-crush Kosaki Onodera (who likes him too but can't manage to confess her feelings for him) is aware to their relationship? What if everyone finds that out? And what if there would be intruders to their relationship?\\n\\n\r\nJust because this anime is cliche doesn't means that I don't like it. For a romantic comedy anime, SHAFT managed this one. Who remembers Bean Sprout and Gorilla?  Shaft did a great job to this one and their phenomenal head tilts are here. If you want rom-com shows, give this one a try. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOh what can I say about the art? Fantastic! The animation is vivid and colorful with a taste of slow motion techniques in some scenes. Like what I said, thank you Shaft for animating this one, although it was surprising, you didn't disappoint me. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds. The OST's are decent and both OP and ED are great. The two Openings (CLICK and STEP) by ClariS are both and very suitable for the series and the ending themes, I personally liked Heart Pattern (by Nao Touyama a.k.a Chitoge) and Hanagonomi (by Kana Asumi a.k.a Marika Tachibana) the other two are also good too, its a pleasure to hear them all.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, I thought that Kana Hanazawa did a great job for voicing Onodera. Also, Nao Touyama delivered well Chitoge's tsun-tsun personality and Kana Asumi for Marika's sweet but scary voice. I can't remember clearly Raku and Tsugumi's voice and others but they did a great job and one that stood out in my ears is Yuki Kaji in his pervert role (again) to Shu Maiko. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters didn't developed that well in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nRaku Ichijou. Always expect to a harem show that the main guy is dense and true indeed to this guy. He may be a jerk often times but he is a jerk with a heart of gold.\\n\\n\r\nChitoge Kirisaki. Many male viewers hate her for her tsundere personality but the truth is she is just a innocent girl that doesn't know a lot of things about love and she just express her feelings in a violent way. She had the biggest character development throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nKosaki Onodera. Completely opposite of Chitoge as many male viewers find her cute and charming. She is just like Raku that is oblivious to his feelings for her but somehow she's a girl that will inspire you.\\n\\n\r\nTsugumi Seishirou. Another tsundere character that is in denial to her true feelings. Because her appearance is becoming lesser as the shows goes by, her development is weak.\\n\\n\r\nMarika Tachibana. Your sweet and classic girl that is expressive to her feelings but the truth is she is fragile and scary inside. But still, you will like her. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot though the characters didn't had the development that I wanted and also, this may be irrelevant to the story but the Paper Plane in the OP sequence... I remembered its manga's one-shot story. Just sayin'\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nisekoi is focused on how relationship grows and how you relate your self by the characters here. If you noticed grammar mistakes here, just let met know because I can't calm when I'm typing this. Anyways, again if you love romantic comedy animes that is wrapped in an harem anime, give this one a shot, because the episodes will sure surprise you. 8/10",

However, if none of that turned you away, you are in for an amazing show.\r\nThe art style is great, leaving little to be desired. It almost never uses repeat animations, however, it makes use of comedic 'fancy backgrounds', which have nothing to dowith where the character is.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a professional, however, I would say the audio is well above average. The voice actors are great, and the music is good. There are plenty of sound effects, most of which are used to comedic effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is great, having a deeper than normal backstory. There are few if any backstory scenes however. The characters start off simple, however, as the show continues, you constantly learn new things about them, as well as strengthen your understanding of them.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment was shattered (refer to paragraph 1). I did not expect the love triangle to be very strong, however, as the story progressed, my enjoyment level crashed as well as hit an all time high. I am not sure how to describe this, as I hate love triangles. However, if I should say one thing, it is not a show you can stop watching easily.",

            "content": "Nisekoi;False Love\r\nStory: In all honestly. There are plenty of pros and cons about the story line. Truly, its a good thing though. The story is something that you don't see often. Yes you see a lot of anime with people having a childhood friend(s) and sometimes they dont remember them, or they fall in love with them. But, Nisekoi is a bit different. The story was given spunk and excitement to it. They made the childhood friend a total mystery, and keeps you guessing on who was the person Raku made the promise to. The story's suspense keeps on increasing more and more and keepsyou wondering where the romance and everything else is headed. I gave it an 8/10. Reason is, some certain things in the story get kinda cliche, but overall, they did a good job on making sure its something fresh. The episodes aren't rushed, they go at a smooth pace, and its easy to understand what going on. The plot keeps getting better and better and after reading the manga, for people who are watching the anime, get ready to be surprised. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I give the art 9/10 because honestly, if you pay attention to how the mouths move, or how all the background or foreground art is, even the characters and everything else itself, its really good. I love the way they have been drawn, the feeling is so HD like. Also looks well done. It might just be my opinion but, anime in 2013-2014 has really gotten so much better since better technology is here for people to draw with. I think that this anime was drawn extremely well though, even down to the littlest detail. I might be over exaggerating, but I just really like it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I really love the music in the anime, and I have to say my favorite is when whenever Raku and Chitoge are doing their little play when pretending to be dating, the music that comes on for those parts is perfect. It makes you laugh with the scene that just happened, and it gives a good feeling to it. The OP to the anime is amazingly done too. The art is fantastic, but the song is also very good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The voices for each of the characters fits well in my opinion. In my head while reading the manga, I thought Raku's voice would be just a bit deeper, and same with Chitoge, but there voices are pretty damn close to what I would of thought. As for Kosaki, her voice is very girly, just what I would of thought. I think they did a good job. The characters themselves can be so funny, cute, serious, and great. I would have to say that their looks fit their personality great as well!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I honestly love romance/comedy/highschool animes/mangas. I dont know why, but I do. This is one of my favorites by far. Its hard for an anime to get me attached to it, but this one did a great job. I just keep reading the manga until the next episode comes out, and I just read the most recent issue that came out. So yeah, Im pretty well hooked. This does a good job with making you want to know whats going on, who is Raku gonna end up with, where is the story gonna head to. Its weird, but addicting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. I seriously love this anime, I think a lot of people will like it once the story gets deeper. The beginning is sort of slow, but its still good. I wouldnt give it any higher than a nine.. for now. Although my review makes me seem just an obsessive person. Remember, although it has a lot of my opinions in it, and a lot of you wont agree, but I hope a lot of you will give it the chance, and hopefully some of you will like it as much as I do. The story is original, the characters are original, and it's funny, cute, and addicting. Now that I feel lame, I hope there will be next season of this anime..",

            "content": "I really wish 0.5 scores were a thing, then this could be at least a 6.5. Sadly, it's not.\r\nGoing over the rating criteria now based on season 1 of the anime ONLY --\r\nStory:\r\nThe summary's premise makes this seem good. Then I checked it out and found out it's just another romance tale where the love interests pretty much get nowhere for the whole duration of the show for whatever contrived reason. I don't mind this so much if there's another, more otherworldly plot going on to sort of fill in for the slow romance advancement, but there isn't really. You're just left with the painfullyobvious conclusion by several episodes in who will be winning the love triangle. About 70% of the episodes in, they introduce a third love interest but let's be honest here, given the late introduction and the fact that one of the first two girls were already written to eventually win (probably with some time skip typical to purely romance plots in the manga), the third love interest served to do nothing more than pad the artificial tension with annoyingly clingy gimmicks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nGiven the way the main plot failed for this anime, the characters really would be the only thing that could still bump this anime's enjoyment up. Sadly, they failed. Kosaki is a stereotypical anime shy girl. Chitoge is effectively a classic tsundere with the belligerent sexual tension so belligerent that it fails to appeal. Kosaki's friend served as an annoyance to try to undo the painfully thick romance-plot armor of Chitoge. Marika is basically the trope that jumps in as an aggressive romantic rival doomed to fail by the makers of the show. The worst part is the fact that almost everyone involved in the promise ten years ago seems to have amnesia but there's no explanation for it. At least if all characters involved were blind as children or something, it would be easy to believe why all of them forgot what each other looked like. But no.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe best part of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMeh. Nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nSince there's no in-universe concerts or anything to enjoy, and the visuals are only good for it's genre but can't compare to more sleek titles like Fate Zero, there's really only the story and characters to consider for this show. And both of that is pretty mediocre. The overly frequent exaggerated faces of the cast made it harder to enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nWho's this for:\\n\r\n-Shoujo fans (who haven't seen *gasp* Ouran, Maid-sama, etc)\\n\r\n-Slice of Life fans\\n\r\n-Someone looking for something reeeeeally light-hearted, not even trying to have the humor make sense \\n\\n\r\nWho's this not for:\\n\r\n-Someone who wants an epic or emotional story\\n\r\n-Someone who wants a work with unique concepts or at least rare romantic tropes\\n\r\n-Someone who wants something serious",

            "content": "So Nisekoi is a typical high harem rom com where a guy and a girl who don\u2019t like each other have to pretend to be a couple for reasons beyond their control. Now I know there\u2019s not a lot to expect from a show like this but it worked. The funniest moments were when Raku and Kirisaki answered honestly when they are suppose to be convincing others they\u2019re a couple. Also I loathe unrequited love in anime (JUST TELL THEM HOW YOU FEEL!!!) but I liked how they put a tangible obstacle between Raku and Onodera. The characters are diverse and deep enough to bemore than just their primary archetype. The humor was well timed and relevant to the situations at hand. The background art was fantastic! Which I mention because most comedies skimp on the backgrounds. Even when the show is being ridiculous and over the top it doesn\u2019t feel out of place given the improbable scenario. I enjoyed this series far more than I ever expected.\\n",

            "content": "*This review contains no spoilers*\r\nI have been putting off on this anime for years, and I finally got the time to cram all of the episodes. I have to say, this is a rather... unique anime. It is one of the better romance animes while still being unoriginal. It bears many resemblances to other anime but overall provides an enjoyable romantic comedy experience.\r\nStory: 5\r\nNo doubt here that this is definitely the weakest point of this anime. The story uses many cliches, including:\r\n-Childhood Promise\r\n-Harem of girls\r\n-The main girl being a blonde half-Japanese\r\n-Shy girl in harem with a \"partner\" who pushes them into awkward situations\r\nThe list goeson and on... But somehow this anime manages to make these cliches into a uniquely enjoyable anime experience.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The art looks beautiful, as expected from a modern anime from a relatively popular company. The art resembles a more rounded version of Bakemonogatari. In fact, much of the anime resembles Bakemonogatari in a way except for the story. The video cuts are similar to Bakemonogatari and the romances of the 2 main characters resemble each other. Still, it is a lovely art style that is to be expected. I have to admit, it was very heartwarming watching the emotional evolution of Chitoge and Raku.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nVery well designed soundtrack. if nothing else, this soundtrack is a very appealing one that shoudl nake any consider this anime as an option. The openings and endings are catchy (still resembling the style of Bakemonogatari), and the sad music really immerses you into this fictional world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well-designed, except for the fact that they aren't very unique. The characters still very much resemble the characters from Bakemonogatari (except for maybe one but revealing who that is would be a spoiler). In fact, the name Onodera Kosaki resembles a name from Bakemonogatari. The characters are funny, though, and they really do make this into an enjoyable experience. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely what pulls this anime through is its enjoyment. This is not much of an extreme ride, but it is very enjoyable, and the gradual realizations and relevations throughout the story make this one of the best and most suspenseful, but also one of teh most relaxing anime of the recent years.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this anime to anyone looking for a good rom-com anime, or a good relaxing anime. I enjoyed it a lot.\\n\\n\r\n(BTW would definitely recomment listening to CLICK and STEP by ClariS, as well as Recover Decoration by Kana Hanazawa, because they are really relaxing catchy songs that are fun to sing along to.)",

Yeah it does have many clich\u00e9s, but it never seems negative. I liked how they balance comedy and romance not sticking to any side too much. I think I could enjoy every single scene in this anime, nothing seemed out of a place.\r\nCharacters are super adorable. Change of their attitude is easily noticeable throughout theseries. It makes you empathize them.\\n\\n\r\nArt is beautiful. Scenes are put at the right angles and distance.

Also I am going to focus more on the positive side of the anime and try not to say anything bad about it lol XD\r\nTo me, Nisekoi is an awesome anime. But, for now, let's get straight into the main review and try not to talk too much irrelevant stuff.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nSo first of all, the story of course. The story is AMAZING, it's easy to understand and also very interesting. I never saw an anime that has this kind of storybefore. Because in every episode there will be always different stuff happening, but sometimes they will talk about what happened on the last episode. Well, I always wanted Chitoge to not act like a fake couple with Raku instead they are couples for REAL!! XDD Also, I was thinking, can't you guys make a story about Raku's harem or something?\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThis one is interesting. Art. Which can also mean animations. The animations/art for Nisekoi is AMAZING! The characters are cute, beautiful and also CUTE! Even the second into for Nisekoi encouraged me to try and invent new stuff on Adobe After Effects. Anyways, back to the review, sometimes the characters movements are realistic, now for an example, and remember, this didn't happen in Nisekoi and its just my imagination. - Onedera said to \"Fake Couple\":\"Ichijo-kun, Kirisaki-san, did you guys made any progress? Like kissing?\", then the \" Fake Couple\" spits, and the animation on how the character looks like, how it poses, are perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nOK, OK, sounds. Don't think of other stuff. Anyways, the sound effects are awesome! The songs they chose are perfect too. Also, I can tell that the people who works on the sound effects did change some stuff in songs that are used as the intro songs. Anyways the sound effects are great, it because that it sounds so real, like it wasn't made with computer software or something.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters are GREAT, I can even describe the characters on one word! It's CUTE! To me, Onedera's face looks a bit weird and Chitoge's face looks nice to me and yeah! To prevent spoilers, I don't wanna continue talking about people faces XD. Anyways, the characters' attitude are great. Example, Chitoge, she might be very violent, gorilla-like, but actually she has some good points too! XD\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nWhy 10/10? It's because of the comedies they make. It's funny and enjoyable. Sometimes I replay some funny scenes in every episode! What makes me love Nisekoi is because of the romance comedy! XDXD\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime is awesome!! I recommend everyone to watch it if you haven't watch it yet! It's not rated R but it's PG13! I also watch every To Love-Ru seasons! So if you guys like animes with Comedy and Romance, be sure up watch it!\\n\\n\r\nTHANK YOU EVERYONE FOR READING MY REVIEW! Be sure to check out my YouTube channel!

Nisekoi is a very fun, light, and heartwarming anime that should he watched with this in mind, as the show verges off into a visual novel type of plot latet in the story, something I didn't really care for. Overall I'd say Nisekoi's strongest points are it's art style and character development around the 3 maincharacters, and aside from these two things the show doesn't really offer much else. The story leaves a bunch of plotholes laying around which aren't ever really answered and the ending was one of those ending that allows for a second season but as a result is rather unsatisfying. \\n\\n\r\nHowever despite the shows flaws the show had me completely enticed with it from the first 5 minutes and had me smiling or laughing the entire time. this show is definetly something you should give a shot and is one of my personal favorite slice of lives.",

            "content": "Nisekoi anime was created by SHAFT.  Nisekoi is an adaptation of the manga with the same name, the series is still on-going, and I already caught up to date with the recent chapter.  I been pump for the anime to come out when they announced it, because I love Nisekoi One-shot, and I think the first part of the manga series was decent, until the introduced harem into the series.  So no matter, I'm going to watch it.  There are 20 episode in the anime.  And 1 OVA releasing soon.  This is a full review of the 20-episode.\r\nStory: 7\r\nNothingmagnificent about the story, a lot of cliche and Rom-Com aspect.  The story so far is Raku Ichijou(MC), a son of a Yakuza faction, made a promise the girl that he can't remember her face, but he remember the promise, and if they reunited they get married; all the got out of it was the locket the girl gave him and the promise.  Fast forward to future, Raku is now in High school, and he still think about the promise.  When a transfer student named Chitoge Kirisaki, knee him in the face by accident; both of them are forced the find the locket, and they stared to hate each other when they are finding the locket, they did find the locket btw.  After Raku return home, he is found out that there was war between Yakuza faction and the beehive.  To end the war Raku and the Beehive daughter must date for three years.  The Beehive daughter is none of other than Chitoge Kirisaki.  The story is somewhat similar to Love Hina.  I think the story was okay in Nisekoi, but I like the story for the one-shot better than the manga series, because Manga series introduce annoying harem and character.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is was great in the anime.  SHAFT know how to make good animation.  SHAFT is know to for series like Monogatari and Puella Magi Madoka Magica.  But it nothing special about it; it not like Shaft is like Kyoto Animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nClariS, the singers behind Oriemo, made to Opening music for Nisekoi.  I will admit I like the Opening Music because I like ClariS, and Ending music is pretty decent.  The voice actor are good at what they do.  Nothing impressive of the sound.  Sound usual to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nNothing special about the character.  Mostly the same as every harem anime out there.  There character, most all, are childhood friend(We found out later in the anime).   Raku Ichijou just an average character, he is like an average male manga harem character.  There are three main girl - Chitoge, Onodera, and Marika.  Chitoge is daughter of the Beehive leader and Raku fake girlfriend, who happen to be a tsundere.  Onodera, she is Raku crush, and she happen to like him back, but both is too afraid to confess to each other, she is worst part of the anime.  Marika, she is the police chief daughter, and she obsessed with Raku, and she is his fiancee by Police chief and Raku father(who he forgotten about).  The minor character are Tsugumi, she is Chitoge friend, and she is working for the Beehive to protect Chitoge, and also a tsundere.  Shuu, Raku best friend.  Ruri, Onodera best friend, she tried to get Onodera to confess to Raku.  The worst part of this anime is the harem aspect and annoying character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nAlthough I know what going happen in the series; I did enjoy some part to the anime, mostly the Chitoge and Raku parts.  I like the opening and ending music.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThe anime wasn't godly or anything.  It was an average anime show, that people will enjoy...maybe, if you are into Rom-Com harem with little mystery.  The worst part of the anime is the harem and the annoying character.",

            "content": "If you have ever wondered what it feels like a harem king in your life, this is the anime will show you. The story is very likeable to some people while others will bash for it. The characters are well developed. In terms of romance, well you have to decide which team will you bet till the end of the story. No ecchi, no sexual jokes  little fanservice perfect for watching while the door is unlocked. The comedy is hilarious and intense (watch this to get the meaning of intense).\r\nThe author did a marvelous job in making this funny story. Seriously, been laughing sohard from beginning to end ( I finished the manga a while back). The best anime harem genre today for me. It is included in my top 10 favorite series of all time.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 pls come soon. I know who won the heart of the boy protagonist so read the manga ASAP after you finished both seasons. \\n\\n\r\n#TeamKosakiOnodera\\n",

            "content": "I know many love this anime , so I watched it suspecting it to be amazing I was disappointed  \r\nI'm gonna start with the things I liked , The relationship between Chitoge and Raku was very interesting and fun to watch  . I wish the should have  anime focused more over their relationship than shoving more not needed characters to the mix . One of the only reasons I kept watching was because of this spice that was Raku and Chitoge had . \r\nNow I have many issues with the show , the biggest issue was how the show shoved not neededcharacters . The show could be so much better if it focused on Raku , Chitoge and Onodera . \\n\r\nI feel the show would be better as a love triangle than a harrem , because tsugumi and tachibana were just side characters with no purpose . Another thing I didn't like was how two characters are having a emotional and serious conversation and suddenly a character pops up and ruins the whole moment . Another thing is how an episode is dedicated to two characters and then suddenly at the very last few minutes of the episode gets focused on another character like the built up of the two characters was nothing . I get that this is a harem but a good harem needs to balance its emotions and time for the characters so in the end its gets harder to chose who ends up with who , but just shaving characters like that is just not natural and is just distasteful .My last issue is how raku reacts to everything , sometimes he acts like a straight up jerk and behaves like he doesn't care at all . \\n\r\nThis show has been in my watch list for awhile and watching it now , I'm disappointed . \\n\\n\\n\r\nI don't recommend this anime but if you like it go ahead and I'm not hating on anyone who likes the show .There was potential but it was thrown out the window .",
