            "content": "Strange things can happen to a person when they're in prison so the general rules of thumb are to keep a low profile, stay out of the way of other people, and avoid dropping the soap in the shower. For the inmates of Japan's only privately owned prison (which for some reason is run as a theme park and is built on Ground Zero of the Great Tokyo Earthquake), the ablutive antics of their fellow \"guests\" are the least of their worries, especially when the warden takes the term \"punishment game\" to a whole new level. The stage is set. The \"Running Man\" style collarsare on. The next event is a lethal variation of Takeshi's Castle.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to Deadman Wonderland.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the manga by Kataoka Jinsei (story), and Kondou Kazuma (art), the story begins with middle school student Igarashi Ganta, a fairly normal teenager with a reasonably mundane life - going to school, hanging out with friends, etc. All of that changes when his entire class are slaughtered while still in school, and as the only survivor he is found guilty of mass murder and sentenced to death. He is sent to Deadman Wonderland to wait out the time before his execution, but the powers that be in the prison have their eyes on Ganta so he must now navigate a labyrinth of conspiracies, greed, betrayal, murder, revolution, gladiatorial combat, and enough blood to make a clan of vampires drool.\\n\\n\r\nWhich immediately brings up the first problem with this series.\\n\\n\r\nAt its heart Deadman Wonderland is nothing more than a bloodier version of the common or garden shounen tale, but bolted onto the framework concept is a plot that has been worked over far too many times, so much so that it's highly predictable and almost barren of any original thought. Far too much importance has been placed on making the content \"cool\" in an effort to appeal to viewers who just want violence, blood and explosions, and with the added yet pointless melodramatic scenes designed to elicit audience sympathy, the storyline never really picks up enough narrative pace to maintain the viewer's interest. There are also a few critical errors that anyone with a basic understanding of investigative techniques would immediately spot and question, but we'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nNow this may confuse some people because Deadman Wonderland does have a lot going on in each episode, so an explanation is probably in order. This anime uses an event driven plot rather than a character driven one, and because of that the protagonist and his fellow inmates are simply along for the ride. They become nothing more than reactionary elements in the storyline, and in an effort to compensate for that the author and his adaptation colleagues have thrown as many different ideas at the series as they could. In truth, the only thing holding the entire narrative together so that it could be considered a story instead of a collection of random events, is Ganta, which gives an idea of the scale of the problem.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Ganta isn't really terrible, but the nature of the plot ensures that his characterisation remains linear and one dimensional, and while it may appear to some that he matures as an individual, this is actually a forced measure that serves only one purpose - to make his win against the next big bad opponent a bit more believable. Unfortunately, Deadman Wonderland isn't really about developing the characters in any meaningful way, and this is borne out by the fact that the supporting cast only get a few paltry flashbacks even though some of them have a lasting effect on the storyline. The oddity is that probably the most intriguing character is Ganta's childhood friend Shiro, a resident of Deadman Wonderland who isn't a prisoner. She is an anomaly who appears to have a childlike personality, but her very presence in the storyline, together with her looks, is enough to set alarm bells ringing for anyone who knows the trope about mysterious white haired characters.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that this is an adaptation of a manga there's automatically a severe limitation placed on design, but Manglobe have done their best with what has been given to them, and the results are actually pretty good. The animation is smooth and there are some nice visual effects scattered throughout the series, the character movements are fluid and have a natural feel, and the action set pieces have a visceral edge to them that the manga lacks. There are a few issues though, but these lie in the smaller details as there are some design influences from other works (Ganta's likeness to Renton Thurston from Eureka 7, which is also a work by the Kataoka and Kondou). In addition to this, there's a tendency to fall back on certain stereotypes (the rather obvious musclebound oaf who likes nothing more than fighting strong opponents), which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can get tedious to see certain character archetypes all the time. Thankfully these niggles aren't really enough to prevent viewers from enjoying the series, especially if one is able to move past the rather slapdash storyline.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, would it kill anyone to use some real world stereotypes, maybe something like the bad tempered little guy who doesn't know how to fight properly but makes up for it in sheer ferocity?\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland has a rather eclectic variety of background music on offer that ranges from dramatic heavy metal blended with techno, to a few simple notes played on a piano. The quality of the audio, both the music and the effects, is surprisingly good, and the choreography shows that some thought has gone into the implementation and timing of each track. The opening theme is a heavy metal piece called One Reason by DWB (featuring Fade), that has been set to a well designed sequence that utilises a three colour base, in this case red, white and black. The end credits feature a slow moving ferris wheel accompanied by images of many of the characters from their lives before they became inmates of Deadman Wonderland, all set to the tune of Shiny Shiny by NIRGILIS.\\n\\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, this anime doesn't really test the abilities of Paku Romi (Ganta), Hanazawa Kana (Shiro), or any of the other cast members to any great degree, but part of that is due to a relatively lackadaisical script. The dialogue lacks a degree of intuitiveness that can make conversations seem forced, and while the cast are capable seiyuu in their own right, they seem to struggle with several scenes in an effort to get the emotion across to the viewer. It's never a good thing when an actor or actress tries too hard, and this fact is borne out during a number of conversations in the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut then, that's pretty much the story of Deadman Wonderland - it tries too hard.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface this appears to be a rather slick production with some high quality audio and visuals, but no amount of beautification can hide a plot that is more focused on currying favour with audiences than it is with actually telling a story. The narrative can often seem like a train wreck (i.e. bits flying off everywhere, people screaming and running for cover, etc), as many of the plot elements have simply been attached without any real thought given to integrating them into the story proper, and this is why many events can feel like they're nothing more than fillers. In addition to this, the idea of weaponizing blood isn't actually new as Wei Zhijun from Darker Than Black can blow things up using his blood, while Saya from Blood + must use hers to kill Chiropterans.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, one has to remember that the story itself is incomplete as this is only an adaptation of the manga up to a point, and this is one of the reasons why there are inherent issues that have yet to be resolved. Unfortunately that excuse cannot cover certain flaws that really do stand out, the chief among them being Ganta's conviction. The series makes a point of showing a confession by him and this is given as proof of his guilt, but what happened to all the witness statements? What about the forensic evidence like the direction in which the windows exploded, or the angle of the attacks on the classroom? While the viewer clearly knows that Ganta is innocent, the apparent ease of his conviction is dependent on his confession, but nothing is mentioned about the physical evidence from the scene of the crime.\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland looks and sounds great, and if all you're after is a series that has lots of violence, blood, weird characters and a storyline that requires you disengage your brain, then this may be for you. The series may have it's problems, but the concept is interesting even if the implementation leaves a lot to be desired, and it does retain a degree of entertainment value for its action set pieces.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence though, Deadman Wonderland is nothing more than a potato that has been painted by Michaelangelo - it looks stunning, but it's still just a potato.",

            "content": "There was a trend back in the Good Old Days of anime (as in you only thought they were Good because you weren't Old enough to know any better) of hyper violent OVAs. Deadman Wonderland feels like a tread back to those days. It has the over-exaggerated violence, the ridiculous amounts of blood, the awkwardly crowbarred in sexiness and, most noticeably of all, it\u2019s utterly shit.\r\nTime has changed a few little aspects though. The OVA market of old has turned into the late night 12 episode anime series of today. This means it has more space to tell a coherent and fulfilling story, a capabilitywhich Deadman Wonderland approaches by totally ignoring it. 12 episodes are enough to tell a neat story with a beginning, middle and end. It gets the beginning right, tossing our protagonist into a scenario in which society have become so totally ignorant of the prison sector, so that even when hell is being created right in front of their eyes, they think it\u2019s an elaborate piece of CGI.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, upon reaching the 'middle' segment, Deadman Wonderland tosses that whole story aside and becomes about super powers. Instead of developing the characters introduced in the beginning, it decides to quadruple the size of the cast, each and every single one having a hastily constructed backstory introduced right in the middle of a fight to the death that ends up having either little or no relevance to the actual battle happening in the present day. Neither does Deadman Wonderland get the 'end' part right either. This is partly due to the fact this is an ongoing manga, but plenty of other adaptations of ongoing manga have managed to construct some sort of conclusion in their respective stories. Usually this is in the form of the main character growing and learning something (see Arakawa, Spice and Wolf or Genshiken), which Deadman Wonderland tries to do, but royally cocks up because the main character has fuck all personality.\\n\\n\r\nYes, this is something else that comes with modernity. Instead of the macho men that spout 'witty' quips like they're in an American first person shooter game (that is, when they ever talk at all), Deadman Wonderland sports a bland spineless teenage boy as its main character. To be fair to Ganta, he does actually do something other than make reaction noises while other characters monologue exposition at him, as is the trend in certain other modern day anime. He reacts to situations by either whining, crying or sobbing. It really isn't much of a personality, as any bland male would react to the cartoonish level of hell that exists in that prison in a similar fashion, and he really has nothing beyond that. There is chance for him to grow into a hero, and Deadman Wonderland tried to do that. Other characters would spout lines as to how much he's grown a spine and standing up for himself, but I failed to see that myself. He started off as a crybaby who could shoot off magical blood bullets when he felt threatened. By the end, he was a crybaby who shot off magical blood bullets when he felt threatened, except this time he could shoot off his magical blood bullets even faster than before. That's not character development! That's like saying a character has developed because he is now slightly better at picking his nose. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing the late night 12 episode anime has changed from the hyper violent OVAs of old is, now that they're on TV, they need to be censored. I can't really criticise Deadman Wonderland for this though, which is a shame because it's a really easy target. The gun that shot black balls of censorship through people\u2019s chests was one of the most unintentionally hilarious things I've seen all year. But if you were to watch the dvd release, the censorship would (presumably) be removed. It would be like criticising it for the screen being upside down because you watched it while standing on your head. It's not the anime's fault you watched it that way. But the fact that it needed the level of censorship it has tells us how much blood and gore there is. Often the gore has no point other than to show how sadistic the anime is. It's really just repulsive and juvenile, like a child who tries to show everyone what a big man he is by killing the class rabbit.\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland is like a modern day MD Geist. It's aggressively stupid and only appeals to those teenagers and manchildren who think sheer bloody mindedness is what is required to make something cool. People might defend this by saying a hyper violent anime is preferable to the insipid harem moe nonsense of the modern era, which is a load of cowpat. They are both as brainless as each other, just appealing to different sorts of immature mindsets. If you gave me a choice between Deadman Wonderland or, say, Fortune Arterial, I'd instead choose repeatedly slamming my fingers in a car door.\\n",

            "content": "I'm writing this review because a lot of the current reviews are complaining about the story being to short and some characters not getting enough screen time. Obviously, not everything is going to be resolved at the end of the anime because the manga has 45 chapters and the anime is only 12 episodes. That being said, I think the anime did a pretty good job in adapting the manga and you should read the manga after (or before) watching the anime. \r\nStory - (8)\r\nAs you know, Deadman Wonderland is about Ganta, a boy who is framed for the murder of his friends and sentto a privately owned prison. Shortly after arriving in Deadman Wonderland, Ganta discovers he can use his blood as a weapon. He is then sent to G-Block (where all the other Deadmen are) and the story begins. \\n\\n\r\nSince the anime is only 12 episodes, we only get to see the first arc, which is fine. In terms of plot, we don't get to see the start of the main storyline. The first half of the anime is getting introduced to Deadman Wonderland and the second half Ganta teams up with Owl. Most of the questions that are introduced such as the Mother Goose System, the Red Man, and Makina (lady in charge of the prison guard) trying to discover what's going on, while explored, aren't resolved. This leaves people with the sense that the plot was cheap and incomplete, but there are 45 manga chapters and the anime only got to chapter 20.\\n\\n\r\nnote: if you want to read the manga, don't start on chapter 20 because the anime left out a chunk of main characters and some events happen in a different order. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - (7)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, Deadman Wonderland was just okay. 12 epiosdes wasn't enough time to introduce everyone, so they left out some pretty important characters. I don't really mind that because we are already introduced to a lot of characters and more would just give less screen time all around (and they were irrelevant to the Owl arc). Even though they left out some characters, the only two characters to receive a decent amount of screen time are Ganta and Shiro. If you want more info on Crow, Hummingbird, etc. read the manga, they get a lot more development. The other problem people have with the characters is that a lot of them are introduced, then die in an episode or two, which leaves no impact on the audience. While this is somewhat true, it shouldn't stop you from enjoying the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nGanta \u2192 after 12 episodes, he showed a little bit of growth. He starts off as shy and wimpy. He needs Shiro to protect him in the prison. He's just average intelligence, overall a pretty normal character. He does notice how weak he is and tries to get stronger, so he's not useless the entire time. He cares for Shiro and hates the Red Man.\\n\\n\r\nShiro \u2192 She's lived at Deadman Wonderland Prison her whole life and she's shrouded in mystery as to why.  She is pretty dumb, but saves Ganta a lot. We get to know more about her past and why she's in DW and can basically do whatever she wants, but I'll let you watch that. \\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation - (8)\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty dark in the depths of the prison and the scenes that are mysterious. The prison itself is very bright and shiny, which fits the show because Deadman Wonderland Prison needs to give the appearance of being a nice prison. The character designs were faithful to the manga and looked good, with the exception of Crow, I thought Crow looked better in the manga, might just be me though. Animation wise, everything seemed pretty fluid, I didn't notice any poor animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound - (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending were pretty good, but I don't really listen to them (sorry). Background music was also fitting. Acting wise, I thought Ganta and Shiro's voices were perfect and really fit them. Everyone else didn't really have a whole lot of lines, but they did a good job. The only voice I didn't like was Toto Sakigami's voice...he sounded kinda like a woman, but he's really only introduced so I don't really care. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - (8)\\n\\n\r\nIt's does a good job of introducing us to the manga, even though some characters were ignored and events were re-ordered. The door is still open for a second season, which  I hope it gets because the real story was just beginning. If you want a gory show with plenty of death, Deadman Wonderland is for you. After you finish the anime (or before if you want) you should also go read the manga. In my opinion, it's better, but the anime version is worth a try.",

            "content": "Hold up your hand if you've heard this story premise before.\r\nNaive, innocent and painfully average teenage boy is thrown into a violent game of life-or-death, having no choice in the matter. He is forced to fight, and discovers he has a mysterious, hidden power. Over the course of the show, he learns to control that power.\r\nYou can put your hand down now.\r\nWhile the story to Deadman Wonderland is, of course, not going to be winning any awards, it still does make an attempt at telling it. The entirety of the plot revolves around the many characters in the infamous Deadman Wonderland prison, a place whereyou can trust no-one, where death roams around every corner and ironically, where the people are very boring. If I had a dollar for every character in this show with a tacked-on, forced, and extremely underdeveloped back-story, I would have enough cash to supply the pen and paper to write better ones. Even Senji Kiyomasa (The Crow), a character that got an entire OVA post-season, feels underdeveloped. I do not care for any of these people, and most importantly, don't like these people. It's amazing that a series like this with such a long list of characters manages to fail to capture my interest. I recommend that you tune in for the fights and the plot developments, and tune out during the back-story segments. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode starts off like an episode of the 1990's American television show, Goosebumps. A generic high school boy named Ganta is thrown into an absurd, nightmare-esque situation where every person in his class is killed violently in a mass murder by a figure affectionately nicknamed by him as ''The Red Man''. Being the only survivor, the police officers and detectives put their brilliant minds together to come to the conclusion that Ganta killed everyone, based on the evidence of being the only person found alive. Terrific. The only apparent evidence suggesting he did it is a 30 second recording of him laughing off the murders as nothing. This hardly believable work of CGI is the only piece linking him to the murderer, and suddenly, it's off to prison, on a death sentence. Super.\\n\\n\r\nOnce there, he learns of the dark secret behind the prison. Morals go out the window as Ganta is forced to participate in childish games to survive. Apparently this is still an episode of Goosebumps. He forms a close friendship with a creepy, pale girl named Rei, uh, I mean Shiro. Stuff happens. People die. Shinji, no... Ganta does a complete 180\u00b0 in character development, and by the finale of the season, he is back to a snivelling, pathetic mess. We are introduced to characters who get killed off episodes later, with no back-story. At all. The show is an under-cooked mess, and as for the ending, disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was handled by Manglobe, the animators for The World God Only Knows, and Samurai Champloo. The art style is very reminiscent of their work on Ergo Proxy. Nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done. The animation in the opening, especially some of Shiro's segments, is pretty neat. The art is uncomfortably inconsistent, often very lazy during the dialogue and slower scenes, and well done during the action scenes. At least it's not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special. Overused, clich\u00e9 blood splatters and other shock-value sound effects are rife throughout the season. The opening song is a very cheesy and teenage hard rock number, which ultimately got on my nerves on the mere second viewing. The closing however, is something else. A gorgeous song that invokes some powerful and melancholy emotions about life before Ganta was forced into the prison. The background music throughout the series is fairly forgettable, excepting a bittersweet piano melody that I heard often during the slower scenes. Regardless of that, nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you desire to watch it, watch it. It's an incredibly average story, with many flat, bland characters (excluding Shiro, the only character in the entire season who I was genuinely infatuated with. She is very reminiscent of Lucy from Elfen Lied).  Don't take this show seriously. It's zany, heavily-stylised, nonsensical and very gory. It relies on basic shock-value and gross-out moments to capture the audience's attention, but ultimately, comes across as childish and edgy. They are a few moments that made me smile, though. Just know, if you're not planning to watch it, you're not missing out on anything special. If you did enjoy it, hope you like waiting for season two. It's either that or the manga.",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland is a a series that showed a lot of promise after a couple of episodes, but ultimately falls to the 12 episode only bug. While the series has an interesting concept, and a great deal of shock value, it falls flat on execution. \r\nOur story involves around Ganta, a typically middle school kid who is framed for the murder of his classmates, who were really killed by what he refers to as \"The Red Man\". He gets sent to a private prison known as \"Deadman Wonderland\", which is more like a gladiator holding place than a prison. His goal is to find theRed Man and kill him. Oh, he also gets this weird blood power which allows him to use his own blood as a weapon. \\n\\n\r\nThe main issue with the show are the characters. Ganta is a kid in a brutal world, but he does not show any real growth at all. Shiro on the other hand is more like a flaw to Deadman Wonderland itself. Her upbeat and rather innocent personality almost represents hope in the show.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Ganta and Shiro there are not many characters worth mentioning. Crow, is probably the coolest character in the show, but only gets a side character spot. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the pacing seems off. There are a few pick me up moments near the start of the show where the viewer can latch onto and think there's hope, but those are totally gone as the show progresses and it basically turns into a suffering with the main character ordeal. On top of this, the closing episodes reveal several things that are never resolved (but does leave room for a second season)\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are good. Maybe not the greatest ever, but not distracting at all. Voice acting is fine too, I can't really think of a character whose voice annoyed me. There is one character, Mockingbird, whose voice is questionable, but you only see him a few times. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that will probably hook you after the first couple of episodes and drag you into it and then you'll be more or less obliged to complete it. Deadman wonderland is not a terrible show, but offers little in the way of substance. It's just lifeless.",

            "content": "I really want to like this show, i've made every effort to enjoy this show, but i can't quite bring myself to recommend it.\r\nDeadman Wonderland is the story of Ganta, a young man sharing a staggering resemblance to Eureka Seven's Renton (same mangaka) who is wrongly imprisoned in the futuristic Deadman Wonderland, a theme park were the convicts serve as the attractions. \r\nThe first thing that became apparent is that 12 episodes was never going to be enough screen time to do this show justice. The first few episodes drive us through the series of event's that lead us to Ganta's imprisonment, now i personallyhad wrongly assumed the wonderland would be a dark and dreary affair, initially this is not the case, the prison is futuristic in appearance, lots of shiny scientific looking facility's and park itself looks like an amusement park all bright and cheery. We're introduced to the idea that the convicts are given a battle royal style neckband which will deal them a lethal dose of poison should they not take the antidote candy every 3 days, these candy's can be earned via participation is the wonderlands various death themed activity's, i would have assumed this to be the basis of the show, as we're introduced and grow to know and appreciate the cast and the environment.\\n\\n\r\nSadly not to be, Ganta (far to) quickly discovers he had some strange new powers and is declared a Deadman and moved to G block, the dark drab place i was expecting from the beginning, and all the stuff about antidote candy and the rest of the park is forgotten, now i've not seen Ganta consume any more candy, i''ve lost track as to if only 3 days are supposed to have past over the course of the entire show, or if it's a highlight real of months, and they just got bored with the idea? Never really touched on again, so thanks for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe show then drives us head long into the Deadman universe, as quickly as possible attempting to introduce us to the Deadmen (those with similar powers to Ginta) through altercations with Ganta and then the Undertakers, a Bleach Captain styled band of throw away Nemesis's for the Deadmen.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing never really has a chance to catch it's breath and never really shows us enough interaction or actual screen time for the various characters to give them any depth or real significance in the show. By the 10th episode we've still got the major character's such as Crow refusing to assist poor Ganta, and rightly so, they've met exactly 3 times ever.\\n\\n\r\nI'm at a loss of what to say about the characters, Ganta's kinda pathetic throughout and plenty whiny, and just doesn't get the time to grow, Shiro's random switches between psychotic and adorable are fun and all, and the various Deadmen we've seen so far have all been pretty cool, in the 10 minutes or so screen time they've had to share with god knows how many throw away characters, all of the under takers seem pretty cliched, but what can you do. I'd honestly say the cast has allot of potential, but your certainly not going to see any of it realised, if this is the first and last season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound, are really good, i love the opening, and this was most of the reason i started the show, i was intrigued by the opening sequence, and it perfectly sets the tone. No complaints on the voice acting, i thought Kana Hanazawa did a stand out job as Shiro, nailed the character for me. Art although not setting any new ground, is all high end, and i suppose is the up side to such a short show, i'm not going to go crazy over it though, i've no doubt it's the main reason this show still average's an 8+ rating while genuinely good shows like Fairy Tail sat below the 8.0 mark for months and months.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment wise, i just expect more from a modern show, the bar has been set really high, by the popular shounen crop of recent years, and this hasn't got there. I really wanted to like this show, my intrigue lasted a good few episodes, before i finally realised no significant ground was ever going to be covered. It's by no means a bad show, but it's one that needed to spend longer setting up the atmosphere and building up some suspense.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion the manga folks really should have held out for a better adaptation offer, this has by no means done justice to what i'm sure was good material.",

            "content": "Have you ever been framed for something that you believed you wouldn't have the capacity to do, and were punished for it? That unlucky scenario is shared by Ganta, the protagonist of the 2011 anime Deadman Wonderland. Deadman Wonderland revolves around the horrifying trials Ganta has to go through after he is sent to a prison camp sharing the title of the anime. The themes used in this anime include finding hope in a hopeless situation, and moving on from your past. \r\nStory: 5 \u2013 The story of Deadman Wonderland primarily revolves around the main protagonist Ganta, and the many horrible things that occur inDeadman Wonderland. The story relies on blood, insanity, and intense moments to keep itself going, leaving proper story-telling at a bare minimum. As you can tell by the synopsis, the story concept (deathmatches) isn\u2019t very original either, and often comes off as cliche. The anime switches its focus around 3/5ths into the series, but the speedy pacing and lack of originality leave the audience unable to properly settle into the show. As with other shounen anime, dues ex machina and plot armor take full effect in Deadman Wonderland, rendering life/death situations trite and unnecessary. Due to the show\u2019s cancellation, the show remains unfinished and so the ending suffers as a result. Deadman Wonderland doesn't appear to run on story, instead running on finding different ways of torturing the characters involved in it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \u2013 The production studio responsible for this series, Manglobe, are also responsible for shows such as Ergo Proxy, and Samurai Champloo. The character designs are slightly bland, excluding Shiro\u2019s design which symbolizes her strange appearances on the show. The art used in this show is somewhat dull and colorless, clearly emphasizing the color red. The animation is somewhat above average, and is especially evident during the battle sequences. Overall, despite the good animation, the art department takes a hit for its general blandness. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \u2013 The opening song used for the anime , \u201cOne Reason\u201d, is a medium-paced hard rocking piece, easily exuding the dark and gloomy feel of the show. The ending song, \u201cSHINY SHINY\u201d, on the other hand represents Ganta\u2019s life before the events of the show and is a lot more cheery as a result. The insert songs used are usually metal-themed, matching the dark tone of the show, but are easily forgettable. The music in the show generally does a good job of being in the background. The dub, done by Funimation, did a pleasant job in the voice-acting department matching their characters effectively with well-acted vocals.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6.5 \u2013 Like the story, the characters of Deadman Wonderland are hit or miss. The protagonist Ganta is your typical (sym)pathetic, spineless, yet good intentioned kid who just happened to be put in a horrible situation, however, I will give him credit for developing a backbone by the end of the series. Shiro\u2019s role in the story is the mysterious inmate who provides comic relief to an otherwise dark and cruel show and because of that, she easily became my favorite character. A lot of the supporting characters each have their own backstories told through flashbacks given during certain parts of the anime. Some of these characters end up being fairly well-developed while others are shafted for the more important characters. Due to the general cruelty of the show, there is a possibility that you will end up not caring much for the characters, as a lot of their time on the anime is limited. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7-7.5 \u2013 Deadman Wonderland is a pretty entertaining anime. The sheer amount of craziness inside the Wonderland keeps the audience on its toes and interested in watching the story unfold. If you enjoy blood and gore, then you will definitely enjoy watching Deadman Wonderland. \\n\r\nOverall 6: Deadman Wonderland is a flawed anime with a clear focus, to shock and titillate. Due to the clich\u00e9s, unfinished ending, and done to death concepts, the show may come off as underwhelming and hard to take seriously. However, I recommend Deadman Wonderland to those who like their anime, short, zany, and not too serious. Just don\u2019t go into the show expecting a complex storyline and really interesting characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6: Deadman Wonderland is a flawed anime with a clear focus, to shock and titillate.

            "content": "I'm somewhat masochistic. Typically when I find something that I think that I will dislike I will drop it after giving it a shot once I'm sure there's nothing I'll enjoy. However, when something is so bad that I am stupified at how many flaws I find in the writing of the show and how poor the characters are in terms of consistency, I somehow enjoy how much I can hate the show in question while watching it. This is somewhat of a disclaimer to say, that unlike most people, I didn't watch the series to enjoy any of its positives, but enjoy ragging onits negatives. Which might kill some of my credibility since I don't find credibility in a wholly negative or positive review for anything, and might've made me oblivious to the strong points of the series. I will attempt to find some positives in the series, regardless, but I could simply be oblivious to some of them due to how much of a bad experience the show was.\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland is a good choice for you if you're looking for edgy fun and if you're the kind of person, like me, that enjoys observing the peak of how atrocious the writing of a show can be. However, it's a bad choice if you can't ignore the flaws and inconsistencies in the writing of a show, because there's just so many of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs an action series, Deadman Wonderland looks good because of its good production values. As a matter of fact, the good production is what did not make the series a complete botch, since I kinda enjoyed its soundtrack. However, as far what happens in the action bits, there's not a lot of meat to go around, with the battles being very one sided towards a certain group unless the character gets a powerup. They are either meant to express gore, or they're meant to express certain shounen-isms. I know the show doesn't have the shounen tag, but the manga is tagged with all the tags this was supposed to be. I'll list them all as I review the series, so no need to check the manga. The shounen-isms I talk about are \"I GOTTA USE ALL MY POWER TO PROTECT MUH FRENS\" and \"I CAN BE STRONG TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!\". However they are not implemented well and they're often nonsensical to happen and they feel like a writing asspull, often seeming just like the writing got pushed into a corner and then \"wait this needs to happen ugh this character can bleed at supersonic speed now hahaha\". There's just a lot of things that adapt to the convenience of the plot as the series goes on, and as a result of such, random power-ups, or specific characters get depowered, with often not as much as an explanation. The supersonic thing ain't a joke, characters need to use their power at that speed so they will not be deactivated by certain weapons. Powers which could've been used at previous points in the series to obtain a different result. And characters that are clearly stronger throwing the fight because... yeah, I guess, right? \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the gore goes, well... silly you would ask, eh... hmm, uh heh... it's censored. And it's censored because there was never a release of Deadman Wonderland that would be uncensored outside of Japan. For what it's worth, the censorship doesn't really make things unable to be misinterpreted, but...\\n\\n\r\nYou might wonder why would a series that is considered horror be shipped as horror and be censored, since that is a clearly bad choice for anything in the horror genre. I mean shock value is important in a horror series, as you need to be unnerved to be scared. That's because this series isn't actually a horror series. Its writing doesn't really present anything that should be horror outside of the gore. The characters don't act any bit more terrified than characters from other shounens, there isn't really any torment inflicted on the main character other than that required for him to get into the circumstances of the plot. Any emotional damage he should've received is just dulled away to the point where he has a stronger reaction and impact to a person losing his eye than his entire class and his two best friends being killed in front of him. Honestly, the only thing I can see this series is as edgy, rather than horror, because it presents a lot of gore and none of the tension to back it up, where you are constantly in danger, simply because the writing is just awful and the main character doesn't suffer any real consequence, emotional or physical. He's as much a shounen protagonist as a protagonist can be. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the genres that the tags are missing on the anime release is the shounen tag. The series has generic shounen tropes such as \"the power of friendship and its value\", \"I can do it if I try, and that gives me a power-up.\", \"A weak boy who powers up as the series goes on because of his friends\" and other such shounen things. I doubt anyone would argue it's a shounen and there isn't really anything to criticize in a show because it's a shounen, other than it being genericly shounen. However, why would you be a horror shounen? Why would the power of friendship and being determined matter when you're supposed to be in a situation where you're supposed to be horrified. Why wouldn't you use his friends being fucked over, since they're there, to torture Ganta, to express fear and terror through him in the series? Again, because this is a shounen, and this limits your capability to do the same things a horror series would normally do, which are the opposite of determination in the face of adversity, that being desperation. Thanks for airing in Shounen Ace, Deadman Wonderland. What a scary thought. Ganta has friends and people he isn't close to, die. As long as he gets over his bests friends dying at the start of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sci-fi tag on the series is right, however, but not every element of the series is science fiction. In order to not mislead you, the cause of the powers is not explained by science and while the technology such as robots and lasers are present in Deadman Wonderland, the characters have the power manipulate blood due to \"blood holes\" which are basically red black holes. There might be a scientific explanation for the powers, however, it does behave very much like a supernatural series. Science fiction series tend to have some sort of pseudo science explanation that kinda limits the amount of bullshit they can use since they have rules. But Deadman Wonderland has no rules, so it can bullshit whenever. So note that the series is not only sci-fi, but supernatural.  The sci-fi plays very little into it, and for the most part the powers are strictly supernatural, with some pseudo science applied around it.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important and last tag of Deadman Wonderland is drama, which is a missing tag for the anime. The drama is undoubtfully the thing is the most atrocious about the series. In order to give you an example of how bad the drama is built into the show, I'll give you the series premise as an example. Ganta is a character who is falsely accused and brought into a prison on \"death\" row. Ganta has witnessed the death of his entire class and his two best friends. Now after such a traumatic event, you would expect the character would have some form of emotional distress but Ganta almost vomits once from shock and like, is a little sad for a while, then he shounens it up and decides \"I WANT TO LIVE BECAUSE...???\" and afterwards once more characters are introduced he is like \"MUH FRENS ARE IMPORTANT\". Now you need to understand, that Ganta, moves on from one of the most traumatic events a person can experience, then after he is falsely accused he is moved in a place where he is treat like utter dogshit and death is often an option. And then he moves on. Like it's nothing. He gets a little beat up and then he gets a power and suddenly, even though it hardly mattered even before moved on, now he acts almost constantly fine. The biggest consequence on Ganta after experiencing this tragedy is that he wants to kill the person that commited the act. After witnessing a tragedy, he is placed in a place where he is constant danger... and then he moves on without any reason than he wants to live... Even before this, he seems to be more pissed off at the idea he was flasely accused than his friends dying, since he barely shows any emotion in regards to what happened to them.\\n\\n\r\nWhy would he just suddenly want to live? I mean, your friends are dead, you saw them murdered, everyone thinks you did it, you're likely gonna be killed and tortured. Wouldn't you at least be depressed? Wouldn't you at least be angry and constantly showing a lot of emotion or simply just shut yourself off? Or would you act like a teenager of who's dog died? Be a little sad and then be like, yeah okay. His portrayal is so horrible that his personality and behaviour is almost a joke. There is no way anyone would act the way he does after experiencing the events he had. And Ganta is just one example out of many. For the sake of not spoiling any plot threads from the series I won't go into detail about anyone else, however, in order to dramatize the series, the show often does flashbacks to show us why x character is fucked up and behaves that way. Which is pointless when the character barely has plot relevance and you're not really gonna bring up again. I mean, the series seems to have ended in a way that pretty would guarantee a second season... but none was made. So a lot of characters that got focus could've been intended to have had an actual role in the future of the series. But the role they had so far, they almost felt like throwaways, that once they ever done with, they were just to be discarded and never to be looked at again. For a series that aspires to be a drama, that's really bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty much an excuse to bring edginess at every point. The characters are either forced to compete in death games in the amusement park so they can survive or they are forced to fight each other and the loser will lose an organ. It tries to make us understand why the people went insane and behaved that way, but really, they're that way just to be edgy. The series doesn't have any other point a shounen wouldn't have, mostly bringing up that kindness and friendship is important. It isn't unique in term of message and theme, and just tries to feature people that went insane because of trauma, with a protagonist that was oblivious to all of it. The characters more often than not experience a form of insanity that makes them want to kill stuff and be edgy and then all of a sudden, they're sane enough to have their behaviour change. These violent mood swings were ridiculous to see as the characters are poorly executed, the story had a really generic point in a setting that shouldn't even make it with a lot of inconsistencies in the mix to be added and logic gaps. \\n\\n\r\nFor instance, how would a teenager who was injured enough to be hospitalized, be capable of hiding a weapon that was strong enough to cause an explosion in a classroom. Even with his confession, that shouldn't be enough to jail him as he was physically incapable of executing the course of the action described. Also why would the warden of a jail be allowed, the jail he was sent to, be able to act out as his lawyer? Why would a prison have to undergo a people's rights inspection, when people come out for entertainment there and prisoners definitely don't seem to have their rights respected there, as they are used for the entertainment of others at the price of their safety? Now their safety matters? And there's more and more and more that I could just list but I think I made my point.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said at the start of the review, it's got good production values. Except for the censorship that filthy westerners deserve, the series has solid animation. What I especially in Deadman Wonderland was the soundtrack. despite the E D G E lyrics of the OP, it's got some really good sounding rock pieces.\\n\\n\r\nThe only factors I can recommend this series on are the E D G E factor. And the fact that you might be capable of consuming it in the same way as me, and that is enjoying the series for its abundance in flaws. There's no other factor I can recommend it on. Steer clear if anything I described is below your standards. I mean look, edgy stuff can be entertaining, I watched series  because I considered edgy but, I liked them in the context where they either didn't try to explain themselves, or at least they were plausible to some extent. But in Deadman Wonderland's case it even seems unaware of what it's doing. So yeah. Have fun.",

            "content": "I first heard about this anime through Crunchyroll's announcing of their winter/spring simulcasts, and my interested was piqued. Overall, it's a very good anime, and has the potential to stand out from the others.\r\nStory: The story starts out with the Red Man, as Ganta calls him, massacring his middle school class. Before he disappears, the Red Man embeds a red crystal-like object into Ganta's chest, which promptly disappears. He wakes up in a hospital and is placed on trial, where he is sentenced to death. He tries to flee, but maddened parents of some of the killed students attack him, and a fake video ofGanta admitting to the killing to Tamaki, his lawyer, and telling him that if Tamaki cleared him, he would tell Tamaki where he hid the weapon. Ganta soon finds himself in the twisted amusment-style prison called Deadman Wonderland, hence the title. All very original, and I look forward to the rest of the episodes, but the anime has the risk of being a 'getting framed for a crime I didn't commit and trying to find the real killer' type.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Truly different from most other animes I have seen. The anime has relatively simple characters, with wonderfully detailed settings, contrasting nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing special. The opening and ending aren't really noteworthy, and sound almost familiar. One good thing about the music is how nicely it keeps the suspense and liveliness of the anime going (During the opening scene of the first episode, Ganta and his two friends are discussing their class trip, but the piano music in the background left me feeling like something was going to happen.) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Very original, especially Shiro and Ganta. All of the characters have their quirks, and exploit them excellently. I'd love to see the back story on many of them, but I'm sure that will happen eventually.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very good. Kept me on my toes the entire first episode, not knowing what would happen. Keeps the blood done to a bearable level, and doesn't get into the gore. Looks like it will be a very good anime to watch!",

            "content": "If you enjoy fast paced action packed anime's, then  Deadman Wonderland is most certainly one of the top choices for Spring 2011.\r\nThe story revolves around a main character called Igarashi Ganta whose sudden encounter with the \"Red Man\" turns his life from a jolly average middle school life, into a hell hole called Deadman Wonderland where inmates put on a show for paying audiences. \r\nBeyond the dark and frightening atmosphere is a fast developing action/horror anime packed with enough twists to keep you on your toes and desperate for more, as it is impossible to predict the turn of events as i tried todo so myself. Each new twist draws you in deeper and deeper to the point where you crave for closure.\\n\\n\r\nAudio and visuals for Deadman Wonderland are extremely effective in setting the right theme and environment for this anime. It gives off a eerie and dark aura easily putting you into the right mood for watching this type of anime. The characters are lacking a bit in development and hard to empathize with but with the series the way it is, there wouldn't be enough time even though it would be nice if there was more depth to each of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough short, Deadman Wonderland is more then enough to satisfy viewers including those who aren't too fond of the genre and is most definitely one of the more enticing series of spring 2011\\n",

            "content": "Every other review is calling this show unique. It isnt. It is just \r\nBattle Royale in a prison. While at least BR established a setting of a crazy future fascist Japanese govt to justify everything, here were given zip: just a psycho society that \"is what it is\" and we just gotta roll with it. I dont buy that for a second. Cutting corners from the get go is a big nono when trying to create a believable setting. This is as far from believable as it gets. While insane, Battle Royale's setting was wholly substantiated and explained.\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD! They are necessary and hilariously stupid.\r\nSothe story....\\n\\n\r\nIts like everyone in authority is blind and stupid. How can a kid do THAT (tear all the kids to pieces and destroy a class room)? Even if everything is so fucking cool after he is sentenced why the hell does story have to be so stupid and nonsensical?\\n\\n\r\nI mean...I am wrong to expect storytellers to try anymore with this stuff or what? The parents at the kid's trial were all scowling and upset and mad at that kid but do none have the brains to ask \"wtf is goin on here?\" This is nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nThe kid could have been put into that death camp amusement park in other, more believable ways right?? Ways that made some sense?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe if it was a govt and police and jury conspiracy or something.....\\n\r\nMaybe if just two kids were shot or something...\\n\r\nNo, whole class full of kids torn to pieces and room destroyed by a scrawny little boy and nobody thinks it makes no sense. Cops, judges, parents, inmates etc...\\n\\n\r\nThe boy's defense attorney is a crackpot too. We never see a defense and the boy just loses. Right...\\n\\n\r\nSo we find our protagonist in the death camp amusement park. There is this overgrown monster dude ex-karate-champ-inmate who runs the joint... or something. \"Im gonna win that race and get the money! Right gang?\" \"YEAAA \" his typical gang responds.\" He beats up our guy and another guy and then were in this crazy race with death traps.\\n\\n\r\nThe race...what the hell is this mess? I am supposed to believe that all these inmates have been here forever and NOBODY knows that this race is going to kill 99% of them?? Even the macho big gang-leader karate dude is like \"F this.\" The god damn race is held so often so how does noone know what it is like? Just stupid.\\n\\n\r\nOh yea, the one light at the end of the tunnel has our main guy gain superpowers and is followed around in the death camp by this cute all-white female naive inmate. Not explained as of now but really I do not want it explained. It seems they would mess that up badly.\\n\\n\r\nShould I not  expect good storytelling anymore? Should I just enjoy the entertainment of it all? Right? Anime...at least Highschool of the Dead was awesome and never took itself seriously. Battle Royale had infinitely more logic behind the actions of its characters. This is just a stupid knockoff...as of ep2.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes, anime characters are put into such unfortunate circumstances that you can't help but shake your head in pity. Now, this isn't the type of misfortune where you go \"Barnacles, I procrastinated and didn't do my boating essay,\" or \"Such misfortune! A certain Sister bites me all the time!\" The misfortune I'm talking about is when Heaven itself seems to abandon you, when it seems all the forces in the world are trying to guarantee no salvation for you. \r\nThe subject of this particular tragic treatment is Ganta Igarashi, who starts as a completely normal middle school boy with all of the nice, usual things.Family, friends, and a sense of security. Sadly for him, this was not going to last. On the very first episode of Deadman Wonderland, a mysterious figure, which Ganta dubs the \"Red Man,\" appears and butchers Ganta's entire class, leaving him the sole survivor. Framed for the massacre of his class, Ganta is incarcerated in the social experiment prison, Deadman Wonderland. \\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland isn't your everyday kind of prison. For starters, there is an amusement park built right on top of the prison, with the usual cute and fuzzy mascots roaming around. Here, the prisoners are used to operate the attractions and entertain the audience, with sadistic attractions such as the Dog Race and most importantly, the Carnival of Corpses. \\n\\n\r\nSince Ganta is housed on death row, there isn't much hope for him in this place. Tagging along with him and constantly saving his life though, is a mysterious girl named Shiro, who claims to be Ganta's childhood friend, and possesses near super human feats of strength and agility. Her presence is a mixed blessing for Ganta; she's rather clueless and childish, but doesn't hesitate to save Ganta. Deadman Wonderland follows Ganta's experiences in this bizarre world. \\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland certainly has an interesting concept. Modern day gladiators, supernatural powers, and plenty of violence. What's not to love? \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Deadman Wonderland is that it's trying to fit too many things into a very short 12 episode anime. Halfway, an important concept and fighting ability called \"The Branches of Sin\" is introduced. It essentially gives a mastery over using one's own blood in a variety of offensive and defensive ways. Somewhere along the way, a rebel group is introduced, an old geezer who never really gets an explanation, a very feminine looking boy, and Undertakers are also introduced. There simply isn't enough time in 12 episodes to flesh out these things to make it flow with its other concepts, resulting in little character interaction and development. Even at the end of the series, there are lots of unanswered questions. \\n\\n\r\nLet me elaborate. There is a staggering revelation near the middle of the series, a revelation that could very well shatter what little logic is present in Ganta's situation. What would happen if Ganta found out about this certain secret? Would he go insane? Would he crawl up and die? Or would he take vengeance? \\n\\n\r\nI don't have a clue, and you're guess is as good as mine. The series introduces this extremely interesting revelation and yet does nothing with it. Given time, this could help make Deadman Wonderland a much better show. And yet, this won't happen, because of Deadman Wonderland's lack of time to flesh out events. It's disappointing, but something in the future could elaborate on this and give a new dimension to the show. \\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, I've read a lot of complaints about Ganta's weak attitude. I really can't blame him though, since he's just a middle school student  who suddenly finds himself on death row. I think it's be unrealistic to think that he'd suddenly toughen himself and willingly face the dangers of Deadman Wonderland so quickly. The entire story takes place in less than 2 weeks I believe, after all. There are a few interesting characters that appear, such as the Crow, Kiyomasa Senji, who is my personal favorite character of this show. He becomes somewhat of a friend to Ganta, though he is unwilling to share the former's optimism of escape. \\n\\n\r\nWhile on characters, I have to applaud this show for introducing some truly hate worthy characters. I'm looking at you, Promoter Tamaki, man who plays with life like a toy. You too, Genkaku Azuma, you sacrilegious mediocre guitar player. And you too, Hibana Daida, unladylike gorilla who wields Zabimaru. Enough ranting though. \\n\\n\r\nAside from characters, the art in this show is pretty decent. Plenty of dark colors and tones in the prison, while bright colors are usually in the form of sadistic, cute mascots with a gun hidden in them or something of the sort. There isn't much diversity in setting, since it takes place in a somewhat futuristic prison after all. That means lots of corridors, cells, stone, steel and things of that sort. Fight scenes were pretty interesting, though animation quality takes a dip sometimes.   \\n\\n\r\nMoving onto sound, the background music was just that, background music. I didn't notice any real noteworthy melodies and such, but the music was appreciated where it was. The opening is \"One Reason\" by Fade. It's a typical rock song with, surprise, English lyrics. It's very appropriate for the dark tones of the show, and it's a pretty decent song.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ending song is a completely different story. It's an interesting song called \"Shiny Shiny\" by Nirgilis. It has a pretty upbeat pop style to it, an interesting contrast to the heavy rock and violence of the show. There are also some melancholic sounds in the song, another contrast to the happy. However, hearing this after the blood has been spilled in a particular episode, gives an interesting feel close to pity. The ending basically shows pictures of the lives of many of the characters before they experienced the hell of Deadman Wonderland. Innocent things like being with friends, embracing loved ones, and appreciating childhood.  \\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland isn't for everyone. There's tons of blood, gore, and some rather disturbing scenes (ahem, Penalty Game). The first episode is remarkably similar in levels of gore to Elfen Lied, so if you can handle things like that, be my guest and enjoy the attractions at Deadman Wonderland. This show should be viewed with enjoying the interesting atmosphere and action as much as possible. It's about a boy with all of the misfortune in the world, living in a twisted environment, trying his best to understand what it truly means to be a \"Deadman.\" \\n\\n\r\nIn Deadman Wonderland, we do our very best to kick the loser while they're down. So sit back, and enjoy watching our prisoners suffer, minds shatter, and play the part of fool, all while I watch.",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland is a twelve (12) episode series that was left open ended so that there is the possibility that another season of it could be in the making. The title of this anime seduced me into watching it with the element of confusion channelling me forward.\r\nSTORY 7/10\r\nDeadman Wonderland is a theme park that not only serves as entertainment to the public but also doubles as a prison for criminals in society. It is the only privately owned prison in Japan. It is here that the fourteen (14) year old Igarashi Ganta is placed after he is charged with the crime of murdering everyone inhis class brutally. At first, the prison appears to be an ordinary one but as Ganta begins to learn more about the prison daily and continue his quest in finding the \u2018Red Man\u2019, he realises that there is more to this prison and himself that meets the eye. \\n\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime was dark and gruesome and the artwork reflected such. The depiction of the amusement park was a stark contrast from the horror that was taking place inside. The prison itself gave off an ominous atmosphere which contributed to the intense mystery of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening score provided the key to the dismal atmosphere of the anime and the music included in the story played on one\u2019s mental because even though kaleidoscope music was used it was the irony of the situation in which it was used. The ending piece was sad, reflecting Ganta\u2019s major emotional state.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty diverse with some of them surprising you completely! Each character added a different edge to the anime, contributing to the story and keeping the audience guessing as to the true nature or intentions of some of them. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 8/10\\n\r\nThe mystery of the anime kept me intrigued because of the journey that is undertaken with the main character Ganta; empathising with him and also wanting to know more about why he was made to suffer for a crime that he did not commit. I was highly impressed with the amount of violence and gore in this series, so much so, that even some of it had to be censored! However, I was disappointed that the story shifted focus after episode six which annoyed me a little but realised that the ending was open thereby leaving the possibility that there would be another season in the future to tie up loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime is definitely worth the watch, that is, if you can stomach all the gore and violence that comes along with it. You can\u2019t help but feel for the main character Ganta and hope that he gets vindicated. The only thing that ruined it for me was the change in the arc where the focus shifted from Ganta to another character Nagi, but nevertheless, a breath of fresh air in the anime universe. \\n",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland. Some people are terming it \"The most gory anime of 2011\"  , well I may have to agree. It's got gore, but is that what it's relying upon to be anything better than just an average Anime?\r\nDeadman Wonderland starts off with Ganta Igarashi, just a normal schoolboy...until his entire class is killed by a mysterious power wielded by the antagonist later known as the Red man. Ganta is pinned for the murder by ridiculous \"evidence\" and is thrown into Japan's first, privately owned prison, Deadman Wonderland. \r\nIn prison, Ganta learns that he now wields the mysterious \"blood power\" (branches of sin) andhe will be forced to fight against other users, and compete in brutal, childish games to survive.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't bad. For the most part it kept me interested and staying on to the next episode. The story does, however, try to be serious and fails because the world encompassing it is so silly. I do feel that it is pandering to a demographic that craves excessive gore, but it is not so amazing as to be what keeps viewers coming back. It's been done better in Hellsing, Elfen lied and even Highschool of the Dead.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are probably the main point of what diversifies it, art-wise, from other Anime's. I, personally, don't care much for the look of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound. Deadman Wonderland does have some ominous backing tracks  which helps to bring out the full potential of various scenes in the series. The opening is rather interesting as well. The voice acting is your typical deal, nothing special. I do feel that Hanazawa Kana was a lot better in Angel Beats! as Kanade than Shiro in this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was where the series fell quite short for me. The protagonist Ganta is weak, pathetic and generally just a pain to listen to. He gets down on himself, he is a hindrance to the other characters. This is all well and good, but these are the clich\u00e9 characteristics of a generic archetype and are suppose to be developed away from. The series loses touch and scenes where Ganta actually does something mildly heroic are too little, too late. I just couldn't relate to Ganta and that is the main reason Deadman Wonderland fell down for me.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for mindless gore this isn't a bad series for it and all in all, its okay.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Telling from the ending this series had, this is definitely going to get another season. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Welcome to Deadman Wonderland! A privately owned prison where the prisoners perform for an audience, in hopes of winning the games and lengthening their life. Sounds like fun, right? Right. It makes an excellent anime anyways. \r\nThis review is based off the first 3 episodes. Overall: 10/10\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nGanta Igarashi witnesses his entire class slaughtered by a Red Figure. He is framed and convicted as guilty, sentenced to death and thus sent to Deadman Wonderland- and that's where the real 'fun' begins. To survive, he must compete in insane games and win, in order to keep himself alive. \r\nIt is a unique storyline that really drawsin the watcher. You want everyone to believe that Ganta is non guilty just as much as he does. As you see Ganta face and overcome obstacles, try to keep some hope in his life and stay alive, you just want to smack the other characters that are making it harder for him. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe art is very beautiful, clear and neat. The gore scenes are not too bad; it was done in a very artistically well manner. The movements are clear and the transitions are nice. Very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound is appropriate for the anime, but nothing special. The opening/ending are pretty good, and there typical sound effects. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe characters are well thought out and true to themselves. The personality matches all of the quirks that the characters have, and make for believable characters. \\n\\n\r\nGanta is an adolescent boy who has to grow up fast in order to survive. The only thing keeping him going is to survive and prove he isn't guilty. He is incredibly disturbed by the event he witnessed and his conviction, and yet tries to persevere in an unthinkable situation. He cares about the people around him.\\n\\n\r\nShiro is extremely light hearted and energetic. It seems that Deadman Wonderland doesn't bother her at all; that it is really just fun and games. She helps Ganta out, even if he doesn't realize it at first, and she gives Ganta a friendly comfort. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI can't wait for the next episodes to come out! It is extremely interesting and keeps you on edge. The story and characters match together well and is done beautifully, making the overall experience very enjoyable. I recommend!",

            "content": "Before the Spring 2011 season began, most of the talk seemed to revolve around \"C\" and \"Deadman Wonderland\". But all that talk died out pretty quickly, and by the time we were a few weeks into the new season, those two shows seem all but forgotten. I've not seen \"C\", but I can tell you that there's a good reason why \"Deadman Wonderland\" sunk so fast: bluntly put, it's a bit sh*t.\r\nThe show is about the main protagonist Ganta's adventures in the world's only privately owned prison, Deadman Wonderland, a place where dark secrets resides and sadistic experiments and gladitorial style bloodsports takes place. Oh,and the \"Deadman\" in \"Deadman Wonderland\" refers to the special prisoners who have gained special powers that allow them to use their blood to do weirdass stuff like turn into blades. And of course, the shady dudes entertain themselves by making these special prisoners duel one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe premises of the show is utterly preposterous. I know almost all anime require the viewer to suspend their disbelief to some extent, but \"Deadman Wonderland\" asks for way too much. Considering the inhumane things that goes on in Deadman Wonderland (the prison not the anime), it's a miracle that it's allowed to exist at all, privately owned or not. As if to mock the stupidity of the general public that exist in the show, Deadman Wonderland even openly flaunts its cruel treatment of prisoners. It does this through its facade... as a fricking THEME PARK in addition to being a prison, a theme park where the audience gets to see gory spectacles such as convicts running through dangerous gauntlets, with the less fortunate ones getting decapacitated and that kind of stuff. Believe it or not, it even has kids visiting on school trips. Everything the audience sees is real, but they get away with it because they tell the audience that it's NOT real. Cunning, eh? Yeah. Those gullible public... they'd believe anything you tell them, heh. Anyway, even ignoring the dubious practice of allowing school kids to see gory entertainment taking place in a prison (which would have real parents up in arms faster than you can say \"Deadman Wonderland\"), it's a miracle that they manage to fool anyone with the lame facade. So it's a miracle of titanic proportions then, that only the odd human rights group smells something fishy about Deadman Wonderland and comes along to protest occasionally outside their gates when they're bored. \\n\\n\r\nEven after you look beyond the crappy premises, the problems never stop appearing. A lot of them stems from the fact that the characters mostly possess astounding observational skills comparable to the blind, and phenomenal thinking skills comparable to the retarded. The result is that the size of plot holes to size of plot ratio is similar to the size of eyes to size of faces ratio of the moe girls in \"Clannad\", as well as \"twists\" that are executed so badly that you can see them coming at least an episode or two in advance. I could go on and on and on about the catastrophic failings of the story, but then this might end up as the longest review ever. Plus, I need to pace myself and save some sarcasm for the remainder of the review, so I better move on now.\\n\\n\r\n\"Deadman Wonderland\" (the anime not the prison) gives off quite a strong \"Elfen Lied\" vibe with its appetite for mindless violence. A lot of the time the story feels like it's being driven by the need for more violence. In fact it is so graphical that they frequently do things like blur out a serious wound or make the screen annoyingly dark (so dark in fact, that you can't actually tell what's going on a lot of the time), presumably so that they'd be allowed to even broadcast it. This leads to some odd scenes such as rooms that were brightly lit only moments ago suddenly becoming very dark when the blood starts to fly. I was kind of expecting the ending to be like \"Elfen Lied\" too, but it's not ... because the show doesn't even HAVE an ending. It just kind of finished leaving about three quarters of the plot strands still hanging.\\n\\n\r\nOther similarities to \"Elfen Lied\" can also be found in the rather extreme, psychopathic characters, for whome we're apparently meant to feel sorry for after they show us a 5 minute \"tragic\" slideshow backstory that's complete horsesh*t. Given the characters in \"Deadman Wonderland\", you'd think the competition for \"worst character\" would be fierce - the painfully generic never-give-up type hero Ganta? The oh-so-original sadistic cute girl? The typical evil tyrant assistant warden? But no, the competition was blown away by the presence of one character, one who doesn't even need a hacked together backstory (mainly because they failed to explain it before the series finished) to win the \"worst character\" crown hands down. I am of course, talking about Shiro. Her character design is actually really cool, and was one of the things that attracted me to this series... and then she spoke, and things quickly went downhill from there. Perhaps the makers of \"Deadman Wonderland\" were trying to create the most irritating character ever, but I have a feeling that they were actually going for an \"endearing little retard\" type character, but accidentally ended up with \"annoying little sh*t\" instead. And how is it that hardly anyone found her presence to be strange as she wanders around the prison almost unopposed?!\\n\\n\r\nThe only the thing that stops \"Deadman Wonderland\" from sinking without a trace is the great production values. Some of the bloody action scenes are vaguely exciting to watch, though others are pretty generic. Its horror aspect can also be quite effective... or at least it would have been if the silliness of the plot did not constantly undermine it. \\n\\n\r\nAside from that, there's not much to see here. With its unreasonably senselss violence, unreasonably extreme characters and unreasonably bullsh*t story, the only fascinating thing about \"Deadman Wonderland\" is how it gets exponentially more stupid the more you think about it - it seems to contain stupidity within stupidity within stupidity. It's not every day you get to see such intricately recursive stupidity, and \"Deadman Wonderland\" pulls it off effortlessly.",

            "content": "Ok, so I've just watched the last episode of this anime, so how do I rate it?\r\nHere's how:\r\nStory: Good 7.\r\nGood in the sense that this is totally a unique anime, sure there anime like this where the protagonist was jailed, but not a lot has this kind of genre that involves, Sci-Fi, mystery, horror, action, and drama which were combined with blood, gore and raw violence (damn censors). Ok, so the muchacho (Ganta, the male lead) is a pussy, but hey! It\u2019s the blood, gore and the raw violence that are the stars in this anime. To recommend any other anime for this onewould be an understatement, co\u2019z this anime is only at par with other shows like \u201cDeath Race\u201d and \u201cPrison break\u201d to were it features life in an hellish prison were everyday it is a fight for survival long enough that someday you\u2019ll be able to get outta there either by parole or by escaping. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5\\n\\n\r\nGeezzz, I don\u2019t know which illustrator I should compare this to, but I really hate the way the muchacho (Ganta) and the chiquita (Shiro) were drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I\u2019d say that for a pussy Ganta\u2019s voice is a match for his role, for a retard (hey! I like called her that) Shiro\u2019s voice played up to it. As for the treacherous prison warden, Tamaki, I\u2019d prefer that he should have had a more gayish tone, and as for the head of the prison security Makina, oh, oh, oh, her masculine voice played well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nHummm, I think it\u2019s \"FAIR\" enough that I describe each main charcter in this anime as to why I gave such rating, here goes:\\n\\n\r\nGanta Igarashi- At one point I sympathized him, co\u2019z shit like that does happen to some unlucky fellow in real life, but then again it pisses me off as to how slow is it for him to accept the fact that he\u2019s in that situation and he has to do anything to keep his sanity intact, I also hated that he\u2019s oblivious that the very one who got him in that mess was standing near him all along.\\n\\n\r\nShiro- Ok so it seem that she\u2019s some kind of  lab experiment, a very deadly lab experiment, I like her cuteness and the way she\u2019s friends with Ganta, but, I really hate that she\u2019s the one who send him in hell (I\u2019m talking about the prison). If there will be a season 2 it is possible that she and the muchacho (Ganta of course) will have to face off.\\n\\n\r\nTsunenaga Tamaki \u2013 I can\u2019t say if he\u2019s a retard or has some fetish with children\u2019s toys, but man, he is one evil SON OF A B**** of a antagonist .\\n\\n\r\nChief Guard Makina \u2013 Aside from having boobs, her character exhibits a typical \u201cS & M\u201d dominatrix kind of thing, however it is difficult to say whether or not she\u2019s one of the good guys or not.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what\u2019s up with the \u201cFAIR\u201d rating in this portion? Well such rating only applied to these characters, and since this anime has a hanged ending there is still a lot to getting to know the other characters in this anime\u2026\u2026..and that\u2019s that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nThought, the blood, gore and raw violence were the stars of this anime, there it is the mystery that surrounds the characters that makes it enjoyable in a sense that one would be curious to find out as whether or not if the mucahcho will be able to escape to freedom, though, what happen is not what one would expect still there is a mystery of whether there will be a season 2 of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Ok, since this anime left us hanging, I think that it is \u201cPOOR\u201d enough that we were also left to wonder if there will be a season 2, and if there will be one, can we expect that the muchacho will break out or will something else would happen to him and the others. But you know this anime has a bit of slice of life in it, which in reality it does happen which involves inmates in correctional facilities all over the world.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland, what can i say about this anime? Well for starters lets just get the story out of the way. Deadman Wonderland follows Ganta Igarashi and is set in modern day Japan one day his whole class is murdered by a mysterious red man and through actions against his control he is found guilty of murdering his 30 something classmates and sentenced to death. Now in this version of Japan about a decade before these events there's a great Tokyo earthquake that left not just the city but all of Japan devastated. After this a prison is built called you guested it Deadman Wonderlandthe first prison to make money off the prisoners with rides and such and this is where Ganta is sent.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that's out of the way let's talk about the things this anime does right and the things it does wrong.\\n\\n\r\nFirst the story. For someone who read the manga up to it's current point I love the story it tells however with this anime you don't really feel that it picks what story it wants to tell. At one point Ganta's doing this another he's doing that and so on the way the story comes across isn't bad but it isn't that good either.\\n\\n\r\nNext the Art. The art for this anime is done very well its the art style the manga did and the manga and anime did it well. Almost everything is done very well except a few moments were there is censoring but i guess that can't be helped but still worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Sound. Sound overall is pretty good things make the sounds you would imagine for the most part. My main issue with the sound is the cussing i understand people cuss and swear but there's a lot of it and I know they did quite a bit in the manga some lines are even pulled right from the manga but some of it should have changed a little for context at certain points they don't do it right or it sounds weird which just ruins the moment it was going for. Something else is that they tried to stay real with the sound i guess you could say but at moments they really should have went up a notch or two. *Slight Spoiler Skip To next Paragraph* At two points i was kinda disappointed cause they were eh when they happened and whoa when i read them at one point a dude get sliced with a sword and barely anything another moment that was super eh was someone kicks the shit out of a giant robot and its doesn't come through the sound how much of a feat it was to do something like that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Characters in this anime are highs and lows. Some characters like Crow shine but not as much as he should have, others like Ganta fall short but only because the anime doesn't get up to his development which sucks since he's who you are following in the story. The characters after the 4th or 5th ep starts to rotate into characters that did or didn't shine in the manga but don't really get the chance to do either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd next we have enjoyment. At the end of the day did i enjoy Deadman Wonderland the answer is a yes, its fun its crazy and there's some nice twist but dialogue and some other issues just come out and bring it down time to time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Deadman Wonderland a 7 its good but only barley it really messes up in ways i just couldn't ignore and if i had compared it to the manga it would have gotten almost a 5. If you like gore, fighting, action, and a story you won't fully get unless there is a season 2 or read the manga then check out Deadman Wonderland",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland is something you wouldnt Expect.\r\nThe first episode consists of the main protaganist (Ganta) going to school and his whole class being murdered right in front of his face by a mysterious person in which Ganta refers to as the RED MAN, after watching all his friends die, Ganta is seen in the court room where an odd video pops up that puts him in jail for the death of his classmates. His \"lawyer\" Tamaki says he feels bad but is the one who ends up making the video. Ganta proceeds to wonderland as a Death Row inmate, where he is first scared andconfused, and meets a WHITE girl named SHIRO. \\n\r\nNow let me say this , the RE-developing friendship of the two is something of wonderment, SHIRO remembers Ganta from long ago as a child but Ganta cant seem to remember. The anime has a lot of blood and fighting action, as the DEADMEN in wonderland use their own blood as weapons to fight, the Director who also happens to be the dirty lawyer, sets up brutal fights between the blood users(DEADMEN) for the whole worlds enjoyment. This anime has a little bit of each character, the dyabolical, sinister Director, the poor kid Ganta. Love interests in some of the people who bring wonderland to its knees. Its a very interesting anime with a lot of thought left upon the watcher as the final episode ends, but if you watch it you must pay close attention to SHIRO, REDMAN, and ACE MAN. In this anime you must make connections to get it. Its only 12 episodes so its very worthy of taking time out of your day to watch alot of blood and violence, and to watch an old but new friendship rekindle.\\n\r\nI give this 10/10",

            "content": "Yangires and Yanderes usually fascinated me in any anime title because of their potential to influence any story. Ever wondered how to make one for the short-term? It is quite simple. \r\nWatch or stay inside Deadman Wonderland. Just as the title suggests, its abuse of Deus Ex Machina, unlikeable cast, unexplained details, unnecessary deaths, insane laughter, and butchered accelerated, not fast-paced, story will turn you into a crazy psychopath, laughing maniacally like Light Yagami from Death Note. Amusement parks could start appearing in your dreams to cope with your psychological disorders. The only way to avoid this is zero expectations, inexperience in the otaku world,and ignorance. I am serious. \\n\\n\r\nBiased and crazy? Since I completed this recently, I am and still have some sanity left. Let us begin exploring this madness before I laugh like the main characters in the given links. \\n\r\nLight Yagami: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDmb4YQqizQ\\n\r\nLelouch Lamperouge: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGJbYpeDMZg\\n\\n\r\nProduction values are medium at the very least. They are not outstanding but unquestionably (YMMV) fitting. The opening and ending themes brought me out of my misery whenever I watch this  so I never skipped them and watch the preview of preceding episodes. They both start and end the show well every time. Voice acting is fair as well. The style and quality of the art are normal like most of Shounen titles with extra focus on their supernatural abilities. I don\u2019t have any negative issues with these factors at all. \\n\\n\r\nFor the rest, this is where it all falls. The main character Ganta Igarashi survives a quick massacre done by the Red Man but is arrested in a very unreasonable manner with no public support at all, not even his own relatives, and receives a death sentence. He goes to Deadman Wonderland, a questionable private prison where prisoners are guinea pigs for the audience\u2019s entertainment. Just as any teenager, he is in shock because his previous life is gone for good. His characterization is a mix of Shinij Ikari, Shiro Emiya, and Madoka Kaname. He runs away but never quits in certain lost situations. He is unskilled and charges without thinking. His behaviour and comments are foolish in important situations. Without others, he is completely screwed. As such, he should have died in the first week of his stay but the writers  played similar cards to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica: audience sympathy and Deus Ex Machina. It is used in most, if not all, of the episodes. He even made something similar to Naruto\u2019s Rasengan and fired it. It always amazes me how he escapes his situations because he has absolutely no chance of survival especially the first event he participated in. There are only a few things you could do whenever a Deus Ex Machina are invoked for Ganta\u2019s survival: cover your eyes and ears in disappointment and fear of being stupefied, laugh hysterically, throw a tantrum, drop this anime.\\n\\n\r\nShiro is the avatar for some of the Deus Ex Machina. She is extremely powerful, childlike, and faithful to Ganta. Appearing out of nowhere and instantly solving about half of his problems, she is god-like. Without her, the torture would have ended a lot earlier, saving us from psychotherapy. More details could spoil the story so I\u2019ll stop here. \\n\\n\r\nFor the supporting characters, they are all fine but lack the focus on characterization. Certain characters suddenly show up such as Mockingbird, introduced in the last quarter. The flashback about the major villain in the last episode (not sure if it was ep. 11 or 12) is arguably unnecessary since it does not majorly influence the story anymore. Senji is the only likeable character in this series. If he was the main character, then it is definitely a more interesting although still typical since it is Battle Royale. His match with Ganta is questionable though. \\n\\n\r\nThe side stories with Tamki and Makina is the only interesting part as far as storytelling goes. Exploring the deeper secrets of the hidden section of the prison or political conflict regarding the confidentiality about the Deadmen, are far more interesting than Ganta\u2019s retarded struggle. Besides that, there is no ending and the final arc is full of Deus Ex Machinas. No more unnecessary deaths, cheated unescapable situations, Plot and Character Induced Stupidity! Don\u2019t waste good ideas and the success of the manga adaptation. \\n\\n\r\n12 episodes is simply not enough to cover all of their background and motives. Some lack detail and some are too late. If the staff wanted to make another season of this, it should be a faithful adaptation, not a butchered animal for leftovers.",

            "content": "Strange things can happen to a person when they're in prison so the general rules of thumb are to keep a low profile, stay out of the way of other people, and avoid dropping the soap in the shower. For the inmates of Japan's only privately owned prison (which for some reason is run as a theme park and is built on Ground Zero of the Great Tokyo Earthquake), the ablutive antics of their fellow \"guests\" are the least of their worries, especially when the warden takes the term \"punishment game\" to a whole new level. The stage is set. The \"Running Man\" style collarsare on. The next event is a lethal variation of Takeshi's Castle.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to Deadman Wonderland.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the manga by Kataoka Jinsei (story), and Kondou Kazuma (art), the story begins with middle school student Igarashi Ganta, a fairly normal teenager with a reasonably mundane life - going to school, hanging out with friends, etc. All of that changes when his entire class are slaughtered while still in school, and as the only survivor he is found guilty of mass murder and sentenced to death. He is sent to Deadman Wonderland to wait out the time before his execution, but the powers that be in the prison have their eyes on Ganta so he must now navigate a labyrinth of conspiracies, greed, betrayal, murder, revolution, gladiatorial combat, and enough blood to make a clan of vampires drool.\\n\\n\r\nWhich immediately brings up the first problem with this series.\\n\\n\r\nAt its heart Deadman Wonderland is nothing more than a bloodier version of the common or garden shounen tale, but bolted onto the framework concept is a plot that has been worked over far too many times, so much so that it's highly predictable and almost barren of any original thought. Far too much importance has been placed on making the content \"cool\" in an effort to appeal to viewers who just want violence, blood and explosions, and with the added yet pointless melodramatic scenes designed to elicit audience sympathy, the storyline never really picks up enough narrative pace to maintain the viewer's interest. There are also a few critical errors that anyone with a basic understanding of investigative techniques would immediately spot and question, but we'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nNow this may confuse some people because Deadman Wonderland does have a lot going on in each episode, so an explanation is probably in order. This anime uses an event driven plot rather than a character driven one, and because of that the protagonist and his fellow inmates are simply along for the ride. They become nothing more than reactionary elements in the storyline, and in an effort to compensate for that the author and his adaptation colleagues have thrown as many different ideas at the series as they could. In truth, the only thing holding the entire narrative together so that it could be considered a story instead of a collection of random events, is Ganta, which gives an idea of the scale of the problem.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Ganta isn't really terrible, but the nature of the plot ensures that his characterisation remains linear and one dimensional, and while it may appear to some that he matures as an individual, this is actually a forced measure that serves only one purpose - to make his win against the next big bad opponent a bit more believable. Unfortunately, Deadman Wonderland isn't really about developing the characters in any meaningful way, and this is borne out by the fact that the supporting cast only get a few paltry flashbacks even though some of them have a lasting effect on the storyline. The oddity is that probably the most intriguing character is Ganta's childhood friend Shiro, a resident of Deadman Wonderland who isn't a prisoner. She is an anomaly who appears to have a childlike personality, but her very presence in the storyline, together with her looks, is enough to set alarm bells ringing for anyone who knows the trope about mysterious white haired characters.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that this is an adaptation of a manga there's automatically a severe limitation placed on design, but Manglobe have done their best with what has been given to them, and the results are actually pretty good. The animation is smooth and there are some nice visual effects scattered throughout the series, the character movements are fluid and have a natural feel, and the action set pieces have a visceral edge to them that the manga lacks. There are a few issues though, but these lie in the smaller details as there are some design influences from other works (Ganta's likeness to Renton Thurston from Eureka 7, which is also a work by the Kataoka and Kondou). In addition to this, there's a tendency to fall back on certain stereotypes (the rather obvious musclebound oaf who likes nothing more than fighting strong opponents), which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can get tedious to see certain character archetypes all the time. Thankfully these niggles aren't really enough to prevent viewers from enjoying the series, especially if one is able to move past the rather slapdash storyline.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, would it kill anyone to use some real world stereotypes, maybe something like the bad tempered little guy who doesn't know how to fight properly but makes up for it in sheer ferocity?\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland has a rather eclectic variety of background music on offer that ranges from dramatic heavy metal blended with techno, to a few simple notes played on a piano. The quality of the audio, both the music and the effects, is surprisingly good, and the choreography shows that some thought has gone into the implementation and timing of each track. The opening theme is a heavy metal piece called One Reason by DWB (featuring Fade), that has been set to a well designed sequence that utilises a three colour base, in this case red, white and black. The end credits feature a slow moving ferris wheel accompanied by images of many of the characters from their lives before they became inmates of Deadman Wonderland, all set to the tune of Shiny Shiny by NIRGILIS.\\n\\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, this anime doesn't really test the abilities of Paku Romi (Ganta), Hanazawa Kana (Shiro), or any of the other cast members to any great degree, but part of that is due to a relatively lackadaisical script. The dialogue lacks a degree of intuitiveness that can make conversations seem forced, and while the cast are capable seiyuu in their own right, they seem to struggle with several scenes in an effort to get the emotion across to the viewer. It's never a good thing when an actor or actress tries too hard, and this fact is borne out during a number of conversations in the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut then, that's pretty much the story of Deadman Wonderland - it tries too hard.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface this appears to be a rather slick production with some high quality audio and visuals, but no amount of beautification can hide a plot that is more focused on currying favour with audiences than it is with actually telling a story. The narrative can often seem like a train wreck (i.e. bits flying off everywhere, people screaming and running for cover, etc), as many of the plot elements have simply been attached without any real thought given to integrating them into the story proper, and this is why many events can feel like they're nothing more than fillers. In addition to this, the idea of weaponizing blood isn't actually new as Wei Zhijun from Darker Than Black can blow things up using his blood, while Saya from Blood + must use hers to kill Chiropterans.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, one has to remember that the story itself is incomplete as this is only an adaptation of the manga up to a point, and this is one of the reasons why there are inherent issues that have yet to be resolved. Unfortunately that excuse cannot cover certain flaws that really do stand out, the chief among them being Ganta's conviction. The series makes a point of showing a confession by him and this is given as proof of his guilt, but what happened to all the witness statements? What about the forensic evidence like the direction in which the windows exploded, or the angle of the attacks on the classroom? While the viewer clearly knows that Ganta is innocent, the apparent ease of his conviction is dependent on his confession, but nothing is mentioned about the physical evidence from the scene of the crime.\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland looks and sounds great, and if all you're after is a series that has lots of violence, blood, weird characters and a storyline that requires you disengage your brain, then this may be for you. The series may have it's problems, but the concept is interesting even if the implementation leaves a lot to be desired, and it does retain a degree of entertainment value for its action set pieces.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence though, Deadman Wonderland is nothing more than a potato that has been painted by Michaelangelo - it looks stunning, but it's still just a potato.",

            "content": "There was a trend back in the Good Old Days of anime (as in you only thought they were Good because you weren't Old enough to know any better) of hyper violent OVAs. Deadman Wonderland feels like a tread back to those days. It has the over-exaggerated violence, the ridiculous amounts of blood, the awkwardly crowbarred in sexiness and, most noticeably of all, it\u2019s utterly shit.\r\nTime has changed a few little aspects though. The OVA market of old has turned into the late night 12 episode anime series of today. This means it has more space to tell a coherent and fulfilling story, a capabilitywhich Deadman Wonderland approaches by totally ignoring it. 12 episodes are enough to tell a neat story with a beginning, middle and end. It gets the beginning right, tossing our protagonist into a scenario in which society have become so totally ignorant of the prison sector, so that even when hell is being created right in front of their eyes, they think it\u2019s an elaborate piece of CGI.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, upon reaching the 'middle' segment, Deadman Wonderland tosses that whole story aside and becomes about super powers. Instead of developing the characters introduced in the beginning, it decides to quadruple the size of the cast, each and every single one having a hastily constructed backstory introduced right in the middle of a fight to the death that ends up having either little or no relevance to the actual battle happening in the present day. Neither does Deadman Wonderland get the 'end' part right either. This is partly due to the fact this is an ongoing manga, but plenty of other adaptations of ongoing manga have managed to construct some sort of conclusion in their respective stories. Usually this is in the form of the main character growing and learning something (see Arakawa, Spice and Wolf or Genshiken), which Deadman Wonderland tries to do, but royally cocks up because the main character has fuck all personality.\\n\\n\r\nYes, this is something else that comes with modernity. Instead of the macho men that spout 'witty' quips like they're in an American first person shooter game (that is, when they ever talk at all), Deadman Wonderland sports a bland spineless teenage boy as its main character. To be fair to Ganta, he does actually do something other than make reaction noises while other characters monologue exposition at him, as is the trend in certain other modern day anime. He reacts to situations by either whining, crying or sobbing. It really isn't much of a personality, as any bland male would react to the cartoonish level of hell that exists in that prison in a similar fashion, and he really has nothing beyond that. There is chance for him to grow into a hero, and Deadman Wonderland tried to do that. Other characters would spout lines as to how much he's grown a spine and standing up for himself, but I failed to see that myself. He started off as a crybaby who could shoot off magical blood bullets when he felt threatened. By the end, he was a crybaby who shot off magical blood bullets when he felt threatened, except this time he could shoot off his magical blood bullets even faster than before. That's not character development! That's like saying a character has developed because he is now slightly better at picking his nose. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing the late night 12 episode anime has changed from the hyper violent OVAs of old is, now that they're on TV, they need to be censored. I can't really criticise Deadman Wonderland for this though, which is a shame because it's a really easy target. The gun that shot black balls of censorship through people\u2019s chests was one of the most unintentionally hilarious things I've seen all year. But if you were to watch the dvd release, the censorship would (presumably) be removed. It would be like criticising it for the screen being upside down because you watched it while standing on your head. It's not the anime's fault you watched it that way. But the fact that it needed the level of censorship it has tells us how much blood and gore there is. Often the gore has no point other than to show how sadistic the anime is. It's really just repulsive and juvenile, like a child who tries to show everyone what a big man he is by killing the class rabbit.\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland is like a modern day MD Geist. It's aggressively stupid and only appeals to those teenagers and manchildren who think sheer bloody mindedness is what is required to make something cool. People might defend this by saying a hyper violent anime is preferable to the insipid harem moe nonsense of the modern era, which is a load of cowpat. They are both as brainless as each other, just appealing to different sorts of immature mindsets. If you gave me a choice between Deadman Wonderland or, say, Fortune Arterial, I'd instead choose repeatedly slamming my fingers in a car door.\\n",

            "content": "I'm writing this review because a lot of the current reviews are complaining about the story being to short and some characters not getting enough screen time. Obviously, not everything is going to be resolved at the end of the anime because the manga has 45 chapters and the anime is only 12 episodes. That being said, I think the anime did a pretty good job in adapting the manga and you should read the manga after (or before) watching the anime. \r\nStory - (8)\r\nAs you know, Deadman Wonderland is about Ganta, a boy who is framed for the murder of his friends and sentto a privately owned prison. Shortly after arriving in Deadman Wonderland, Ganta discovers he can use his blood as a weapon. He is then sent to G-Block (where all the other Deadmen are) and the story begins. \\n\\n\r\nSince the anime is only 12 episodes, we only get to see the first arc, which is fine. In terms of plot, we don't get to see the start of the main storyline. The first half of the anime is getting introduced to Deadman Wonderland and the second half Ganta teams up with Owl. Most of the questions that are introduced such as the Mother Goose System, the Red Man, and Makina (lady in charge of the prison guard) trying to discover what's going on, while explored, aren't resolved. This leaves people with the sense that the plot was cheap and incomplete, but there are 45 manga chapters and the anime only got to chapter 20.\\n\\n\r\nnote: if you want to read the manga, don't start on chapter 20 because the anime left out a chunk of main characters and some events happen in a different order. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - (7)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, Deadman Wonderland was just okay. 12 epiosdes wasn't enough time to introduce everyone, so they left out some pretty important characters. I don't really mind that because we are already introduced to a lot of characters and more would just give less screen time all around (and they were irrelevant to the Owl arc). Even though they left out some characters, the only two characters to receive a decent amount of screen time are Ganta and Shiro. If you want more info on Crow, Hummingbird, etc. read the manga, they get a lot more development. The other problem people have with the characters is that a lot of them are introduced, then die in an episode or two, which leaves no impact on the audience. While this is somewhat true, it shouldn't stop you from enjoying the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nGanta \u2192 after 12 episodes, he showed a little bit of growth. He starts off as shy and wimpy. He needs Shiro to protect him in the prison. He's just average intelligence, overall a pretty normal character. He does notice how weak he is and tries to get stronger, so he's not useless the entire time. He cares for Shiro and hates the Red Man.\\n\\n\r\nShiro \u2192 She's lived at Deadman Wonderland Prison her whole life and she's shrouded in mystery as to why.  She is pretty dumb, but saves Ganta a lot. We get to know more about her past and why she's in DW and can basically do whatever she wants, but I'll let you watch that. \\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation - (8)\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty dark in the depths of the prison and the scenes that are mysterious. The prison itself is very bright and shiny, which fits the show because Deadman Wonderland Prison needs to give the appearance of being a nice prison. The character designs were faithful to the manga and looked good, with the exception of Crow, I thought Crow looked better in the manga, might just be me though. Animation wise, everything seemed pretty fluid, I didn't notice any poor animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound - (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending were pretty good, but I don't really listen to them (sorry). Background music was also fitting. Acting wise, I thought Ganta and Shiro's voices were perfect and really fit them. Everyone else didn't really have a whole lot of lines, but they did a good job. The only voice I didn't like was Toto Sakigami's voice...he sounded kinda like a woman, but he's really only introduced so I don't really care. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - (8)\\n\\n\r\nIt's does a good job of introducing us to the manga, even though some characters were ignored and events were re-ordered. The door is still open for a second season, which  I hope it gets because the real story was just beginning. If you want a gory show with plenty of death, Deadman Wonderland is for you. After you finish the anime (or before if you want) you should also go read the manga. In my opinion, it's better, but the anime version is worth a try.",

            "content": "Hold up your hand if you've heard this story premise before.\r\nNaive, innocent and painfully average teenage boy is thrown into a violent game of life-or-death, having no choice in the matter. He is forced to fight, and discovers he has a mysterious, hidden power. Over the course of the show, he learns to control that power.\r\nYou can put your hand down now.\r\nWhile the story to Deadman Wonderland is, of course, not going to be winning any awards, it still does make an attempt at telling it. The entirety of the plot revolves around the many characters in the infamous Deadman Wonderland prison, a place whereyou can trust no-one, where death roams around every corner and ironically, where the people are very boring. If I had a dollar for every character in this show with a tacked-on, forced, and extremely underdeveloped back-story, I would have enough cash to supply the pen and paper to write better ones. Even Senji Kiyomasa (The Crow), a character that got an entire OVA post-season, feels underdeveloped. I do not care for any of these people, and most importantly, don't like these people. It's amazing that a series like this with such a long list of characters manages to fail to capture my interest. I recommend that you tune in for the fights and the plot developments, and tune out during the back-story segments. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode starts off like an episode of the 1990's American television show, Goosebumps. A generic high school boy named Ganta is thrown into an absurd, nightmare-esque situation where every person in his class is killed violently in a mass murder by a figure affectionately nicknamed by him as ''The Red Man''. Being the only survivor, the police officers and detectives put their brilliant minds together to come to the conclusion that Ganta killed everyone, based on the evidence of being the only person found alive. Terrific. The only apparent evidence suggesting he did it is a 30 second recording of him laughing off the murders as nothing. This hardly believable work of CGI is the only piece linking him to the murderer, and suddenly, it's off to prison, on a death sentence. Super.\\n\\n\r\nOnce there, he learns of the dark secret behind the prison. Morals go out the window as Ganta is forced to participate in childish games to survive. Apparently this is still an episode of Goosebumps. He forms a close friendship with a creepy, pale girl named Rei, uh, I mean Shiro. Stuff happens. People die. Shinji, no... Ganta does a complete 180\u00b0 in character development, and by the finale of the season, he is back to a snivelling, pathetic mess. We are introduced to characters who get killed off episodes later, with no back-story. At all. The show is an under-cooked mess, and as for the ending, disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was handled by Manglobe, the animators for The World God Only Knows, and Samurai Champloo. The art style is very reminiscent of their work on Ergo Proxy. Nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done. The animation in the opening, especially some of Shiro's segments, is pretty neat. The art is uncomfortably inconsistent, often very lazy during the dialogue and slower scenes, and well done during the action scenes. At least it's not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special. Overused, clich\u00e9 blood splatters and other shock-value sound effects are rife throughout the season. The opening song is a very cheesy and teenage hard rock number, which ultimately got on my nerves on the mere second viewing. The closing however, is something else. A gorgeous song that invokes some powerful and melancholy emotions about life before Ganta was forced into the prison. The background music throughout the series is fairly forgettable, excepting a bittersweet piano melody that I heard often during the slower scenes. Regardless of that, nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you desire to watch it, watch it. It's an incredibly average story, with many flat, bland characters (excluding Shiro, the only character in the entire season who I was genuinely infatuated with. She is very reminiscent of Lucy from Elfen Lied).  Don't take this show seriously. It's zany, heavily-stylised, nonsensical and very gory. It relies on basic shock-value and gross-out moments to capture the audience's attention, but ultimately, comes across as childish and edgy. They are a few moments that made me smile, though. Just know, if you're not planning to watch it, you're not missing out on anything special. If you did enjoy it, hope you like waiting for season two. It's either that or the manga.",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland is a a series that showed a lot of promise after a couple of episodes, but ultimately falls to the 12 episode only bug. While the series has an interesting concept, and a great deal of shock value, it falls flat on execution. \r\nOur story involves around Ganta, a typically middle school kid who is framed for the murder of his classmates, who were really killed by what he refers to as \"The Red Man\". He gets sent to a private prison known as \"Deadman Wonderland\", which is more like a gladiator holding place than a prison. His goal is to find theRed Man and kill him. Oh, he also gets this weird blood power which allows him to use his own blood as a weapon. \\n\\n\r\nThe main issue with the show are the characters. Ganta is a kid in a brutal world, but he does not show any real growth at all. Shiro on the other hand is more like a flaw to Deadman Wonderland itself. Her upbeat and rather innocent personality almost represents hope in the show.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Ganta and Shiro there are not many characters worth mentioning. Crow, is probably the coolest character in the show, but only gets a side character spot. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the pacing seems off. There are a few pick me up moments near the start of the show where the viewer can latch onto and think there's hope, but those are totally gone as the show progresses and it basically turns into a suffering with the main character ordeal. On top of this, the closing episodes reveal several things that are never resolved (but does leave room for a second season)\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are good. Maybe not the greatest ever, but not distracting at all. Voice acting is fine too, I can't really think of a character whose voice annoyed me. There is one character, Mockingbird, whose voice is questionable, but you only see him a few times. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that will probably hook you after the first couple of episodes and drag you into it and then you'll be more or less obliged to complete it. Deadman wonderland is not a terrible show, but offers little in the way of substance. It's just lifeless.",

The first few episodes drive us through the series of event's that lead us to Ganta's imprisonment, now i personallyhad wrongly assumed the wonderland would be a dark and dreary affair, initially this is not the case, the prison is futuristic in appearance, lots of shiny scientific looking facility's and park itself looks like an amusement park all bright and cheery. We're introduced to the idea that the convicts are given a battle royal style neckband which will deal them a lethal dose of poison should they not take the antidote candy every 3 days, these candy's can be earned via participation is the wonderlands various death themed activity's, i would have assumed this to be the basis of the show, as we're introduced and grow to know and appreciate the cast and the environment.\\n\\n\r\nSadly not to be, Ganta (far to) quickly discovers he had some strange new powers and is declared a Deadman and moved to G block, the dark drab place i was expecting from the beginning, and all the stuff about antidote candy and the rest of the park is forgotten, now i've not seen Ganta consume any more candy, i''ve lost track as to if only 3 days are supposed to have past over the course of the entire show, or if it's a highlight real of months, and they just got bored with the idea? Never really touched on again, so thanks for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe show then drives us head long into the Deadman universe, as quickly as possible attempting to introduce us to the Deadmen (those with similar powers to Ginta) through altercations with Ganta and then the Undertakers, a Bleach Captain styled band of throw away Nemesis's for the Deadmen.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing never really has a chance to catch it's breath and never really shows us enough interaction or actual screen time for the various characters to give them any depth or real significance in the show. By the 10th episode we've still got the major character's such as Crow refusing to assist poor Ganta, and rightly so, they've met exactly 3 times ever.\\n\\n\r\nI'm at a loss of what to say about the characters, Ganta's kinda pathetic throughout and plenty whiny, and just doesn't get the time to grow, Shiro's random switches between psychotic and adorable are fun and all, and the various Deadmen we've seen so far have all been pretty cool, in the 10 minutes or so screen time they've had to share with god knows how many throw away characters, all of the under takers seem pretty cliched, but what can you do. I'd honestly say the cast has allot of potential, but your certainly not going to see any of it realised, if this is the first and last season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound, are really good, i love the opening, and this was most of the reason i started the show, i was intrigued by the opening sequence, and it perfectly sets the tone. No complaints on the voice acting, i thought Kana Hanazawa did a stand out job as Shiro, nailed the character for me. Art although not setting any new ground, is all high end, and i suppose is the up side to such a short show, i'm not going to go crazy over it though, i've no doubt it's the main reason this show still average's an 8+ rating while genuinely good shows like Fairy Tail sat below the 8.0 mark for months and months.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment wise, i just expect more from a modern show, the bar has been set really high, by the popular shounen crop of recent years, and this hasn't got there. I really wanted to like this show, my intrigue lasted a good few episodes, before i finally realised no significant ground was ever going to be covered. It's by no means a bad show, but it's one that needed to spend longer setting up the atmosphere and building up some suspense.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion the manga folks really should have held out for a better adaptation offer, this has by no means done justice to what i'm sure was good material.",

            "content": "Have you ever been framed for something that you believed you wouldn't have the capacity to do, and were punished for it? That unlucky scenario is shared by Ganta, the protagonist of the 2011 anime Deadman Wonderland. Deadman Wonderland revolves around the horrifying trials Ganta has to go through after he is sent to a prison camp sharing the title of the anime. The themes used in this anime include finding hope in a hopeless situation, and moving on from your past. \r\nStory: 5 \u2013 The story of Deadman Wonderland primarily revolves around the main protagonist Ganta, and the many horrible things that occur inDeadman Wonderland. The story relies on blood, insanity, and intense moments to keep itself going, leaving proper story-telling at a bare minimum. As you can tell by the synopsis, the story concept (deathmatches) isn\u2019t very original either, and often comes off as cliche. The anime switches its focus around 3/5ths into the series, but the speedy pacing and lack of originality leave the audience unable to properly settle into the show. As with other shounen anime, dues ex machina and plot armor take full effect in Deadman Wonderland, rendering life/death situations trite and unnecessary. Due to the show\u2019s cancellation, the show remains unfinished and so the ending suffers as a result. Deadman Wonderland doesn't appear to run on story, instead running on finding different ways of torturing the characters involved in it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \u2013 The production studio responsible for this series, Manglobe, are also responsible for shows such as Ergo Proxy, and Samurai Champloo. The character designs are slightly bland, excluding Shiro\u2019s design which symbolizes her strange appearances on the show. The art used in this show is somewhat dull and colorless, clearly emphasizing the color red. The animation is somewhat above average, and is especially evident during the battle sequences. Overall, despite the good animation, the art department takes a hit for its general blandness. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \u2013 The opening song used for the anime , \u201cOne Reason\u201d, is a medium-paced hard rocking piece, easily exuding the dark and gloomy feel of the show. The ending song, \u201cSHINY SHINY\u201d, on the other hand represents Ganta\u2019s life before the events of the show and is a lot more cheery as a result. The insert songs used are usually metal-themed, matching the dark tone of the show, but are easily forgettable. The music in the show generally does a good job of being in the background. The dub, done by Funimation, did a pleasant job in the voice-acting department matching their characters effectively with well-acted vocals.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6.5 \u2013 Like the story, the characters of Deadman Wonderland are hit or miss. The protagonist Ganta is your typical (sym)pathetic, spineless, yet good intentioned kid who just happened to be put in a horrible situation, however, I will give him credit for developing a backbone by the end of the series. Shiro\u2019s role in the story is the mysterious inmate who provides comic relief to an otherwise dark and cruel show and because of that, she easily became my favorite character. A lot of the supporting characters each have their own backstories told through flashbacks given during certain parts of the anime. Some of these characters end up being fairly well-developed while others are shafted for the more important characters. Due to the general cruelty of the show, there is a possibility that you will end up not caring much for the characters, as a lot of their time on the anime is limited. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7-7.5 \u2013 Deadman Wonderland is a pretty entertaining anime. The sheer amount of craziness inside the Wonderland keeps the audience on its toes and interested in watching the story unfold. If you enjoy blood and gore, then you will definitely enjoy watching Deadman Wonderland. \\n\r\nOverall 6: Deadman Wonderland is a flawed anime with a clear focus, to shock and titillate. Due to the clich\u00e9s, unfinished ending, and done to death concepts, the show may come off as underwhelming and hard to take seriously. However, I recommend Deadman Wonderland to those who like their anime, short, zany, and not too serious. Just don\u2019t go into the show expecting a complex storyline and really interesting characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6: Deadman Wonderland is a flawed anime with a clear focus, to shock and titillate.

            "content": "I'm somewhat masochistic. Typically when I find something that I think that I will dislike I will drop it after giving it a shot once I'm sure there's nothing I'll enjoy. However, when something is so bad that I am stupified at how many flaws I find in the writing of the show and how poor the characters are in terms of consistency, I somehow enjoy how much I can hate the show in question while watching it. This is somewhat of a disclaimer to say, that unlike most people, I didn't watch the series to enjoy any of its positives, but enjoy ragging onits negatives. Which might kill some of my credibility since I don't find credibility in a wholly negative or positive review for anything, and might've made me oblivious to the strong points of the series. I will attempt to find some positives in the series, regardless, but I could simply be oblivious to some of them due to how much of a bad experience the show was.\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland is a good choice for you if you're looking for edgy fun and if you're the kind of person, like me, that enjoys observing the peak of how atrocious the writing of a show can be. However, it's a bad choice if you can't ignore the flaws and inconsistencies in the writing of a show, because there's just so many of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs an action series, Deadman Wonderland looks good because of its good production values. As a matter of fact, the good production is what did not make the series a complete botch, since I kinda enjoyed its soundtrack. However, as far what happens in the action bits, there's not a lot of meat to go around, with the battles being very one sided towards a certain group unless the character gets a powerup. They are either meant to express gore, or they're meant to express certain shounen-isms. I know the show doesn't have the shounen tag, but the manga is tagged with all the tags this was supposed to be. I'll list them all as I review the series, so no need to check the manga. The shounen-isms I talk about are \"I GOTTA USE ALL MY POWER TO PROTECT MUH FRENS\" and \"I CAN BE STRONG TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!\". However they are not implemented well and they're often nonsensical to happen and they feel like a writing asspull, often seeming just like the writing got pushed into a corner and then \"wait this needs to happen ugh this character can bleed at supersonic speed now hahaha\". There's just a lot of things that adapt to the convenience of the plot as the series goes on, and as a result of such, random power-ups, or specific characters get depowered, with often not as much as an explanation. The supersonic thing ain't a joke, characters need to use their power at that speed so they will not be deactivated by certain weapons. Powers which could've been used at previous points in the series to obtain a different result. And characters that are clearly stronger throwing the fight because... yeah, I guess, right? \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the gore goes, well... silly you would ask, eh... hmm, uh heh... it's censored. And it's censored because there was never a release of Deadman Wonderland that would be uncensored outside of Japan. For what it's worth, the censorship doesn't really make things unable to be misinterpreted, but...\\n\\n\r\nYou might wonder why would a series that is considered horror be shipped as horror and be censored, since that is a clearly bad choice for anything in the horror genre. I mean shock value is important in a horror series, as you need to be unnerved to be scared. That's because this series isn't actually a horror series. Its writing doesn't really present anything that should be horror outside of the gore. The characters don't act any bit more terrified than characters from other shounens, there isn't really any torment inflicted on the main character other than that required for him to get into the circumstances of the plot. Any emotional damage he should've received is just dulled away to the point where he has a stronger reaction and impact to a person losing his eye than his entire class and his two best friends being killed in front of him. Honestly, the only thing I can see this series is as edgy, rather than horror, because it presents a lot of gore and none of the tension to back it up, where you are constantly in danger, simply because the writing is just awful and the main character doesn't suffer any real consequence, emotional or physical. He's as much a shounen protagonist as a protagonist can be. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the genres that the tags are missing on the anime release is the shounen tag. The series has generic shounen tropes such as \"the power of friendship and its value\", \"I can do it if I try, and that gives me a power-up.\", \"A weak boy who powers up as the series goes on because of his friends\" and other such shounen things. I doubt anyone would argue it's a shounen and there isn't really anything to criticize in a show because it's a shounen, other than it being genericly shounen. However, why would you be a horror shounen? Why would the power of friendship and being determined matter when you're supposed to be in a situation where you're supposed to be horrified. Why wouldn't you use his friends being fucked over, since they're there, to torture Ganta, to express fear and terror through him in the series? Again, because this is a shounen, and this limits your capability to do the same things a horror series would normally do, which are the opposite of determination in the face of adversity, that being desperation. Thanks for airing in Shounen Ace, Deadman Wonderland. What a scary thought. Ganta has friends and people he isn't close to, die. As long as he gets over his bests friends dying at the start of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sci-fi tag on the series is right, however, but not every element of the series is science fiction. In order to not mislead you, the cause of the powers is not explained by science and while the technology such as robots and lasers are present in Deadman Wonderland, the characters have the power manipulate blood due to \"blood holes\" which are basically red black holes. There might be a scientific explanation for the powers, however, it does behave very much like a supernatural series. Science fiction series tend to have some sort of pseudo science explanation that kinda limits the amount of bullshit they can use since they have rules. But Deadman Wonderland has no rules, so it can bullshit whenever. So note that the series is not only sci-fi, but supernatural.  The sci-fi plays very little into it, and for the most part the powers are strictly supernatural, with some pseudo science applied around it.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important and last tag of Deadman Wonderland is drama, which is a missing tag for the anime. The drama is undoubtfully the thing is the most atrocious about the series. In order to give you an example of how bad the drama is built into the show, I'll give you the series premise as an example. Ganta is a character who is falsely accused and brought into a prison on \"death\" row. Ganta has witnessed the death of his entire class and his two best friends. Now after such a traumatic event, you would expect the character would have some form of emotional distress but Ganta almost vomits once from shock and like, is a little sad for a while, then he shounens it up and decides \"I WANT TO LIVE BECAUSE...???\" and afterwards once more characters are introduced he is like \"MUH FRENS ARE IMPORTANT\". Now you need to understand, that Ganta, moves on from one of the most traumatic events a person can experience, then after he is falsely accused he is moved in a place where he is treat like utter dogshit and death is often an option. And then he moves on. Like it's nothing. He gets a little beat up and then he gets a power and suddenly, even though it hardly mattered even before moved on, now he acts almost constantly fine. The biggest consequence on Ganta after experiencing this tragedy is that he wants to kill the person that commited the act. After witnessing a tragedy, he is placed in a place where he is constant danger... and then he moves on without any reason than he wants to live... Even before this, he seems to be more pissed off at the idea he was flasely accused than his friends dying, since he barely shows any emotion in regards to what happened to them.\\n\\n\r\nWhy would he just suddenly want to live? I mean, your friends are dead, you saw them murdered, everyone thinks you did it, you're likely gonna be killed and tortured. Wouldn't you at least be depressed? Wouldn't you at least be angry and constantly showing a lot of emotion or simply just shut yourself off? Or would you act like a teenager of who's dog died? Be a little sad and then be like, yeah okay. His portrayal is so horrible that his personality and behaviour is almost a joke. There is no way anyone would act the way he does after experiencing the events he had. And Ganta is just one example out of many. For the sake of not spoiling any plot threads from the series I won't go into detail about anyone else, however, in order to dramatize the series, the show often does flashbacks to show us why x character is fucked up and behaves that way. Which is pointless when the character barely has plot relevance and you're not really gonna bring up again. I mean, the series seems to have ended in a way that pretty would guarantee a second season... but none was made. So a lot of characters that got focus could've been intended to have had an actual role in the future of the series. But the role they had so far, they almost felt like throwaways, that once they ever done with, they were just to be discarded and never to be looked at again. For a series that aspires to be a drama, that's really bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty much an excuse to bring edginess at every point. The characters are either forced to compete in death games in the amusement park so they can survive or they are forced to fight each other and the loser will lose an organ. It tries to make us understand why the people went insane and behaved that way, but really, they're that way just to be edgy. The series doesn't have any other point a shounen wouldn't have, mostly bringing up that kindness and friendship is important. It isn't unique in term of message and theme, and just tries to feature people that went insane because of trauma, with a protagonist that was oblivious to all of it. The characters more often than not experience a form of insanity that makes them want to kill stuff and be edgy and then all of a sudden, they're sane enough to have their behaviour change. These violent mood swings were ridiculous to see as the characters are poorly executed, the story had a really generic point in a setting that shouldn't even make it with a lot of inconsistencies in the mix to be added and logic gaps. \\n\\n\r\nFor instance, how would a teenager who was injured enough to be hospitalized, be capable of hiding a weapon that was strong enough to cause an explosion in a classroom. Even with his confession, that shouldn't be enough to jail him as he was physically incapable of executing the course of the action described. Also why would the warden of a jail be allowed, the jail he was sent to, be able to act out as his lawyer? Why would a prison have to undergo a people's rights inspection, when people come out for entertainment there and prisoners definitely don't seem to have their rights respected there, as they are used for the entertainment of others at the price of their safety? Now their safety matters? And there's more and more and more that I could just list but I think I made my point.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said at the start of the review, it's got good production values. Except for the censorship that filthy westerners deserve, the series has solid animation. What I especially in Deadman Wonderland was the soundtrack. despite the E D G E lyrics of the OP, it's got some really good sounding rock pieces.\\n\\n\r\nThe only factors I can recommend this series on are the E D G E factor. And the fact that you might be capable of consuming it in the same way as me, and that is enjoying the series for its abundance in flaws. There's no other factor I can recommend it on. Steer clear if anything I described is below your standards. I mean look, edgy stuff can be entertaining, I watched series  because I considered edgy but, I liked them in the context where they either didn't try to explain themselves, or at least they were plausible to some extent. But in Deadman Wonderland's case it even seems unaware of what it's doing. So yeah. Have fun.",

            "content": "I first heard about this anime through Crunchyroll's announcing of their winter/spring simulcasts, and my interested was piqued. Overall, it's a very good anime, and has the potential to stand out from the others.\r\nStory: The story starts out with the Red Man, as Ganta calls him, massacring his middle school class. Before he disappears, the Red Man embeds a red crystal-like object into Ganta's chest, which promptly disappears. He wakes up in a hospital and is placed on trial, where he is sentenced to death. He tries to flee, but maddened parents of some of the killed students attack him, and a fake video ofGanta admitting to the killing to Tamaki, his lawyer, and telling him that if Tamaki cleared him, he would tell Tamaki where he hid the weapon. Ganta soon finds himself in the twisted amusment-style prison called Deadman Wonderland, hence the title. All very original, and I look forward to the rest of the episodes, but the anime has the risk of being a 'getting framed for a crime I didn't commit and trying to find the real killer' type.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Truly different from most other animes I have seen. The anime has relatively simple characters, with wonderfully detailed settings, contrasting nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing special. The opening and ending aren't really noteworthy, and sound almost familiar. One good thing about the music is how nicely it keeps the suspense and liveliness of the anime going (During the opening scene of the first episode, Ganta and his two friends are discussing their class trip, but the piano music in the background left me feeling like something was going to happen.) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Very original, especially Shiro and Ganta. All of the characters have their quirks, and exploit them excellently. I'd love to see the back story on many of them, but I'm sure that will happen eventually.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very good. Kept me on my toes the entire first episode, not knowing what would happen. Keeps the blood done to a bearable level, and doesn't get into the gore. Looks like it will be a very good anime to watch!",

It gives off a eerie and dark aura easily putting you into the right mood for watching this type of anime. The characters are lacking a bit in development and hard to empathize with but with the series the way it is, there wouldn't be enough time even though it would be nice if there was more depth to each of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough short, Deadman Wonderland is more then enough to satisfy viewers including those who aren't too fond of the genre and is most definitely one of the more enticing series of spring 2011\\n",

            "content": "Every other review is calling this show unique. It isnt. It is just \r\nBattle Royale in a prison. While at least BR established a setting of a crazy future fascist Japanese govt to justify everything, here were given zip: just a psycho society that \"is what it is\" and we just gotta roll with it. I dont buy that for a second. Cutting corners from the get go is a big nono when trying to create a believable setting. This is as far from believable as it gets. While insane, Battle Royale's setting was wholly substantiated and explained.\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD! They are necessary and hilariously stupid.\r\nSothe story....\\n\\n\r\nIts like everyone in authority is blind and stupid. How can a kid do THAT (tear all the kids to pieces and destroy a class room)? Even if everything is so fucking cool after he is sentenced why the hell does story have to be so stupid and nonsensical?\\n\\n\r\nI mean...I am wrong to expect storytellers to try anymore with this stuff or what? The parents at the kid's trial were all scowling and upset and mad at that kid but do none have the brains to ask \"wtf is goin on here?\" This is nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nThe kid could have been put into that death camp amusement park in other, more believable ways right?? Ways that made some sense?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe if it was a govt and police and jury conspiracy or something.....\\n\r\nMaybe if just two kids were shot or something...\\n\r\nNo, whole class full of kids torn to pieces and room destroyed by a scrawny little boy and nobody thinks it makes no sense. Cops, judges, parents, inmates etc...\\n\\n\r\nThe boy's defense attorney is a crackpot too. We never see a defense and the boy just loses. Right...\\n\\n\r\nSo we find our protagonist in the death camp amusement park. There is this overgrown monster dude ex-karate-champ-inmate who runs the joint... or something. \"Im gonna win that race and get the money! Right gang?\" \"YEAAA \" his typical gang responds.\" He beats up our guy and another guy and then were in this crazy race with death traps.\\n\\n\r\nThe race...what the hell is this mess? I am supposed to believe that all these inmates have been here forever and NOBODY knows that this race is going to kill 99% of them?? Even the macho big gang-leader karate dude is like \"F this.\" The god damn race is held so often so how does noone know what it is like? Just stupid.\\n\\n\r\nOh yea, the one light at the end of the tunnel has our main guy gain superpowers and is followed around in the death camp by this cute all-white female naive inmate. Not explained as of now but really I do not want it explained. It seems they would mess that up badly.\\n\\n\r\nShould I not  expect good storytelling anymore? Should I just enjoy the entertainment of it all? Right? Anime...at least Highschool of the Dead was awesome and never took itself seriously. Battle Royale had infinitely more logic behind the actions of its characters. This is just a stupid knockoff...as of ep2.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes, anime characters are put into such unfortunate circumstances that you can't help but shake your head in pity. Now, this isn't the type of misfortune where you go \"Barnacles, I procrastinated and didn't do my boating essay,\" or \"Such misfortune! A certain Sister bites me all the time!\" The misfortune I'm talking about is when Heaven itself seems to abandon you, when it seems all the forces in the world are trying to guarantee no salvation for you. \r\nThe subject of this particular tragic treatment is Ganta Igarashi, who starts as a completely normal middle school boy with all of the nice, usual things.Family, friends, and a sense of security. Sadly for him, this was not going to last. On the very first episode of Deadman Wonderland, a mysterious figure, which Ganta dubs the \"Red Man,\" appears and butchers Ganta's entire class, leaving him the sole survivor. Framed for the massacre of his class, Ganta is incarcerated in the social experiment prison, Deadman Wonderland. \\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland isn't your everyday kind of prison. For starters, there is an amusement park built right on top of the prison, with the usual cute and fuzzy mascots roaming around. Here, the prisoners are used to operate the attractions and entertain the audience, with sadistic attractions such as the Dog Race and most importantly, the Carnival of Corpses. \\n\\n\r\nSince Ganta is housed on death row, there isn't much hope for him in this place. Tagging along with him and constantly saving his life though, is a mysterious girl named Shiro, who claims to be Ganta's childhood friend, and possesses near super human feats of strength and agility. Her presence is a mixed blessing for Ganta; she's rather clueless and childish, but doesn't hesitate to save Ganta. Deadman Wonderland follows Ganta's experiences in this bizarre world. \\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland certainly has an interesting concept. Modern day gladiators, supernatural powers, and plenty of violence. What's not to love? \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Deadman Wonderland is that it's trying to fit too many things into a very short 12 episode anime. Halfway, an important concept and fighting ability called \"The Branches of Sin\" is introduced. It essentially gives a mastery over using one's own blood in a variety of offensive and defensive ways. Somewhere along the way, a rebel group is introduced, an old geezer who never really gets an explanation, a very feminine looking boy, and Undertakers are also introduced. There simply isn't enough time in 12 episodes to flesh out these things to make it flow with its other concepts, resulting in little character interaction and development. Even at the end of the series, there are lots of unanswered questions. \\n\\n\r\nLet me elaborate. There is a staggering revelation near the middle of the series, a revelation that could very well shatter what little logic is present in Ganta's situation. What would happen if Ganta found out about this certain secret? Would he go insane? Would he crawl up and die? Or would he take vengeance? \\n\\n\r\nI don't have a clue, and you're guess is as good as mine. The series introduces this extremely interesting revelation and yet does nothing with it. Given time, this could help make Deadman Wonderland a much better show. And yet, this won't happen, because of Deadman Wonderland's lack of time to flesh out events. It's disappointing, but something in the future could elaborate on this and give a new dimension to the show. \\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, I've read a lot of complaints about Ganta's weak attitude. I really can't blame him though, since he's just a middle school student  who suddenly finds himself on death row. I think it's be unrealistic to think that he'd suddenly toughen himself and willingly face the dangers of Deadman Wonderland so quickly. The entire story takes place in less than 2 weeks I believe, after all. There are a few interesting characters that appear, such as the Crow, Kiyomasa Senji, who is my personal favorite character of this show. He becomes somewhat of a friend to Ganta, though he is unwilling to share the former's optimism of escape. \\n\\n\r\nWhile on characters, I have to applaud this show for introducing some truly hate worthy characters. I'm looking at you, Promoter Tamaki, man who plays with life like a toy. You too, Genkaku Azuma, you sacrilegious mediocre guitar player. And you too, Hibana Daida, unladylike gorilla who wields Zabimaru. Enough ranting though. \\n\\n\r\nAside from characters, the art in this show is pretty decent. Plenty of dark colors and tones in the prison, while bright colors are usually in the form of sadistic, cute mascots with a gun hidden in them or something of the sort. There isn't much diversity in setting, since it takes place in a somewhat futuristic prison after all. That means lots of corridors, cells, stone, steel and things of that sort. Fight scenes were pretty interesting, though animation quality takes a dip sometimes.   \\n\\n\r\nMoving onto sound, the background music was just that, background music. I didn't notice any real noteworthy melodies and such, but the music was appreciated where it was. The opening is \"One Reason\" by Fade. It's a typical rock song with, surprise, English lyrics. It's very appropriate for the dark tones of the show, and it's a pretty decent song.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ending song is a completely different story. It's an interesting song called \"Shiny Shiny\" by Nirgilis. It has a pretty upbeat pop style to it, an interesting contrast to the heavy rock and violence of the show. There are also some melancholic sounds in the song, another contrast to the happy. However, hearing this after the blood has been spilled in a particular episode, gives an interesting feel close to pity. The ending basically shows pictures of the lives of many of the characters before they experienced the hell of Deadman Wonderland. Innocent things like being with friends, embracing loved ones, and appreciating childhood.  \\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland isn't for everyone. There's tons of blood, gore, and some rather disturbing scenes (ahem, Penalty Game). The first episode is remarkably similar in levels of gore to Elfen Lied, so if you can handle things like that, be my guest and enjoy the attractions at Deadman Wonderland. This show should be viewed with enjoying the interesting atmosphere and action as much as possible. It's about a boy with all of the misfortune in the world, living in a twisted environment, trying his best to understand what it truly means to be a \"Deadman.\" \\n\\n\r\nIn Deadman Wonderland, we do our very best to kick the loser while they're down. So sit back, and enjoy watching our prisoners suffer, minds shatter, and play the part of fool, all while I watch.",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland is a twelve (12) episode series that was left open ended so that there is the possibility that another season of it could be in the making. The title of this anime seduced me into watching it with the element of confusion channelling me forward.\r\nSTORY 7/10\r\nDeadman Wonderland is a theme park that not only serves as entertainment to the public but also doubles as a prison for criminals in society. It is the only privately owned prison in Japan. It is here that the fourteen (14) year old Igarashi Ganta is placed after he is charged with the crime of murdering everyone inhis class brutally. At first, the prison appears to be an ordinary one but as Ganta begins to learn more about the prison daily and continue his quest in finding the \u2018Red Man\u2019, he realises that there is more to this prison and himself that meets the eye. \\n\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime was dark and gruesome and the artwork reflected such. The depiction of the amusement park was a stark contrast from the horror that was taking place inside. The prison itself gave off an ominous atmosphere which contributed to the intense mystery of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening score provided the key to the dismal atmosphere of the anime and the music included in the story played on one\u2019s mental because even though kaleidoscope music was used it was the irony of the situation in which it was used. The ending piece was sad, reflecting Ganta\u2019s major emotional state.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty diverse with some of them surprising you completely! Each character added a different edge to the anime, contributing to the story and keeping the audience guessing as to the true nature or intentions of some of them. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 8/10\\n\r\nThe mystery of the anime kept me intrigued because of the journey that is undertaken with the main character Ganta; empathising with him and also wanting to know more about why he was made to suffer for a crime that he did not commit. I was highly impressed with the amount of violence and gore in this series, so much so, that even some of it had to be censored! However, I was disappointed that the story shifted focus after episode six which annoyed me a little but realised that the ending was open thereby leaving the possibility that there would be another season in the future to tie up loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime is definitely worth the watch, that is, if you can stomach all the gore and violence that comes along with it. You can\u2019t help but feel for the main character Ganta and hope that he gets vindicated. The only thing that ruined it for me was the change in the arc where the focus shifted from Ganta to another character Nagi, but nevertheless, a breath of fresh air in the anime universe. \\n",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland. Some people are terming it \"The most gory anime of 2011\"  , well I may have to agree. It's got gore, but is that what it's relying upon to be anything better than just an average Anime?\r\nDeadman Wonderland starts off with Ganta Igarashi, just a normal schoolboy...until his entire class is killed by a mysterious power wielded by the antagonist later known as the Red man. Ganta is pinned for the murder by ridiculous \"evidence\" and is thrown into Japan's first, privately owned prison, Deadman Wonderland. \r\nIn prison, Ganta learns that he now wields the mysterious \"blood power\" (branches of sin) andhe will be forced to fight against other users, and compete in brutal, childish games to survive.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't bad. For the most part it kept me interested and staying on to the next episode. The story does, however, try to be serious and fails because the world encompassing it is so silly. I do feel that it is pandering to a demographic that craves excessive gore, but it is not so amazing as to be what keeps viewers coming back. It's been done better in Hellsing, Elfen lied and even Highschool of the Dead.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are probably the main point of what diversifies it, art-wise, from other Anime's. I, personally, don't care much for the look of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound. Deadman Wonderland does have some ominous backing tracks  which helps to bring out the full potential of various scenes in the series. The opening is rather interesting as well. The voice acting is your typical deal, nothing special. I do feel that Hanazawa Kana was a lot better in Angel Beats! as Kanade than Shiro in this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was where the series fell quite short for me. The protagonist Ganta is weak, pathetic and generally just a pain to listen to. He gets down on himself, he is a hindrance to the other characters. This is all well and good, but these are the clich\u00e9 characteristics of a generic archetype and are suppose to be developed away from. The series loses touch and scenes where Ganta actually does something mildly heroic are too little, too late. I just couldn't relate to Ganta and that is the main reason Deadman Wonderland fell down for me.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for mindless gore this isn't a bad series for it and all in all, its okay.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Telling from the ending this series had, this is definitely going to get another season. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Welcome to Deadman Wonderland! A privately owned prison where the prisoners perform for an audience, in hopes of winning the games and lengthening their life. Sounds like fun, right? Right. It makes an excellent anime anyways. \r\nThis review is based off the first 3 episodes. Overall: 10/10\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nGanta Igarashi witnesses his entire class slaughtered by a Red Figure. He is framed and convicted as guilty, sentenced to death and thus sent to Deadman Wonderland- and that's where the real 'fun' begins. To survive, he must compete in insane games and win, in order to keep himself alive. \r\nIt is a unique storyline that really drawsin the watcher. You want everyone to believe that Ganta is non guilty just as much as he does. As you see Ganta face and overcome obstacles, try to keep some hope in his life and stay alive, you just want to smack the other characters that are making it harder for him. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe art is very beautiful, clear and neat. The gore scenes are not too bad; it was done in a very artistically well manner. The movements are clear and the transitions are nice. Very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound is appropriate for the anime, but nothing special. The opening/ending are pretty good, and there typical sound effects. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe characters are well thought out and true to themselves. The personality matches all of the quirks that the characters have, and make for believable characters. \\n\\n\r\nGanta is an adolescent boy who has to grow up fast in order to survive. The only thing keeping him going is to survive and prove he isn't guilty. He is incredibly disturbed by the event he witnessed and his conviction, and yet tries to persevere in an unthinkable situation. He cares about the people around him.\\n\\n\r\nShiro is extremely light hearted and energetic. It seems that Deadman Wonderland doesn't bother her at all; that it is really just fun and games. She helps Ganta out, even if he doesn't realize it at first, and she gives Ganta a friendly comfort. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI can't wait for the next episodes to come out! It is extremely interesting and keeps you on edge. The story and characters match together well and is done beautifully, making the overall experience very enjoyable. I recommend!",

            "content": "Before the Spring 2011 season began, most of the talk seemed to revolve around \"C\" and \"Deadman Wonderland\". But all that talk died out pretty quickly, and by the time we were a few weeks into the new season, those two shows seem all but forgotten. I've not seen \"C\", but I can tell you that there's a good reason why \"Deadman Wonderland\" sunk so fast: bluntly put, it's a bit sh*t.\r\nThe show is about the main protagonist Ganta's adventures in the world's only privately owned prison, Deadman Wonderland, a place where dark secrets resides and sadistic experiments and gladitorial style bloodsports takes place. Oh,and the \"Deadman\" in \"Deadman Wonderland\" refers to the special prisoners who have gained special powers that allow them to use their blood to do weirdass stuff like turn into blades. And of course, the shady dudes entertain themselves by making these special prisoners duel one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe premises of the show is utterly preposterous. I know almost all anime require the viewer to suspend their disbelief to some extent, but \"Deadman Wonderland\" asks for way too much. Considering the inhumane things that goes on in Deadman Wonderland (the prison not the anime), it's a miracle that it's allowed to exist at all, privately owned or not. As if to mock the stupidity of the general public that exist in the show, Deadman Wonderland even openly flaunts its cruel treatment of prisoners. It does this through its facade... as a fricking THEME PARK in addition to being a prison, a theme park where the audience gets to see gory spectacles such as convicts running through dangerous gauntlets, with the less fortunate ones getting decapacitated and that kind of stuff. Believe it or not, it even has kids visiting on school trips. Everything the audience sees is real, but they get away with it because they tell the audience that it's NOT real. Cunning, eh? Yeah. Those gullible public... they'd believe anything you tell them, heh. Anyway, even ignoring the dubious practice of allowing school kids to see gory entertainment taking place in a prison (which would have real parents up in arms faster than you can say \"Deadman Wonderland\"), it's a miracle that they manage to fool anyone with the lame facade. So it's a miracle of titanic proportions then, that only the odd human rights group smells something fishy about Deadman Wonderland and comes along to protest occasionally outside their gates when they're bored. \\n\\n\r\nEven after you look beyond the crappy premises, the problems never stop appearing. A lot of them stems from the fact that the characters mostly possess astounding observational skills comparable to the blind, and phenomenal thinking skills comparable to the retarded. The result is that the size of plot holes to size of plot ratio is similar to the size of eyes to size of faces ratio of the moe girls in \"Clannad\", as well as \"twists\" that are executed so badly that you can see them coming at least an episode or two in advance. I could go on and on and on about the catastrophic failings of the story, but then this might end up as the longest review ever. Plus, I need to pace myself and save some sarcasm for the remainder of the review, so I better move on now.\\n\\n\r\n\"Deadman Wonderland\" (the anime not the prison) gives off quite a strong \"Elfen Lied\" vibe with its appetite for mindless violence. A lot of the time the story feels like it's being driven by the need for more violence. In fact it is so graphical that they frequently do things like blur out a serious wound or make the screen annoyingly dark (so dark in fact, that you can't actually tell what's going on a lot of the time), presumably so that they'd be allowed to even broadcast it. This leads to some odd scenes such as rooms that were brightly lit only moments ago suddenly becoming very dark when the blood starts to fly. I was kind of expecting the ending to be like \"Elfen Lied\" too, but it's not ... because the show doesn't even HAVE an ending. It just kind of finished leaving about three quarters of the plot strands still hanging.\\n\\n\r\nOther similarities to \"Elfen Lied\" can also be found in the rather extreme, psychopathic characters, for whome we're apparently meant to feel sorry for after they show us a 5 minute \"tragic\" slideshow backstory that's complete horsesh*t. Given the characters in \"Deadman Wonderland\", you'd think the competition for \"worst character\" would be fierce - the painfully generic never-give-up type hero Ganta? The oh-so-original sadistic cute girl? The typical evil tyrant assistant warden? But no, the competition was blown away by the presence of one character, one who doesn't even need a hacked together backstory (mainly because they failed to explain it before the series finished) to win the \"worst character\" crown hands down. I am of course, talking about Shiro. Her character design is actually really cool, and was one of the things that attracted me to this series... and then she spoke, and things quickly went downhill from there. Perhaps the makers of \"Deadman Wonderland\" were trying to create the most irritating character ever, but I have a feeling that they were actually going for an \"endearing little retard\" type character, but accidentally ended up with \"annoying little sh*t\" instead. And how is it that hardly anyone found her presence to be strange as she wanders around the prison almost unopposed?!\\n\\n\r\nThe only the thing that stops \"Deadman Wonderland\" from sinking without a trace is the great production values. Some of the bloody action scenes are vaguely exciting to watch, though others are pretty generic. Its horror aspect can also be quite effective... or at least it would have been if the silliness of the plot did not constantly undermine it. \\n\\n\r\nAside from that, there's not much to see here. With its unreasonably senselss violence, unreasonably extreme characters and unreasonably bullsh*t story, the only fascinating thing about \"Deadman Wonderland\" is how it gets exponentially more stupid the more you think about it - it seems to contain stupidity within stupidity within stupidity. It's not every day you get to see such intricately recursive stupidity, and \"Deadman Wonderland\" pulls it off effortlessly.",

            "content": "Ok, so I've just watched the last episode of this anime, so how do I rate it?\r\nHere's how:\r\nStory: Good 7.\r\nGood in the sense that this is totally a unique anime, sure there anime like this where the protagonist was jailed, but not a lot has this kind of genre that involves, Sci-Fi, mystery, horror, action, and drama which were combined with blood, gore and raw violence (damn censors). Ok, so the muchacho (Ganta, the male lead) is a pussy, but hey! It\u2019s the blood, gore and the raw violence that are the stars in this anime. To recommend any other anime for this onewould be an understatement, co\u2019z this anime is only at par with other shows like \u201cDeath Race\u201d and \u201cPrison break\u201d to were it features life in an hellish prison were everyday it is a fight for survival long enough that someday you\u2019ll be able to get outta there either by parole or by escaping. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5\\n\\n\r\nGeezzz, I don\u2019t know which illustrator I should compare this to, but I really hate the way the muchacho (Ganta) and the chiquita (Shiro) were drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I\u2019d say that for a pussy Ganta\u2019s voice is a match for his role, for a retard (hey! I like called her that) Shiro\u2019s voice played up to it. As for the treacherous prison warden, Tamaki, I\u2019d prefer that he should have had a more gayish tone, and as for the head of the prison security Makina, oh, oh, oh, her masculine voice played well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nHummm, I think it\u2019s \"FAIR\" enough that I describe each main charcter in this anime as to why I gave such rating, here goes:\\n\\n\r\nGanta Igarashi- At one point I sympathized him, co\u2019z shit like that does happen to some unlucky fellow in real life, but then again it pisses me off as to how slow is it for him to accept the fact that he\u2019s in that situation and he has to do anything to keep his sanity intact, I also hated that he\u2019s oblivious that the very one who got him in that mess was standing near him all along.\\n\\n\r\nShiro- Ok so it seem that she\u2019s some kind of  lab experiment, a very deadly lab experiment, I like her cuteness and the way she\u2019s friends with Ganta, but, I really hate that she\u2019s the one who send him in hell (I\u2019m talking about the prison). If there will be a season 2 it is possible that she and the muchacho (Ganta of course) will have to face off.\\n\\n\r\nTsunenaga Tamaki \u2013 I can\u2019t say if he\u2019s a retard or has some fetish with children\u2019s toys, but man, he is one evil SON OF A B**** of a antagonist .\\n\\n\r\nChief Guard Makina \u2013 Aside from having boobs, her character exhibits a typical \u201cS & M\u201d dominatrix kind of thing, however it is difficult to say whether or not she\u2019s one of the good guys or not.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what\u2019s up with the \u201cFAIR\u201d rating in this portion? Well such rating only applied to these characters, and since this anime has a hanged ending there is still a lot to getting to know the other characters in this anime\u2026\u2026..and that\u2019s that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nThought, the blood, gore and raw violence were the stars of this anime, there it is the mystery that surrounds the characters that makes it enjoyable in a sense that one would be curious to find out as whether or not if the mucahcho will be able to escape to freedom, though, what happen is not what one would expect still there is a mystery of whether there will be a season 2 of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Ok, since this anime left us hanging, I think that it is \u201cPOOR\u201d enough that we were also left to wonder if there will be a season 2, and if there will be one, can we expect that the muchacho will break out or will something else would happen to him and the others. But you know this anime has a bit of slice of life in it, which in reality it does happen which involves inmates in correctional facilities all over the world.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland, what can i say about this anime? Well for starters lets just get the story out of the way. Deadman Wonderland follows Ganta Igarashi and is set in modern day Japan one day his whole class is murdered by a mysterious red man and through actions against his control he is found guilty of murdering his 30 something classmates and sentenced to death. Now in this version of Japan about a decade before these events there's a great Tokyo earthquake that left not just the city but all of Japan devastated. After this a prison is built called you guested it Deadman Wonderlandthe first prison to make money off the prisoners with rides and such and this is where Ganta is sent.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that's out of the way let's talk about the things this anime does right and the things it does wrong.\\n\\n\r\nFirst the story. For someone who read the manga up to it's current point I love the story it tells however with this anime you don't really feel that it picks what story it wants to tell. At one point Ganta's doing this another he's doing that and so on the way the story comes across isn't bad but it isn't that good either.\\n\\n\r\nNext the Art. The art for this anime is done very well its the art style the manga did and the manga and anime did it well. Almost everything is done very well except a few moments were there is censoring but i guess that can't be helped but still worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Sound. Sound overall is pretty good things make the sounds you would imagine for the most part. My main issue with the sound is the cussing i understand people cuss and swear but there's a lot of it and I know they did quite a bit in the manga some lines are even pulled right from the manga but some of it should have changed a little for context at certain points they don't do it right or it sounds weird which just ruins the moment it was going for. Something else is that they tried to stay real with the sound i guess you could say but at moments they really should have went up a notch or two. *Slight Spoiler Skip To next Paragraph* At two points i was kinda disappointed cause they were eh when they happened and whoa when i read them at one point a dude get sliced with a sword and barely anything another moment that was super eh was someone kicks the shit out of a giant robot and its doesn't come through the sound how much of a feat it was to do something like that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Characters in this anime are highs and lows. Some characters like Crow shine but not as much as he should have, others like Ganta fall short but only because the anime doesn't get up to his development which sucks since he's who you are following in the story. The characters after the 4th or 5th ep starts to rotate into characters that did or didn't shine in the manga but don't really get the chance to do either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd next we have enjoyment. At the end of the day did i enjoy Deadman Wonderland the answer is a yes, its fun its crazy and there's some nice twist but dialogue and some other issues just come out and bring it down time to time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Deadman Wonderland a 7 its good but only barley it really messes up in ways i just couldn't ignore and if i had compared it to the manga it would have gotten almost a 5. If you like gore, fighting, action, and a story you won't fully get unless there is a season 2 or read the manga then check out Deadman Wonderland",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland is something you wouldnt Expect.\r\nThe first episode consists of the main protaganist (Ganta) going to school and his whole class being murdered right in front of his face by a mysterious person in which Ganta refers to as the RED MAN, after watching all his friends die, Ganta is seen in the court room where an odd video pops up that puts him in jail for the death of his classmates. His \"lawyer\" Tamaki says he feels bad but is the one who ends up making the video. Ganta proceeds to wonderland as a Death Row inmate, where he is first scared andconfused, and meets a WHITE girl named SHIRO. \\n\r\nNow let me say this , the RE-developing friendship of the two is something of wonderment, SHIRO remembers Ganta from long ago as a child but Ganta cant seem to remember. The anime has a lot of blood and fighting action, as the DEADMEN in wonderland use their own blood as weapons to fight, the Director who also happens to be the dirty lawyer, sets up brutal fights between the blood users(DEADMEN) for the whole worlds enjoyment. This anime has a little bit of each character, the dyabolical, sinister Director, the poor kid Ganta. Love interests in some of the people who bring wonderland to its knees. Its a very interesting anime with a lot of thought left upon the watcher as the final episode ends, but if you watch it you must pay close attention to SHIRO, REDMAN, and ACE MAN. In this anime you must make connections to get it. Its only 12 episodes so its very worthy of taking time out of your day to watch alot of blood and violence, and to watch an old but new friendship rekindle.\\n\r\nI give this 10/10",

            "content": "Yangires and Yanderes usually fascinated me in any anime title because of their potential to influence any story. Ever wondered how to make one for the short-term? It is quite simple. \r\nWatch or stay inside Deadman Wonderland. Just as the title suggests, its abuse of Deus Ex Machina, unlikeable cast, unexplained details, unnecessary deaths, insane laughter, and butchered accelerated, not fast-paced, story will turn you into a crazy psychopath, laughing maniacally like Light Yagami from Death Note. Amusement parks could start appearing in your dreams to cope with your psychological disorders. The only way to avoid this is zero expectations, inexperience in the otaku world,and ignorance. I am serious. \\n\\n\r\nBiased and crazy? Since I completed this recently, I am and still have some sanity left. Let us begin exploring this madness before I laugh like the main characters in the given links. \\n\r\nLight Yagami: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDmb4YQqizQ\\n\r\nLelouch Lamperouge: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGJbYpeDMZg\\n\\n\r\nProduction values are medium at the very least. They are not outstanding but unquestionably (YMMV) fitting. The opening and ending themes brought me out of my misery whenever I watch this  so I never skipped them and watch the preview of preceding episodes. They both start and end the show well every time. Voice acting is fair as well. The style and quality of the art are normal like most of Shounen titles with extra focus on their supernatural abilities. I don\u2019t have any negative issues with these factors at all. \\n\\n\r\nFor the rest, this is where it all falls. The main character Ganta Igarashi survives a quick massacre done by the Red Man but is arrested in a very unreasonable manner with no public support at all, not even his own relatives, and receives a death sentence. He goes to Deadman Wonderland, a questionable private prison where prisoners are guinea pigs for the audience\u2019s entertainment. Just as any teenager, he is in shock because his previous life is gone for good. His characterization is a mix of Shinij Ikari, Shiro Emiya, and Madoka Kaname. He runs away but never quits in certain lost situations. He is unskilled and charges without thinking. His behaviour and comments are foolish in important situations. Without others, he is completely screwed. As such, he should have died in the first week of his stay but the writers  played similar cards to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica: audience sympathy and Deus Ex Machina. It is used in most, if not all, of the episodes. He even made something similar to Naruto\u2019s Rasengan and fired it. It always amazes me how he escapes his situations because he has absolutely no chance of survival especially the first event he participated in. There are only a few things you could do whenever a Deus Ex Machina are invoked for Ganta\u2019s survival: cover your eyes and ears in disappointment and fear of being stupefied, laugh hysterically, throw a tantrum, drop this anime.\\n\\n\r\nShiro is the avatar for some of the Deus Ex Machina. She is extremely powerful, childlike, and faithful to Ganta. Appearing out of nowhere and instantly solving about half of his problems, she is god-like. Without her, the torture would have ended a lot earlier, saving us from psychotherapy. More details could spoil the story so I\u2019ll stop here. \\n\\n\r\nFor the supporting characters, they are all fine but lack the focus on characterization. Certain characters suddenly show up such as Mockingbird, introduced in the last quarter. The flashback about the major villain in the last episode (not sure if it was ep. 11 or 12) is arguably unnecessary since it does not majorly influence the story anymore. Senji is the only likeable character in this series. If he was the main character, then it is definitely a more interesting although still typical since it is Battle Royale. His match with Ganta is questionable though. \\n\\n\r\nThe side stories with Tamki and Makina is the only interesting part as far as storytelling goes. Exploring the deeper secrets of the hidden section of the prison or political conflict regarding the confidentiality about the Deadmen, are far more interesting than Ganta\u2019s retarded struggle. Besides that, there is no ending and the final arc is full of Deus Ex Machinas. No more unnecessary deaths, cheated unescapable situations, Plot and Character Induced Stupidity! Don\u2019t waste good ideas and the success of the manga adaptation. \\n\\n\r\n12 episodes is simply not enough to cover all of their background and motives. Some lack detail and some are too late. If the staff wanted to make another season of this, it should be a faithful adaptation, not a butchered animal for leftovers.",

It is a great manga, it actually kept me religiously reading it until the release pacing got weird. When news of the DW anime came out, I was ecstatic. A Deadman Wonderland anime, finally! \r\nBut when it finally came out, I was disappointed. The DW anime does not deliver an as powerful punch than its manga adaption.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\n Deadman Wonderland is about a boy named Ganta Igarashi who is accused of murdering his whole class and is sent to \"Deadman Wonderland,\" a prison of many secrets. Throughout his stay at thisprison, Ganta must survive in games of manslaughter and discovers a mysterious power called the \"Branch of Sin.\"\\n\r\nThe anime adaption of DW stays true to the manga. The plot is unique, but it may remind  you of series such as Battle Royale. Seeing as the anime is set for 12 episode, I don't believe you will see as much content as you expect to see, and you will still probably be craving more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art in the anime adaption of DW is very much the same as the manga. Animation wise, the series is pretty bad. The animation is very boring and movements are not fluid and the colors are not that appealing. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nOpening song is not that great, although it very does relate to the anime. Don't know whether this is just me, but I enjoyed the ending song. It's been a while since I've heard Nirgilis. The music played during the show foreshadows impending events and raises the mood for what is happening. Sound effects used during action scenes are not note worthy .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters in DW are very unique. Although Ganta is your typical shounen hero, the sadistic prison warden, mysterious girl in white, the law abiding prison guard, the normal prisoner who gets mixed in this whole mess, and G block; All of these characters make for a crazy cast in this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThe anime is not as enjoyable as reading the manga. The same things happen, making it very predictable. For those new to the series, they will be surprised at how the story unfolds. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is definitely NOT one of the best this season. It is a nice addition, but if you really want to enjoy Deadman Wonderland at its fullest, read the manga.",

            "content": "NOTE: The \u201cpro-con\u201d list at the bottom will be something new I\u2019m trying out, and thus may not stick to if it\u2019s deemed unnecessary or \u201cbad\u201d. Feedback is appreciated.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\u201cPeople fear death because they don\u2019t \u2018understand\u2019 it, and we\u2019re afraid of strangers because we don\u2019t \u2018know\u2019 them. Not being able to understand the one you love\u2026 is the worst fear of all\u2026\u201d\r\nI\u2019m actually a big fan of battle royals, and after watching Btooom! I felt like I wanted more of the \u201cpsychological killing games\u201d. I soon found (and still do, by the way) lots of people recommending Deadman Wonderland to MAL users who liked Btooom, sayingthey were both very similar in their concept, setup, and overall execution, and thus, I started watching Deadman Wonderland...\\n\\n\r\nStory: (6 / 10)\\n\r\nNow, I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t read the manga, or if the anime simply tries to make too many things happen at once, but the story could be really confusing at times, seemingly trying to focus on way too many elements of the story at once. At its core, Deadman Wonderland is about a boy who has everything taken away from him, receives a mysterious power and in imprisoned and forced to fight to survive, and eventually escape.\\n\\n\r\nThese are all good elements of a story (in my opinion), as long as they\u2019re done in a somewhat good way. To me it felt like the story was (probably because of the many different focuses) sort of \u201csloppy\u201d, not really explaining anything as they go along, and just simply moving way too fast. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing, however, is probably the fact that I\u2019m either misunderstanding this completely, or there\u2019s actually no real ending (no closure, not even a real showdown). So to me, the story just felt overall very meh, even if the concept was nice.\\n\\n\r\n(To avoid spoilers, I won\u2019t go into too much detail, but early on in the show, there\u2019s a scene where some prisoners have to run a sort of lethal crash course, in order to win an antidote for a poison that keeps the prisoners in check, and honestly I think the series overall could\u2019ve benefited from simply revolving around something like this (even though I know this is obviously based on the manga)).\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7 / 10)\\n\r\nEven though the story and execution might have been somewhat sub-par, the art really stood out. The art is beautiful, and the animation is smooth and very well done. Character is also pretty good, but something that bugged me was that the \u201cbranches of sin\u201d felt somewhat... \u201cunderwhelming\u201d, in terms of animation. Some of them actually looks a lot like each other, and overall it just feels like they could\u2019ve been made in a much cooler, better looking way.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: (7 / 10)\\n\r\nDeadman wonderland admittedly has a pretty good cast of voice actors, who all (mostly) do a good job in portraying their respective characters. One obvious (would-be) selling point for me is the fact that one of the main characters, Shiro, is actually voiced by Hanazawa Kana, and I believe she did a good job in portraying the \u201cinnocent\u201d side of Shiro. Other than her, I thought the voices were good enough, but really nothing amazing, and there were a few ones that just felt \u201cstale\u201d, if you will.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, an interesting thing that was pointed out to me is that Deadman Wonderland actually has the OST size of a 24 episode series. I\u2019m not really known for paying very much attention to background music at all, unless it\u2019s very prominent, and so I can\u2019t really add much to this myself, as there wasn\u2019t really any track that I felt stood out to me, or lingered with me afterwards. Granted, there were a couple of tracks which were made quite prominent, especially during some of the fighting scenes, but these all just kinda faded away as soon as that scene would finish. However, the way the OST sizes importance was explained to me, was that since this is only a 12 episode show, and it features so many songs, you never really hear the same song played more than maybe a couple of times, as each scene brings a new piece of music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (6 / 10)\\n\r\nI\u2019m on the fence about whether this deserves a 7 or not, but ultimately I\u2019ve decided to rate it 6, because of the fact that no characters really feel as fleshed out as I would like to. There\u2019s basically no character development at all, and even with the added backstory scenes of some (albeit secondary) characters, most of the characters just feel like they\u2019re there for the sake of being there...\\n\\n\r\nA lot of characters feel very \u201cmysterious\u201d, as if they later wanted a big reveal of various twists and whatnot regarding said characters. Unfortunately, this never happens, and what we\u2019re left with is an undeveloped, \u201cmysterious\u201d & unrelatable character. \\n\r\nAs an example of the character development, Ganta (the series main character) starts out as your typical \u201cwimp\u201d, who has just lost everything and thinks he\u2019s worthless in every way. Now, in most shows with this type of character, he would usually develop into something more \u201cbadass\u201d later on, overcoming his guilt/sorrow/angst or whatever\u2019s holding him back, but this never happens in Deadman. Granted, there are individual scenes where he seemingly overcomes all this and moves on to becoming a new person, but then it ends and he\u2019s still the same \u201cwimp\u201d as he was several episodes ago. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is probably that they introduce a lot of these \u201cmysterious\u201d characters, some which even only show up a couple of times, but we don\u2019t find out anything about these characters, and it all makes the show very hard to get into. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (5 / 10)\\n\r\nHonestly, this show was a major letdown for me. It really does have a good concept, and very well done art, but all the things mentioned above (especially the story) makes it all fall apart, making for a not so pleasant viewing as you\u2019d hope for. It had its cool moments, as well as some funny ones, (but even though it tries, it sort of lacks in the sadness department), and in the end it\u2019s all just a mess.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nIf you like me, found this show as a recommendation after watching Btooom, or something similar, I\u2019d advise you to either stay away completely, or at least go in not expecting something like what you were promised, because that\u2019s certainly not what you\u2019re going to get.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Nice concept\\n\r\n+ Great soundtrack\\n\r\n+ Very well done artwork & animation\\n\r\n+ Hanazawa Kana\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Messy story\\n\r\n- Undeveloped characters\\n\r\n- \u201cStale\u201d fighting scenes (most of it is just talking to each other, but they never actually get anywhere)\\n\r\n- Not as much variation in the \u201cbranches of sin\u201d as there could\u2019ve been",

            "content": "I found myself intrigued by Deadman Wonderland\u2019s title alone, as I was perusing the interwebs for a good horror anime.  This anime is well marketed in the states, considering I\u2019ve seen it all over Netflix, Hulu and Crunchyroll but I never took the plunge until now.  What I found was well short of my expectations, and a series that had so much going for it but squandered it horribly.\r\nWe\u2019ve all seen this premise before.  Innocent kid from a Japanese Middle School is thrown into a ridiculous series of events, eventually finding out that he possesses magic powers which he somehow masters withina few hours and blasts his way to victory.  Deadman Wonderland had an opportunity to divert from the stereotype in its carnival prison setting, but missed the marked several times.  Ganta, the main protagonist\u2019s class is interrupted by the appearance of a demon of sorts, killing everyone in an explicitly violent manner.  Ganta is left speechless and is seemingly chosen by this demon when it places a red gem into his chest.  The scene transitions to him being instantly interrogated by police and then is transported to a court room where he receives a death sentence.  Seems a little over the top, even for anime standards.  Where were his parents?  Why\u2019s his defense attorney the same guy who runs the prison?!   He seemed to be completely alone in his life, despite only being about 14.  I get it, it\u2019s an anime\u2026 but with a realistic setting, at least throw me a morsel of believability.  I found myself almost laughing at the ludicrous chain of events.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, Ganta is transported to the same prison his class was slated to take a field trip to, \u201cDeadman Wonderland\u201d\u2026. Doesn\u2019t exactly sound like a place I\u2019d take the kids to.  However, this is no normal prison; inmates wear collars that slowly inject a lethal poison into their bloodstream if they don\u2019t take an antidote encapsulated in the form of candy every 72 hours.  Oh, and the only way to get said candy is to purchase it using cast points earned from completing events in the carnival.  Talk about annoying.  The story escalates as Ganta learns more about a mystery power his body contains and about the interesting inmates in Deadman Wonderland, all the while trying to figure out how to escape the madness before his Death Row takes its toll.  Not to mention the mysterious skin-tight-suited albino girl he meets along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many beaming issues with this plot it\u2019s ridiculous.  After the initial messed up event Ganta participates in, before a packed audience, the workers state how they have to be on their best behavior for the upcoming inspection team.  Did no one see the inmates being decimated not a day earlier?! And did no one think that was a tad too much to expose the general public to?  All the inmates seem to want to escape, but has anyone thought about how to remove the poison collar devices??  There are too many to list, I could go on and on for hours.  I understand 12 episodes was not nearly long enough for the writers to get their points across, but I think a high school creative writing student could\u2019ve posed a better plot, or at least ways to tie up the loose ends.  Not to mention that the story neither ends on a cliffhanger nor a moment of closure.  Oh, plot holes, how I love thee.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t find very many redeeming characters from Deadman Wonderland.  Ganta is at least somewhat believable with his frightened demeanor, but that\u2019s all he has going for him.  He doesn\u2019t have very many likeable attributes, and other than his childhood memories of playing with a certain girl\u2026 nothing about his past is explained.  I had a better time understanding Owl as a character than Ganta, at least the writers made sense of his history with Deadman Wonderland.  Of course, it has to be said that Ganta does grow as a character throughout the show, but due to the small amount of episodes, it felt forced in a way\u2026 like someone was saying, \u2018You\u2019d better man up in hopes for a second season, or your story\u2019s about to end!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s Shiro. Man, oh man am I getting tired of this character trope.  It\u2019s the oblivious and innocent girl who can mysteriously unleash monstrous amounts of power on a whim, but is in love with the main protagonist, even though she probably wouldn\u2019t realistically even remember him.  Not to mention the unnecessary fan service slipped in with the occasional cute pouty face or the skin tight outfit with a red spiral pointing to her nipple.  What the hell is that all about anyway?\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is slipped in decently at least.  Whether it\u2019s the muscle bound Crow with a soft Senpai side or the clever and militant warden, desperate to uncover the dark secrets behind Deadman Wonderland\u2019s true existence.  There\u2019s also the seemingly innocent Yoh-kun and his sexually messed up sister.  None of the character\u2019s plot lines are ever fully explored though, and a lot gets tossed to the side to focus entirely on the main arc.  Owl and Gengaku were pretty much the only characters that stood out to me, and their backgrounds for how they ended up in Deadman Wonderland are scary enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Deadman Wonderland is actually pretty good.  The action sequences leave a lot for the eyes to ogle, and the characters look worn and terrifying in some instances.  I did notice some laziness during slow scenes, but nothing exceptionally bad.  The gore is taken to a whole new level, reminiscent of other violent series I\u2019ve seen before, and the opening scene in the middle school sets the bar for shock value.  In the instance the anime is rewatched in the future, I can\u2019t imagine it could look outdated in any way, due to the lack of CGI entirely.  What to say about the intro?  I initially despised it, but as I kept watching the show it grew on me and I actually ended up enjoying it.  It reminds me of the music style I was into in high school, being slightly nostalgic in that fact.  I also like the way the characters were edited into the intro without spoiling anything about the plot.  Sound effects were okay, decently strewn together, and some of the music seemed ominous and creepy as hell as it added to the overall feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there isn\u2019t a higher score I can give this anime.  So many unanswered questions and unbelievable story progression make Deadman Wonderland fall into a trap that is hard to get out of.  If a second season was ever released, I would more than likely watch it, but I\u2019d start off initially skeptical due to the unfulfilled feeling I was left with at the end of the first.  Too many stereotypes that could\u2019ve been broken in this series, but it didn\u2019t quite do it for me.  If you like shock and awe, and don\u2019t have the attention span for too many episodes, Deadman Wonderland is at least worth a look.  That being said, I hope you enjoyed the review!",

            "content": "Ah Deadman Wonderland (referred as \"DW\" from here on), the only 2011 Spring show i watched. Let's begin with this:\r\nStory: Ganta Igarashi is a 14 year old middle school student accused and later convicted of murdering his entire class, yet he proclaims his innocence and says he saw a \"Red Man\" actually do the killings. But his \"public defender\" Tamaki fails to help Ganta and gets sent to DW, a carnival where the inmates are subjected to humiliating and often life or death situations. \r\nThe story is pretty generic for the most part. Ganta tries to prove his innocence while trying to maintain his sanityin DW. He meets Shiro, a cheerful yet mysterious girl who quickly becomes Ganta's closest friend inside DW. He realizes that in order to survive he needs to take an antidote, called \"candy\" every two days or he'll die. To get candy, one must get credits, obtained from winning contests. Nothing exciting but nothing outlandish either. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: The best part of DW is the animation/art. Even though the blood/violence is heavily censored in the TV version, i found the animation to be top-notch. Each episode really does its best to show us the facial expressions of Ganta (especially episode 6), the Deadmen, everyone else in the show. But the violence is stunning on DW. People getting chopped in half, impaled, electrocuted, eyeball removal, yeah its pretty bad. Yet, ironically those instances are when the Animation truly shows its strength.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP/ED are nothing outstanding, but alright. The background music is just that, background music. Voice acting: Romi Paku is known for voicing every popular male character (see Elric, Edward) that's ever been seen and pulls off a strong performance as Ganta. Rising newcomer Kana Hanazawa (also Mayuri from Steins;Gate, Shiemi from Blue Exorcist) nails it as the aloof and cheerful Shiro.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I already talked about Ganta, but i'll add something to this. He starts off as your typical whiny shounen lead which gets really annoying as the show is 75% Ganta, 15% Shiro, 10% everyone else, though there are some instances where Ganta really shines (see episode 6). Only near the very end of the very short series, he finally admits that he's weak and seeks the training of \"Crow\" (aka Senji Kiyomasa), one of the powerful Deadmen inside. Their friendship stems as a result of one of the many \"contests\", such as Carnival Corpse, inside DW in order to get credits. I won't spoil what happened, but all i'll say is that the loser has to partake in a slot machine game where anything can happen (\"Lose your right arm, Lose your eyeball, Lose your hair (?)\").\\n\\n\r\nNone of the other characters really standout. Ganta suffers the mistake of being too nice to people, especially inside DW. He befriends Takami Yoh, a kleptomaniac searching for his sister but Takami is also in cahoots with the mainman of DW, the Promoter Tamaki (Yes, that guy who was Ganta's public defender, pretty twisted huh?). Later Ganta meets Iron Chain, the group who's plotting to breakout of DW and their leader Nagi. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Having watched no new anime since last year, i can say with certainty that Deadman Wonderland is a refreshing yet lacking anime in some regards. Only 12 episodes, the ending is very much left wide-open yet very unlikely the show will get any real closure (such as a second season, or an OVA). But for the most part i loved DW. Ganta, while flawed, managed to keep his sanity for the most part. Shiro is loveable, funny and quick to defend Ganta from anyone at anytime. But there just wasn't enough episodes to explain the most important parts of the show, such as the Branches of Sin, Undertakers, and of course Shiro herself, but it's a good show especially given its only 12 episodes. I recommend this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe good: Crisp, detailed animation. If you haven't read the manga, you'll love this more than those who read the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe bad: Unanswered questions, failed character improvement.\\n\\n\\n",

As far as the Art / Soundtrack go it was also pretty good, but what bothers me the most about this anime is without a doubt the MC (Igarashi, Ganta). I dont think I have ever hated a MC character more than the one in this anime, everything he does is just so damn irritating and I cant help but believe that he is nothing more but auseless pus$y and it pisses me off so damn much. During the entirety of the series Im just hoping that he would die and therefore I would never have to see him again. But other than that, the anime is quite enjoyable and therefore I am giving it a solid 6/10. <3",

            "content": "So have you ever seen anything that looked so super special awesome you just had to get it then once you get it you were let down by what it didn't do. Well thats how Deadman Wonderland is. I was really hyped to actually watch this because a lot of my friends were like its way better than anything I've seen yet. Sadly I was really let down. I won't touch base with the OVA as all that is a back story.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThe story is no way bad or anything it just feels like there area bunch of holes in it and even so itwasn't paced that great either. The beginning was really rushed to the whole \"Deadman Wnderland amusement park prison\" aspect where the main character was forced into such a hell hole within like 5 minutes of the first episode which in that time he acquires such powers he has no clue of their acquisition. Based off that, the story really had no where to go in terms of contrast and most the events were really predictable. This really led to an okay but somehow happy ending. It  really isn't the best ending but it feels like it promotes a second season which I do not foresee ever happening. Even with this in play I was actually waiting to feel any sort of emotion while watching it but I can say it doesn't make me feel any different while watching it as I said it was pretty predictable.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThis was really good and usually fit the mood of most of this anime revolving around the worst prison system ever created so yeah it was usually dark. However I did not favor the immense amounts of gross out scenes and cringey amounts of gore. I realize there are other series I have seen with way more gore but this whole series focuses on the gore and bloodshed.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music seems to be the most redeeming part of the entire series. No matter how you watched this anime dub or sub, the themes are the exact same but either way they got me pumped to watch this series. I really could listen to the Opening and Credits 100 times over and still love it but sadly that was really the only good thing the music department had going for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nLike the story the characters introduced really went no where. The anime tries to make you feel sympathy for the characters but these attempts happen way to early for you to feel anything for them so in a way there doesn't seem to be any real development. Also they added in way too many supporting characters who really didn't contribute any to the plot. Even with all the back stories nothing really changed about how I feel about the characters. Even with Ganta's and Shiro's childhood, its one of those \"They have good friendship then they depart then boy forgets\" childhood. However I really came to like Shiro.  She was really unique to the series as being one of those characters who didn't really bum me out every time I look at her. I also like the fact they didn't really push for any romance kind of actually caught me off guard in the end but other than them characters were really bland.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nLike I said in the beginning this anime is sort of a let down to me but I have no business calling it bad anime it Was actually good. I just think that this anime doesn't really bring anything new to mind after watching it and it didn't make feel anything while watching it. If you really haven't seen a whole lot of anime or just haven't seen any for quite some time this is actually a great anime to watch. While it may not be the best story for its time it still is fairly decent and if you were wanting to watch it go ahead its not horrible but its not the greatest thing ever spawned and theres nothing really new about it. However if there is any real sequel this may or may not change but for now Deadman Wonderland will get a 7 from me also if you havew atched this series you might as well watch the OVA. It doesn't really fit with the rest of the series but hey it won't kill  you right?",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland, in my opinion, is a really great anime- but it's an anime for a very niche crowd. It's super violent, pretty crude, and only goes so far into the manga's story, which some people may not appreciate in an anime adaptation.\r\nTo the anime's credit, the violence and crudeness never feels forced. It all feels very cohesive to the story's overall theme, and even when I cringed at some of the more brutal parts of the story, I never rolled my eyes and thought, 'Oh, this is all just for shock value.' Something about the way it was written made me believe that eachand every thing shown was needed and had a place in the anime, especially since we get to see the way that all these brutal events effect each character.\\n\\n\r\nI found most of the characters to be very likable or at least interesting, even though a huge handful of them are raving psychopaths- again, this is a trope that can often become eye-rollingly forced, but like I said, I liked a good chunk of the characters. There's only a few I didn't care for as far as writing or execution goes, and they were mostly characters who came in towards the end and got their time cut short since their stories continue on in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like dubs, I highly recommend watching Deadman Wonderland dubbed, because it turned up my enjoyment of the series considerably. The adapative script is just plain great, and the dialogue all feels very natural- plus you get to hear some awesomely crafted cursing from a bunch of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nMy only big qualm with Deadman Wonderland (aside from the unfortunate 12 episode cap, which I'll give a pass under the hopes that they'll do another season) is that the awesome carnival/amusement park theme gets dropped about halfway through as the characters interact less within the framework of Deadman Wonderland and more behind the scenes. It's hard to describe without spoiling anything, but I would have liked to see more 'playing by the rules' before the story really got going- but again I'm assuming this has a lot to do with the episode cap, and I think the anime was otherwise very well-paced for having so much to cover in such a short time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I quite enjoyed this anime, and if you like dubs, I highly recommend giving Deadmon Wonderland's dub a try. It takes a good show and makes it even more compelling.",

            "content": "You'll be on the edge of your seat for this anime. There is a large sense of mystery in this anime as well as the moments of cringing whenever something horrible happens. It was a little slow of an anime to begin with, but after a while it really picked up the pace. It has the feel of a battle anime, but it does have a compelling reason to continue watching it right up to the end. Also, there are interesting characters, that are easy to get attached to, even the ones who you think you'll hate right off the bat. If left unsatisfied bythe anime, read the manga to fill in any of the gaps and continue past the ending of the anime if you're too impatient for the next possible season (I don't think there are any plans for another season).",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland was written by Kataoka Jinsei. It started in 2007 and is still going. Last year it got a twelve episode anime adaptation. I haven't heard much about the series so I don't know what to expect. Let's take a look and find out. \r\nFourteen year old Igarashi Ganta witnesses the murders of his peers at the hands of the mysterious \"Red Man.\" The Red Man pushes a crystal into Ganta's chest and vanishes. He soon finds himself in a privatised prison where he'll have to fight to survive. The basic elements seem very cliche, but it's all presented in a very unique andinteresting way. The story does an excellent job of balancing between more light-hearted moments and really dark, twisted moments. This contributes to making it very interesting to watch. It also has excellent pacing. It sets up for another season while still having a satisfying climax and an interesting conflict. The one negative is that it is a short anime. The result is that a lot of plot points don't get resolved. However, it is clearly set up for a sequel so it's really not a major negative and I do hope that the series does get a second season because what's there is very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThis series has a massive cast. The major characters are, mostly, very well fleshed out, as are some of the side characters, but most of them get very little character development. However, that does work for the story and the setting. Given the length, they really couldn't have done much better. My only real issue with the characters is with Ganta himself. He feels like a stock everyman protagonist that we've seen a lot. He does get a little development in the last couple episodes, but he still comes across as a pretty bland character. Especially when compared to the far more interesting group around him. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good, overall. There's a good use of colours, the fight scenes are interesting and they even manage to make the backgrounds lively. Which is pretty impressive for an anime mostly set in a prison. Now, there are some really gruesome scenes that may be a bit difficult to watch, but they are excellently handled and plot relevant. This isn't mindless or something that's just done for shock value. There are a few art issues. The first is that there are some really dark scenes that are hard to see and there's really not a good reason for them to be. Another is that there are a few art errors, there aren't many but there are enough that it is a little distracting.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is excellent. Paku Romi and Hanazawa Kana both have very strong performances, but the entire cast is good. The music does a very good job of helping set the tone. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 2/10. Kyoko seems to have a crush on Makina in a few scenes, but you don't get enough with them to be certain. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Deadman Wonderland is an 8/10. It has a few weak points, but it's a very good anime overall. It's well-paced, interesting, well acted and it has a lot of endearing characters, even if the main protagonist is rather dull. If you don't mind sitting through some gruesome scenes I would definitely suggest checking it out.",

            "content": "I'll applaud the day when the game show to the death thing can cough up something good with the shock value of blood and bile. It\u2019s a great genre that seems to blend a little bit of psychological, horror, and satirical elements and I wanted a good example of it in Deadman Wonderland after liking something like Battle Royale. But like any genre or sub-genre that\u2019s been cracked at minimally is based on experimentation and guinea pig zapping. There are gonna be some stinkers at the beginning of something better, so even though Deadman Wonderland makes me want to call the  game-show-to-the-death subgenre moot.But even if I didn\u2019t like it Some like King/Bachmann's Running Man succeed in some ways; and doesn't try to go for a greater societal message but ends up being a good thriller. It's nothing deep or prophetic but it works. On the other end of the spectrum there's the impeccably god-awful Saw films that try too hard and crap out a laughably bad plot for shock value and a couple bucks.  Deadman Wonderland tries. It tries really hard. At times it tries too hard. And because of that it unfortunately falls into the latter rather than the former. It has a cool pair of boots to jolt down its 12 episode run, but by the end the blood-soaked laces end untied and muddier than before. \\n\\n\r\nSince by clicking on most of my reviews you've bought a one way ticket into negative nancy town, so I'll say something (reasonably) nice; the character inconsistencies aren't as bad as the plot inconsistencies. While the end result ends up spiraling all over the place at least it knows it wants to set up something bigger. However that doesn't mean that the plot is good; its not as much of a plot as much as it is a laundry list of unanswered questions. It starts out wanting to focus on the injustices that innocent Ganta is facing now that his life has changed in the most horrific way possible. The first couple of episodes are pretty engaging albeit silly and hard to believe even from a satirical standpoint. They really did an initially impressive job of making a very cute and colorful world spattered with blood, traps and an overwhelming smog of nihilism to the world complete with metal guitar  power chords chugging in the background.  I was even able to overlook the hero is an underdog with a mysterious power cliche because it forwarded the plot in an interesting setting. However all that goes way off the rails for the sake of exploring Ganta's power, which would have been fine if they would have kept the cutesy-gorefest motif along with that to keep it interesting.  Instead we're treated with a plot that opens up more questions than answers. Why does Ganta stop seeking revenge on the Red Man even after the revelation of their identity is rather jarring? How does that character feel about their eventual revelation to Ganta? Why were Ganta and Shiro childhood friends but he didn't recognize her when the games started? I could go on to ask about why the red explosion that wiped out tokyo happened, what effect it had on the world, and why the prison's director is using Ganta and the other scar chain members as guinea pigs for it but I'd run out of room. The plot also wants to be geared towards Yoh and Ganta trying to kill the director but after Yoh's sister Hummingbird shows up to deliver some cringe-worthy and needlessly sexual lines of dialogue, he's barely seen after that.  Then it becomes all about the resistance movement and Ganta making his power better for even more unexplained reasons, some people die, there's an explosion and just like that the show ends. That happens after Ganta almost runs out of blood but then sprints down a hallway and has the snot kicked out of him but doesn't die. There's no really other way to put it other than the plot was a big rushed ocean of red herrings.\\n\\n\r\nAlright if you whipped out a fanboy flopper during the last paragraph put it away because I like the sound and art design. As I mentioned before The game to the death circus of torture scenes were really cool. While they may seem a touch corny I liked that the show tried to mix so many cute and innocent parts of the world with the violence and gore, and that really brought forth my initial hopes for the show. Such a motif gives way to hinting at the societal horror that I was hoping for with the show. Granted I was let down and treated with a cake that was two days past the expiration date, but with this pro of the series I could still lick off the frosting at least. The characters were reasonably diverse, and while there's an occasional character like Makina that's there only to be a pair of boobies they actually put effort into making the normal characters be normal. Ganta, Shiro, and the other Scar Chain characters are interesting in context because of their normalcy. Senji too, was badass, well designed, and actually had a purpose for having an eye patch. The ferris wheel too that was the goal and the closest thing the series had to a literary symbol was a nice break from everything and was also shown at appropriate times during the show, like at the end credits. Speaking of end credits, the music was something that the show needed more of. I liked the heavy, plodding and dread-inducing background music that the show boasted, but like I said I wanted more of it. The opener \"One Reason\" worked with the show and while it's not a great song due to the corny lyrics and butt-rock style, it works in twisted images and dramatic abs and boobs shots of the intro.\\n\\n\r\nFinally there's the characters, most of whom were endearing enough to be likeable, but who all lacked clear motive and enough of an arc to exist as players in a show rather than faces in a vacuum. Ganta is a little squirt with big dreams of revenge and escape, and he would have been liked by me more as an underdog character if he came out on top like an underdog character should. If you looked at him from just a character standpoint you'd think he's oblivious because he just forgets about finding the red man. But I feel his character could have been explored far more than it was, and I knew there had to be more to it. The show hints at his backstory and past relationship with Shiro but doesn't give him the time, which really frustrated me. The plot cheats him out of an arc to solve the mystery of the classroom massacre, finding out who the red man is, controlling his power and ultimately escaping hopefully with an introspective epilogue to spare. But sadly he doesn't and neither do many of the other characters. There's hints that Shiro's personality is two pronged but it never explores why or what her purpose is either. Some of the key Scar Chain players like Karako and Nagi are given backstories but due to the short length of the show their personalities are mainly shown through info dumps and feel really rushed. Hummingbird and Yoh get tossed by the wayside after Ganta headbutts Minatsuki and despite her painfully bad dialogue I wanted just, some contribution or development from them too. Of course then there's the undertakers like Genkaku  and the director Tamaki who can't stop reminding you that they're villains and also insane. That's it, there's no extra motives given and very little backstory as to why they're doing what they're doing other than \"oh they're crazy and the world's messed up\". The only character that's done justice that defines who he is is Senji, who only has that substance because he gets a tangential episode. If they had the time to make a 13th episode why didn't they just sprinkle in characterization throughout the show? I mean sure that episode was awesome but it really bothered me that the characters didn't get enough justice as to who they were. \\n\\n\r\nSo sure, not the whole show is bad, and I think it really had potential to stand out like Battle Royale or The Running Man do in the death game subgenre. However it wasn't given the right writing TLC to make it better. So I'd pass on the show, but I also would be interested in reading the manga or see if the show suffered due to budgetary constraints. Or maybe even a season 2.\\n\\n",

It's a place where prisoners fight for their lives in order to please the crowd that is rooting for bloodshed. \\n\\n\r\nGanta starts off as terrified and confused, but that shifts quickly when he learns that he has to adapt and become strong in order to survive this hell he has been placed in. Ganta realize that he has been framed and that his being here in this prison is no coincidence. His objective now is to find the red man responsible for everything and to prove his innocence, but before he can do that he needs to escape and avoid the many possible threats that Deadman Wonderland holds.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf there is any character as mysterious or even more so than the red man, it would have to be this girl named Shiro. Shiro, an pale girl covered in red markings seems to be Ganta's childhood friend who Ganta vaguely remembers. She appears to be unbound by the prison and goes unnoticed by the guards as if she was a spirit but her very existence is real.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself feels very fast paced which affects the fight scenes and results in less intriguing characters that are poorly introduced. Main two characters that got their fair share of screen time includes Ganta and Shiro. Ganta's impression is very mature for a middle schooler. His age doesn't quite fit how he's able to deal with the situation so effectively. Shiro does a great job at keeping the audience engaged and her childlike personality compliments her well. As for the other characters, they don't leave  a strong impact and the ones that dies off are hardly remembered due to lack of background stories.\\n\\n\r\nArt is neither eye-catching nor repellent. Plenty of gore and violence incorporated which is remarkable and keeps the viewers entertained. Biggest issue like I said is that it's very face paced and with only 12 episodes it leaves out significant details. Disappointed with the ending in the sense that it feels incomplete and that I wanted more of an explanation. Overall, I enjoyed the anime. It's a good one if you like short animes. Just don't expect a solid constructed storyline.",

            "content": "before I start this review, I wanna say that deadman wonderland so under rated by soooo many people, and its just flat out ridiculous. in my opinion (please highlight I said MY opinion), a show like deadman wonderland has so much potential, because now a days, people don't know how good anime use to be when it was all about the compelling action. shows like DBZ and yu yu hakasho, gurren lagann, all these shows had more of a focus on action, rather than emotional bullshit. Where as now, an anime ain't nothing if ain't got a moe or a splice of life. not tosay no anime should not have that, but it's made action series like the classics almost non-existent. Deadman wonderland to me takes a try at the good old days.\\n\\n\r\nstory\\n\r\nGanta is your average boy who is nothing special, and his life would have been that way if there was just that problem that his classmates weren't killed by the \"red man\", and implanted some red thing inside him. Being the only soul survivor, he is charged with the slaughter of all classmates, and is, in the end, sent to deadman wonderland, where he must fight for survival. Shortly after being there, he realizes through a certain event, that the red thing inside him has given him superpowers (like some of the other prisoners, or \"deadmen) and allows him to use blood as a weapon. now I don't wanna give too much away, because that's episode one in a nut shell, but the story is pretty well, but the reason I didn't give a ten out of ten is because the show does have some plot holes here and there, they are forgivable, but unfortunately, they do exist. \\n\\n\r\nthe animation\\n\r\nif you want to see where this show shines, this is it. granted its style is no guilty crown, but its got a very dark feel to it. Its kind of the same feeling that black lagoon gives you with the city roanipur or however you spell that. the gory aspect of the show is not too be exaggerated though, it is not meant for the squeamish. The animation however does compliment the show in every aspect. there's not much else to say other than the opening of the show, has phenomenal animation.\\n\\n\r\nthe sound\\n\r\nthe music in deadman wonderland like everything else in the show, is dark, but it also is freaking perfect. it's a mix of heavy tunes, and dark erry music that fits both the dark aspect of the show and the action scenes. and the opening is the best opening I have ever seen, heavy metal tune, and pumps you up for the psychotic stuff coming your way. needless to say, it is amazing, a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nthe characters\\n\r\nthe characters in this show is about the problem I have with this show. Now for anyone who doesn't know, I love future diary/mirai nikki, and ganta is very much like yukki. ganta is, like yukki, a winy weakling and can't go through any problem without crying, and his dub voice actor got annoying as all hell. I will say he is not a total spineless coward as he does rise to the occasion more than I could have expected. next you have shiro, one of my favorites. shiro is a albino girl around gantas age who comes out of absolutely nowhere to help ganta and decides he is her best friend. however she is a complete mystery and definitely makes you wanna learn more about her. not much else to say about her other than she acts just about as silly as team rocket. next up ya got yo who starts to appear to be an aid to ganta, and teaches him things about the prison and how it works. I can't explain more without spoilers, so we now move on to the last one, crow. Crow is definitely the badass of the show, everything from his voice, how he acts, and how he goes about things. I will not go any further on him other than he is my favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nmy personal enjoyment\\n\r\noverall deadman wonderland is a pretty kickass show, but unfortunately there is one thing that made me not give it a ten out of ten. being that it did real good in America, and not good where it needed to, japan, it never got a second season. this leaves with soo many things unanswered. however since that is not the shows fault, the show is still pretty damn good with plenty of action, all the gore ya want, and plenty of thriller and mystery. pray everyone, pray for a season 2, and we might not be disappointed. or buy the dvd and help them out if you liked it that much.",

            "content": "Average anime with interesting settings and potential, but both of those are critically wasted. The only things which hold the score on 7 are two of many plain characters and the mystery surrounding the main female protagonist.\r\nStory:\r\nAt the beginning the story seems like the main and most interesting part of the show. Private prison, death sentenced prisoners fightng for survival, high school boy with supernatural powers but lack of self-confidence.\r\nMain problem is that the anime has only 12 episodes. There is simply not enought time to tell all the important things in an interesting way, and so we dont know nothing about most of thecharacters and events and then the writers try to explain everything in last episode - NOT working. Not to mention that there is vast majority of things which are not explained just because this anime does not covers the full manga.\\n\r\nConclusion: 6/10 for so much wasted potencial and too hasty ending\\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers ahead*\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAbout most of the characters we know nothing. They exist simply because story wants more pawns to kill. How I already wrote, there are only two characters which are interesting - Shiro and Crow. But just because of Shiro I gave this anime one or two points bigger score. This simple girl with her crazy second personality as main anime antagonist is just adorable. She always shows in critical moment has some easy but catchy phrase and then either saves everyone or gets ass kicked. Her appearance is also very untraditional, and the background surrounding her childhood has some really strong moments and is very touchy (unfortunately not mentioned in anime - you must read manga)\\n\r\nConclusion: 8/10 - Shiro rulezz, Crow is badass\\n\\n\r\n*End of Spoilers *\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\r\nOther thing which you will remember is good sound setting in thrilling parts, not to mention the great anime opening song. Art could be better in 2011 but its watchable and some details are pretty nice. The whole contrast of the prison which is presented as funny family land vs. gore and bloody things which are happening in the *basement*\\n\r\nConclusion: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nSummary and final word:\\n\r\nIf you like gore action animes with mystery element, this is for you. By far not so good as Mirai Nikky but enjoyable. The one thing which will hold you by the monitor will be Shiro and concern how the whole thing will end (unfortunately unfulfilled due to rushed end).\\n\r\nOverall 7/10",

            "content": "The Nu Metal song in the beginning could\u2019ve been a good sign of things to come. The anime could\u2019ve been the visual version of Nu Metal \u2013 loud, heavy, violent, stupid and a lot of fun. Too bad it\u2019s closer to early Drowning Pool than Mushroomhead or Slipknot. A lot of stuff happens, but nothing is fun.\r\nThe warning signs are in the first episode. Ganta (\u2018gangsta\u2019 minus two letters) has no personality. Brief slice-of-life tell us nothing about him other than that his taste in women is generic, his best friend is more extroverted than him and that he\u2019s nice.\r\nHe\u2019s a bland stand-in for theviewer. He\u2019s defined by the most vague attributes \u2013 he\u2019s nice, he wishes good for everyone and he feels a little weak. It\u2019s a nice suit the viewer can insert himself into and feel better at the end at overcoming the pain along with Ganta.\\n\\n\r\nA character defined by being normal and good-willing can work. The writers would have to be aware that this is his purpose, though. They will have to make sure his normality is constantly contrasted (because normality is in itself empty) and that his goodwill is active. This worked for Danganronpa.\\n\\n\r\nGanta isn\u2019t Naegi and there are no one here as mad as Daganronpa\u2019s students. We never get an insight into how the events actually affect him. Then again, the events are meaningless acts of cruelty. All Ganta can do is be depressed for a while, inner-monologue about how weak he is and then stand up to protect his friends.\\n\\n\r\nWasn\u2019t this what Sakamoto did in BTOOOM!? The major difference between the two is that Sakamoto had less people to talk to, so he also inner-monologue\u2019d during fights.\\n\\n\r\nShiro isn\u2019t much better. Her personality is amusing but runs out of steam before you notice it had any steam in the first place. Yuno is an obvious comparison, and Shiron is everything Yuno satirized. She exists to please Ganta and to help him. She doesn\u2019t have anything beyond this.\\n\\n\r\nYuno was defined by being a yandere. The fact she needs someone is the center, not the someone she needs. Without Ganta, what can you do with Shiro? She walks around, acts cutsy and solves problems for Ganta.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s possible that the manga develops her differently. There\u2019s a big twist thing that\u2019s not revealed in the anime but is elaborated upon there. In this anime, she\u2019s our hero cute female sidekick.\\n\\n\r\nThe creators also can\u2019t be imagnative with their cruelty. Buckets of blood are spilled and people get shot in the head. Many were abused in their past. It never builds towards anything. Everyone just suffers.\\n\\n\r\nIn order for us to understand suffering, we need to see the difference between one kind and another. We need to see how different characters approach the situation. Many in Future Diary had a difficult past, but they took it differently. They weren\u2019t just senseless psychos. It affected their desires and worldview in a way that\u2019s connected to their personality. There is a difference between Yomotsu\u2019s rough justice, Tsubaki\u2019s hatred, John\u2019s megalomania and Yuno\u2019s obsession.\\n\\n\r\nViolence is just tossed here. It\u2019s something to cheer for. How can you take a show seriously when everyone is so sadistic? The world is cruel, but it\u2019s also strange. Stories from Holocaust survivors are more shocking not just because they\u2019re real but because they\u2019re going somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nHumans adapt. People who live in harsh circumstances adapt or die. In the most intense times in the army I didn\u2019t have time to inner-monologue. In this anime they just monologue. The reason the pain of Danganronpa\u2018s cast was believable was because they had more than pain in their lives. The show made it clear each of these characters could stand on its own.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters of Deadman Wonderland can exist outside the anime. They\u2019re all tied to the emotional core of doom\u2019n\u2019gloom. Without senseless violence they don\u2019t exist. Characters who need senseless violence are senseless.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s ironic how the series tries to say something about brutal entertainment. The whole set-up is violent entertainment taken to reality. It\u2019s an interesting concept, especially when we deal with prisoners. The rights of criminals and what to do with them is a controversial issue.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems the anime\u2019s answer is that we should massacre them in entertaining ways. If this was supposed to be a critique, it should\u2019ve made the violence truly shocking. Violence is shocking not when it\u2019s extreme, but when it has some sort of meaning. This is why Yukki killing a bunch of orphans is more jarring than any \u2018difficult past\u2019 story here.\\n\\n\r\nYukki\u2019s violent rampage was a result of a person who is sure he can bring everyone back to life. It\u2019s an embodiement of \u2018once people become easy to copy/resurrect their life lost value\u2019. The Deadman Wonderland is brutal, but also cool. The people are using weapons made of blood. The race has them dying in all kinds of ways. The camera always lingers on the body so we will get a clear image of it. It\u2019s pornography now.\\n\\n\r\nI could\u2019ve forgiven this if the series wasn\u2019t so pretentious. I love aesthecized violence, and you can use it to give commentary on it. Borderlands is both violent and comments on violence in video games. What exactly Deadman Wonderland is trying to say about our relationship with violence is unclear. People are cruel, so?\\n\\n\r\nIf it was more stylish, if the focus was more on the violent games than the psycho-drama thing it would\u2019ve been better. There are some cool visual ideas. The race scene could\u2019ve been fun, but instead it\u2019s a celebration of gloominess \u2013 brutal violence with no energy that\u2019s still pornographic. It\u2019s just unpleasant.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s actually hypocritical. The series points to us how disgusting brutal entertainment is, but the show itself is nothing but brutal entertainment. Its violence only exists for our pleasure and the cruelty isn\u2019t deep. It\u2019s like how in the Saw films, Jigsaw talks about how we should appreciate life but forces others to kill.\\n\\n\r\nAt least it\u2019s better than BTOOOM!. The series does reach some kind of conclusion. The grand story doesn\u2019t end but they create a central enough arc that does. The setting and characters are also wild enough to be entertaining occasionally. People are getting their heads split open, there\u2019s a loli with a sword-whip-thing and weapons made of blood. It\u2019s pretty fun.\\n\\n\r\nIt does have a weird relationship with sexuality as expected. It\u2019s not drowning in fanservice, but the female cast is hanging around with more nudity than practical. Shiro has a skin-tight custom that makes her look naked, another girl is half-naked and the camera literally pauses so we could stare at some G-cups. These type of anime generally fail at sexuality, but despite the occasional moment Future Diary was mainly concerned with the personalities. Danganronpa also never sank to these lows. Sexuality is fun but not when it\u2019s off-topic. Why is the sexual features of every female character is emphasized? At least there\u2019s a dude with killer abs here.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the people in the sound design knew what they\u2019re doing. There are some guitar riffs and industrial beats. It\u2019s the perfect soundtrack. There are even Cannibal Corpse-like blast beats during the Carnival Corpse. If only they had a better anime to fit these cool beats to.\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland is occasionally fun, but it\u2019s closer to BTOOOM! than to . If doom, gloom and sadism are impressive you then you find some enjoyment here. I wouldn\u2019t even recommend it for people who are into violence. The brutality is never stylish, never cruel in a way that stays in the mind. It\u2019s halfway there and the result is just unpleasant. It\u2019s a bad Nu Metal song \u2013 full of angst, noise, \u2018brutality\u2019 but no fun or depth.\\n\\n\r\n2 killer lolis out of 5",

            "content": "If you like bloody violence and white girl butt, Deadman Wonderland was made for you. I was hoping the season finale would redeem a rocky last couple episodes, but it\u2019s pretty much a mess. Some thoughts and my \u201ccool\u201d list.\r\nInstead of the good and fair critique I\u2019ve become known for, I\u2019ll just take a note from Nichijou and list, \u201cThings I Thought Were Cool!\u201d and I\u2019ll also add a, \u201cThings I thought Were Terrible!\u201d\r\nThings I Thought Were Cool!\r\nShiro was cool and she\u2019s easily my favorite insane character of the Spring 2011 season. I enjoyed her character, and I\u2019m not above saying I greatly enjoyed lookingat her boobs and butt all season. Although on a serious note, albino people aren\u2019t attractive in real life. It\u2019s true, look it up. It\u2019s like anime has moe-fied albinism. I can\u2019t imagine this series without Shiro though, seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire opening sequence is excellent. The song, animation and design were all put together beautifully. I enjoyed all the animation overall. The characters and most importantly, the fights, all looked good. I enjoyed a lot of the grimy-ness of the characters and the dirtiness of the prison, especially in contrast with the pretty shows like Hanasaku or Denpa Onna.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the lack of rainbow hair was cool. Besides Shiro and Kanako with their white locks, the show had some good hairlism (hair+realism). I just made that up, but I could see that one taking off.\\n\\n\r\nHummingbird was pretty cool. Crow was cool, but all his homoerotic scenes of girl-hating and being topless with Ganta were not so cool. His consistent slicing up of dudes was cool though.\\n\\n\r\nAll the action in DW, in a slice of life and drama filled season, \u201cseemed\u201d cool. Although the action wasn\u2019t always that great, it always looked cool. I\u2019ll lump the violence and gore in with the action as well. While the censoring was surely \u201cterrible\u201d, all the amputations and bone-breakings were cool. The violence along with some rape and drug use made this show pretty shocking at times. Guitar Hero (featured in my terrible list) even drops the F-bomb quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some other cool things, but even more than things I thought were cool, there were\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThings I Thought Were Terrible\\n\\n\r\nThe overall character design, and not just looks, but everything from origin stories to personalities through to their special abilities or \u201csuper powers\u2019 if you will. I hated Guitar Hero. I hated Daida, the 3rd grader. I hated Owl. I hated the \u201csuper good with computers\u201d guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe show had some nice grown up themes and more mature plot style devices, so all the \u201csuper cool\u201d character designs, for me, felt like an insult. I don\u2019t need an evil priest who uses guitar guns or a little girl who uses a giant sword. They were terrible.\\n\\n\r\nGanta I wasn\u2019t thrilled with, but I understood the need for a weak-ass lead, but I thought Romi Park (Edward Elric, Toshiro from Bleach), was a terrible choice to perform his voice. I enjoy almost all of the seiyu\u2019s former roles, but the whiny-bitchy tonal quality along with the whiny-bitchy character design, was just too much whiny-bitchy for me overall.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I thought the action was cool, I could use a little less shounen dialogue during the fights. More fight, less talk. Too much talk while trying to survive is terrible. Unless talking is your super power I guess.\\n\\n\r\nDoes Cool kill Terrible? Or does Terrible kill Cool?\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the actual show, there\u2019s no killing here. As evidenced by the scientific list above, Deadman Wonderland definitely has its merits. I\u2019m not going to rail on the show, but I\u2019ll just say that story isn\u2019t told in a very tight, consistent way. It also feels very rushed. At first it just felt like a quick, fast moving show. Now that it\u2019s over, it ended up just feeling rushed, as if they tried to squish 20 episodes worth of material into 12.\\n\\n\r\nI will be watching a second season however and waiting eagerly for Eating Cookies With Shiro, coming out on Blu-ray soon!\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Thoughts about final episode removed due to spoilerish tendencies: go to http://moemonster.com/2011/07/02/deadman-wonderland-episode-12-finale/ for full unedited review]",

            "content": "Among other things, anime is know for being pretty violent, especially compared to a lot of other animation. Deadman Wonderland is Manglobe's contribution to the long line of series that specialize in hyper-violence. With a grim outlook on people and a sadistic tenancy to put its characters through the wringer mercilessly that matches its visceral violence, Deadman Wonderland is an unrelenting bloody nightmare. However, while it does succeed at shocking audiences, it sacrifices not only well structured narrative, but a sense of humanity. The end result is a satisfyingly lurid, but hugely uneven storm of blood and violence.\r\nRight from the beginning the setting and circumstancesof the story fill us with dread. Our protagonist Ganta Igarashi witnesses the mass murder of his middle school class by some super-powered being, and then sent to prison for the grizzly crime. The prison he is sent to, the carnival themed Deadman Wonderland, is hell on earth. The murderous inmates and ruthless guards seem to have it out for Ganta; the warden himself is responsible for fabricating evidence against him. On top of all that Ganta is developing a horrifying ability to weaponize his blood. Ganta's world has fallen apart, he is subjected to cruelty which exceeds torture, and this misery seems inescapable. The show exudes this hopelessness with every frame, and really this is the shows greatest strength. The world of Deadman Wonderland is as harsh and cruel as you will find.\\n\\n\r\nBacking up the grim atmosphere are the some strong technical merits. Deadman Wonderland is a dark and vividly gruesome nightmare; the things it depicts are as incredibly unpleasant: blood is spilled, limbs are ripped off, and eyes are gouged out. Yet it is impossible to turn away. Even when there is not any violence, however, it is clear a lot of effort was put into the visuals. The prison looks like a colorful, but ominous carnival, complete with creepy looking animal mascots. The inner halls of the prison are cold, dark, and oppressive. The character designs are just as good as the background work; the designs are good and the faces are especially fun to look at when characters are going crazy. Likewise the animation is good, it looks fluid when it needs to show off, and shortcuts in animation are taken where they are least noticeable. The soundtrack does its job well, although aside the heavy guitar used in the brutal action scenes, the music is not particular memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe gleeful sadism of the show comes at a heavy price. There are not many characters that come across as likeable. Most of them are either certifiably insane or cold and heartless; possessing the ugliest of traits, and as such they are hard to feel for. Ganta is neither insane or heartless, but he is also a pretty boring lead, spending most of his time lamenting over the hell his life has become or how weak he is. Granted, he is reacting to his current situation the way a sane person would, but his struggle is not all that engaging because of his constant whimpering and lack of personality outside the usual male lead tropes. Which is a real problem, because the show desperately wants his struggle to be compelling. The only exception is Shiro, the mysterious and cheery  albino girl that befriends Ganta, though she squarely falls into the hyperactive childish girl archetype. Her cheery disposition is the only ray of happiness in an otherwise very miserable world. This isn't to say she is a very well written character, she can get annoying and like all the other characters in the show lacks complex emotion. However, her bright demeanor does make her stand out, and her darker character traits add a little intrigue to her.\\n\\n\r\nThe character are not the only problem here, however. There is also Deadman Wonderland's plot. A lot of what happens in the show is kind of preposterous, if not downright unbelievable. It is more than a bit of a stretch that a prison would be allowed to put collars on inmates which would kill the wearer if they do not consume a special candy in a certain amount of time. It is even more unbelievable that a prison would be able to publicly execute inmates on an obstacle course in front of an audience that include young teenagers stupid enough to believe it is all special effects. All of this is done for shock factor in Deadman Wonderland, and it brings into question if the show has any understanding of humanity at all. Sure, people do shocking and horrible things, but they are not the mindless, bloodthirsty, and voyeuristic herd that this show depicts; and it is insulting in more than one way to the viewer to present them as such. This mistake in depicting people is not exclusive to Deadman Wonderland, in fact it is pretty prevalent in gore-fests. On top of that, the story does not know where it is going; ultimately coming to a sudden stop that is guaranteed to satisfy almost no one.\\n\\n\r\nAs exceedingly violent and bleak Deadman Wonderland is, it is also entertaining. There is a kind of sick enjoyment of seeing the nightmarish atrocities of the show that is just undeniable. There is a thrill in receiving a shock, and this show definitely delivers on shock value. Still, it doesn't excuse the lack of human understanding which is prevalent in both the characters and plot. And it definitely does not excuse the meandering story line which ultimately goes nowhere. While it can be a gory fun, in the end Deadman Wonderland doesn't provide anything exceptional in the world of gore-fests.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, so this my first review on this site. Sorry in advance if it isn't the best or if any one disagrees. Don't worry there are no spoilers.\r\nBefore beginning Deadman Wonderland, I had read several reviews and didn't have the highest expectations because many people had given it around 6 stars. So naturally, when I watched the first few episodes, and I couldn't disagree more. I was like: This anime is the shiz.\r\nIt was so promising, left so many questions and had me on the edge of my seat. It couldn't be that bad, could it?\r\nIt was when I hit around episode 6 onward, thatI completely understood what they meant.\\n\r\nTalk about disappointment.  \\n\r\nIt became super messy, adding the most uninspired characters I had ever watched. Like, don't get me wrong, I didn't hate them all, in fact I liked the protagonist (despite him crying half the time) and I liked Shiro and their other friend, but the others... not to sound heartless, but they could all die, and I wouldn't care less. They were so one dimensional and generic.\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga, but from just watching the anime, I felt as though they were trying to squeeze in as much backstory as possible, trying to make things really emotional about how inhumane this 'Wonderland' is. It worked to some extent, mostly because it was kinda just sick, but seemed almost unnecessary when placing these backstories on such bland characters. For the main part, the direction they took was kinda just wrong. LIKE Y U FOCUS ON THIS AND NOT THE PROTAG'S STORY OR HIS BACKSTORY???? \\n\r\nAt least every time the protagonist cried it reminded me of Edward Elric.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a 6 because of it's fall from grace. Such potential was lost and now I think I should just read the manga because it's probably a lot better than this. \\n\r\nIf you like blood and gore and all that jazz, sure, why not watch it? But if you are looking for an anime that will hit you in the feels for the long term, not the best choice.",

            "content": "TL;DR: A solid yet short offering that entertains but leaves a little to be desired.\r\nLonger review:\r\nDeadman Wonderland follows Ganta, a teenage boy who witnesses his entire class be brutally slaughtered, only to be blamed for the incident and sent to Deadman Wonderland, a prison/amusement park where guests have to fight to survive.\r\nIf you're like me, you found the brief summaries floating around like that reasonably enticing. It's not necessarily the most original story out there, but it gets the job done. There are a couple plot twists thrown in in the first half of the season to keep you guessing as to the identity ofthe Red Man (the person who killed Ganta's class), but these don't extend as long as I'd have liked. The story moves along at a reasonably fast pace but ends on a scene that makes me wish there had been another season, or at the very least another episode or two to wrap things up. I found the second half of the season more interesting than the first half of the season, mostly due to more plot development and better characters being introduced. There is more humor in the first half than the second half, but it's still present here or there. Overall, I'd give the story a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Deadman Wonderland was very good. The character designs were strong, the animation was of a high quality, and I found the show to be pretty pleasing to the eye, especially some of the fight scenes. Emotions were conveyed pretty well, and I liked the stark contrast of the happy amusement park above ground and the dark, bloody underground where prisoners are put in battles to the death to survive. I'd give the art a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Deadman Wonderland was also pretty strong. The OP was amazing, and some of the score that plays throughout the show is very strong (especially Track 5: DW28A (if you've seen the show you'll instantly recognize it)). The voice acting was pretty good - I watched it dubbed and found all of the character's voices to be pretty well done - Greg Ayres as Ganta was an interesting choice and worked well, and it was a treat to hear him as it was a very different character than that of Sunohara in Clannad, whom he also voiced. I watched a bit in Japanese audio as well for comparison purposes and also enjoyed that, so whether you prefer dubbed or subbed you should be happy. The sound gets an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a bit divisive for me. I really liked certain characters (like Senji, aka Crow, Nagi, and Karako), but others were lacking (such as Ganta, Yoh, and Toto Sakigami (Mockingbird)). Ganta felt like the stereotypical, weak teenage boy who has to discover what it means to be strong through fighting and standing up for others. This isn't necessarily bad, but it's been done before and been done better. Other than not being a huge fan of the main character, I also feel like Yoh had some interesting developments but was just completely removed for a few episodes despite still being around. I didn't really get why they wouldn't have one of the more important side characters not show up for the final few episodes, but oh well. Finally, Toto immediately struck me as very interesting, but was never really developed beyond the initial introduction and one or two other scenes. This left a bit to be desired. But it wasn't all bad, and as I previously mentioned there were some pretty good characters to invest in that kept me entertained. Overall, because of missed opportunities, yet still a few redeeming qualities, I'd give this a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we are nearing the end of the review. I found the series to be pretty enjoyable despite a few shortcomings, which include some lacking parts of the story and missed character opportunities. However, the fighting and gore was well done, as were the emotions portrayed by the main characters, and I was on the edge of my seat for a large part of certain episodes - I watched the entire show in just a few days, which displays that it kept me coming back for more. I really did want to know what happened in the next episode, what happened to the characters, and to see if their big plan would actually work. I caught myself jamming along to the OP and admiring the art direction and character design. For these reasons, I would give me overall enjoyment of the show a 8/10 (as I tend to put a greater emphasis on story and characters than art and sound).\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend the show to anyone looking for something with an entertaining premise with great animation and sound, but to not expect too much of the story or characters. In the end, for the reasons summarized in the last paragraph and previous sentence, I would give Deadman Wonderland an overall score of 7/10. \\n",

            "content": "From time to time, anime viewers are presented with a pseudo-intellectual show which excels in both soundtrack and animation but lacks other, more important traits such as a coherent story or interesting characters. In 2011, Deadman Wonderland aired and it follows this formula to a great extent.\r\nThe anime's premise sounds fairly intriguing: Shows in which the protagonist has to escape some sort of facility always have a great amount of routes it can take. In this case, it is combined with the popular Battle Royale trope due to which the potential viewer probably has high hopes towards the anime. Unfortunately, Deadman Wonderland is not ableto fulfil these expectations. There are many issues with the logic the show and its characters want to apply which make it easy to see many plot holes and conveniences. The reason why the protagonist, Ganta, is convicted is because he allegedly slaughtered his entire class. However, there is no evidence other than him being the sole survivor that point to him being the criminal. Of course, one could claim that the court has been bribed but this does not explain why the whole world seems to think that he is the murderer. While it might have been possible for this anime to be a good show the viewer can simply enjoy without having to think a lot, it tries to be edgy and tense and consequently results in nothing but pretentiousness.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tries to combine several characteristics other popular anime have, such as the aforementioned prison setting, a childhood friend, gore, super powers, contrived plot twists and tournaments. This, combined with a protagonist who is basically a toned down copy of Neon Genesis Evangelion's Shinji, is apparently what the writers think makes a good anime. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Everything the anime presents seems to be loosely tied together without having any impact apart from being nice to look at. What is more, a majority of the events occurring in the anime do not seem to be of any importance whatsoever. They do not contribute to the story's progress or the protagonist's development. In fact, the setting, which is built in the anime's first half, seems to become more and more irrelevant as it goes on.\\n\\n\r\nNot only the protagonist is a generic character but also the supporting cast has no remarkable traits and merely consists of annoying children and other bothersome characters. There are anime where you cannot decide who to root for because both sides have understandable reasons to win. In this case, it is similar with the unfortunate exception that you want both sides to lose because of how horribly written every character is. While it is interesting to see what varieties of abilities they have, you do not feel connected to them since they lack any form of characterisation and the viewer consequently does not sympathize with the characters when they die.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, thanks to decently entertaining battle scenes, the fights between the characters are somewhat enjoyable, but still very predictable. In most cases, they end due to someone developing super human strength for no apparent reason.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the soundtrack is remarkably good. Not only does the background music fit the anime very well but the opening theme has to be one of the catchiest songs there is. Since Romi Park and Hanazawa Kana voice the anime's main characters, there is nothing one could complain about in the cast either. The animation is also very fluid and the art style fits the setting without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, if you want to watch an anime with cringe worthy, melodramatic moments that heavily relies on shock value and has hardly any positive characteristics other than its soundtrack, you might enjoy Deadman Wonderland. However, since this probably is not the case, I ultimately cannot recommend this anime and suggest that you watch something else instead.",

            "content": "Story: 1/10\r\nThe story of Deadman Wonderland started off promising, in a way. A teenage boy is sentenced to death, and sent to prison after being falsely accused of mass murder, and now has to participate in dangerous games hoping to postpone his death by obtaining antidote pieces of candy. It looked cool, and even though it didn\u2019t make any sense that people actually believed a teenage boy could have been able to slaughter his entire classroom in this way, the story had something going for it.\r\nBut soon the story goes in a whole different direction, and we find our protagonist Ganta running down some hallwaysand fighting some guy in some arena, with some typical shonen power, the \u201cbranch of sin,\u201d that is somehow reason for the board of the prison to throw him into some fights. Some people that somehow got online access to this fight are discussing some things that do not matter and the loser of the fight loses a body part for some reason. Why does the board of the prison use prisoners that have branch of sin for this and doesn\u2019t the show expand on the other prisoners? Why is none of this information leaking out? Why does no visitor to the ever notice that people actually die in these games, while some of which are attractions for visitors to see? These questions are never expanded upon. There is no logic behind anything in this show, it\u2019s mostly just mindless gore and violence.\\n\\n\r\nThe story gets even worse down the road. One day, while roaming around the halls (because that is totally what prisoners on death row do), our protagonist suddenly finds this rebellion that is only thrown in the story for the sake of being \u201cthe rebellion,\" and for no reason at all they have their own lounging room, complete with furniture, electronic devices, and entertainment, in what is supposed to be a DEATH ROW PRISON. They screw around for a little, trying desperately to make us believe that they\u2019re characters that have an actual purpose, and eventually, they get interrupted by an undertaker: an anti-branch of sin fighter. What is that? Why are they in the prison fighting against prisoners with the branch of sin? Not important at all. All that matters is that they fight the main characters and have weird huge weapons. Deadman Wonderland tries so hard to be edgy, it even throws in an acid-spewing spider robot to lead the characters into harm\u2019s way.\\n\\n\r\nEverything that has any kind of potential in this show gets thrown out of the window. The moment of fail that takes the cake is when somebody brings up the candy pieces that the prisoners have to obtain to survive after those pieces having been absent for several episodes. In the meantime the viewer had actually forgotten that they even existed and goes like \u201cOh, right, those things were a key plot element at one point. Why were they never brought up again?\u201d Turns out the main character has about eight of them now, despite no information being given to the viewer about how he got them.\\n\r\nI\u2019ll spare you the other plot holes, because I could be writing about them all day; simply know that the story of this show is ridiculously illogical and is best summarized with the words \u201cmissed potential.\u201d The ending (if it can be called an ending) illustrates this too, by being the most anticlimactic ending I have seen in years, dissatisfying and pissing off its viewers as an extra slap in the face of everyone who coped with the show until its ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here. Ganta is a Shinji clone with no substance, Crow is a typical badass guy for shonen standards that would\u2019ve done a better job as a main character than Ganta, Shiro (who I haven\u2019t even mentioned because of her dullness and unimportance to the story) is the most clich\u00e9d character in the show, being the cheerful-but-vulnerable type girl, and most of the other characters are either there to slaughter or be slaughtered. The only depth we get is some background information on the two most insane people in the show, and the only point of this information is explaining how said characters got insane.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Deadman Wonderland is the only good thing about it. The action scenes were brought alive quite beautifully, especially those with the Red Man in it, and the opening is pretty neat. Animation is fluid, use of color and light is good, and character designs are up to standards. Pretty great job from Manglobe.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Deadman Wonderland is not that bad. No tracks really stand out, but each track fulfills its purpose and the soundtrack generally gets the job done. The opening song is alright, the ending song is boring, and all the other songs from this score lie somewhere in between.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely hate Deadman Wonderland. It could have been decent, but its story started making less and less sense every episode to the point where it was not even slightly believable or interesting anymore, and its characters didn\u2019t do anything to help. This show voids itself of logic for the sake of being gory and dark and it frustrated me in every sense of the word.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland is a steaming pile of crap and should not be seen as anything else. Spare yourself the pain of watching this if you have an IQ above 80.\\n",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland is quite brutal... and I love it!\r\nImagine a normal day at school when suddenly a floating person outside wearing red kills everyone in your class and you get blamed for the murder of your 29 classmates including your best friends. This happen to our main character named Ganta, who is then is sent to Japan's first privately owned prison called \"Deadman Wonderland\" which was built in the year 2017 and is not only a prison but also an amusement park where people come to see prisoners compete in deadly games to earn prison currency just to eat... or they can save up forother things too.\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland is not for the feint of heart (which should be pretty damn obvious because of the title) an I definitely wouldn't reccomend it to young 'uns because there is bad language, gore and all that jazz. Deadman Wonderland is set in the year 2023 and focusses on Ganta (the mc) and his life as a prisoner at this prison that will root out the weakling, chew them up and shit them out of a flaming asshole into a bucket of acid and to finish it off, get pissed on. Not many animes (or mangas) touch on the prison/prisoner topic, which is probably for a good reason like repetition but hey, Deadman Wonderland takes a prison and makes an amusement park where the death of prisoners is fun for the whole family! Now that's exciting!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Deadman Wonderland are pretty interesting and a handful of them have supernatural powers called branches of sin which allows them to use their blood as a weapon, butnjust because they can us blood to kill doesn't mean they're safe from blood loss which is their price for such a power. Each branch of sin user has a different power that can be used with their blood. People who have the branches of sin are given nicknames after birds like Crow, Hummingbird, Woodpecker, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing from the opening to ending and everything in between and the art style is really good and has a dark creepy tone when necessary. \\n\\n\r\nThe OVA is a prequel to Deadman Wonderland and follows supporting character Kiyomasa Senji\u00a0(\u5343\u5730\u6e05\u6b63) aka \"Crow\" who is an awesome character btw.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Deadman Wonderland is a really good anime but my only complaint is that 12 episodes really isn't enough to tell the story that was being told which was pretty obvious by the ending and there isn't a second season as of January 29, 2015. There needs to be a second season! *Sigh* I guess the only way to know what happens next is to read the manga, which I heard is really good and has 50+ chapters, I'll be sure to check that out at some point because Deadman Wonderland has one more fan as of now. If you like Mirai Nikki/Future Diary then I reccomend you check this out too because they're similar in many ways but also much different. Deadman Wonderland is less psychotic and more brutal than Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any questons, I'll be in Cell Block G of Deadman Wonderland",

            "content": "Deadman wonderland is a story about certain special prisoners called \"deadmen\" that have inherited or rather gained the power to use their own blood and turn them into lethal weapons for killing.\r\nThe anime isn't that good. It lacks most of the manga and it even hangs up on episode 12. The characters and the idea itself was really good and the setting of a prison can really bring in the watchers. BUT THE BIG PROBLEM, they tried to fit the anime within only 12 episodes while the manga is already up to 45+ chapters and its still ongoing. It only takes half the story ofthe manga and they even took out some other characters. I'd rather read the manga than watch the anime. Its a real letdown since i was actually waiting for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the current shortage of episodes. Its still a good anime to watch and sit down next to a bowl of popcorn and enjoy the blood and gore. The art is actually better than the anime on my point of view. The character development is really intriguing since i read the manga myself and really like Senji Kiyomasa(FANBOY'S). Overall the anime is interesting on the first parts but will leave you hanging after the last episode. But if you want to know more after the anime then I suggest to read the manga. \\n",

Read the manga too and you will see something horrific! \r\nI give it a 9 due to some of what I seen before this. I spent too much time on dark anime/manga over the recent years. And this made me realize similar art from recent anime. I will not give any SPOILERS! \r\nWatch it in Mexican, Japanese, English, whatever appeals to you! \r\n'Tis this show can domany emotions to the viewer themselves. \\n\\n\r\nTake an action show for example; like Naruto and what you maybe watching that involves anime. This also can be confusing on parts. But, like I said in Baccano!; DO NOT DROP IT! \\n\\n\r\nA tad bit scary, gruesome, confusing, sad, and so much to put on. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend it for anybody who just watched; Mirai Nikki, Death Note, and Another. \\n\\n\r\nPEACE!",

            "content": "++ SLIGHT SPOILERS ++\r\nPrison. It's a place that, as a child, you were told was full of the bad people. However, while that statement is correct, it's also wrong. The chances of someone being innocent is 4%. That might not seem like much but it is estimated that 1,320 defendants executed since 1977 were innocent. So that would mean that Deadman Wonderland in Cell Block G, most of them did nothing wrong.\r\nOne of those people are who innocent is Igarashi, Ganta. Ganta is one of these Deadmen who have the ability to control their blood as \"another limb\". He uses this power to survive inthis hell hole amusement park. It's violence and blood fill this show head to toe. It seems to just try to appeal to those \"Edge Lords\" of anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory. Since the show is only 12 episodes long and we probably (80% sure) won't get Season 2, as it didn't do that well in Japan, it wouldn't be able to expand as much as it most likely wanted to. Since the anime covered 20 chapters and the manga is 45 chapters. We only saw the first arc. Afterwards we are still left with many questions like \"What is the Mother Goose System?\" and \"What IS Shiro?\".\\n\\n\r\nArt. The Art is covered with a lot of blood and violence. I'm not saying the blood isn't well-drawn. It's just a bit over the top. Other than that, I don't really have any other criticisms about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound. The OST (Original SoundTrack) is jam packed to the brim with many different songs. Every time you hear a song it's probably the first time you've heard it. The opening song isn't really to my tastes but I can still appreciate the hard work and dedication it took to create the OST.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nGanta's a bit of a wimp. He's whinny (tolerable though) and even though he does grow out of that phase, Shiro is still best grill. Talking of Shiro, Ganta does care for Shiro and needs her to protect him sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nShiro is REALLY interesting. She is funny, important and downright creepy when she sings the lullaby. She wan't to protect Ganta as he is Shiro's friend.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the show was high. It did dip down every now and then but other than that, It kept a smile on my face as I witnessed murder. How lovely.",

(the last arc goes off track for longer than I would've liked.) The main character feels like an actual kid framed for murder. He gets upset often and really doesn't want to be there, but eventually he develops other opinions and outlooks,it's quite nice. Besides him there is a large cast of characters, all of which are quite likable. However, don't expect any thing groundbreaking, this anime is just a really good time.

            "content": "I'm one of those who haven't read the manga before watching the anime, so this review might not please you for this particular reason. I know most people who gave a negative feedback for this anime had read the manga before, so I'm just protecting myself here. \r\nStory : 8/10\r\nDeadman Wonderland has a very peculiar story, which is, as most people specified, very long, but due to the small amount of episode, very compressed. Fitting a story this big in only 12 episodes is a hard job and it wasn't entirely done well here. \r\nThe story takes you to a prison which is also anamusement park. The prisoners have to get points by entertaining people who visit the amusement park to get 'points' which are the prison's currency. Prisoners who are on the death row have huge necklace which slowly inject poison in their bodies, resulting in death after 72h. The antidote to this poison is found in special candies. \\n\\n\r\nA special place of the prison, the G block, is reserved for prisoners who have special powers, the sin branches, which allow them to control their blood in various ways (similar to Kyokai no kanata, in a way). Those prisoners are nicknamed with bird species names and fight for the pleasure of wealthy people in matches where the loser has to face a penalty game, resulting in the loss of one of his or her body parts. \\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when the main character ends up in the prison after being falsely accused of killing all of his classmates. The person who killed his classmates is the source of all sin branches and infected him with it, giving him powers. \\n\\n\r\nYou follow the main character in his journey in the prison, meeting people, adapting to the harsh prison and fighting, of course. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art didn't impress me, nor did it disappoint me. It's a style that is very versatile and the special effects were well done, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe anime being a thriller, you have to feel some anxiety when you watch it and personally, the sound was what did it for me. The very exciting music and the special effects surrounding the deaths and battles was very, very well done. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe lowest point of my review. The characters are very, very, very stereotyped. There wasn't an episode I couldn't compare one of the characters to another one from another anime. The main character is your typical weakling that becomes stronger, such as Naruto. His friend, Shiro, resemble the very naive girl you might find when watching animes like Kobato or Elfen Lied. Some side characters were very typical too, ranging from the muscle-head that ends up being kind as hell and the traitor who ends up being an ally. The characters didn't impress me and most of them didn't have much development. The main character doesn't have the time to develop much in so little episodes and this is a bit disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland is full of surprises. Surprises that do not always get explaining or conclusion. For my part, this didn't bother me. I had a very good time watching the 12 episodes and couldn't take my eyes of the screen. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you start watching Deadman Wonderland with the hopes of having all your questions answered, you will be disappointed. It is true and I will not be denying it, this anime is incomplete. Many questions arise when you start watching it. Who, how, why, what ? Most of them won't get answered. You will be left with an ending that isn't disappointing in itself, but it leaves you to believe that there will be more, but there won't. It's over. \\n\\n\r\nSome people get very angry with that and to be honest, I'm usually one of those people. For some reason however, maybe because the anime compensated in many other ways, I wasn't upset at all by the ending. I felt like the characters were left in a point where their story would continue and that I didn't have to know more, I didn't have to know if everyone would finally know the truth. I leave that behind and I leave it without regrets. I definitely recommend this anime for a boring evening, with a bowl of popcorn aside. Enjoy!",

And by that I mean literally give it my hand because I'm afraid they're going to cut it off like they did the rest of the characters in this show. All joking aside, let's talk about the Wonderland.\r\nI feel this anime could have had the potential to evolve into a burgeoning 48 episode Shounen or something, but it's unfortunately just the main 12 episodes and a single backstory episode on one of the characters. Even without reading the manga, I could tell that some severely important details were left out that really just leads to adisassociation with the characters. While I won't deny some of the premises were really cool, the faults of this anime really lie with whatever sorry bastard decided they could fit a fictitious Japanese universe + character development + plot in a mere 12 episodes. These factors combined lead to a notoriously disappointing \"resolution.\" Also, the main character's voice makes me want to shoot myself.",

In order to raise funds for rebuilding, Deadman Wonderland, the first privately owned prison, uses it\u2019s prisoners as amusement park attractions. Igarashi Ganta is accused of the massacre of his classmates. Falsely accused, Ganta is tried and sent to Deadman Wonderland where he sees the horrors that lie beneath this amusement park.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story and concept itself is very interesting. Though, I may be biased since I am fond of anime in the horror/gore genre. Anyway, Deadman Wonderland tackles the truth, no matter how gruesome it is. Between the blood and death,you will not be able to turn your eyes away from the screen. The major factors in the story are revealed little by little, something I praise the mangaka for. While there are some plotholes and other things that may seem as a downside, I believe that it won\u2019t matter that much, and if you find that the fact that this is overly violent or non realistic, then I say that you\u2019re wrong. As I said before: It shows the truth as it is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is attractive and surprisingly accurate. I have nothing more to elaborate on this subject.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nYou will find yourself supporting the characters, feeling what they feel, crying when someone dies. The characters are introduced in such a way, that they will leave a big impression on you, regardless of their position in the story. All characters have their own unique pasts and traits, something you will come to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\r\nI think that anyone will enjoy this\u2026if you are willing to sit through lots and lots of blood. It is really a beautiful story with deep meaning. Deadman Wonderland is a masterpiece\\n",

That's double your typical chapter length and the show follows the standard practice of putting two chapters together for each episode.\r\nWhat ends up happening is that they try to cram far too much into a single episode than they can reasonably be expected too. Which means things have to be cut. Problem is that there isn't much you can cut from the manga. The length of each chapter allowed for theappropriate pacing to be used. This is the root problem for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the get go a main character gets cut out altogether. Meaning a major plot point with her becomes multiple plot holes and the emotional reaction her arc brings disappears even if they attempt to cover her part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the anime looks awesome and I want to enjoy it, but I had to quit when the first episode showed that they were not just cutting parts, but cleaving chunks out. You will get a much more enjoyable experience reading the manga for this on.",

            "content": "Whenever I think of Deadman Wonderland I think of one thing in particular, lost potential. It started out extremely strong, but then soon started to go down hill\r\nRating List:\r\nStory 5/10: This is were Deadman Wonderland gets things a little wrong. The first episode drew me in with its interesting hook almost immediately, and I was extremely excited to watch the next episode afterwards. However after the first episode...everything started to go downhill. The story is quite honestly a bit of a mess, with enough plot holes to fit into a cruise liner. It's good when your watching it because there is action and awesome fightscenes. But when you sit down and think about it, things don't always add up. Now one thing that the story does gain a few points in would be originality. It was the original presentation of the situation as a whole that was so riveting and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10: The characters in Deadman Wonderland were actually rather impressive. Many of the characters were rather original and had interesting backgrounds and personalities. That is of course, with the exception of the main character Ganta Igarashi. Ganta is...well, a huge coward. There were many times during the series where he lacked any form of courage at all. Now, I will admit that the situation that Ganta is put into would probably terrify many people and drive many to the point of insanity. Perhaps I\u2019m being a little harsh here, but there has to be some sort of limit to cowardice. Even though its understandable why Ganta turns out the way he does, it\u2019s just not fun to watch a main lead that it always complains and crys. The other main character is Shiro, is rather peculiar. She really lightens up the mood when she is on screen because of her wacky personality, and she was quite fun to watch. She also has an air of mystery around her because of this. The side characters are the real stars of the show, and this is because many of them original and interesting.They all have their own motives and powers, many of the side characters are just completely insane, as well. One of the things that I really liked about the show were the interactions of a large group of the completely insane inmates trapped together in the completely insane prison. My main complaint about the shows side characters are that we really don't get enough of them. What I mean by that statement is that even though we are given many of the character\u2019s backgrounds and many of the backstories and personalities are rather interesting; It feel as though my time with them is always cut too short. This is probably due to the fact that it's a 12 episode show, so it does not have enough time to flesh out all of its side characters. But it made is rather disappointed when the show introduces a new character with a really interesting personality and background, just to move on with the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: This is another one of the areas were Deadman Wonderland did a good job. One of the things that Deadman Wonderland does right is atmosphere. The art style itself is very dark and creepy, it really fits the mood of the show well. There is also a good amount of detail put into the backgrounds, which really got a good feeling for the insanity of the prison itself.  Also the fight scenes are animated rather impressively. The animation flowed well, and there are some scenes that looked visually stunning. The show as a whole is very bloody and violent, and the art does not fail to represent the horrific things going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: As I stated before, probably the best thing about Deadman Wonderland is the atmosphere of the show as a whole. The music at some points really does help set that eerie mood. The soundtrack has a lot of creepy, bass heavy music that can really add to the feeling and aspects of the show. In almost all instances the music only enhanced the show, and really did a good job fitting the show\u2019s mood. Add to that the openings and endings that are simply incredible, and the soundtrack is very impressive overall.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: I have very mixed feelings when it comes to my enjoyment of the show. If you just turn off the inner critic within you and sit back and enjoy the show, then you will be pleased with the show. However, if you cannot simply sit back and experience the show, then the amount of plot holes will probably drive you insane. As for my personal enjoyment, I would have to say that it was decent. I could\u2014for the most part\u2014ignore the problems in the show.  This is due to the fact that I loved the feeling that I had while I was watching the show, and would probably watch it again if given the chance.",

        {
            "content": "I started watching Deadman Wonderland because the idea of being put in prison and having to compete in deadly games seemed like it would be pretty scary and intense. The show starts out really well by setting up the plot and adding in a lot of mystery and conspiracy, but I think it fails in delivering any closure. Instead there are just a lot of unanswered questions. This is one of those shows that had potential to be something amazing, but didn't exactly get there. \r\nStory (C+) - Well, what I imagined the story to be was a little different than what the actual storywas throughout the whole series. A kid named Ganta is falsely accused of murder and sent to a prison called Deadman Wonderland. It turns out that this isn't a normal prison. Everyone has to compete in deadly games in a kind of amusement park style. Naturally, Ganta is confused and scared and doesn't know what to do. We also find out that in order to survive, the prisoners have to eat candy which can only be bought by participating in the games and earning money. If they don't eat a certain amount then a collar on their neck will poison them. This is the basic premise of the story. \\n\r\nAll of that sounds really interesting, and for the first few episodes we see Ganta being forced to do things he doesn't want to do while trying to solve the mystery of who murdered his friends and framed him for it. Everything was going pretty smoothly until all of sudden Ganta meets a resistance group made up of prisoners who want to escape Deadman Wonderland. So about halfway through the show Ganta and his new friends start planning a way to escape. This is when I started to realize that some parts of this show don't really make any sense.\\n\r\nFirst of all, I'm supposed to believe that this \"prison\" is allowed to make their prisoners compete in games that could kill them? Not only that, but the outside world believes that Deadman Wonderland is an amusement park, and they watch the prisoners kill eachother during their deathmatches. But that's not even the best part. We're supposed to believe that the public has NO IDEA that the people they're watching kill eachother are actually from jail....last time I checked the prison was called Deadman Wonderland...so if the Amusement park is called the same thing then why would the people not know what was going on??? Plus, if the inmates were GETTING KILLED right in front of their eyes, then I really don't understand how they couldn't know. The other thing that bothered me was the candy. I thought the candy was going to be a big deal, but no. They talk about it for like one episode and then we never see it again until episode 12...  \\n\r\nThe other thing that really got on my nerves was why everyone was able to roam around the prison like they were on vacation. This is supposed to be some high-level security prison. I mean, there's all this technology (it's like 2020 or something), they even have to wear collars! Yet everyone walks around, going into eachother's rooms, and conversing with eachother like it's nothing. Um, what? That makes no sense. They shouldn't even be able to get together to plan an escape, let alone leave their own rooms whenever they feel like it. Stuff like this REALLY bothered me because one minute you're forced to participate in a deathmatch, and the next minute you're able to go blow up part of the building without any consequences. Do they not have surveillance cameras???? \\n\r\nThen there's the whole branches of sin thing. It's some power that lets you manipulate your blood. Only people called \"deadmen\" can do it. It looks pretty cool for awhile...but I just don't think it was used enough. I thought the whole point of the story was to show Ganta in jail trying to figure out who killed his friends, while trying to stay alive by surviving  all the deadly games and becoming stronger. He fights in like 2 deathmatches the whole show...pretty dissapointing. There's a lot of violence and blood too - which is pretty intimidating at first. But seeing how easily the prisoners can walk around the jail and go hide in a broom closet or something made everything less scary.\\n\r\nLike I said before, the second half of the show is mostly Ganta trying to escape, which pretty much goes nowhere and advances pretty slowly. A lot of the plot development from the first half is completely abandoned in the second half. It's like a completely different story. A lot of episodes dragged on without much character or story development. I'm guessing this show will have a sequel because the last episode ended on a pretty lame cliffhanger. Overall, I liked the idea of Deadman Wonderland, and for a little bit it was on a roll. The story just deviated too much and focused on things I didn't care about when it could have been answering questions and actually developing the plot. \\n\\n\r\nArt (B+) - The animation is good. Everyone looked distinguishable, and the movements are nice and smooth. Sometimes the locations seemed a little bland and dark. I guess there's not much color to add to a prison, but yea. I thought everything was done well, but there was nothing groundbreaking or breathtaking. Still very good though. \\n\\n\r\nSound (B) - The music isn't...the best. There wasn't really that much to be honest (or atleast not much that stuck with me). I was kind of expecting more, especially for a show that's supposed to be somewhat suspenseful/intense. I actually really liked the OP and the ED though. I thought they both fit nicely. All the voice actors did a good job. Romi Paku did great, as always. Overall, I was expecting more music, but for such a short series they did good enough. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (C) - I guess 12 episodes isn't really enough to introduce a lot of characters and also develop them. The only person that we really get to know is Ganta. He's quiet guy who cries a lot (but I'm sure I would too if I were in his position) and he starts out pretty weak and helpless in the beginning....well actually he kinda stays that way. I was always waiting for him to become stronger and get more confidence in himself, but that didn't really happen. Instead, whenever he was about to lose he randomly got powerful and beat people. That cycle happened a lot of times. First he would complain about how weak he was, get beat up, and then he would suddenly think about how he didn't want to lose and then somehow win. I was okay with him winning, I mean I was rooting for him the whole time, but he did come off as a little bit pathetic. I still liked him though and I think he's a pretty likeable character. Hopefully he'll get a lot stronger next season.\\n\r\nThe only other character that we really get to see is Shiro. She's this weird albino girl that wears this skin tight suit. She's pretty amusing and random, and she's Ganta's best friend throughout the show. She's also really likeable. Shiro apparently has more to her than meets the eye, and seems to know some things about Ganta's false imprisonment. Shiro is a mysterious character who adds a lot of suspense and questions for the viewer. \\n\r\nLike I said, other than these two there's not really any other character to get attached to. There are a few other ones that seem like they'll be important to the story later, but there's just not enough development of them. One thing about the characters that I would have liked was an explanation of why they were in jail in the first place. I mean we know Ganta's innocent, but what about Shiro?? What did she do so bad that put her in jail?? What about the people in the resistance? Are they all innocent too?? Do they even deserve to escape? Hopefully those questions are answered.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (C+) - I wanted to like Deadman Wonderland more than I did, mostly because I really liked the premise of it. The whole idea of Ganta trying to figure out why he was framed for murder while being thrown into this nightmare of a prison sounds really good on paper, and maybe the manga delivers better than the show, but I was pretty underwhelmed. There are definitely some parts of the show that are enjoyable. There are some decent action scenes and every episode usually ends with the viewer wanting more. The branches of sin look pretty cool, and I liked how Shiro was really good at beating people up. But with so many unanswered questions and important aspects of the story completely ignored, it's hard to really enjoy it without getting a little frustrated. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (C) - I think I'm being a little nice to this show because in all honesty they could have done a much better job with it. I'm not sure how the manga is, but I know it's gotta be better than this. I gave this show a solid 7/10 because I think the story - while incomplete - is definitely interesting enough to watch. With only 12 episodes I'm sure it was hard to fit in a lot of details, but then that  makes me wonder why they didn't just make the show longer. I really like the idea of Deadman Wonderland, but the execution could have been much better. Hopefully season two surpasses it.",

            "content": "DW is an anime about a boy, Ganta, unjustly accused of slaughtering his entire class and sent to an amusement park high-tech prison that would give Amnesty International a fit. Once there, he befriends a white-haired retarded-genki-girl creatively named Shiro as he fights for his life in a sort of private gladiator arena and proceeds to be exploited by everyone he meets. Wait, that came out wrong\u2026 let's just say he's fooled by everything and everyone. \r\nStory: This anime is only twelve episodes long, which helps to illustrate what happens when you try to park a bus in your garage. Adapted from a manga, thereis not enough time to explain everything or give side characters some depth. As a result, we have several animated paper bags running around with Tragic Story post-it notes stuck on them. Of course, the story is not really the main selling point for this anime. You are watching this for the gore fest and flying limbs and buckets of superpowered blood. So, by the time this ends and major plot points are left unresolved you don't really care. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: We start off with innocent Ganta who after a certain point it is in a state of perpetual shock and spends a lot of time crying. That is quite understandable: after all, he is surrounded by psychopaths and sadists, like a mouse in a room full of cats. He doesn't get very annoying, props to the seiyuu, and grows a bit of backbone by the end. Speaking of annoying, we soon meet retarded Shiro who is less intelligent than a dog but physically stronger than the Hulk. And runs around in a body suit so tight it must give her an awful wedgie. Shiro remains constantly annoying and occasionally frightening. The rest of the characters have their (twisted) charms but their backstories are too rushed for us to care. Musclehead inmate Senji is perhaps the most appealing character and wisely kept to a minimum or else he would have easily upstaged Ganta as the main. Finally, the villains are all sadistic , sociopathic cartoons but they are fun to watch as they try to grind poor Ganta to the ground. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Stylishly done by famous Manglobe studio of Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy fame, now fallen on hard times and reduced to animating moe-tard shows to put food on their table. The opening sequence especially is beautifully done and the fight scenes follow with some nice details here and there. Visually, there are no complaints, it is a feast for the eyes (uh\u2026 maybe not quite the right expression in view of a certain episode).  \\n\\n\r\nMusic: Personally, I am fond of the opening song and I've only put it on repeat for about 2000 times. It's in English, by the way, and thankfully not in Engrish. The background music is also very good, with some haunting arrangements very well fitting the mood and splatteriness of it all. Some would say such a good music score is wasted on a mediocre anime like this. I think they may be right. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nAfter all the shock value is spent and the gore fest is over, this is actually a mediocre anime. It certainly isn't a keeper but if you like splatters and dismemberments and pretty, bloody pictures then give it a go. \\n",

            "content": "I've wanted to give writing a review a shot so this is the first one I have ever written and I decided to review Deadman Wonderland.\r\nDeadman Wonderland is a raw and gritty anime that really deserves that R rating, but does Deadman Wonderland set itself a part from every other shonen anime? What is it that makes Deadman Wonderland attractive to viewers? Is it because the amount of gore and violence rivals that of just about any horror movie, or is there more to it? These are questions I found myself asking before watching Deadman Wonderland and found the answers rather quickly into the 12episode series.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nWhen I first started watching Deadman Wonderland, I thought that the only thing it had going for it was the massive amount of gore and profanity in the first episode. But the more that I watched the series, the more I saw a real plot begin to develop. The relationship between Ganta Igarashi and Shiro seemed very strange and unnatural at first but once the story started to delve deeper into Ganta's back story it really started to make sense. I could not even count how many times while watching this I was jaw dropped and confused by the vast amount of plot twists. While the story was very good it also progressed poorly and often left me wondering what was going on. Not only did the story progress poorly, but it also wasn't fully developed. The plot jumps all over the place and changes almost every three or four episodes. The worst part about the plot is where it left off, if this doesn't get a second season then this will be another anime that fell victim to not having a true ending. Even with all of the negative aspects to the story, I still give it an eight based on the true core of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art quality in Deadman Wonderland was fantastic! The animation was very smooth and really helped set up the entire series. The dark colors gave it a very raw and gritty feeling that exposed the horrifying nature of the prison. The art played an integral part in the series and really set up the dark and somber tone throughout it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music in Deadman Wonderland played just as big of a part in setting up the dark tone of the series as the art quality. The soundtrack really helped tell the story and was one of the best soundtracks I have heard in an anime. The music was really dark and creepy, it was almost as if the music was made for a horror movie. The music really made up for the parts that were lacking in the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe main problem I had with the characters was that relationships were never really established and none of the characters truly developed besides Ganta. None of the relationships in the show were given time to develop which led to them feeling unbelievable and lacking a tight bond. Ganta's relationship with Shiro doesn't really makes sense until his childhood is explored and even then their relationship seems very confusing. His connection with Senji also seems very awkward and forced. I get that they share a bond based on respect, which isn't the first relationship that has been built on this, but it just doesn't feel right and is very rushed. Ganta's relationship with the resistance group also feels very rushed. He is only a part of the resistance for like a day or a couple of days and yet he has a great amount of faith and loyalty in the people that he has just met? It just doesn't feel natural. Moving on to character development which is very weak throughout the series. Ganta is the only character who I truly felt developed throughout his time spent in prison. The fact that he is just a frightened and cowardice child in the beginning who matures into a strong person who wants nothing more than to be able to protect his friends is great. I loved that, but because the anime is so short, none of the other characters get developed in the process.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI felt that this series was very enjoyable if you are either a fan of gore or aren't bothered by it. If you can't stand to watch very graphic and cringe worthy scenes than you most likely won't enjoy Deadman Wonderland. I thought that while the gore was overused, it also played a necessary part in displaying the terrifying nature of the prison. Not only was the gore necessary, but it also made the viewer sympathize with the protagonists of the series. The horrifying torment and abuse that the Branches of Sin users went through was very tragic and heartbreaking, especially for a character like Nagi. I highly enjoyed Deadman Wonderland for the disturbing portrayal of not only the life inside of the prison, but also for the corrupt people behind the whole thing. I felt that it sent a relatively real message about how people in charge often abuse their power.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIn the end, I felt that Deadman Wonderland was very much worth the watch and was very well done. As I have stated, I feel that the lack of character development, rushed plot, and the fact that the series felt unfinished at the end really are what kept this anime from being a must see classic. It would have been best if the creators had waited for the manga to finish in order to prevent the series from being left on a cliffhanger and gotten a fully developed plot. Instead we are left with an incomplete series that many people will view as \u201cokay\u201d. I gave Deadman Wonderland a nine because I found it to be highly enjoyable and one of the best core plots I have experienced in a shonen anime. Even though the plot did skip around a lot, it was a fundamentally great story that wasn't developed properly. In conclusion, I would highly recommend Deadman Wonderland to anyone who is looking for a more mature themed anime that is very unique and original.",

Deadman Wonderland is explicitly a gore anime, a bloodbath of an anime to compensate for it's terrible story and little character development. Deadman Wonderland quickly turned into a show about super powers after the first couple of episodes was introducing many themes, why the prison they stay in is privately owned and made to look like a circus; how can they have a circus where the inmates die in games but the public thinks it's all fake? Why is he specifically framed for the massacre of children. This show could've been a lot about character development and how life in prison can really affect you mentally and physically, the uprising of prisoners could've been better developed over a course of 20+ episodes or 2 seasons and would have been far more entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 Nothing special, pretty nice effects\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 Music fit the mood and tone of the show\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4 There were some instances of character development, but for the most part, many characters personalities and beliefs are unknown\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 Although this was more of a blood bath anime meant to entertain in the gruesome deaths and fights in it, it was still somewhat entertaining and made me want more of this series, but only because I'm interested in how the story and characters could develop.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5.6 but we'll round it to a 6",

            "content": "This is a great anime for people who enjoy gore. Blood is everywhere and there is not a single episode where at least one drop isn\u2019t spilt. It shows what people with a lot of money can create and get away with, how extreme losses can affect the sanity of a person, and how twisted people with the power of manipulation can make life. The characters that make up this anime have all had devastating events happen to them. But despite all of that, even with past devastation, there are characters who still have hope and the will to fight to the bitter end. Mostof the characters that really count have interesting back stories that help the viewers understand why they are the way they are. \\n\r\nThere were a couple of disappointing things for me in this anime though. 1) The lack of Shiro\u2019s full development 2) The ending\\n\\n\r\nShiro is a vital character to this anime and they did show a little of her past because of Ganta but they didn\u2019t really show where she came from or what was going on with her enough to make her as powerful as she was. They hinted a little bit but didn\u2019t explore it to its full potential. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if there was a second season. They left it open because they were counting on a second season but when the people in Japan didn\u2019t take as much interest in it as they expected they dropped it. Of course if the viewers really wanted to know what happens after the 12th episode they can read the manga, but because of how they ended it, it leaves the viewer expecting more\u2026.only to get nothing.\\n\\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed watching this anime. It had me hooked from the beginning and wasn\u2019t like anything I had ever watched before. I would recommend it for anyone who loves action, gore, and drama. I warn viewers that the ending is sudden and open but it is still definitely worth the watch.",

The onlything the show has is good animation. They really try to wow the audience with over the top and unrealistic gore/fight scenes and unnecessary trash dialogue that makes other characters, and especially the mc, appear to be elementary school kids who just learned how to cuss and are trying to use them in sentences for the first time. Any kind of character development is absent as every character remains unchanged from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the story and the mc show no development. It could be translated as an immense number of plot holes or the fact that there was no story to being with. Either way this illustrates how the show failed in just about every way possible.",

            "content": "Remember Lance Armstrong? The guy who managed to cheat perhaps every single fucking organism on the planet? What I am going to present you is the anime version of him. If you don't know better, Deadman Wonderland will come to you as a pretty good anime. However it is perhaps the worst anime adaptation of all time.\r\nNow where do I start? I myself don't know seriously. But I guess that a brief introduction will do a whole lot of good for you guys who don't have a clue about it. Simply put it is a horror survival anime with some action. Now let me statethat this show requires you having well developed testicles since the blood, gore and the themes present are not for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nOk lets begin. Simply put, this anime is a fucking piece of garbage. A colossal waste of time. Now I hear you say, 'The premise looks very good and and many people have said that it is good!' Unfortunately the people who recommended you this anime don't know anything about the source material which is perhaps one of the best manga I have ever read. It basically spits on the manga and shows it the biggest middle finger possible. \\n\\n\r\nNow I will focus on it's story. Incomplete anime in my opinion are equivalent to the offspring of Hitler and  Mussolini. But what gets my blood boiling is how much damage it does to the manga. The anime was used as a promotional thing. But how do you promote a fantastic work with the worst adaptation ever? Its fucking incomplete. It leaves you asking why you ever watched it since you could have spend the time changing your pathetic life and making yourself a better person. \\n\\n\r\nThe art's pretty good. Animation is top notch and I have no complaints here.Battle scenes don't' cut any corners. Visuals complement the anime very well. Overall I think the animation is pretty solid stuff.\\n\\n\r\nNow give me a moment to tell you about the opening. Its the best fucking opening I have ever listened to. Its called One reason and there is no reason for you to not to listen to it. It's a rock song with excellent lyrics. Mother fucking excellent lyrics. Listen to the complete version of the song and you will appreciate how well it describes the feelings of the protagonists. Along with Lain's Duvet and Mirai Nikki's Kuusou Mesorogiwi, it is simply the best opening I have ever listened to. \\n\\n\r\nBut before that let me tell you about the animation which accompanies the song. It's fantabulous. Sexy. Mesmerizing. Amazingly well made.\\n\\n\r\n Now you are probably thinking what a hypocrite I am. In the beginning I was bashing this anime and now I am praising it. But the previous paragraph was the last positive paragraph I have for this anime before I get back into my rage mode.\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland has decent characters. But no character development whatsoever. Whiny boy stays whiny. Before you attack me saying that it is only 12 eps long, a good anime can completely flesh out it's characters in 6 episodes. And then there are Mockingbird and Shiro. You want to know more about them. But the anime proceeds to give you the biggest cock block of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the manga. I shouldn't do this on an anime review but I have to do so. The manga is all round excellent. Everything is superb. Read it. Like right fucking now. Then see the anime( please don't) and you will understand the disservice done by it.\\n\\n\r\nI apologize if this review came across as a rant. I sincerely tried my best not to make it look like one. Maybe it was on the border. But I had to say something about it. It's a mess. If it would have been longer with around 30-40 episodes and adapted faithfully, I would praised the living shit out of it. But I find myself criticizing it instead. My advice to you would be to read the manga and forget that this anime existed.\\n\\n",

The art style was not appealing to me, and the plot was just empty to me.  Not a single episode excited me, and I didn't feel any attachment to the characters or the series itself.\r\nThe character development is poor.  We didn't really get to know Ganta Igarashi's life andcharacter before his class was suddenly killed and he was blamed for it.  Not only did this damage his character, but it also damaged the plot because it seemed too rushed.  Even when he was placed within Deadman Wonderland, his character and life before imprisonment was poorly-written.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think that the anime is horrible.  Having heard such good things about the manga, I think that the anime had a lot of potential but the production staff didn't do a good job.",

I feel it's along the lines of the Elfen Lied house of storytelling, using shock and violence not as filler, but as a driving force for narrative. Focusing on Ganta, aka Woodpecker, is just a normal boy, until his entire class is murdered. After being falsely accused, and then being beaten multiple times because of it, he finds himself in Deadman Wonderland, a sort of Jigsaw/Death Race/ Running Man hybrid of violent contests in the name of entertainment. That's all I'm going to say story wise, due to not wanting tospoil anything, but it's definitely a series worth watching if you enjoy watching shock plot.",

And I see that one point of critique is the limited 12 episodes HOWEVER i do believe there's a very good chance for an extension of the anime for a second season and maybe even beyond that.\r\nStory: The story has a good premise, unlike most other anime's, when i watch deadman wonderland i'm not strongly reminded of any other anime series which serves as a testament to its originality. The series starts off very strongly in my opinion, however I did bring it down because a few times inthe latter episodes i did find myself doubting the plausibility of many scenarios, I know that almost everyone will rebut by saying its an anime its not supposed to be realistic, but suspension of disbelief is something writers have to strive hard to achieve as well. Final score for story is 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound are both outstanding in my opinion, the quality of animation is fantastic and the style and heavy use of red tones gives the series a very unique feeling. Sound is also pulled off extremely well, the music is always dark but ranges from a straight off heavy metal track to gloomy opera like style music, music choice is also usually spot on for the sequence.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the one thing that lets down DW in my opinion, i started off feeling very sympathetic towards Ganta but as the show progressed i found myself caring about him less and less. Also the backstory to hummingbird i thought was a bit too weak and unrealistic, they went for shock but i find myself almost laughing at the stupidity of the sequence (i won't specify - spoilers). Shiro is probably the only character i find consistently interesting at this point in the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i very much still enjoy Deadman Wonderland, and urge more people to watch it especially if you're a fan of darker stories such as elfen lied and higurashi no naku koro ni. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 final score",

The entire series, I was bracing myself for the predictions of horrible characters getting worse...and never had to take the blow.\r\nI'm not going to go over each section, but something must be said for Ganta. He is a whiny, three-quarters-helpless little brat who seems to just be stuck in the ensuing chaos. And you know what? I consider that to be his saving grace as a character. He's realistic and believable in how his opponents normally mop the floor with him; to the contrary, the only thingthat irks me about him is how he eventually ends up on top. A traumatized schoolkid, his wimping out and bawling every five minutes both stick with him to the end of the series, which I appreciate deeply. I have had just about enough of starting out with a wimpy male lead and having the writers try to toughen him up. (Most of the time, they utterly fail.) They let Ganta be a brat and stay a brat.

            "content": "Before I start this review.. I want to greet everybody with an early \"Happy Halloween\" As you can see.. Deadman Wonderland is an anime of, in my opinion, the horrible, the most terrifying, the most bloody.. When I finished this.. Eeeehhh!! It's.. you know... Scary..\r\nThis anime is surely a dark one.. It has dark plot, dark character.. anything in this anime is dark.. It is surely for adults who are brave enough to watch this kind of stuff.. Maybe I am exaggerating a bit but this is what I felt..\r\nWell, where in the blue hell can you see a prison wherein a boy of Ithink 15 years old will be imprisoned? Well, I feel sorry for Ganta because his background is definitely a background of very sorry, very unfortunate, very pitiful moments..\\n\\n\r\nThis is a short preview... There is this prison in the middle of some city.. That prison is known for having amusement park establishments.. All those establishments where run by the inmates themselves..  Welcome to the not sure if hell or heaven prison called Deadman Wonderland.. Then after some screw up moment, a boy named Ganta was imprisoned in this one hell of a place.. In that prison, he met a girl named Shiro.. Then, together with Shiro, Ganta was further involved in some of the most screwed up scenarios inside that prison.. There are fights involved wherein you must not lose.. Ganta must fight in order to save his sorry bass to the unfairness of reality..\\n\\n\r\nHere are my thoughts..\\n\\n\r\nStory (9)\\n\r\nI was like \"F*ck this series!\".. I meant it in a positive way and a negative way.. Let's discuss first with the positive side.. This is one hell of a story.. The moment that they showed the \"amusement park\" like prison, it will definitely sparks your interest.. Not only that, the way the story flows, it has shocking plot twists, plot devices and plot elements.. You need to see them for yourselves and I assure you, you're going to find the awesomeness despite all the disturbing things that you're going to see.. I mean it! It's freaking awesome!!\\n\\n\r\nOn the negative side... I'm going to give the one main word: DISTURBING... All of the things that happened in this series are really disturbing.. The gore, bloodshed, mentality, mind games, the personalities of people etc.. You will definitely sensed that there is something about the minds of these people are really screwed up.. There are many loose screws on their heads.. Also, the hardships and trials that the main protagonist Ganta endured. For me, it's very damn disturbing.. You know, this is really DISTURBING.. I think that this anime is \\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\r\nIn my opinion, there are no questions to be asked in the art.. The art is good.. The animation is fluid... Perfect!!\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\r\nWell.. the theme songs are quite fine..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9)\\n\r\nAs what my main word says: DISTURBING.. There are a bunch of disturbing characters that showed up in this series.. I'm going to give a short list of some of the traits of some characters but I will not reveal them so that there are no spoilers.. ok? There is the:\\n\r\n1) Mentally screwed up\\n\r\n2) Sadistic\\n\r\n3) Master mind\\n\r\n4) Pitiful\\n\r\n5) Gay\\n\r\n6) Has split personality\\n\r\n7) Traitor\\n\r\n8) Fired up to kill or hurt people\\n\r\nSee? Those are some of the characters that you will see.. Take note, I didn't list up some positive characteristics in order to be biased with the DISTURBING motif, it's just that there are no positive that can be listed..\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8)\\n\r\nYou are going to ask me if I enjoy the series? \\n\r\nHonestly speaking, I am 50/50.. \\n\r\n50 % me says that I did enjoy the series  because of the shonen elements within it.. You know, the action flavor with some dramas and other elements..\\n\\n\r\nThe other 50% says that I am scared like hell!! It's freaking scary.. The version that I watched is censored or filtered.. Imagine if it is not filtered..\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nDespite some moments wherein I felt scared and disturbed, this series has something special within it.. You know, it makes you want to read the manga version of it.. You will be interested on what comes next.. There are more things to come aside from the things that were shown in the anime..\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing, are you brave enough to watch this in it uncensored version? Do it!! If there is a uncensored version.. This is a good anime to watch especially when Halloween comes.. As what the motif says, also watch Halloween-related shows.. That means watch scary shows.. Just try to compare which is scarier: SAW or this one.. HAHA.. Anyway.. Good Luck and have fun..\\n\\n\r\nThat's all\\n\\n\r\nLightningSnow :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland has gotten its fair share of mixed reviews over the years. It\u2019s got its ups and downs. Is it overrated? Probably. Is it bad? I wouldn\u2019t say so. I think most people will enjoy it to some extent and it's definitely great for people looking to watch a good violent thriller show.\r\nAs for the story, it\u2019s fairly descent but not flawless. So our main character Ganta is thrown into Deadman Wonderland. A prison where inmates fight each other to the death and endure deadly obstacle courses for the amusement of the public. I know. It\u2019s sick. Especially when you see families with theirchildren in the crowd. Eventually Ganta discovers that he\u2019s one of the \u201cdeadman\u201d a person who can control their blood and use it as a weapon.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that for me the best episodes were the first few of the show as they set up a great concept. The downfall is that the show takes a slightly different rout than we expect it to. Ganta gets involved in a few fights with other deadman convicts but eventually teams up with the other deadman of the prison in an attempt to escape and let the world know of all the horrors going on in the prison. (because apparently the citizens believe all the blood and deaths they are seeing are just special effects) I wouldn't say this story is bad by any means but I think it could have been much better if they had focused more on Ganta trying to prove his innocence and find out the identity of the \u201cRedman\u201d (the one who really killed all his classmates) while in the meantime, trying to survive the dangers of the prison. Now these things are not dropped. They are dealt with in the show, but I felt they treated them too much as minor subplots when they should have been the main focus of the story. The blood fights themselves are definitely cool and each deadman has different abilities and styles in which they use their blood which makes fights very fun to watch but I still would have rather seen them focus a little more on obstacle courses like the one in episode 2. The pacing is a little on the slow side but there are a lot of points in the show that should keep you interested nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nGanta is an alright protagonist. Out of nowhere he\u2019s suddenly framed for the brutal murder of his entire class and is thrown into the worst prison in the world so he obviously starts off scared and confused thinking \u201cWhat in the world just happened to me!?!\u201d like anyone would but once he comes to terms with what happened, he has the drive to become stronger which makes him fairly admirable. His character develops slowly but it does develop.\\n\\n\r\nShiro is pretty great. Fun, goofy, and loveable with a good amount of mystery to her to keep you interested and Kana Hanazawa does a fantastic acting job as always. Not to mention there's a jaw-dropping plot twist with her character around half way through the show that will more than double your interest in her.\\n\\n\r\nMinatsuki Takami aka \u201cHummingbird\u201d is also a great character but there\u2019s not much I can tell you about her without spoilers. I\u2019ll just say that I though she was great and it\u2019s a little disappointing that she got such a small amount of screen time. She got a lot of focus when she first showed up but then kind of faded away.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters in the show, they\u2019re descent enough as they each have their own things about them that make them interesting. A lot of the deadman later on in the show seem to be fairly good people and it makes you wonder what they did that got them thrown into a prison like Deadman Wonderland and if maybe they were framed like Ganta.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is good and the blood fights especially are well animated. The soundtrack is also good and the opening fits the show well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ending, the show is unfinished and requires a season 2 (which I\u2019m guessing they won\u2019t make) They did this with Claymore too, though Deadman Wonderland is a much more open ending than Claymore\u2019s was. Basically if you want to finish the story you will need to read the manga, which is completed. I myself have not read it yet but I\u2019m sure I will eventually because I do want to know how this show ends considering the ginormous amount of unanswered vital questions this show left us with. And who knows. It might change everything I\u2019ve said in this review but for now these are my thoughts on this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you haven\u2019t seen Deadman Wonderland yet then this is a show I would recommend you see at some point in your anime life especially if your into this type of genre. I definitely enjoyed this show and I\u2019d say watch it at your convenience but it\u2019s not something I would really push anyone to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n",

            "content": "Critic\u2019s Log - Earthdate: October 31, 2013. Review #66: Deadman Wonderland\r\nWhat happens when you combine Alice in Wonderland, The Hunger Games, Prison Break, and something that Stephen King could\u2019ve written. You get Deadman Wonderland!\r\nGanta Igarashi has been convicted of a crime that he hasn't committed, (Trust me, it\u2019s not like Alexandre Dumas\u2019 The Count of Monte Cristo).  He is sent to a new, privately owned and operated prison facility, where the inmates are the main attraction in a modern day twist to the gladiatorial coliseums of ancient times. Ganta meets a weird girl named Shiro (he he, because she\u2019s Albino, go figure) and hediscovers a new found super power powers, and a little conspiracy theory. Welcome to Deadman Wonderland.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, this is a Studio Manglobe production. Ever heard of Samurai Champloo? Well, this studio worked on that anime and it was a stylish anime. This anime has some stylish action and the animation looks really good for the most part. Maybe too good, Samurai Champloo had some hiccups, but the animation is Deadman Wonderland\u2019s greatest strength and sadly, it\u2019s the show\u2019s only good factor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music by NARASAKI isn\u2019t really as memorable as some would hope, the soundtrack does have a couple good tracks, but there are some pretty forgettable themes in the show, so don\u2019t expect a spectacular soundtrack out of this one, but here\u2019s one highlight of the music and that is the opening theme song. The visuals are pretty badass, but the song really kicks ass. Some of the imagery is kind of messed up, but what do you expect when it\u2019s about someone competing in something that is similar to the Hunger Games but in Prison and more brutal. The Closing theme is ok but nothing much. The music is fitting, has some memorable themes, but mostly forgettable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Japanese casting, Romi Park is pretty damn good as Ganta. Kana Hanazawa sounds fun to hear as Shiro, and I really don\u2019t want to go over the entire cast, as small as they are. Noteworthy seiyus include Junichi Suwabe as Tamaki, Yuji Kaji as Yo Tamaki, Daisuke Ono as Nagi Kengamine, Jun Fukuyuma as Rokuro Bundo, and Toshiyuki Morikawa as Higashi Genkaku. As for the English dub, It is performed very well\u2026 But I am probably going to get flamed for this but here goes\u2026 Greg Ayres is not a bad voice actor, but he was not a good choice as Ganta. Every time I hear his voice and see Ganta\u2019s voice, I just don\u2019t see it match. My only complaint with the dub is Ganta. So get used to hearing his whiny voice while watching the dub. Monica Rial on the other hand was terrific as Shiro. Noteworthy Dub voices include Aaron Dismuke as Yo Takami, Colleen Clinkenbeard as Chief Makina, Eric Vale as Tamaki. J. Michael Tatum as Nagi Kengamine, and Patrick Seitz as Senji. The Dub is good, but I would suggest the subs if you don\u2019t like Ganta\u2019s english voice. But the ADR direction by Joel McDonald is pretty good for the most part.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, Ganta is pretty whiny from time to time and this is excused for quite a while because of what Ganta goes through. But as it progresses\u2026He does stay whiny, and doesn\u2019t necessarily toughen up as he should be. As for Shiro, I really find her adorable. She is cute, she can kick ass. But that is all I will say about her. Yo Takami is a pretty decent supporting character, but the complication between him and her sister was a bit interesting. Tamaki is a bastard, but Chief Makina is a badass, even if she\u2019s not fully developed. I wouldn\u2019t screw with her even if she has G cup boobs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNagi Kengamine is interesting along the way, but there is one major problem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe premise may have been very interesting, and there were some interesting flashbacks. But there are some things that were not fully explained that needed it, and the ending is abrupt and makes the series unfinished. The ending to this show is one of the worst I have ever seen. But that is not really the show\u2019s fault, oh wait. It was their fault unfortunately\u2026 You see, the anime adaptation sadly did not fare well in Japan and even though this anime ends with a possibility of a sequel, we are most likely never gonna get it. If you wanna take my advice, stick with the manga on this one. But I still recommend the anime in case you are unsure of the manga. Yeah, it is odd that I am recommending you to see this anime even though the manga is more complete than this incomplete show. I was contempt that it wasn\u2019t a masterpiece, and I was entertained as well as in for a twisted ride, but unfortunately. The ending is the greatest disappointment to this show, after all that much potential of seeing Deadman Wonderland as a great series. But it isn\u2019t meant to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland is available by Funimation, the manga written by Jinsei Kataoka and illustrated by Kazuma Kondou was available by Tokyopop but was rescued by Viz Media, the 1 episode OVA prequel \u201cRed Knife Weilder\u201d is also available by Funimation which was released with the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Deadman Wonderland was a twisted series that manages to entertain and frighten. It has damn good animation, a somewhat generic soundtrack with some memorable themes and a kickass opening, some interesting characters, and a plot that is kind of like Hunger Games, Prison Break, and something that even Stephen King could\u2019ve written\u2026 all mixed together. But sadly, the ending just flat out killed everything the series was going for and has made Deadman Wonderland turn from being something that would have standed out into a show that became a huge disappointment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Deadman Wonderland a 5.2 out of 10, it is SO and SO. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment.",

            "content": "Okkay..So,this review may contain spoils of the anime.\r\nDeadman Wonderland kind of disappointed me. Here are the reasons why. But overall I really enjoy this anime. I'm disappointed, because I have the feeling and the conviction it could have be better.\r\n**********STORY**********\r\nPersonally I think DW have an excellent story and they should have exploited it more. The first episode went really quick. *****SPOILS****The massacre of Ganta's class and then right after that the trial of Ganta.Then, he goes to this place called Deadman Wonderland, the only private prison of Japan and at this prison he meets Shiro, a girl that will help him during all the anime.Everything I just mention is just in 1 episode. Seriously, it could easily be 5 episodes. I was a bit upset. Who won't be !? I give a 6/10\\n\\n\r\n**********ART**********\\n\r\nIn my opinion, I really like the style of how the character were drawn. Also, it's really detailed.Of course, it's nothing compared to what Makoto Shinkai do, but it still detailed and also I really liked how the blood was realized. It was an new way to use blood I did see.In this DW, Deadmen, the ones who have their blood affected because of the Red Hole, have special powers or you can call that habilities. Overall, I love the art. I give a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n**********SOUND*********\\n\r\nI don't know really what to say about the sound 'cause I know that my sound wasn't really great due to the quality of the video on Internet. The opening,One reason, was well choose compare to the style of the anime an alternative rock song from the band Fade.Ya, I think I have nothing more to say about the sound. I give a 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**********CHARACTER*********\\n\r\nOhh.. Let's talk about the characters. There is not a single character I don't hate. \\n\r\nOhh.. Let's talk about the characters. There is not a single character I don't hate. They did a good job when we look the relation between them and to convey the character feelings and everything about the personnality,etc. But the only problem is would have like to know more about them. For examples, Shiro's past, Nagi's one too,also Karako and many others. They just did an overview of Genkaku,Ganta and Nagi. There is just Crow,Senji, in a Ova we saw the past of Senji. So, that is a really big problem of DW.The anime, if they have done that,could have at least 30-40 episodes. This was my biggest disappointment. I give a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\n**********ENJOYMENT*********\\n\r\nWell, I think everything above gives you a clue if I enjoy it or not. \\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime. It's a bit short for what they could have done. I would like to enjoy longer, but what can I do. Nothing. I'll have to read the manga to know the end 'cause Ahh.. this ending leaves me disappointed. haha I find I used a lot ''disappointed'' in this review, but i think it's the perfect word to resume how I feel. I give a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe final result: 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review will be helpful to make your choice to watch it or not.:)\\n\\n\\n\r\n-There might have mistakes in this review.I try my best to make the least possible. My first language is French. In case you want to know why I make a little note like this.\\n",

Why do we need a mental hospital to stay over?\r\nStory 4/10\r\nWhat can I say.. I Don't know what the fuck is going on in the beginning until the very end of the series.. The Psychological Element and horror in this theme is outstanding but it lacks more potential for the audiences. We have here call them selves as Deadman and Ganta is one of them..It all happens at his school where the Red man called \"Wretched Egg\" (That's so Lame Title/Alias or Nickname).. demolished the whole class within his(I would say he but it reveals that it's a she for the past episode) Blood Manipulating Abilities. Only Ganta survives and now woke up in a perfect state at the  hospital Wait Is this some Kind of Joke? after the events happened in the school he got framed and arrested... without any kind of explanation * Truly piece of Crap  on making an introduction, Every Plotholes diverted to the manga which is fully cut. and the ending doesn't make any sense and here I am I thought it could be better if it has symbolism but no, I don't sense anything.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\r\nLet Me Guess\\n\r\n(BTW I can't recall some names of other characters Sorry about that)\\n\r\nWe have A Wimpy Protagonist - Ganta\\n\r\nHappy Go Lucky Suicidal Girl - Shiro\\n\r\nPolice Before and now some Petty Badass Punk - Crow\\n\r\nThat Not So Virgin Girl\\n\r\nIdiot Dumbass Big Brother..\\n\r\nPuny Disgusting  Four eyes Guy\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic 10/10\\n\r\nOf All the English Opening I've heard this is the Best..

I enjoyed it every episodes but story backfired and felt rushed... No that I care about it. And  also balance Psychological, and blood is the most important thing when it comes to this show... Seeing every body getting killed by some blood, got sliced or melt.. And I was like \"Blood Manipulating more like Blood Bending haha lame...\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI know that this isn't for everyone but others were seeking for killing sudden death battle mayhem.

            "content": "My sister recommended this anime to me due to my love of the psychological/horror genres. I'm sorry to say that I'm rather dissapointed... This show had a lot of potential but the execution was terrible and it was crammed into an unorganized 12 episodes. \r\nThe story could've been good but it wasn't. It started out on a high note than it went downhill into cheap deaths and characters with 5 second screen time. I was looking forward to the ending hoping Ganta would face the red man (and if you watched the show you know how complicated that whole situation would've been) because THAT would'vebeen a shock value. That ended up dissapointing me more than anything else. The arcs were strangely put together going from battles to the death to choppy backstories to the happily ever after approach? \\n\\n\r\nThe art was very good, I enjoyed the character design and the gore wasn't too overwhelming. Theye also put good thought into color symbolism and how it affects the overall mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending were enjoyable. Nothing wrong there but not my favorite either. The opening bothered me a little though cause it looked.. fan made if that makes sense. Like an AMV. I liked the photography idea for the ending. Cute. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were all very interesting, I was hoping I could make one of them a favorite- but none of them had nearly enough screen time. Their stories seemed incomplete and the seemingly important characters didn't come until later. Speaking of later- what the hell was Ganta doing for the first 10 episodes? I get the whole underdog thing they were going for but his character is incredibly unrealistic and he would've died the second he stepped foot in that place. Also- the people running the place knew the (spoilers?) video was fake so why did they think he was so strong and special? His powers were lacking- the only thing they wanted was to test what the red man implanted. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment level is entirely biased and tbh I got bored after the fourth episode. I completed it just to see the ending (which drove me to write this review in the first place)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I wanted to enjoy this anime. It had an awesome opening and while the protagonist was annoying from the get-go, he was at least believable. It starts strong and then putters out as the series progresses. \r\nStarting off, the art style and animation work is absolutely phenomenal and at no point did it ever falter. Characters are crisp, movements are fluid, and the amount of work the creators put into the visuals is evident in every frame. The violence and gore is top notch and every wound is visceral and fulfilling. \r\nThe sound is also superb. No overused soundboard effects.The music could overall have beena bit better and that is my only complaint. \\n\r\nAs for the story, you will be let down. There is much intrigue toward the beginning but then the story quickly develops major pacing problems that plague the narrative up to the final seconds of the last episode. Characters are introduced and killed within seconds, characters that deserve  full introduction never get one and the viewer is left wondering why they should care in the slightest about a character they've known for a little over half an episode. Except for several side characters, character development is slow and we get a meager piece of it in the final episode. \\n\r\nCharacters come and go without warning and simply disappear with no explanation. Several of the characters have far more interesting backstories than the episodes give them time for. This is especially so with the villains. Antagonists go from being on the side of the hero to simply not with little explanation as well. \\n\r\nThere are so many loose ends at the end of this one. There is no fulfillment for the viewer and nothing is explained. There are major subplots that you never see come to fruition. Shiro's backstory is barely explained and her true nature is barely revealed at all. So much is left unresolved that it's frustrating and was honestly upsetting for me. because the investment I had in the series never paid off. \\n\r\nMuch is hinted at but it feels like it ends halfway through a season, not at the end of one. \\n\r\nSpeaking of that, there are no plans for a second season (at this time) so you'll have to read the manga (which this detracts from slightly) if you want to know what happens. \\n\\n\r\nAbout halfway through I would have recommended this anime but by the end all I can say is steer clear or read the manga.",

            "content": "So you've read the synopsis of this anime and kept thinking, is the anime really as interesting as the plot says it is. And I can say, with all my heart that it indeed is!\r\n A mysterious prison run as an amusement park, having inmates die for viewers enjoyment? Sounds like a fun ride. And it truly is. The story is very interesting, being explained with enough detail so that you know what you're following, but not too much so that you don't feel the mystery factor. During the whole watch, you will find yourself wondering what are the true intentions of this mysteriousprison really is. One weak side of this anime though is that it often rushes stuff, and you will often question a lot of stuff that needed answers really badly.\\n\\n\r\n But the story isn't the only thing that this anime excels at. One of the best things about this masterpiece is the characters. Each one is lovable and hateable in their own sense, I'm sure they will leave you in a rollercoaster of emotions. One bad thing about this anime, which sadly is all too common is the basic main character syndrome. If you've seen a shounen anime you know what I mean. Ganta is the typical Wah-i'm-useless-in-all-aspects-but-everyone-loves-me-because-of-my-dedication-strong-will-and-love-of-friendship MC, but if you manage to ignore it then you will find this anime really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n The art style is really detailed and pretty, even though there are gigantic amounts of blood almost every minute (though that is an important premise). All the characters look unique and interesting. The art style also looks like a mix of old 90's anime and new 10's anime, but that mix suits this anime pretty well.\\n\\n\r\n The sound is nothing special, but it's nothing bad either. One annoying thing is using the same battle music and \"sad moment\" music over and over again, it gets kinda boring. Other than that the voice acting is really solid in the Japanese version (i haven't seen the dub to judge), but they usually fall for the engrish cliche, and that happens often here.\\n\\n\r\n Other than the engrish cliche, there aren't many more. Of course, you will sometimes find the classic 'Don't look at my boobs you perv' cliche but that happens rarely, i think it happens only in about 2 or 3 episodes. Other than that there aren't other cliches.\\n\\n\r\n Overall this anime is really fun and interesting and I recommend you watch it, especially for the characters, except the main character.\\n",

What really made me like this anime was the gore not many anime's have the gore to the extent which this anime did I find it to be similar to Elfen Lied which I quite enjoyed, The concept of a prison carnival is quite original so it drew me into the plot very quick and the power to wield blood as weapons is pretty interesting to. I wish thatthey would continue on with the story because 12 episodes is not enough this should become a on going anime I could see this becoming the next great anime, if they made this anime as long as soul eater I would be happy. Overall this was a good anime for males and for females if you like the action and gore. I give it a 9 out of 10 for originality and creativity toward the story.",

Like ao no exorcist and kuroshitsuji for example.\r\nThe real major flaw is the ending. That's it\r\nStory 9\r\nThe story is quite good its not something you expect everyday a 14 yesr old and sentenced to death. For a few flaws that may contain spoilers. I cannot say. Some things you see coming, others not. Opening spoils a lot.\r\nArt 8 \r\nThe arts not the best but its not too bad. It csn give off heright vibe that the events should impact. But a few animator flips it can be some what off at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nI love the opening a lot its great and the. Ending is ok, the osts are abit random bt unique and compleely work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9\\n\r\nThe characers. Are about as you would susoect not too bad b nt exactly great.

As a result, the events of the beginning don't really deliver much impact.  Assuming what seems obvious, that this wasn't meant to be a major event so much as it was a necessary stepping stone into the actual story, I merely hoped that the show would come to deliver a little more.  As things went forward, continuously introducing new characters and giving them only minimaldepth, it never really did succeed.  I did still find myself becoming slightly entertained, however, as it drew a bit closer to the conclusion.  I can't really single out things that I liked about the show because nothing really grabbed me as particularly great.",

            "content": "Deadman wonderland is not the best anime that you are ever going to watch but that completely does not mean you should not watch it. this is my first review so try not to be too harsh\r\n Now lets get started, Deadman wonderland is a kind of anime that you will not see a lot. The story is very interesting and compelling. Throughout the whole thing you are rooting for the protagonist and you want him to succeed, even though the story ends kind of abruptly does not take enough from the experience for it to be a big deal, and there is always themanga that takes it further.   Story 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is some of the best art style i have seen in a while. The art is slick, flashy and very very nice to look at especially when there is and intense part of the story but in some parts it may look a little bland with all the jail scenery and the black colors like black and grey. Art 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in deadman wonderland is also top notch the sound effects of people being torn apart in the carnival corpse makes you cringe and ambient sounds throughout the world are very nice to listen to. And much like the art it suffers the same fate with the jail scenes and how it just becomes more bland and you feel like you have seen and heard this kinda stuff before. Sound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the only and biggest downfalls (although not a really big one) is the fact that the protagonist is not one of the bravest characters you will ever see, but the character that picks up the slack for the main protagonist is the other main character names Shiro. She is one of the most weird funny and enjoyable characters of this anime even though you may be disappointed at first with the main protagonist there is no need to worry because there are many different characters that have an interesting back story. Characters 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment was very very high while watching this anime all the episodes leave you with such feeling that you need to see what happens next in the story and it just has an addictive pull for you to want to watch the next episode and the one after that. Enjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime has its good things and its bad things one of the things that disappointed me the most about it though was its length i believe it could have been much longer and they could have put more material in it. the story and great and compelling except for its few hiccups here and there, the art is top notch besides the bland parts in the prison, sound is the same thing with the art, very good but gets held back a bit in the prison scenes, the characters are enjoyable and interesting besides when you first meet the main character, he comes off as quite a wimp at first but that quickly changes, it has a very addictive feel to it where you want to see what happens next, overall i loves this anime and i think you will to. It is great and i could not recommend it more highly. Overall 9/10",

There is also some good humor chucked in there every now and then and its the only anime i have seen with so much swearing and in my opinion it gave me a sort of unique feel to it but i'm sure there's others out there with equal quality's.\r\nI would suggest you watch this if you haven't all ready i really enjoyed it, if you like foul language and blood battles witha slight twisted atmosphere i think you would enjoy this anime as much as i did but the only down side with this is that it is only 12 episodes long and i feel that they rushed it  as the last half of the anime seamed rushed and missed things out.It should of been at least 30 episodes long to enplane some other conceps and edvents",

            "content": "I was hoping for a new Elfen Lied, but this was mostly a big disappointment. Basically just another shonen, but with the lights turned down. That in itself wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but all the good things about Deadland Wonderland are obscured by the many flaws. All in all, I don't regret watching it, but there are way better options out there for all the genres this series claims to be.\r\nRegarding gore and violence, there are a couple of strong scenes, but they are few and far between. Fans of Gantz and Elfen Lied will not be impressed.\r\nThe artstyle is great and frameby frame it looks really good. Problem is, the animation is stiffer than I'm comfortable with. The animators really just put in work where absolutely necessary. Thus, the character speaking will move and behave normally, while all around him freezes in place. Even wind blowing in the hair is obviously reserved for the one in focus. Bah. At least the fighting scenes and special effects got the love they deserved. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter design is fine for a shonen. Hair colours, wierd clothes and weaponry in abundance. \\n\\n\r\nThe intro song is pretty good, if you can get past the emo engrish lyrics. Ending song is well produced but didn't hook me. The background music is varied and unusually well done. No repetetive midi plinky-plonk to be heard. The japanese voice acting is average or slightly above.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, it's a mixed bag. Mixed with cliches, that is. The \"kid turns into super hero but struggles with his own insecurities\" and \"mysterious magic girl with a challenged intellect and hot body\" are staple commodities in anime and it takes something more special than this for me not getting bored of it. The grand plot is a bit compelling in all its wierdness, but a lot is left to the imagination. A good 2nd season would hopefully be able to bring this score up a notch or two.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the cast has a lot of potential, but not much of it is realised as the plot just  drags all of them with it with no time for anyone to really shine.",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland promises something big, and it nearly delivers it.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is fairly easy to follow: a 14-year old boy is framed for killing his class, and goes to a different prision, where the person who framed him is, and where he's forced to fight for survival and for revenge.\r\nStorytelling is done at a good rate, and you don't have any \"filler\" episodes. In each episode there's new pieces of information, new characters, new backstories. There are flashbacks as to why some characters wound up in DW, and they're neither a 1-sentence thing nor an episode-long sob story. It's the perfect balance between them,and it explains why each character was \"chosen\" to be there, and why their powers are the way they are.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is very clean and it fits the story. The blood is appealing and fairly animated and the characters' mouths are mostly in sync with the voices. Nothing bad to say about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound is very mainstream. It goes well with the animation, and doesn't bother you or anything, but it isn't outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nExcept if the Opening Song is included here. The Intro is amazing, both the song and the animation. You'll want to watch the intro in every episode, even if you're watching all 12 in a row.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe main character is kind of mainstream when you first \"meet\" him. Ganta is a 14-year old kid, who just had his life wrecked and has to struggle in a weird place. As you move further into the story, he's all about justice (I don't want to spoil it for you) and he'll do everything for his friends.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the main, I have to say, the characters are near-perfect. Everyone has a story to them. There's someone who betrays their \"friends\" constantly, but is only worried for their family. There's another who is a very childish person, with a freakishly gory backstory.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, very good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI'm doing these together because my overall opinion is my enjoyment of this anime.\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland has the potential to be a very good series, worthy of being in everyone's top 10. There's only one problem with it: there's only one season, and I doubt they'll be making more. Unfortunately, the anime wasn't successful in Japan, so they haven't gone through with a 2nd season. The story is cut short, and ends in a dramatic way. The main character doesn't reach his goal at the end, and there's an important character whose story didn't get to be told.\\n\\n\r\nThat's very saddening, but I still recommend you to watch Deadman Wonderland, because you have a finished manga to read after you see the anime. It gives you closure and it very enjoyable!",

It was a beautifully organized anime, but one thing I have to say:\r\nOnly watch the ending of you want your heart to sink to hell, be skinned alive, torn to shred slowly and painfully, and then burnt to an ashy crisp.\r\nThat is all I have to say about the ending. \r\nOther than that, the art was well done, I have to say. Unless you don't like unnecessary gore, that is. It is very thrilling and will make you jump out of your seat every time the episode ends. It has fluffy moments,but other than that, it'll give you lots of feels. Like, as much as a whole bus full of elephants, along with a whale bus driver, making you give them a piggy-back ride. It does have the clich\u00e9 main character, though, that is seeking revenge and such. His companion, Shiro, I'm sure you'll love sooner or later, and many creepy anime viewers were sure to have died of nosebleeds from Shiro during the series. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I assure you'll love the 12 action-packed episodes, and hoping to dear God that there will be a sequel for the series.",

The exploration of the prison, meeting the sexay warden, and seeing how the place operated seemed to indicate that we would be shown our hero trying to survive amidst the grinding wheels of gang violence and repression by the sadistic people controlling the place.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, we start to get plenty of time for the hero to cry and moan about being the hero, characters describing how they need to be more stereotypical or coming out of nowhere and then being told their important to the plot with little or no explanation.\\n\\n\r\nI had to force myself to go back and watch parts I skipped around episode eight.

Prisoners with unique special abilities (superpowers that use their blood as weapons) are pitted against each other in brutal fights for entertainment. The events that lead to the prisons creation are unraveled as the story goes on, and a faint glimmer of hope rears it's little head as Ganta must find a way to survive this living nightmare.\r\nThankfully Ganta hasone friend when he arrives, or is she really the friend she says she is? There is a lot of mystery in this story, and it's the mystery that drives the storyline. The artwork is well done, and it introduces some interesting characters along the way. Ganta is filled with grief and despair, but there's something about him that attracts a few of the other prisoners to him.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good adaptation of the manga series, which is currently ongoing (though on an extended break at this point in time). The anime ends just as the story is really starting to unravel.

            "content": "Okay, this anime was terrific. As I get more into the horror genre, I find more and more anime/shows I like. Deadman Wonderland is one of those shows. I loved every second of this show.\r\n-Story-\r\nBy reading the synopsis, you would have an idea of what's going on so there's no reason to restate it. Anyway, I was captivated from the first episode. There's so many questions with the story regarding Ganta and Shiro that I just had to keep watching. I think I watched this series in a week or so. But the story is FANTASTIC. I only wish that there was more to theanime. I'm going to read the manga sometime because I heard that it was completed and I really want to know what happens.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nThe whole atmosphere is so dark in this show (I love it!) which really adds to the effect. I'm not an artist or an art person in general so I don't know what else to say...\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nThe music was amazing, it was stuck in my head forever. I loved everything about the sound. It was dark and hopeful at the same time, which gave even more value to the series.\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\nI'm sure a lot of people hate Ganta, but I think he's pretty cool. He's a realistic character who can't for the life of him understand why he's in Deadman Wonderland. It's heartbreaking to see his struggle, and makes me cheer for him even more.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland is an extremely enjoyable anime, I'd recommend it for fans of horror, or anyone who wants to give it a try. No hesitation, watch it. I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nWatch Deadman Wonderland. I'd recommend it in a heartbeat. My only disappointing moment was when I found out there would be no more of the anime. I'm disappointed that there's no season two, but what can you do?\\n\\n\r\nGo. Watch it. Especially if you're considering it.",

            "content": "What a trainwreck.  Might as well start with the premise, which is the best thing Deadman Wonderland has going for it.  Ten years ago, a massive explosion/earthquake engulfed and destroyed Tokyo.  Ganta Igarashi, a survivor with no memories of the tragedy, has led a normal life until one terrible day a sinister being dressed in red kills everyone in his class and shoves a red stone into his chest.  Summarily convicted of slaughtering his classmates on the basis of a confession he doesn't remember giving (due process for the win), Ganta is sent to Deadman Wonderland, a maximum security, privately-owned prisonthat raises revenue by forcing its inmates to perform in lethal games for society's enjoyment.  As if this weren't twisted enough, Ganta soon begins to unravel Deadman Wonderland's dark secret. \\n\\n\r\nSounds pretty good, or so I thought.  And really, for the first half or so, the show has a nice pace, quite a few layers, lots of refreshing profanity, and enough gore to make it 2011's Elfen Lied.  In episode 1 the wonderfully dark and ruthless Chief Guard Makina asks the new inmates if they have any questions, to which one responds, \"How big are those titties?\" and she says \"G.\"  That pretty much sums up the mood of the show: over the top, profane, and often absurd.  This is by no means a bad thing if the story is good, but around episode 6 things start to fall apart. \\n\\n\r\nThis was the first time I thought, alright, they're trying too hard.  Overkill on the language, too fast-paced, and too many characters and new events.  Maybe it's just the 12 episode curse, but it's hard to do drama when you've barely finished building things up before you go in for the shocker climax.  And unfortunately, we see this time and time again in Deadman Wonderland, especially with the slew of characters that are thrown at us in the second half.  People start sacrificing themselves, or just acting insane.  The writers apparently realized this was an issue, but they chose the odd strategy of showing a character do something completely random, followed by a few minutes of their background to explain why that just happened.  About halfway through the show also decides to go from original thriller to typical Shounen, where the fights are 70% empty speeches about friendship and the value of life and 30% action.  No thanks.  I have to admit I sort of thought this might happen, because Ganta is one of the whiniest, annoying characters I've witnessed in a long time.  Part of this is due to his voice - do not watch this in English!  I'm sure I've heard Greg Ayres's voice before and thought it was fine, but he really should never be cast as a main character again.  Romi Park, on the other hand, is a pretty good fit for Ganta, but regretfully Ganta's insufferableness runs much deeper than his voice.  I get that he is a teenage boy who has been thrown into this absurd situation, but he never really grows up or stops pouting, despite repeated promises that he will.  At least Shiro, Ganta's quirky, unnaturally powerful albino friend who seems to know him from the past, adds a bit of comic relief and quite a bit of mystery, but she's not complex enough to carry the show on her own and doesn't start to develop until the final couple episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's obvious by the end that the writers were banking on the prospect of getting a second season: just get through these 12 episodes, and I promise we'll tell you a good story.  We'll tell you what actually happened ten years ago, why Deadman Wonderland really exists, why in the final episodes we've introduced this new guy who is insane and also the strongest of all the deadmen but gets literally no development, etc., etc.  I didn't even need to look it up to know this was based upon an incomplete manga, because it was so painfully apparent.  It was also really unfortunate, because like I said in the beginning, this story has a good premise.  Alright, I'm done whining.  Clearly I've been watching Ganta too much.  I'll finish with a couple other nice things about the show: the OP is not a half-bad song, even for someone who isn't a fan of hard rock, and its animation is promising.  The animation overall is also very good; I especially liked how expressive the characters' faces were, as it really brings out the pain and grief.  I guess that's it . . .  I'm sure Deadman Wonderland is a great experience for some people, and at only 12 episodes, it's not as if I'd argue against watching it.  Just realize that if you're looking for  plot and character development, you're in for a disappointment.",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland captured my interest when I noted a bunch of blood benders fighting, an interesting looking girl, and a boy falsely imprisoned. What came after this though is the reason I found Deadman Wonderland to be dreadful. This is clearly an objective opinion, but I hope you will read on so you can get a grasp of some reasons the show may not be for you.\r\nTo sum it up right from the start: This show is unfinished. This Anime was written to promote the Manga, and as such, left the majority of the major story to be consumed elsewhere. I learned about this afterwatching the show, as it ends abruptly, and many questions are left unanswered (especially regarding the wretched egg, and other charecter backgrounds). The best character for me, Shiro, is super underdeveloped, so much so that her connectivity to the MC and her backstory are briefly touched on at best. You want to know more, but simply are not. \\n\\n\r\nMany other characters get limited screen time, making them also feel irrelevant, which is sad because frankly, I felt the MC was one of the most lacking in the series. The MC has your typical shonen flaw, hes a seemingly untalented, whiny kid who finds himself far to weak to be relevant, until finally everything works out because he wanted SO BAD to be useful. in some cases this is ok, but in this show specifically, their focus on the MC and negative pressure for other characters made me greatly dislike him. \\n\\n\r\nSound and art work was fine, not overly impact or impressive. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I truly just disliked this show. As I watched each episode I hoped for solid development and progression, but felt this show did a prime job at doing the opposite. Fight scenes were fun, but the characters were either unnoticed, or dissatisfying, the story was unfinished, and the shows ending was quite a letdown. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love this show, by all means keep loving it, but if you haven't seen this show, I personally would strongly recommend you look elsewhere. If you want to be invested in a show, I don't believe this is the one!",

            "content": "Another one of those 1-cour anime that after seeing episode 1 I wasn't too captivated to the anime but after seeing episode 2 I just had to finish the rest in one long sitting. Deadman Wonderland (DW) is notable for two things, these being its soundtrack and its portrayal of gore. I've seen anime with plenty of blood and innards (i.e. Parasyte, Tokyo Ghoul) but that in DW is more... how do I put it? It's more gruesome. I reacted more viscerally. Death and dying runs wild in DW, which is entirely to be expected given the setting -- a prison created to entertain thepublic with macabre games involving the inmates. The soundtrack matched very well, I thought, and was good to listen to. I look forward to adding the OST to my fourth YouTube playlist, Resonant Thunder.\\n\\n\r\nDW is only 12 episodes long and let me tell you straight out, the story doesn't end after episode 12. I'm glad DW originated from manga because apparently the anime didn't reach even the halfway point in the manga plotline. Still, the way certain characters can fight is interesting and fun to watch, reminiscent of the fights in Parasyte. One character -- Crow -- is so cool, in my opinion at least, that he merits a spot on my favorite character list. The way mysteries are slowly unraveled is well done; that's always a necessary component of any good story. The animation as a whole was well-crafted, there weren't any VEEs, and the characters were well designed.\\n\\n\r\nObviously with only 12 episodes any character development would be weak. The protagonist does show some improvement, however, and his relationship with a certain character is touching.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed episodes 2-12 enough to watch them straight, staying up past my bedtime to the wee hours of the morning.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially if you're a fan of gore and blood and fighting, you'll enjoy Deadman Wonderland.",

If you liked Eureka Seven, you would probably like Deadman Wonderland too, just not as much. Both animes have a confused main character who have a mysterious girl by there side who give them hope in hard times. Also the guy who wrote the manga version of Eureka Seven, wrote the manga for Deadman Wonderland, so he probably bounced a few ideas from eureka Seven into Deadman Wonderland.The anime is quite gory, but the gore is neccesary for setting the tone of the environment the characters are in.\r\nPlot:Ganta the main character, has been framed for slaughtering all his classmates, when in reality it was a mysterious character called the redman.The redman spared Ganta, and gave him a power that lets him control his blood into a weapon form.Ganta gets put into a privately run prison where, there are normal culrpits and others like him. In order to survive in this prison you need candy ( otherwise you die by posion already given to you), which is obtained by winning battles and other gory things. The story progresses from here with Ganta meeting Shiro ( a mysterious girl) and his interactions with other prison inmates....\\n\r\nMusic: Music/OST is fantastic, especially track 5 DW28A, it really gets me pumped when its playing during the anime.\\n\r\nOverall this anime is quite good, it does have quite a few flaws, but despite those I really enjoyed it. Would I watch if a secound season were made? Definentely.",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland, it's not every day you come across a combination of complete opposite terms describing an idea, having the reader read Deadman and then to tone it down including Wonderland at the point of the tongue's resting. sneaky bastard those are. but as edgy the show tries very hard to be, the title of the series at least compliments that. This one of those shows that meets a lot of hate and criticism, some say it sucks, some call it a masterpiece, others hide behind the fact that the manga was better. But no matter how good or bad the source material is, theadaptation is an entirely different work that can have a lot of issues on its own, slow-pacing, event-skipping, filler and more.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\\n\r\nOn one of those lovely quite days, a major incident took place in Tokyo, a humongous explosion that ended up erasing great landscapes in an out-of-this-world manner. 10 years later, A private prison had already rested on the exact same location the explosion originated from, under the name of Wonderland that uses its prisoners as a source of entertainment for other people putting them in death battles, challenges, events. And keeping a spare of interesting residents are test subjects.\\n\r\nA naive middle school student, Ganta, gets framed for killing his entire classmates by some of the prison's officials and as consequence, he's sent to Wonderland to serve his sentence. Filled with hatred and Anger towards the Red Man that massacred his friends, he strives to get his revenge. If you're still wondering about the \u201cDeadman\u201d part in the title, that's a term used to refer to people that have a special power called \u201cThe Branch of Sin\u201d that allows the users to control their blood in a manner that enables them to fight, we're talking about bloody swords, tentacles, bullets...etc. Cool huh? Well, the idea and everything is there, but the execution was not what you'd call a great job. In a lot of other shows, slow pacing kills off a lot of the hype and story progression, but in this one, there was a pacing very fast that the story itself couldn't keep up in a steady way, and thus rendered most of the event blurry and dull. The action starts up very early on, but I'm really not the type of guy that gets impressed by flashy colors and butterflies, in this case, gore and violence. Yes, I do enjoy my gory anime, but only if it was done right and in concise doses, and I'll spare Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate from this because those had their reasons. As I mentioned before, this is like that edgy early teen boy that thinks he is cool and badass just because he can spit off slurs and throw in partial nudity and excessive gore every 3 minutes, no, that's not the way to do it. A lot of very important plot points got skipped and never were explained, and most of the flashback characters were never officially introduced or given a proper reason on how they disappeared.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\\n\r\nIf anything, they did not slack off animating blood, and thankfully they didn't, seeing how it plays a major role than just acting like a dumb liquid that needs every excuse to splash around (Why am I getting worked up over blood? lol). Something I like here was the character designs, I have to give some extra points just for that, no crazy hairstyles, no inhuman anatomy or anything from that caliber, but still, it had its own cartoonish taste, and fed perfectly their sadistic smiles with life and horror. And I'm dead serious, those were some really terrifying evil smiles that could alone immobilize you. The way the fights where animated made up for the horrible story progression in my eyes. I never knew I was into good liquid animation until I saw how fluid their blood flowed (literally). I'm queuing up some GIF of blood projectiles at the moment of writing this review just for how satisfying they felt when they hit the target.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\\n\r\nLet's talking about the opening and ending theme songs and get them out of the way. The opening is unforgettable, and seeing how it has English lyrics all the way till the end makes it a bit easy on the memory, sounding as savage as the show wants to pretend to be like, and as the first lyric says \u201cSlit the throat of reason and reality\u201d, that alone prepares you for what there is in store of madness to come.\\n\r\nUnlike the opening, the ending theme song was very light on the heart, both on the audio and the visuals, complimented by the characters in their past lives when everything was still okay. I can't say much about the soundtrack as I am all focusing on the blood animations, I could have sworn I canceled all other senses just to power up my sight and get the most out of those fluid animations. The voice acting was decent, talking about the SUB version here, I didn't enjoy the main character's high pitched voice that much, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (6.5/10):\\n\r\nI thought for the longest time that Yuki from Mirai Nikki is holding the title of the most annoying main character, but I guess that Ganta might steal that away from him, the guy literally is made to annoy the freaks out of you. Making immature wrong decisions all of the time, and never learns from his mistakes, acts always like he's the one in the right path and keeps mumbling some talk-no-jutsu black magic while being the most hypocrite figure on the show. And the list keeps on going filled with forgettable characters except for one cool guy called Crow, he sure got his ssslices (yes, that's how it's spelled) on point.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\\n\r\nI would be frank here, I had to pause the series midway for some in real life reasons, and I haven't resumed the watch until a month later, and to make it even harsh on the show, the first 6 episodes weren't all that exciting for me that I was going to give up on the series and give it a 5 or lower, but I feel like the last half had some improvements over the first one. It really took its time to introduced major characters, 4 episodes left to the end and tons of questions were still unanswered.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (7.1/10):\\n\r\nNot my proudest recommendation. Before watching it for myself, the title of the show always gave me shivers of badassery and excitement to see the actual anime, but it didn't turn up the way I imagined it to be, in fact, it wasn't even close. However, that doesn't make it entirely a bad show, I enjoyed what there was for me to enjoy. Do I want a sequel? absolutely, and as I've said, the general idea of the plot sounds very cool, and I'd like to see a better remake or a deserving sequel that makes up for this, a lot say the Manga is better, and that brings some hope.",

It is constantly explaining the mysteries while introducing even more mysteries. Just when you think you have everything figured out, it will switch it up. In other words, the show is not as predictable as you would think. I watched Deadman Wonderland shortly after watching Another, and while the storylines of the two anime are very different, there are a lot of similarities between the two.\r\nAs a final note, I feel must mention that the song during the closing credits of Deadman Wonderland fits perfectly. It isa beautiful calming song that helps bring you back from the intensity of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You enjoy violent, spectated, fights to the death, i.e. Hunger Games, The Running Man, etc.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: You are part of the younger audience or are turned off by blood and gore. They spare no violent expense in Deadman Wonderland.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: You will know by the end of episode one if this anime interests you.",

            "content": "Seeing as deadman wonderland has brilliant reviews and is so commonly favored by blue exorcist lovers, this anime had plenty of promise for me. Sadly I was very disappointed.\r\nStory 2/10 although the story idea was brilliant, it was played out terribly. For an anime with a battle royale element, their into as much fighting as you would expect. Their where loads of gaps which where never rounded off and most of the characters that appear to have a big part of the story are ether not even mentioned again or dont have as big of an influence as you would think. The story doesn't reallyamount to anything and you do not get a sense of satisfaction at the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10  1 of the only 2 things I liked about this series. Animation is fluid and consistent apart from at some occasional point but was very well done. ]I did not personally like the appearance of the main character partly because he reminds me of astro boy but that's a personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 the only other thing I loved about this anime, the intro song is just fabulous and the sound in general is  great, one off putter would be the English vocals for the main guy, his voice is really irritating.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10 despite their being some interesting characters in the series, they are bland and predictable. Character development? I don't think this even crossed the writers mind as their is little to no development. The characters at the end are more or less the characters you meet at the very beginning, just a tiny bit more bad ass.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10 idk, you just keep expecting something brilliant happen but what would have been the super exciting parts are played out in a very dull way. I did enjoy the battle scenes but they didn't even hit a 4 on my thrill-o-meter plus the pretty pathetic protagonist doesn't change so fight scenes get a little dull after 4 or 5 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10 despite my personal distaste for this series, it would be unjust to give it a 1 as as I said, the art was fabulous and their where some epic battle scenes but apart from that, I can safely say that this is the first series that has under 200 episodes that I got bored of half way through I would behave dropped it but as mentioned earlier, I kept thinking something brilliant was going to happen but it never came.",

            "content": "I have to say when I saw some AMVs and I read the synopsis I was sold. A prison run not by the government but by a organization. Where people have to fight or survive in order to pleasure the visitors. It reminded me so much of films like gladiator but then in a new setting. I loved the storyline. \r\nStory:\r\nWell the story starts really awesome, people getting murdered and the main character getting accused of these murders. After that he is sent to a prison. This prison is not our everyday prison, this prison is for the people who are sentenced to death. Thereare rules in this prison hard rules and those who do not obey them will get killed. These people know they are going to die one day, but they can live in luxury until they die if they play it right. These people can join the Karnaval and attend races in order to win tickets to buy food (witch they don't provide in this jail) and much more benefits. It is survival of the fittest.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem I had with this story is; that this boy who is wrongly accused wants to take revenge. A nice start for a story but the way he is prosecuted is totally left out. The things he gets accused of are so unrealistic that it makes me wonder why everyone believes that he did it. Well that apart the story starts to kick of when we see people dieing and trying to survive in this hard prison. Were gangsters rule and guards take abuse of people. \\n\\n\r\nThe story develops itself way better halfway the series, we get to see more blood and gore and more fan service. The story is pretty awesome. Although the big fights are lame, yes very lame we ought to see more and maybe this will happen if a season 2 comes out (witch I'm pretty sure of)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main character is a pain to watch, he is weak scared and not that clever he also looks a bit stupid (at least I did not like the way they drawn him). But that aside the main character did just enter a brutal prison so his reactions are most likely pretty normal. And I have to say that at some point he does grow balls and becomes a lot more relaxed than he was first.\\n\\n\r\nHis companion is a girl, and something here seems odd, we see this girl is strange yes. But in this jail there are no girls allowed. It is the male section. But no one ever wonders why there is a girl 24/7 next to the main character, not even the guards. Well that aside this character is mostly weird and well I did not like her very much. You also don't get that much information about her, but she is a nice twist to the story and probably very important in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are pretty awesome, but I cannot tell you anything about them since I will ruin your story experience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are decent in this anime, they are not memorable like Light or Lelouch were. But it is a decent short anime of 13 episodes with lots of blood and gore and lots of fan service if you like that. The anime is brutal (for example we see how they remove an eye) and it is something I never saw so that's nice. But the story isn't that strong it takes really long to get to the point they want to go. And then they stop with a huge cliffhanger witch could also provide as a real ending. But if it does then, well then they failed at ending the anime properly.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is amazing tough so if you don't want to watch the anime just check out the OST. But overall it wasn't that much of a good experience. It is a anime you want to see if you have seen all the good ones already. I heard that the manga continues and that it is much better. I hope they make a season 2 and I think that after that season I can adjust my opinion, this anime for now leaves to many gaps open.\\n\\n\r\nNote:\\n\r\n(This anime is censored on most anime sites so you won't see blood or fan service I had to see it without the blood and gore for most of the episodes. If you want to see it with blood and gore I advice you to buy the anime on DVD, since I cannot find a site were they show everything, and that sucks cause the blood and gore is mainly what the anime is about).\\n\\n\r\nCheers Lucid\\n",

            "content": "Now, like any other anime you heard before, this was based on the manga series by Jinsei Kataoka & Kazuma Kondou (he wrote and illustrated the Eureka Seven manga). People have said that this series has remind them of Elfen Lied with the same blood-and-gore factor added in but none of the existential creepiness you find after watching it (or reading it in case of the manga of that). I didn\u2019t go in with high or low expectations. I just want to see if this series is turning out to be something to remember or to just past the time while you\u2019re falling asleep.\r\nA massiveearthquake ravaged Japan's mainland and destroyed most of Tokyo, sinking three-quarters of the city into the ocean. Ten years later, the story shifts to Ganta Igarashi, a seemingly ordinary student attending Nagano Prefecture's middle school. As an escapee, a survivor of the great earthquake, Ganta has no memories of the tragedy and has lived a normal life and that all changes when a strange person covered in blood and crimson armor floats through his classroom windows. Grinning madly, the Red Man massacres Ganta's entire class but instead of killing him, embeds a red crystal shard in Ganta's chest. Within days of the massacre, Ganta is declared the sole suspect. Following a quick trial, Ganta is sentenced to death and is incarcerated in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme park like prison.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, now the main character Ganta Igarashi is portrayed rightly as a character who knows he\u2019s been wronged for what happened that day and like any teenager, he\u2019ll be scared shitless of what\u2019s coming to him as he goes into Deadman Wonderland (Speaking of that, is it me or does that sound like a rock band to you?) from the stuff he heard from his friends. Now, in the character development department, once Ganta enters the prison as a scared boy, as of now, he is still a scared boy. He does tried to defend himself against the prisoners but I don\u2019t know if got anything to do with his whining, cracking voice or the fact you would be scared, too, if you see what he has seen in there.\\n\r\nShiro, or as I call her, my favorite character of the show. She is a mysterious albino girl who has the resemblance of one of Ganta\u2019s deceased friends, who I assume he had a crush on before any of that happen.  She also possesses inhuman physical abilities and has an intimate knowledge of the prisonWhile the other prisoners are threatening, blood-thirsty, and/or murderous, Shiro\u2019s mannerism is very playful like a child but she doesn\u2019t go overly annoying about it. Matter of fact, if anything, it makes the show calmer than what it is now but the show is still tense on its subject.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters include Y\u014d Takami, an ally of Ganta during his stay and his story was that he became a prisoner of buying his sister\u2019s freedom with the Cast Points he received while playing these games of life and death, and speaking of his sister, Minatsuki Takami, also known as, Hummingbird, she may seem like the innocent, scared girl but when she show her true colors, damn, she can fight like hell out there and curse like a f***ing sailor while she\u2019s at it. Oh yeah, one more thing, when hearing this version of TV, expect a lot of bleeps to happen on this show (think about that, people who wanted PSG on Toonami/Adult Swim).\\n\\n\r\nHalfway into the series, there is a rebellion group Scar Chain who\u2019s determined to escape the prison and expose the illegal actions of the prison with themselves having their own struggles to deal with the prison, especially the leader of the group, Nagi.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by Manglobe, or as the previews quote, \u201cFrom the studio that brought you Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy\u201d, and the quality is shown to be not quite a visual feat but there was a great effort of amount thrown in, although the blood does like less bloody and more like fruit punch but that\u2019s not a deal breaker, just a minor tidbit of the style. The opening music sequence used in the Toonami version was nothing more than a quick tease, only showing 20 seconds of the theme song. Why does Bleach airing in its umpteenth season has a full opening but Deadman doesn\u2019t? The full opening theme sequence can be found on YouTube and that and the opening song \"One Reason\" by DWB feat. Fade completely fits the tone of the series and wow, it is glorious to listen in your ears but I can\u2019t say the same thing to the ending song \"Shiny Shiny\" by Nirgilis. It\u2019s a very calm and upbeat J-Pop song but hearing that after watching an episode feels like an emotion whiplash and for the voice acting for the English dub\u2026..\\n\\n\r\nGreg Ayres as Ganta = mostly whiny but fits the character; Monica Rial = very decent as Shiro, one of the reasons why I like her in anime roles; Aaron Dismuke = last time I heard him was in Cat Planet Cuties, this is an upgrade from that; Jamie Marchi = somewhat okay but passable; Eric Vale = he tried.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: While it\u2019s not a great series, I managed to enjoy the series regardless of that. Some of the characters are not very relatable but there is a good amount of character development even if it does go by fast with what little episode order they gotten. I personally would rate this over Elfen Lied in the psychological horror department of anime.",

He was framed for \r\nthis horrific slaughter and sentenced to death in the most messed up prison ever built called deadman wonderland and you would think death is the worst part it is not. This place is based on life or death you win a challenge or a battle and you get to live the catch is you can pass on one of these\r\nevents but you need to collect points to get candy. Candy is the item that givesthem more time once your clock hits 0 your head will explode. So\\n\r\nthey are pretty much forced into fighting each other to the death. Later through this series Ganta figures out he has these powers from the red man \\n\r\ncalled the branch of sin. These people with the branch of sin brawl it out head to head to see who lives and who dies. While Gonta is locked up in this\\n\r\nprison he meets this girl named Shiro who winds up to be a old childhood friend throughout this series they both fight for survival and even make an \\n\r\nattempt to escape the prison. I enjoyed this series I felt it hard to get into at first pretty hard the first couple of episode didn't really interest\\n\r\nme but once it picked up I was hooked. Its so hard for me to give it more than an 8 just because of how I felt about the start. But if you can get over\\n\r\nthat you would love this series it has a interesting art style that I did enjoy, the story line was pretty good solid in my opinion, the characters \\n\r\nhad very good back story to them all together I think besides the start it was a very nicely constructed series.",

The story, art, sound and character immersed me right away and I think I've binge watched it multiple times with different friends. \r\nThe sad part is that the anime falls short compared to the manga. There is so much more to this story than what they \"stuffed\" into the given 12 episodes, which they in the last episode just ended without really agood explanation. And as it still stands I don't know if there will be a 2nd season, and if it will be I am not sure how the anime will do it? I just feel like they left out some really important moments from the manga to really make the anime up to par with its manga. Which is a shame really. With that said I still can't with a happy heart give the story less than an 8, for the anime alone it probably would be a lower score, but my heart can't deny the potential it had, and that the manga have so. \\n\\n\r\nThis is still one of my favs, but if you really want to know what this anime is good for please go pick up the manga. The art almost identical and really amazing! \\n\\n",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland is a dark and shocking anime. It is gory and unsympathetic to it's characters. Usually.\r\nThe first couple of episodes are very well done. These episodes got me hooked on the series and I immediately started to read the manga after viewing them. I am up-to-date on the manga, and because of this, I am more disappointed in the series finale than I would be if I hadn't read much of the manga. So many loose ends were not tied up at the end, though it would be impossible to tie them as this series is only 12 episodes long. The part that manyviewers were hoping to see was not included in the anime. Perhaps there will be a second season, though.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, on with the flaws. Many people will say that the characters were the biggest flaw. I'm not sure about this. The characters were pretty one-dimensional, yes, but the anime wasn't focused on them. This anime focused on the story. The very twisted story. So yes, the characters were weak but I don't think that they break the series. Then again, you are either going to love or hate the main character, Ganta. He is a wuss. Though, he is easy to sympathize with, as he is a kid thrust into a horrendous world. His constant whining is annoying, though, and he does not develop very much through the anime. Hopefully, he wont grind your gears too much. I really enjoyed most of the other characters. They were stereotypical, yes, but they all had their dark secrets that made them a bit deeper and more twisted. Shiro, the main female character, is definitely the most interesting. Sadly, though, she doesn't really get to shine in the anime, as the series is so short.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some absurd moments in this anime. Then again, many anime are outrageous. Just don't be expecting every detail to make sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing for me, there is no sense of change in this story. Everything remains bleak. There are a few warm-hearted moments, but they are shattered quickly with more blood-splattering. This is enjoyable, in a twisted way, for many of us viewers, but it just gets predictable after so many times. If the series were longer, perhaps we could have seen some real progress.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the positives!\\n\\n\r\nThis series is all about shock-factor. Is this actually a good thing? Well, it depends on the person. I loved watching every twisted moment in this series, and there are a lot of them. Even though it does get predictable, the producers pull off every gasp-inducing moment pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is actually pretty cool. It is perfect for all the madness that goes on. I realize that I'm making this anime sound absolutely horrific. Depending on who you are, it can be. But it does have some heart if you look hard enough, and it isn't nightmare-inducing. I suppose it is really just shock-factor.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art. The animation is smooth and the character-designs go perfectly with their stereotypes. Some very nice visual effects are used in many of the scenes, so that is nice.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the sound of Deadman Wonderland. Every voice was perfect for each character. Ganta's voice actor was especially great and is probably the saving grace for this character. Seriously, I think that Romi Paku was perfect for the role. The music used through-out the series wasn't overbearing and it usually worked. The themes are forgettable, though. The opening music, One Reason, is very pleasing to the ears. The lyrics are all in clearly-spoken English, and the song is really just perfect for the series. Even if you do not like the series, I can almost guarantee that you'll love the opening.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series, but it is very lacking. The plotholes, the one-dimensional characters, the predictability... They are all very annoying. But I do recommend this series to anyone who is looking for a short little horror-story.",

The manga is a mos def 10/10 and I don't doubt for a second that if this anime continued it would be a 10/10... But sadly it didn't\r\nThe show is beautiful, it's got a great color scheme that looks great with the action, well when you can see it. A major problem I had with my funimation blu Ray was its censorship. The story was good, but the problem was it STOPPED right before it became great. The main character was whiny but showed potential to grow, andthe background characters, from what I could see, were interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I love this series, but that's mainly because I read the manga, so I know what happened in the future, and though I love this anime, it's truly saddening when I know what could have come 7/10",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland a interesting title for what I thought was a rather mediocre anime. While the anime doesn't have any flaws that destroy it, it leave you rather perplexed. Wondering if thats really the end.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nWhere have we seen this before a weak character experiences a traumatic event and gains special powers. Nothing new to see here. Although these powers are moderately interesting I feel that they were not properly demonstrated in the anime. Another gripe I have with this anime is the fact that the story goes nowhere. I am left asking for more.\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nThe art here is nothing special but it is stillgood. The characters are animated well and the fight scenes look nice. No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are unfortunate enough to have watched the english dub you will be stuck with the annoying voice of Greg Ayers for the lead character Ganta. While the dubbing is good I simply find his voice insufferable and hate listening to it. This doesn't mean he was a bad choice for Ganta it just means I personally don't like it. The rest of the cast is dubbed fine though and their voices are good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters in this show have little to no explanations behind them they are just seemingly added in then a generic sad backstory is given so you pity them. No characters really stand out and the only one I was able to remember besides Ganta and Shiro is Crow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy watching this at all. From the annoying dub to the shitty story. The bland characters and the sparse battles I was left wondering where did they go wrong. I was also left confused and had to resort to going on to the Deadman Wonderland Wiki to understand this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show was ok at best and was not worth my time. If you are truly interested watched but be warned it will be a long 12 episodes. If you are interested in the concept I would recommend the manga at least then everything is properly explained and there is a true ending not the bullshit we were given here.\\n",

Its unique and terrifying.It has something other stories lack and thats uniqueness.The thought of a middle school student framed for the murder of his best friends,and being sent to a prison filled with psycho  paths,and having to fight to the death,is so surprising,so warm and yet so chilling.The only thing that pissed me the hell off was the fact that the anime got cut short.It had a unfinished feel to it,do to low view stats.the manga still is a 10out of 10,because its still running.But for the anime i cant say the same. Its a 9 of 10 at best,because there was so much unexplained.The anime left out so much good materiel,and it was a shame because it had awesome art and good english dub voice actors.Over all i was left with a emptiness in  my heart after watching the anime.It had such good side character but did jack shit with them.In the manga it has the full ending,more back story on the supporting character and over all better.I would personally recommend the manga over the anime.\\n\\n\r\n  do you agree with me?  did you think the ending to the anime was shit?  \\n\r\n    if you dis agree send a message to me and tell me why.  :D\\n\r\n               thanks for reading have a awesome day.",

Unfortunately it got about half the episodes it needed, making it little more than a 12-episode trailer for the manga.\r\nThe story deals with some very interesting themes and has many surprising twists that keep you asking questions. However, the ending cuts off about half of the ongoing plot threads, leaving many questions unanswered. They even start new arcs in the second-to-last episode that never get resolved. There was honestly huge opportunity for an epic ending that would put FMA to shame here, but it was pissed away.\r\nThe animation and art is high-quality, themusic and voice acting are also top-notch thanks to the incredible folks at Manglobe.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are varied and interesting, but never get enough screen-time or development because of the rushed nature of the show. You have badass incarnate who's afraid of girls, a psycho monk who's trying to free people from the material world of suffering, and a sweet-loving albino girl in a bodysuit who hides a dark secret.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a fast-paced action anime to pass the time, this is a solid choice, but it doesn't stand on its own as an anime, so you'll be forced to read the manga when it's over.",

            "content": "Before I start off with this review, I will start by saying that I've read the manga of Deadman Wonderland and loved it. When I heard that there was an anime series for it, I got excited, but I was a bit disappointed.\r\nDeadman Wonderland is a 1-cour series, meaning it only had 13-16 episodes. The manga itself has around 56 chapters, which could equal around to about a 2-cour series, 24 episodes or longer. But, I understand, that at the time when Deadman Wonderland was airing, that all chapters weren't released. That's fine.  But to this date, we still haven't got a second season.Trolls?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is actually pretty good. Igarashi Ganta is framed for murdering all of his classmates in a tragic accident, when in reality, it was some Red Man that murdered all of his classmates. I mean, we even saw him dragging someones head across the floor. Is that murder? Nah. Seems fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe Red Man struck some weird shit into Ganta. It was some red thing, but to me I call that the \"Red Deadman Converter Thingy\", The Red Man struck that into Ganta and shit went down after that.\\n\\n\r\nGanta faced court the day after, or month, I don't know and he was found to be guilty. So, he went to a prison called Deadman Wonderland which is a prison filled with Deadmen, which are people with the power to wield weapons using their blood. Cheating, yes I know.\\n\\n\r\nHe meets a lot of prisoners there (what? really? not like its a prison.) and becomes friends with like 3 of them, the others are dicks.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay. It sticks to the art style of the manga, so I really do not mind it at all. I think it sticks to the art style of the manga, I cannot remember. They both look similar, so who cares.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening of the anime is good, and some background music tracks are good. Everything else... eh...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's not enough character development in this series, except maybe just Ganta's development. None of the other characters really developed that well, considering how well they were handled in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was a huge disappointment after reading the manga, which I loved. I know I shouldn't compare the two (Manga and Anime) but I do. Should I compare? Yes, I actually think I should.  Adaptions to Manga are generally not that good but anything in my list that is above a 6 is good. So, Deadman Wonderland is not that great of an adaption.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga of Deadman Wonderland is much better. If you'd like the ending not to be a trolly piece of shit, then read the manga. The manga is a great series and is one of my favorites til' this day. These have been my opinions and I have no idea if I've convinced anyone to watch/read it. If I have, congratulations. You should really read the manga. It's a great series.",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland has an interesting premise. A young boy Ganta get sent down for a crime he didn\u2019t commit and ends up in a jail where nothing is normal. It\u2019s certainly not original but Deadman Wonderland sets it stall out early on with graphic violence and strong language in abundance.  Deadman Wonderland is essentially a theme park with inmates taking park in various games to entertain the public. \r\nGanta is a normal school boy but one day his whole class are brutally murdered by the mysterious \u2018redman\u2019. One thing you realise from the start is how deeply flawed this show is right from thestart. Ganta get sent down just because he was the sole survivor with virtually no other evidence. This greatly hinders the story going forward as to be honest it\u2019s pretty ridiculous.\\n\r\nGanta himself reminds me a lot of Renton from Eureka 7. He\u2019s a snivelling crybaby with few redeeming features. He learns soon that it\u2019s everyman for himself and he can\u2019t trust anyone. He later meets a fellow inmate Shiro a mysterious white hair girl with incredible strength who has a soft spot for him. Shiro is by far the most interesting character in Deadman Wonderland . She is the only person who seems to care about Ganta. \\n\r\nOne thing you soon realise is that characters are introduced and killed off with no real development but given this is only a short series it is understandable. As the series progresses Ganta learns he has a special power that allows him to manipulate his blood into a deadly weapon.  This is called a tree of sin, and we soon learn that there are other inmates who posses this power and they are soon pitted against each other in fights to the death.\\n\r\nAction scenes such as fights are handled well but they seem to have set out to make this as gruesome as possible and at times it feels a little exploitive.  I have no issue with violence or strong language but there needs to be a point to it in Deadman Wonderland this isn\u2019t always the case. In terms of animation the show is quite stylised and has some interesting character designs. It flows smoothly and has pretty high production values.\\n\r\nCharacters are mostly a dislikeable lot, and most are killed off pretty quickly. Ganta does show signs on manning up towards the end of the series and there are hints of what Shiro really is.  Once again the show is hampered by its short run as we only see character development right at the end.\\n\r\nSound is pretty decent on the whole and the show has a solid English dub. The title track is pretty horrific J Rock nonsense and I found the closing track much better.\\n\r\nDeadman wonderland is quite enjoyable in places and throw up some interesting questions that are never really answered. The show has a very open ending and you don\u2019t really feel much has been achieved other than a high body count. Deadman wonderland will probably not get a second series and you can\u2019t help but feel the show would have benefitted from a longer run.  It\u2019s certainly could and probably should have been better. As an action series it definably worth a look just don\u2019t expect anything deep and meaningful .\\n",

            "content": "The anime begins with the most forced motivation I have ever seen in an anime. Nothing about the first episode makes any sense. No court in the free world would sentence a child that harshly regardless of his crime. Above that, the evidence didn't add up in the slightest. The faked confession didn't even play part in the trial, this was released after the sentence. And in what world does a \"bomb\" cause cut wounds anyway.\r\nBut lets say the trial never happened. Lets just say everything went like it should or that it was actually properly explained.\r\nThe deadman wonderland attraction park is a farce. Themodern world wouldn't stand for it. There is a clear distinction between seeing special effects and somebody getting impaled on spears. There would be investigation upon investigation on such an show. Not to mention SEVERE censorship.\\n\\n\r\nNow once again, lets say somehow the world accepted this \"running man\" kind of entertainment. The anime still wouldn't make sense. \\n\\n\r\nHow does a high school student make it through such a gauntlet without being the first to die? From what we see he isn't exactly the brightest, nor is he the captain of the track club.\\n\r\nThe way he summons his \"powers\" is a completely idiotic way of doing things. It would cause severe injury and permanent scaring. The physical pain alone would be a serious issue. There would have been better ways of doing this part.\\n\r\nThe main villain is never touched on in the first season. The entire first series can be shrugged off as simply \"setting the mood\".\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime lack any form of common sense, instead of going around the problem they go right through it. And not very well either.\\n\r\nGiving a character back story right before they die. This doesn't make me care about them, its just another excuse to make the audience \"feel bad\" for whoever dies. Its a major flaw a lot of anime share.\\n\\n\r\nThere is so much more that could be pulled into question, i however don't feel the need to put myself through that anime again. These are the things I pulled from the top of my head.\\n\r\nI'm sure there is a lot more to moan about but i'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nI gotta say, i liked the battle near the end. It wasn't anything special, but compared to the bullshit you sit through in the rest of the show it was quite good. The anime itself simply isn't enjoyable. There is no payoff and there is nothing calling me back for the second series. Any anime with more than a single season should at least have a worthy cliffhanger in between.\\n\\n\r\nIts a battle-royal/kill-count anime with a horrible story and a cheap execution going for nothing more than shock value. And it even fails to deliver on the shock value. Censoring the gore beats the point of there being any. There are things that are just better off left implied.",

            "content": "I'll be genuinely honest when I say, I have been a hyped up fan of this series until I actually finished it, and frankly, I think that it has some points which require working but overall as an anime - and something which I find myself putting in the Shonen category because of its main character (referred from this point onwards by its Deadman Wonderland alias, Woodpecker).\r\nSound\r\nI won't like, I love the theme song of Deadman Wonderland - its fluid, it captures the insanity and horrendous brutality of the landscape which the anime tries to establish (and does to a significant extent maintain) holds ontoas it progresses in its 12 episode run. Actually, this anime has - in my opinion - a really good soundtrack overall. My personal favourite sounds though, were the theme song and the Corpse Carnival (or Carnival Corpse, as it would be announced in the subbed version) song (which incidentally reminded me of Cannibal Corpse - a nod to it perhaps).\\n\\n\r\nAs for story and art and characters, I'll only say that they were involving in the 12 episode run. They could be better, because it being Shonen it is understandable that Woodpecker is the weak link in this anime and only in the 11th and 12th episode does his potential start showing (to marvelous effect, in my opinion). Wretched Egg is an interesting character who they held back on for a future second season which (alas) will never happen. So far as the place itself is concerned, the art style captures the... brutal, gorish, sickening perspective that was the aim and intention of this anime. It has a few faults here and there though (episode 4 for instance, has a scene in which Woodpecker's face injury was omitted even though the remaining scenes maintain it again), but so far as the use of \"horror closeups\", and character development is concerned, it captured the mood. There are moments when it tends to have a witty angle, although I think that these moments were unnecessary as a result of which they distracted me from a good anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nCredit where credit is due, I actually enjoyed this 12 episode anime for its unsettling atmosphere - but I'd watch it only as a fan whose psyched by the theme song and the Carnival Corpse events. Its mostly for fans who'd hold onto it if they like it - but not all would find it appreciable if they have seen say... Hyakumonogatari/Requiem from the Darkness, or Cat Soup or Shigurui. Certainly not a timeless classic, but a good anime nevertheless.",

However, this potential is grabbed and trown into a sandpit of horribly lame characters that we've seen in a myriad of other animees already. \r\nHowever what really destroys it is it's lack of explaining the backstory to the incident that started the whole thing. It's leaving the main plot of the story unresolved.\r\nThe protaganist is an appaling character that is of course weak, but always stands up even when he should be dead - the same character you'll find in all mediocre animees. \r\nThe show boasts a bare amount of 12 episodes, andit's really not enough - it's rushed through and leaves a lot of characters unresolved and gone. You never even get the time to create attachment to the characters before they are best friends and would die for each other. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is something you shouldn't watch. leave it be, I've only found frustration here.",

There should have been a second season, but it would have been hard to do given the ending. \r\nI have read about the manga and the story behind it after the show, had it stayed true to that, had they animated all the arks, then this could have been an awesome anime, instead you have characters not explored properly, not even the main character Shiro. \r\nShiro's personality and mental condition are not explored, barely mentioned. Shiro could have been upthere with Lucy, Gasai Yuno, instead she remains a toddler hooked on candy throughout the series. It's a realy pitty Kana Kanazawa voices this one, talent wasted.\\n\\n\r\nThe realism is quite bad in this series, the gore seems to be there just for people that want to see blood, beating, hacking, putting holes through people, loosing blood, doesn't stop them because they need to rise back for a few seconds.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think this should be watched if you are interested in a coherent story that explains or even teases a bit the begging of the manga. Save the time and watch the manga instead. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a 12 episode trailer for the manga and some animated blood then this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nI don't agree with you who want a second season. This does not require a second season, it requires a reboot!",

            "content": "While Deadman Wonderland certainly left much to be desired, I definitely didn't hate it. I'm going to make this as cognitive as possible, but seeing as how the show lineage itself was a bit hectic, we'll see how this goes. \r\nMy biggest problem with the show was exactly that, lack of information. It felt like it missed some episodes somewhere in the middle or something. Events just sort of happened, and they weren't explained until much later if at all. I'm all for ambiguous stories, but this was just hard to follow altogether. The main plot holes being this:\r\nWhat is the history of Ganta andShiro being together as little kids, and why did Ganta not remember it at first?\\n\r\nI'm assuming Shiro had split personality or something, right? For that one moment she wasn't Shiro, but that's the only thing we ever saw of it and it was never explained. Or how Shiro ended up in Deadman Wonderland far before Ganta. \\n\r\nAlso, not near enough was explained about the expolsion that orignaly caused the blood-power disease thing. We were handed a LOT of events, but not enough information to make it coherent. \\n\r\nBUT, I give a strong E for Effort. There was definitely a lot of really incredible and unique things about this show too.\\n\r\nOf course, my favorite thing is Shiro. She is your typical cutesy character on the surface maybe, but she has a very complex story (one that audiences really have to configure on their own granted) but her unusually sweet atmosphere along with her unique attire, Shiro is easily the most interesting thing in this show. She is a sweet, fun loving girl who loves sweets, but she can also be insanely strong and kill pretty much anyone. Which, I can always get behind a strong female lead who DOESN'T depend solely on the guy she loves. It's really vice versa in this case. Ganta is kind of a sniveling little weasel for 90% of the show, but that's his arc, right? He is driven solely on revenge of his friends who were murdered in the very beginning, but at some point he reaches the arc of realizing he can't live solely off of hatred for the red man, but we never saw when that change exactly happened? And by the end, he stopped talking about the red man altogether. Except for that ending, which I actually kind of loved. Like I said, I like ambiguous things. Leaves room for interpretation. Can Ganta still love Shiro after that discovery? Who knows?\\n\r\nThe music in this show is PHENOMENAL. I felt the heavy rock intro and OST parts were really fitting and exciting, but really all the music succeeded in adding suspense and excitement. \\n\r\nThe animation style was also exquisite. Especially the design of the characters, obviously. \\n\r\nI see a lot of complaints online about 2 things with this show though, one of which I don't agree at all with, the other only half way. \\n\r\nThe first one is that there is a debate that this show has \"too much\" gore and cursing and is there solely for the sake of being shocking and over the top. I think it is a little over the top yes, but I think it is that way intentionally. Though the show is chaotic from start to finish, some of the themes in it are very blatantly obvious. An amusement park where people watch criminals compete in competitions and kill each-other is obviously something that would never happen in real life, right? I think so because I still have enough faith in humanity. But humanity is also really sick and a lot of us enjoy watching things equally as sick, just in our heads, it's all make believe. We watch horror movies and read scary stories because we know it isn't real. But why do we enjoy it? Doesn't it make us just a little bit whach to get such enjoyment out of others misery? Fictional or not? Deadman Wonderland is the same thing, and while we know the theme park is real, the customers there do not. It's like it's punishing us for liking something so sick and twisted. This show is taking a mirror and shouting at us \"look at how messed up you are!\" And while it isn't exactly a pretty and positive one, I think it IS effective. So yes, I do think the cursing and violence was VERY necessary indeed. \\n\r\nThe last thing I see a lot is complaints about there being too many characters. I think I disagree with this too for the most part. I think the characters we had were a good number, I just wish we had seen more of some. My biggest example is Ganta's two friends at the beginning who died. This is the thing that drives Ganta through it all, yet we as an audience know basically nothing about them. Obviously they were innocent kids, and their death is sad and all but... because we knew nothing about them, it didn't affect us as deeply, therefore we didn't connect with Ganta as deeply as we could have. I do also wish we could have seen more of Minatsuki (Yo's sister) simply because she was quirky, and because she had a very complex story which we never really learned much about (goes back to that lack of information thing I was talking about). But she was an interesting character, who obviously had some evil IN her (like all of the other prisoners) but wasn't all bad. Her and Senji.... Senji was cool. I wish we could have seen more of him too, simply because he was probably one of the most likeable characters, aside from Shiro. (But the OVA does give us a good background on Senji, which is nice). \\n\r\nBut all in all, this anime is very ambitious and does sell itself a little bit short, but... I think there is something there. I've heard the manga is significantly better so maybe I'll give that a shot. But if you're interested in watching a show that is unique and beautifully animated, check this one out. It's a lot to decipher, but I think it's still pretty solid.",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland a Story of Ganta a boy who is at High School when suddenly his life is turned up side down when he becomes a victim in a deadly school attack. Him being the only survivor he is pointed as the so called \"Attacker\" which then he is put Japan's only Theme Park Prison named \"Deadman Wonderland\" where prisoners are forced to serve as the attractions, little did he know there is only one way to survive.\r\n'Welcome to Deadman Wonderland' \r\nI had very high hopes for this Anime, I could not wait to watch it with having excitement and good exceptions of knowing thebase plot and thinking how it could thicken but oh dear was I wrong. I want to firstly say this Anime is not bad, but it has such weak areas which I will address that leads me to say overall I cannot recommend this Anime (but hear me out). I will firstly cover the Story:\\n\\n\r\n(STORY of Deadman Wonderland): Score of 6 - As Previously said this Anime revolves around a 14 year old boy who was caught in a Deadly attack leading him to be put in this Theme Park of Horror, Blood and Insanity but he does not know that in till he finally spends time in this place of hell. The Story as a whole starts of Solid, there is a lot of think about and it soon comes to the person watching what Ganta has to do and achieve to survive this place. The problem I had with the story is they lacked proper story telling within the anime and had intense moments which as a whole kept the anime rolling along. With the Anime steam rolling through the people watching may become a bit lost and unsettled due to the fact is has got through so quickly without the originality it needs. This all does change getting later into the Anime where it revels more about the Characters, The Theme Park and how and what Ganta has to do to Achieve his 'Goals'. As you get further it does get better, it has a slow start but has some interesting things that will catch your eye and make you want to watch more. It also does reveal very important aspects of the Anime early on which again makes you more drawn to the story but with these secret they keep it very solid and having different intentions with different characters which I like. Lastly I would like to Mention this Anime is only a fraction of the Manga please take into consideration that the Characters as I say below have not been fully developed yet and have not received there full screen time (there is a very good example of this for a character near the end).\\n\\n\r\n(CHARACTERS of Deadman Wonderland): Score of 6 - The point I would like to make before mentioning anything is that problem this anime had is that there were only 12 episodes, personally I don't think that was enough time to fully introduce everyone. This Anime however has some solid characters but it has your main protagonist 'Ganta' who is your everyday pathetic, waste of space who is a really good kid who just happened to be put in this Harsh and Brutal environment. Alongside Ganta you have another character called 'Shiro' whom personally I did like alot. She plays the role of a mysterious prisoner who gives that relief and protection to Ganta but also has a very  unique side to her character which is why she is interesting. She makes the anime alot more lightful in the sense she isn't this dark bloodly person like most of the inmates meaning she gets along well with Ganta. Along side these characters are others who have there own backstories told through own ways giving that extra brutal-ness to the Anime as a whole. Before I sum up this paragraph I want to mention one last character whom's name is known as 'Owl'. He is a well developed character and makes you get heavily invested into some parts of the Anime; what makes him so special is strict and sorta reliving personality but also being very strong as a character which like any Anime always makes you love them even more(but he's strong in a good way having his awesome unique ways to defeat enemies). To sum up the characters, some are well developed and overall the characters are good some better than others and some really interesting however they lack being well developed and generally the way some of the characters are made really puts you off them some are really hit and miss in Deadman Wonderland. Now lets move onto the Enjoyment of this Anime:\\n\\n\r\n(ENJOYMENT of Deadman Wonderland): Score of 6 - Deadman Wonderland for the enjoyment aspect is good, it has some very entertaining parts and some very brutal and bloody parts which you may or may not enjoy. You will enjoy this anime more however if you are interested in blood and gore. There are parts of the Anime where fights do occur and really get you gripped within that fight making you enjoy the characters more and the story. I cannot really say more that there are some very good parts of the characters being shown in the anime where I enjoyed the anime the most but it lacks overall in great enjoyment in my own opinion it would be better to say I was more interested to see what happened with a single character than the whole story because of how much I enjoyed the character progress. \\n\\n\r\n(ART & ANIMATION of Deadman Wonderland): Score of 7 - This is one part of my review and I can say quite highly of. Before I set off on saying anything I would like to mention how the Animation goes really well with getting that dark and horrible theme to the viewer making it much more enjoyable to watch at certain points. Overall the Art and Animation is not bad, the production team behind this known as 'Manglobe' have done some good jobs in the past with such Animes like 'Ergo Proxy' but to relate to that Anime also the character appearances are quite bland for example how the character 'Shiro' has a very plain and bland design. You will notice if you ever do decide this is that they really like the colour red but thats a good thing as said before. They much emphasize the use of the dullness of a prison. The animation overall was not poor I would like to add, it was smooth and the fights that occurred were well done I think the part of this that let it down was the Art Team with some bland and poor designs.\\n\\n\r\n(MUSIC & SOUNDTRACK of Deadman Wonderland): Score of 7 - Now moving onto to the biggest part I remember about this Anime. This is purely for one thing however which is the Opening Song. The Title of the song is 'One Reason - by Fade'. I would like to mention its an incredible song really something that gets you pumped showing as you get through the show what the prison becomes and what it is like behind its high walls. The fact they include the name of the Anime into the song's lyrics is awesome personally it made me like it more because of this reason but also the darkness behind the lyrics and everytime you hear it you remember each and every part of the Anime; by far this was the best part of myself watching this Anime (however the Anime is still good do not get me wrong). For the Ending Song, it is very boring and there is nothing to it but it makes sense with the picture they are trying to get across so therefore I cannot really review it but it could of done with something a bit better than the blandness of just a single instrument which you can barely hear. So what about the Soundtrack? well in all honesty it's not great but there are moments which music is played and it is very suited makes you feel sorta pumped but they lack the correct scoring, they did not have any dark and horror music to go along with the theme but for something like a really important part of the Anime they had ok pieces going alongside which did not ruin the moment so at least they did an alright job. \\n\\n\r\nThe Opening Song for Deadman Wonderland: 'One Reason - Fade\"\\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICpzoZozwCU\\n\\n\r\n(ENDING of Deadman Wonderland): Score of 3 - This was one of the biggest problems I had with this Anime for a good reason that it was very bad and left with many any unanswered questions which for ANY Anime is horrible. I understand this is only a proportion of the Manga but they could have at least left it off at a good point or even just not a bad ending (Silly Author). To sum it up better but as said before the Anime is left at a point where you are thinking to yourself \"wait what that's it? it's over?\" it doesn't feel finished when you are on that last episode's end credits and it has so much more to give and so much more to answer. From what comes from the last episode as well it just leaves it on such a bad note therefore just tipping my overall score by a huge amount. \\n\\n\r\n(OVERALL SCORE of Deadman Wonderland): Score of 6\\n\r\n- Sorta Enjoyed.\\n\r\n- Story was good but they could of done so much more.\\n\r\n- Some of the Characters were Alright, some better.\\n\r\n- Opening Song was Fantastic, rest of soundtrack fell behind.\\n\r\n- Art and Animation was good, Art lacked in some areas of character design.\\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this Anime, however I do recommend to go and listen to the opening song provided in this Review. \\n\\n\r\nReview #1 by Dayeneth, Written on 28th - 29th of November 2016.\\n",

            "content": "Waring: I only saw the first episode, and this review is more about why I'm stopping there.\r\nProbably the worst show I've ever seen, but for different reasons than The Ass Bitch War. Purely personal reasons. I don't like Prison stories, and I have a natural (maybe misplaced) trust in my government and police that they aren't screwing everyone over all the time for no reason, even if it's not true. This show takes the reality and pushes it to the extreme, which is hard for someone as easily trusting as me to watch. I don't like how Ganta, the main character is framed and thepolice bully him, 2real4me dawg.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters designs are pretty bare minimum, except for Shiro who looks like a mental hospital run-away, which I think is the point but it kind of creeps me out with how far they decided to take it, which I think is also the point. With the ugly art style it has it's hard to find her cute, not impossible in the hands of a good enough artist, just hard within the context of the show. But seriously being unable to distinguish which part of her body is the straight jacket (thingy) and which part is just her skin bugs me, also her brown mittens kind of spook me too. When she was introduced in the show, I honestly thought she was just fully naked with weird markings, or maybe she is naked and just has a collar on. Hot.\\n\\n\r\nI looked up fanart and she actually didn't look any cuter, way to go show you can't even do that right.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just teasing, this show does have a lot of actual merits: It has a cool metal OP, which doesn't happen a whole lot but I like it (the visuals for the OP are a mix of awesome and disgusting).\\n\r\nIt's also a pretty good dystopia, the setting is extreme but not so much that it's impossible to tell why or what they amplified for more than \"Wouldn't it be interesting if...\" kind of deal. Prisons are carnivals; entertainment for the masses. We kind of already do that on a smaller scale with the flood of shows and books and whatnot about Prison life, such as Orange is the New Black, Scared Straight, (for more Nippon similes) JoJo 6, Rainbow, Prison School, and Nanbaka. We torture and scrutinize inmates who, probably aren't even that bad as well as basically ruin there chances of fitting back into normal society and becoming a better person when they come out.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why this is the worst show I've ever seen. Not because it's horribly written or perpetuates horrible cliches and the poison of the industry, but because it reminds me too much of how we actually do things, this show correctly depicts prison as well as the brutality of the police, and frankly, it's so hard to watch that I don't want. Call me part of the problem, but this show makes me upset thinking about how realistic it is, other than Ganta having weird superpowers.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is fuckin' terrible BUT if you like it I understand I can't blame you, it does a lot right. Just not my thing.",

            "content": "Deadman Wonderland was a bit disappointing for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a actually a decent anime but this could have been adapted into something a lot greater. This had potential but the lack of a certain character and other aspects leave the show almost impossible to carry on. I read all 51 (I know theres more, although its on a hiatus) chapters of the manga and let me tell you, the manga is far better than the anime. The anime feels to rushed, especially at the end. If you're going to watch the anime before reading the manga then you'll most likely bepleased with the series but if you read the manga first, like me, then you'll most likely be disappointed. Too many loose ends for the anime to end and too many mistakes for the anime to be continued. In Japan, the anime did not do too well compared to the manga so a second season is unlikely. The only way for the show to continue is if they somehow incorporate one important character in a random arc but that seems highly unlikely. And for fans of the anime, Genkaku is definitely not the main villain... Too me this seems like a short anime that's a teaser for the manga. This had possible potential to turn into a 25+ or even 50 ep anime but they squished about 21 chapters worth into 12 episodes.... The story had potential in the manga but is left at a huge cliff hanger in the anime, the art is very good in my opinion, the sound is good, the characters were all pretty interesting, the enjoyment for me was meh-so so, but might be more exciting for you if you haven't read the manga first. The overall quality of the show was about a 7.",

People's lives being used for entertainment really makes the viewers look deep into their own huamity.  The only thing that makes Deadman Wonderland weak is that there is not enough of it, and I truely believe that there should be a season 2. This is a very underrated anime and must be watched.",

            "content": "Having recently finished the anime, I am on the fence about Deadman Wonderland. If it was nothing more than a fighting anime, intended to just be blood, guts, and explosions, It would have done just fine. In fact, if that's all you want, don't read ahead, just go watch it. Instead, however, it tried to look into some deeper human emotions and failed. As I said before, the action scenes are actually pretty good, and the mixed soundtrack fits the fight scenes quite well (Shiny Shiny, the closing theme, is still stuck in my head). However, the people in the scenes besides the battles weremediocre at best. Clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9, trope after trope, stereotype after stereotype, the characters couldn't have been more unoriginal if they cosplayed another anime. The brawny guy who's crazy and likes to kill people, yet for some reason conveniently shows mercy to the main character. The strong willed leader with a dark past and family problems. The supporting cast members that have a shorter lifespan than a redshirt or a Walking Dead side character. These things bothered me, but one bad area can't kill an anime, so what else broke it for me? The story. A boy survives a tragedy and gets magical powers, and has to use them to a). Atone for the tragedy b). Protect the innocent c). Seek revenge. It's been done a million times, and that's not necessarily a bad thing; new animes and movies have this theme all the time and work it well. The thing is, Deadman Wonderland didn't do too well at it. The power growth is ridiculous, with Ganta jumping from the bottom of the barrel to the strongest deadman in the wonderland in a matter of seconds, with no intermediaries whatsoever. The main nemeses had potential to be tools in exploring certain aspects of insanity, but the flashbacks lasted about 3 minutes at the very longest, just telling the viewer \"I got hurt this way so I hurt someone else this other way.\" No elaboration, no development, just that and boom-battle. Gratuitous violence sugarcoats the writing, and the idea of blood as a weapon - literally - shows potential. But, as it stands, this anime is just something I would recommend watching if you're in a bad mood and want to see something explode.",

            "content": "Now at first i really liked Deadman Wonderland, good start in my own personal opinion.\r\nThe story was very good, there are many problems with it and some things i think they just went to far with, but made a certain amount of sense from the situation they were in. \r\nThe art was great, i really enjoyed the effort put into the little things, there were some things they left out on but other than that it was very gory but you'll understand more of that when you watch the anime yourselves.\r\nThe sound i personally dont have any complaints over, it was outstanding, sound effects ofthe fight scenes and the ambient sounds of Deadman Wonderland. Which is quite rare i normally hate ambient sounds as i get distracted rather easily.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters had some issues from a personal point of view, great never the less, the later characters really suited the environment they were in. Can't say i liked the main character too much for the first half, but it got better later on.\\n\\n\r\nI totally enjoyed everything except one particular scene which even for me was a bit too much, real or not and i love those kinds of things. Reason why i watched anime as a much younger age :D but there is a limit to everything. But it was great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall going from the scores thus far it is a 9/10 I recommend this anime for those among you who enjoy gory animes with creative ideas for a power, i have not come across something that has used this idea which who knows i might get told otherwise. \\n\r\nAnyways it is quite gory the themes are quite 'degrading' and very much so dark, even creepier is the 'promoter' does it all with a smile. Ended too soon though and i would of preferred a longer running anime since there just aren't enough of Deadman Wonderland park shown in the anime series. But other than that one complaint as long as you Love Dark, Gory animes with special abilities than you are going to Love this.",

            "content": "Imagine you're a kid again. You're hanging out with your little circle of friends heading off for a regular day at school. You get to school, everyone's sitting in the desks, but then all of the sudden, a crazy guy in red shows up and starts butchering everybody! Your best friend's head just rolled past your feet! The girl you had a crush on has her blood spread all over the chalkboard! You see the man coming your way and you pass out due to shock...\r\nThen you wake up, and you're in handcuffs. The public believes you committed this heinous crime, killing all of yourfriends and classmates at school. This is what happens to Ganta Igarashi, the main character of Deadman Wonderland.\\n\\n\r\n\ufeffStory - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter being framed for this sadistic murder spree, Ganta is shipped off to an insane prison called Deadman Wonderland. This facility is roughly half theme park, half prison, but all crazy. This setup is very intruiging and each episode throws more and more into the pot in attempt to add depth to the events at hand. Soon we discover Ganta is of a breed of people who can manipulate their blood and do so to fight. There are also mysterious things going on behind the scenes and higher ups in the prison have their eye on Ganta. This is all effective in making Deadman Wonderland more interesting at first, but so much is going on here that it makes the big flaw of the anime stand out more. This is one of those shows that lacks resolution at the end. It's extremely rare for any story to be able to successfully leave loose ends and feel gratifying, and Deadman Wonderland is not one of those special cases. Everything goes nowhere and it makes the anime feel pointless, even though the build up and journey to the end was fairly good. The only thing that even feels remotely like a resolved arc is the one involving some secondary characters that you got introduced to more than halfway into the episode count. It all screams for a second season, which I don't deny would be a good idea, but unless that happens this ending is horrid.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's this constant little skipping in the animation here and there. I thought this was an effect at first but I noticed it just seems like lack of budget or shoddy animation. It's pretty distracting and holds back what is otherwise a pretty decent animation job. There isn't anything great here really but nothing bad either. Character designs are as basic as the characters, except for Shiro, who has a pleasantly unique look. The effects on the Branch of Sin superpowers have a fascinating tech-looking design to them that works surprisingly well. The action is pretty good and on display very often being one of the main highlights of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice work is all solid. Deadman Wonderland is so over the top both in violence and dialogue that it could have been utterly horrible if some good actors weren't behind the characters. The lines are just off the wall at times but the delivery makes it believable to a point where it's actually fun to hear these characters be so vulgar and foul-mouthed.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is surprisingly good, even if it's very standard in the use of the songs. You pretty much know after two episodes when you'll be hearing certain tunes chime but none of it is bad. The opening theme is actually one of my recent favorites I've heard in anime. The ending theme however, feels out of place and also breaks the serious mood that most, if not all episodes end on. It's a really happy go lucky song, there's nice lighting and a ferris wheel in the background. It would be downright whimsical if it was closing the curtains on almost any anime but this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is what's going to lose the show many viewers. The characters are all stereotypes we've seen in one anime or another and very few even have one quality of any value. Ganta is the inferior whiny male lead incarnate. He feels like a black hole of everything that can go wrong with this trope. Even though the audience will feel sorry for him starting out, there's just so much time spent crying and not being good at anything that Ganta never makes up for his flaws. Shiro is the cutesy, dumb, obsessive girlfriend type, but she's got white hair so you know there's more to her than you think. Shiro spends most of her time eating and when she's not eating she's being irritating.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are full of cold and violent people who are all crazy for no reason. The villains all feel the same, just adding to a number of things generic about Deadman Wonderland. The only characters that were really interesting are Nagi and Karako, a pair introduced very near the end of the show who honestly feel like they could've been the center of a much more interesting plot than what we have.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a short anime that's got lots of solid action that isn't completely mindless, with some foul language, gore, and you don't mind unfulfilling endings, Deadman Wonderland might be quite enjoyable. For most though, it's going to come off as a standard anime that doesn't offer much.",

Every chance we get, we sit in front of the T.V. to watch either someone escaping from a tank full of spiders, some girl bitch slapping another girl or the next stop for a spaceship and its crew. Probably (and sadly) the most popular of all television is reality T.V. I know it, and you know it to be true. We enjoy watching real people each week do crazy uncontrollable stuff just to gt attention because they are having a shinning moment. Now imagine if some dude took the concept of a bitch slapping another bitch andsome dude trying to escape from a tank of spiders and combined them into one reality television extravaganza and  you will probably get \"Deadman Wonderland.\" \\n\\n\r\nDW (as I will call it for short) started off as an interesting survival/wrong man story. A young high schooler innocently sits in his classroom with his friends, joking and laughing about the next field trip. When suddenly a guy dressed all in red smashes through the window and kills everyone in the classroom, except Ganta. He is arrested and charged with the murders, (idk how they could possibly thought one kid could of done this, I mean that room was a disaster) and is sent to hell on earth, the prison/fun land known as Deadman Wonderland. And this were the really interesting stuff happens, Ganta is put to the test, as he must survive the brutal murders that occupy this prison, as well as survive the games they have the prisoners play. This stuff is great, its brutal and intense, kind of like how Shawshank Redemption would be if crossed over with  The Hunger Games. its a perfect example of taking reality T.V to far and showing that we are not far from showing killings on T.V. Then... it goes down hill. \\n\\n\r\nIt starts to develop this story. Giving Its main character this background that makes little to no sense. Somehow, Ganta is connected with the white haired girl Shiro, who is this playful gitty girl who can suddenly turn into this deadly assassination. The problem is, there wasn't enough time to fully develop that. There is so much other stuff going on, like a group of deadmen trying to escape prison, but are stopped by this group of people called Undertakers who are the only ones who can defeat the deadman and there special powers to turn their blood into weapons. Suddenly a huge cast of characters introduced and the show is already half way over, so it feels rushed and the final climatic battle, is anticlimactic. \\n\\n\r\nDW starts off interesting. Pitting its characters in a battle of survival that earns them candy that keeps them alive, while the loser gets a piece of their body part taken off. it was brutal, it was bloody, but it was something different. But then it went in the direction of Bleach or One Piece, were one to many characters are put into the mix,  certain things are never answered. (Who was the Red Man!) certain characters just disappear, never to be heard of again. And the last two episodes were it should of been an awesome bloody fight, ended in a useless monologue and an anticlimactic fight. I liked the first half of DW, but the second made no sense and was rushed. It needed more episodes and hopefully will get a second season. Also the opening theme in English dubbed version is one of the worst I've ever heard. Too bad.",

            "content": "Facing irrationality doesn't mean not feeling fear, but rather possessing eyes that gaze upon fear and standing against the world.\r\nDeadman Wonderland seems to be built upon quite an interesting premise when you look at it. Deadman Wonderland is the name of the only privately owned prison in Japan but it\u2019s a prison with a twist. The prison makes its convicts face off in brutal matches to the death just in order to amuse on looking crowds of people, the general public! It\u2019s like gladiator fighting in the 21st century except you\u2019re not making it out alive, sooner or later you will die. Death is literallyaround every corner, if you aren\u2019t killed in the games, good luck surviving with all the other weird and twisted inmates, this isn\u2019t quite the show it seems!\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main story revolves around Ganta, we start the show with him in class and just talking with his classmates, everything\u2019s pretty normal, I mean what could possibly go wrong? Proceed with weird floating mad man with powers to appear out of nowhere and throw around a bit of red magic and end up murdering everyone in the class. A few limbs here and a bit of blood there, didn\u2019t see that coming now did you? Oh and of course don\u2019t kill Ganta, no, no, we can\u2019t be killing the main character in this show in the first minute now can we.\\n\r\nGanta then wakes up and is accused of being the killer since he\u2019s the only one alive and a strange clip of him confessing to the murders just randomly pops up. After a few court trials (which probably have empty-minded people on the panel of judges- such irrational people) he finds himself sentenced to death and joins Deadman Wonderland as a death row inmate. Oh and did I mention Ganta doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s older than 12, so they\u2019ve gone on and sentenced this 12 year old or so kid to death, wonderful. Ganta meets various people in the prison where no one is what they seem like and is sucked into a fight for survival, which is riddled with twists, not that all of them make very much sense. Over the course of this show he also finds out he has a superpower and slowly learns to control this power and there we have it ladies and gentlemen, that is more or less how this show starts out and to be honest, it\u2019s actually quite interesting, even if it does seem like things are just going from bad to worse to this poor kid so fast, so fast. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise I think this show is actually rather interesting, it has a fair share of characters it seems to fit in over the short span of episodes and it does make you get to know them more- not that you\u2019ll necessarily like them all. Ganta himself isn\u2019t the tough kid with a temper or the macho man, in fact, he is portrayed as a weak character who has a very strong will and strong desire to keep pressing on in adversity. So often during the show when he is just getting the crap beaten out of him, you do often feel a bit a pity for him. He can be a bit frustrating at times because he isn\u2019t always the best at thinking rationally and keeping his cool but you can\u2019t really blame the guy after all he has been through, although there are times when his emotions and actions can leave you frustrated, mainly because he seems to have very wild mood swings in the depressing and dark end of the spectrum. The other main character who we are introduced to is called Shiro and she is by far the best character in the show. Shiro just pops up around Deadman Wonderland and often follows around Ganta and asks him to play with her and just generally spend time together. Shiro has a very peculiar white look about her (Shiro means white in Japanese) and combined with her eyes, something doesn\u2019t seem quite right about her. However, with her super bubbly and extremely childlike behaviour you can\u2019t seem but to really get behind Shiro, she keeps the show interesting and gives the show a very interesting angle. Also, she\u2019s actually really strong and when I say strong, I am probably seriously understating her powers, something is most certainly not right about her, so given how her childish tendencies, it\u2019s best to stay on her good side. The other characters all have their own distinct stories and aren\u2019t all moulded around typical character traits- so this is certainly the best part of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of gore in this show, some of it is the usual blood spattering everywhere and limbs flying around although sometimes they really do go into detail with some scenes and actually touch upon some very serious situations without holding back much on the details. It\u2019s the kind of gore that I would describe would make you really uncomfortable at times and while you get used to it by the end, it certainly is enough to put some people off the show. \\n\\n\r\nNow in terms of how this story goes about unravelling itself, this is the aspect where it seems to take a nosedive. After building itself up with an interesting story, surprisingly good characters and some sort of direction, the plot just fails. It sinks into its own giant plot holes and leaves you very frustrated at the end since it just simply does not tie up any loose ends and keeps the viewer thinking, wait\u2026.what? It\u2019s not the good type of open ending where you are left to ponder what could\u2019ve been, it\u2019s the kind of ending which screams we didn\u2019t have enough episodes to fit everything in, so we will just forget about half the things we introduced earlier. It\u2019s a shame because this was actually quite a mature show and had quite a lot of potential but I\u2019m afraid the show does the plot no justice at all and you can tell the show is falling apart towards the end. \\n\r\nI\u2019ve mentioned this show is mature, it certainly does touch upon some topics which require a lot of maturity to understand, which is nice to see in an anime, even if the topics can be a bit uncomfortable to deal with. However sometimes they have some terrible one-liners which are just so out of place and unnecessary that it proves to be an annoyance and you will know when you\u2019ve heard them, don\u2019t worry about picking those up. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are both okay, the ED especially really creeped me out for some reason probably because they showed Ganta and his school friends hanging out, which just made me feel uneasy. In terms of a soundtrack, this show did well enough in this department too, so no issues here. The art was mediocre, nothing was wrong with it, if anything, the most impressive aspects for me were the character designs for some of the characters and especially Shiro, not for details but for the styling and just how it seemed to work, even if it wasn\u2019t very flashy. The colours used in this show are mainly quite toned down and mellow, so the palette they chose from was very muted and dark, which helped with the idea of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a show with massive potential which really could have gone on to be something great, however it is riddled with missed opportunities and sometimes it just seems to give up with the idea of closure or at least even explaining anything. Also the awkward script writing can spoil the flow of things at times, so in the end it\u2019s a bit of a love-hate show. It\u2019s certainly well worth a watch to enjoy something which feels a bit different to your standard anime, however be prepared to be disappointed. I would love more shows like this to be made in the future, except they should actually have a decent end. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6.7\\n\r\nTukky12 \\n\r\n=)\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of recommendations, I would say \u201cAnother\u201d is well worth a watch, the show also has a lot of gore and an interesting pull with the story, however in the case of Another, it actually has quite a thrilling end. Or Elfen Lied, watch that at your own risk xD (I\u2019ll leave you to find out about that on your own!) \\n",

            "content": "The name itself let us imagine what this anime is all about . Death , gore , blood splatter etc . When i watched Deadman Wonderland , the feels that i get from this anime is similar to Mirai Nikki . That being said , Deadman Wonderland just happens to be an anime where they have potential , yet not enough to cover the flaws . 12 episodes is not enough for me .\r\nStory:7\r\nThe story tells us about a kid that was being framed for a mass murder , Igarashi Ganta . The one who killed all of his classmates were ''The Red Man''. The Red Man gave Ganta a special gift which will be useful later on . He then was sent to Deadman Wonderland , a place where killers are gathered . After some events that happen , Ganta met Shiro , a mysterious girl that happens to know a lot about Ganta . From my point of view , the story pace seems like they were rush . Could be due to the anime only have 12 episodes which the manga have like 50+ chapters .\\n\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nThe arts and animation were decent . Not enough to capture my interest . There were some 3D animations that were really nice .\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nThe voice actor and actress were good actually . Nothing that make me stop watching or anything . There were some OST that was nice . I really like the OP and ED . The OP has this thrill feelings whenever i hear it and the ED has this relaxing feelings to it .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\nOnly a bit of these characters does actually have a background and a character development . Some are just there to be waiting for their death which is understandable . Our mc is Igarashi Ganta of course . This kid is just too depressing . He is sometimes pathetic in a way that can actually make you mad . Shiro is the girl that have a split personalities . There are others like Kiyomasa Senji a.k.a Crow , who is the sslice dude , Takami Yoh , a dude who is in search of his beloved sister who is in Deadman Wonderland and many more . The characters development here seems like they only focus on some characters only . I was disappointed with the characters development here .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime just fine despite how much flaws that exist here . From the gore , to the a bit of epic battle scenes , they were quite good actually . There were some comedy that's only for a gag relieved which is good . Other than that , i got nothing .\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\r\nDespite i gave this anime a total of 7 , Deadman Wonderland did a good job at entertain me for a while . I would recommend this anime to anyone who wants an anime where there is a bit of gore , powers involved and just blood splattering . Just know this , it's not every one cup of tea . This is an anime where you're either enjoy and like it a lot or you didn't enjoy it much and hate it a lot .",

This anime is dark and twisted rarely is there humor. it was agood show with an ending that makes you gasp! enjoy (only for people that can handle lots and lots of blood)",

            "content": "[I originally reviewed this straight after watching it and got a bit too excited and waaaay too biased due to my love of this type of horror, so this review is a lot more accurate.]\r\nThis anime was everything that I love about anime: bloodshed, twists, messed up plots, a horrible secret\u2026basically lots of drama and tears\u2026with death and mutilation around every corner. \r\nIf you can\u2019t stomach that stuff, I\u2019d maybe consider your decision a little harder.\r\nWhy did I like it so much? \r\nIt was the plot from the beginning that initially made me want to watch on, because it was a shocker of an introduction.The fact that it was packed full of bloodshed urged me further through the series too as the deaths/mutilations were pretty ridiculous, and almost hilarious...which is positive for some but not others.\\n\\n\r\nThe deaths and injuries inflicted were usually justified, especially in some of the prison's twisted little 'games'.  I really liked the entertainment 'carnival/circus' theme of the games mixed in with the death/horror, it was very much like a clown massacring a bunch of kids, with cute music in the background. Again, some people will dig this, some will not. (I must note that Shiro's character reflected this very thing to a tee once you find out more about her).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were driven with a passion due to their horrible surroundings. This caused them to become strong, emotionally as well as physically.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the majority of the characters were very three-dimentional as you find out a lot about them as people due, mainly, to flashbacks. The flashback method which was used within the story makes it a bit easier to emphasise with some of the characters, especially those with bad pasts.\\n\\n\r\nAs more and more characters get put through an emotional rollercoaster, so do you.\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't care so much about the sound and will skip an opening theme if I've watched it all the way through already but the Deadman Wonderland OP I watched/listened to every single time. It fit the anime pretty well but the heavy emphasis on the guitars, and the genre of the song in general, made it look more like an action anime than anything else (rather than a horror or a drama), which isn't necessarily wrong.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally when I reviewed this anime, I could find no negative aspects, but since calming down as well as talking it over with a friend, that isn't true. One thing that annoyed me was the plot - it became quite unresolved and characters' aims became distorted or forgotten. However, if there's a second series, it will make this series better as it feels incomplete.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, if you want to be shocked, WTFd and don't mind extreme forms of death and/or questionable methods of mutilation, give this a go.",

The problem I have with this anime its the inconsistency with the whole candy thing and the blood which I cant get into without spoiling it but trust me when your watching this you'll being to notice how it just doesn't make sense and I done care how motivated you are you CAN NOT SURVIVE HALF THE THING THAT HAPPENS TO THEM. what is this Disney true love concurs all bull sh*t.\\n\r\nthis anime gives away a lot and I don't know if they do it on purpose or accidental but I could tell who the red man was within the first few episodes and no I did not read the manga. Now I don't care much for spoilers even if i know the ending to something i can still equally enjoy it as much as i would if i didn't, but the thing is the would anime is based on Ganta trying to kill the red men thats the only motivation he has to go on so why give it away so fast why not wait till the end to show us who it was.\\n",

            "content": "...Eugh.\r\nWhat is the worst anime you've ever seen?\r\nNo, I'm not talking about Boku no Pico or Mars of Destruction. I'm talking about a series that makes you so angry, leaves you feeling so empty and disappointed inside that you literally are at the point where you can't say a damn thing about it that would make it sound extremely bad. That's how little you feel about it and how apathetic it made you. Indifference is worse than hatred, and this anime and my relationship with it is a prime example.\r\nThis is Deadman Wonderland.\r\nSTORY: 5/10\r\nOkay, before I go into the plot, let's talk about Sword ArtOnline for a sec. An MMORPG where real lives are at stake. You can't leave until you beat the game, but if you never beat it, you can never join reality again. Beautiful concept. Excellent sales pitches all around.\\n\\n\r\nThe execution is horrible. You don't need me to tell you that.\\n\\n\r\nAnime has proven time and again that a seemingly terrible concept can lead to a spectacular anime, (i.e. Polar Bear Caf\u00e9 or Detroit Metal City,) and, likewise, a wonderful concept can lead to terrible execution, as stated above.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Deadman Wonderland is an example of the latter.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a boy who gets unjustly framed for a murder he clearly didn't commit, but due to a corrupted courtroom and his screwy defense attorney, he gets locked away in this prison that's an amusement park on the outside and a fight club on the inside. Prisoners are used for entertainment a la Roman Coliseum by having to fight each other to the death, complete obstacles that could end their lives, and use their own blood as weapons until they pass out or their opponent gets brutally murdered---whichever comes first.\\n\\n\r\nThere you go. Some business guy probably used that as a sales pitch and an entire boardroom gave him an ovation.\\n\\n\r\nBut.\\n\\n\r\nBUT.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself is UNBELIVEABLY forced in tone. It is extremely hard to believe, even with your suspension of disbelief, that a small child who is being tried for brutally murdering his classmates was sent into a courtroom that was literally built to screw him over and that's all he gets. I get that this is supposed to be this dystopian version of Japan, but it's kind of like Tokyo Ghoul in the sense that, even though it's supposed to be dark, it's a little too unfair at the point where the viewer may not want to cheer for the main character because it's pointless. They're going to lose because life just isn't fair for fifteen-year-old boys that the world will never understand.\\n\\n\r\nAnd before you think this show will be worth watching through the end after such a shady beginning, it's not. The ending comes directly out of left-field and is about a random side-character without ever bringing up a possible resolution for our \"hero.\"\\n\\n\r\nI have never read the manga, but apparently this show is an adaptation of only the first four books of a twenty-something part manga. If that's not a red flag, I have no idea what else I can tell you.\\n\\n\r\nART: 5\\n\\n\r\nI mean, like...eh. It's fine. I don't have a tremendous amount to say about it aside from it's jarring like it's supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really a stylistic approach. It's just a basic, \"Oh, this is a dark anime with a twist on the innocent nostalgia of amusement parks; let's put dark colors on what are supposed to be bright objects!! :D\" \\n\\n\r\nExample: It's no secret that Madoka Magica is both kawaii and kowai. There's a blend of huge pops of color and entirely different mediums are used to create the witches in the show to make the danger stand out that much more, so when someone dies or when a fight occurs, it catches you that much more.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of Deadman Wonderland is just...blank. Two characters talk in a blank room with a poster on one of the walls, panning back and forth to crowds of people. Fight scenes are eh, character designs are eh, it's all eh when it doesn't have to be.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6\\n\\n\r\n\"Any questions?\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Yeah, how big are those titties?\"\\n\\n\r\n\"I'm a G.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe dub has some gold nuggets in it. I have no idea why they decided to cast that annoying blonde kid from Clannad as the main character, though. Don't ask about music. I literally could not tell you what instruments are being used in the soundtrack, much less the 2007 Linkin Park wailing of the OP.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5\\n\\n\r\nHere's a test for you weebs to try at home to see how long an anime will stick with you.\\n\\n\r\nGo on Google Images and type in \"*insert anime here* character wallpaper\" and pull up the wallpaper with the most characters in it. It could be two, could be twenty. If you can name every character, no matter how many there are, it's safe to say that the anime did a great job nailing the characters in your head, thus they'll be your waifus forever.\\n\\n\r\nI literally cannot name a single character from Deadman Wonderland, not even white-haired big gloves. I think there was a guy named Yo, but I literally can't remember. This show glazes over character arcs that would have been more interesting had they been panned out more. Like I remember this one episode about this seemingly innocent girl who goes batshit crazy due to trauma behind the crime she had committed to get sent to Deadman Wonderland, but after two episodes, we literally never hear from her again. The last episode is about a cop or something.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really care, either. Not like I'm getting paid for this.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 5\\n\\n\r\nI have a feeling we all would have enjoyed this show much more if we were all in seventh grade and Evanescence was still the best thing to happen to us. At first, in all honesty, I adored this show. Thought it was the shit, immediately looked up merchandise for it, wanted to cosplay Red Eyes McBigBewbs at the next local con.\\n\\n\r\nBut the more I watched, the more I questioned.\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of the first ten anime I had ever watched from beginning to end. I hadn't even seen Death Note yet, that's how small of a weeb I was. So, at the time, this was the darkest anime I had ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThen I watched more anime and began to hate myself and my standards.\\n\\n\r\nI kept asking, \"Why?\" Why does no one try to escape? Why does literally no one sympathize with children in a death camp without much reason to be there? Why is REMBB even here?\\n\\n\r\nIt was fine when I started, but then I wanted to quit several times but didn't because hey I already started and I only have two episodes left and I have nothing else to do with my pathetic life except watching children beat each other with their own blood\\n\\n\r\nAnd again. No reward.\\n\\n\r\nLiterally could have...I don't know, hugged my cat more instead of watching the \"finale\" that was basically an ad for the OVA, which has basically NOTHING to do with the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5\\n\\n\r\nIn short, it was genuinely disappointing. A beautiful concept with an apparently brilliant manga gets a horrendous adaptation that leaves the viewer not getting anything but not wanting anything else. I honestly checked years ago to see if they were going to make a second season to this show just to see if they were going to try again. I would love to see a wonderful concept like this pull through and grow enticing, or at least incite a reaction besides, \"Eh.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo...is this the worst anime I've ever seen? Well...no. But it's the worst relationship I have with one. It's like watching your kid, who you know is super talented and can probably end national poverty and hunger, never move out of the house and does nothing with their philosophy degree while bragging to everyone about how smart they are without actually doing anything with their knowledge, instead just locking themselves up in the basement and ranting on their blogs about how the smart people never get the jobs they deserve while he hasn't even looked in the classifieds of the newspaper. You can't say they're a terrible human, nor can you say they're good.\\n\\n\r\nTalent, along with a beautiful concept, means nothing if you don't do anything worthwhile with it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this anime barely tries.",

            "content": "The Positive Side:  The show\u2019s premise is gripping not only because of its horror, but also because of its originality.  Ganta Igurashi, a schoolboy of 14, witnesses the gruesome murder of his entire class by a strange, supernatural being in bleeding, red armor.  As if his life wasn\u2019t horrible enough yet, Ganta is framed for this murder and back-stabbed by his own attorney.  Still traumatized by the death of his friends, Ganta is thrown into the hellish prison known as Deadman Wonderland, where inmates must participate in deadly competitions in order to stay alive.  The owner of Deadman Wonderland (whois also the man who posed as Ganta\u2019s attorney) rakes in profits by marketing the gruesome deaths of the inmates as entertainment to the public while convincing viewers that the deaths are actually staged via CGI.  It\u2019s a premise that immediately places Ganta into a sympathetic position, and also offers insightful commentary on the evils of prisons for profits and on the use of violence as entertainment.\\n\r\nGanta gets a lot of accusations of being whiny and useless, and I\u2019ve always found those accusations pretty baffling.  A fourteen year-old watches his friends murdered, and is immediately thrust into a prison where he is seemingly doomed to die horrifically, and the audience hates him for being upset?  What people seem to miss about Ganta (despite the fact that Shiro flat-out says this) is that he never gives up, even when giving up seems so tempting.  His determination to stay alive and avenge his friends is made all the more remarkable because of his fear, his weakness and the fact that he is perpetually outmatched by the people around him.  \\n\r\nThe supporting cast is pretty strong (on the heroes\u2019 side, anyways).  Ganta\u2019s friend Shiro provides some much needed comic relief, but because she is obviously mentally damaged, her character doesn\u2019t clash with the overall grimness the setting.   Nagi provides a foil to Ganta, his strength, stoicism and soft-spoken nature contracting Ganta\u2019s perpetual state of panic.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some neat concepts in the setting, such as the power to form weapons out of one\u2019s own blood (thus granting super-powers for the cost of constantly risking auto-exsanguination in combat), and the prisoners being forced to wear toxic collars that could only be staved off by consuming regular doses of an antidote.  The way that outsiders to Ganta\u2019s plight are perpetually deluded and oblivious about what\u2019s actually going on is unnerving from both sides.  It hard to say what\u2019s scarier, the thought that we could be put through hell without anyone on the outside noticing or caring, or the thought that something horrific could be happening just under our noses without us knowing.\\n\r\nThe Negative Side: The first problem with this show is that it over-stuffs its cast with psychos.  I get that this is set in a futuristic and corrupt prison, but there are simply so many sociopaths, all shoving and piling over each other in their separate efforts to wow the audience with competing abominations, that each individual villain becomes less memorable.  This would probably be forgivable if Deadman Wonderland didn\u2019t betray its own maturity in the last two episodes for the sake of indulging in the narcissistic power-fantasy that seems mandatory to the Shonen genre.  I\u2019m going to be talking about an ending now, so there\u2019s gonna be some spoilers, if you didn\u2019t get that.  Seriously though.  Spoilers are coming.  In like, the next paragraph.\\n\r\n\tThe series\u2019 downhill slide begins with the removal of every character besides the Protagonist who could hope to make a difference, starting with Karako.  Karako has been set up as Nagi\u2019s second in command.  She successfully rallies the rebellion in Nagi\u2019s absence, and when their escape attempt is interrupted by an acid-spewing robot-tank, Karako ensures that the rest of the group escapes before taking on the robot one-on-one and beating it to death with her fists.  In short, Karako is badass with a capital B.  Well, until the writers say otherwise.  In the series\u2019 ending, Karako gets easily captured, and seemingly forgets about the sword-wielding psychopath standing right behind her, which results in her being impaled and disabled for the rest of series.  This sudden stupidity and helplessness is not at all consistent with her character.\\n\r\nAfter swooping in and saving Ganta\u2019s ass, the Hummingbird bows out of the escape effort by claiming she deserves to be in prison, a sudden turn of idealism that just feels wrong for her cynical, foul-mouthed personality.  \\n\r\nWorst of all, Crow, the man who demanded Ganta never, ever get in a fight when he isn\u2019t there to watch, learns that Ganta is about to fight the strongest, scariest villain in the Wonderland with a brand new technique that Crow just finished teaching him, and Crow decides that somehow, this isn\u2019t worth tagging along to see.  None of these actions are even remotely true to everything we know about these characters, but apparently, respecting interesting secondary characters you\u2019ve spent the entire series developing isn\u2019t nearly as important as making the Protagonist feel speshul.  \\n\r\nThe absurd lengths the writers go to keeping the sidekicks out of Ganta\u2019s way reach a climax when Ganta and Shiro are facing down the Gay Surfer-Monk of Darkness.  Shiro is in her absurdly powerful Wretched Egg form, and Ganta pushes her aside and flat-out tells her, \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to be the hero!\u201d  I get that they\u2019re trying to show Ganta has become more badass then he was when the series started, but really?  They couldn\u2019t find any more believable way to do it?\\n\r\n\tGanta is not an Escapist Character.  He has never been an Escapist Character, and abruptly deciding to toss him a Deus Ex Machina Super-Power and letting him take down the Season 1 Big Bad on his own is, like almost everything that happens in the last two episodes, completely inconsistent with the character development that made us care about these characters in the first place.  Ganta garners sympathy specifically because he ISN\u2019T a typical Shonen hero.  He\u2019s scared, perpetually traumatized and physically weak, and even when he learns to harness his supernatural abilities, he is surrounded by people with powers equal to and greater than his own.  Despite having every conceivable disadvantage, Ganta is determined to survive and attain justice, and that makes him an extremely compelling character.   By shoe-horning him into the spot-light and suddenly giving him a new weapon that is far more powerful than anything any other Deadman has shown, they\u2019ve robbed Ganta of everything that made him interesting.  He\u2019s just another Shonen hero, stealing glory from his supporting cast and pulling inexplicably superior fire-power out of his ass at any point the plot demands.  To add insult to injury, the only reason the Deus Ex Machina Gun is required is because Ganta\u2019s hyper-sonic attack fails, even though the hyper-sonic attack was developed specifically to take down the kind of bad guy Ganta is facing.  It just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\\n\r\n\tUltimately, Deadman Wonderland chose to compromise its artistic potential for the sake of appealing to a power-hungry, adolescent audience.  What could have been a memorable Seinen horror is instead, a violent, melodramatic and manipulative chunk of garbage.\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019d never seen this anime tho I knew about it because it was a popular title, so the lovely Pink decided to rectify that with a rabb.it session and my god, am I glad I finally watched it! She\u2019s a surprising big fan of dubs, so I was like \u201cokay let\u2019s see this train-wreck\u201d, but I was pleasantly surprised that the dub was great.\r\nThis show is filled with swearing, of the kind I\u2019ve never heard before on an anime, and I was super shook and amazed, AND I WISH MORE ANIME GOT THIS KIND OF TREATMENT BECAUSE WOW. Tho tbh, MC\u2019s voice was kinda\u2026not thatgood at first, but it grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nThis does end in a \u201cto continue\u201d/we haven\u2019t finished the story kind of ting, but I was told it\u2019s cause the studio went bankrupt, so can\u2019t be helped :V I do wish they\u2019d outsource it to another studio, but the manga is already over OTL\\n\\n\r\nThe anime had wonderfully vicious scenes of skin melting, and chunks of meat getting ripped, AND IT WASN\u2019T CENSORED, IT WAS AMAZING. Plus the character design was great, and I liked how some characters weren\u2019t what they looked like. Especially being foul motherfuckers once the penny dropped and they turned vicious~\\n\\n\r\nThis was really engaging, fast-paced and never bored me, so if this sounds like the type of show you enjoy, GET ON IT, YOU WON\u2019T GET DISAPPOINTED. I recommended watching the dub because it\u2019s not censored, at all, so it\u2019s always great to see it!",

            "content": "I won't give this anime slack for being incomplete, even without any attempt at a satisfying conclusion, whether for a season or otherwise. I knew that going in, so it wouldn't be quite fair.\r\nHowever, that set aside, it really disappointed. The story, which sees Ganta Igarashi being imprisoned in a cruel, brutal and privately owned prison-slash-amusement park (which is a very disturbed concept to begin with, so shouldn't that at least have been somewhat interesting?), veers off-course at least twice, and those veers aren't insignificant. Is it really about the prison, or is it about the sudden superpowers that show up almost out of theblue? I know the answer may be \"both\", but what we did have going on about the prison was suddenly tossed aside for the powers. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, but not exactly the nicest looking style if you ask me. That's pretty subjective, though, so I'm sure lots of people like the look of it a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty good. The opening theme, in particular, is much better than the rest of the anime (really, you might as well watch the opening and skip the rest of it, if you really want my opinion). Why do I give the sound a 5 then? Ganta Igarashi's dub voice is one of the most annoying voices I've heard in my dubbed anime history (which includes 4Kids, for perspective). I really do want to feel bad for this kid, he really is in a crap situation and I'm sure most people would react to his situation the way he does, but that voice really gets on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are not at all interesting, at least to me. Ganta whines and cries an babbles on uselessly. Shiro is mysterious, but mostly just comes off annoying (particularly if you don't look up spoilers). Crow is about the coolest character in the show, and about the only one I actually like, but that may just be because he's voiced by Patrick Seitz in the dub; if it were anyone else, I probably wouldn't even like him.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, and overall, it was a drag. It was pretty boring, and as far as it being a violent and gory anime, well...I guess so. But there honestly wasn't that much gore (at least in the version I watched. Maybe that was the censored version and it's much worse). I'll give it kudos, I guess, for having some hard-to-watch scenes. I was just expecting more in terms of violence and gore, and was quite disappointed with what we seem to have gotten. Guess I shouldn't have watched Hellsing Ultimate before this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while I would like to be able to recommend Deadman Wonderland, I just can't. If you absolutely want to know the story, read the manga. Otherwise, I'd give this one a pass.",

            "content": "No spopilers.\r\nDeadman Wonderland is a pretty old-school style anime.  It rides heavily on its visuals and its mood, but ends up not delivering as far as plot and characters.  The MC is pretty much an even more wimpy version of Yuki from Mirai Nikki.  That can work out, but the problem is that the woman he leans on is in this case a very shallow character.  Shiro is basically a walking piece of fanservice, and despite her apparent badassery, has little effect on the overall plot.  It really seems like Ganta's story, with Shiro just being there to provide TnAand a forced romantic appeal.\\n\\n\r\nThat could work but all the characters are painfully shallow.  I understand the source material was quite compressed, but I don't feel like giving more time to hese characters would have helped.  All in all it seemed like it was relying way too heavily on aesthetic to compensate for bad characters and a lackluster plot.  The entire world setting just appears less than thought through, and it feels like someone just wanted to make a \"Carnival of Death\" anime and tried to force some absurd plotline onto it.  There was not a single likable character throughout the show, and the only women shown without fanservice are either old, children, or the single female character not shown in ways which are meant to appeal to men's sexual desires.\\n\\n\r\nI thought they had lots of room to work within on their soundtrack, band that while it was pretty good overall, that they failed to explore the possibilities that lay within using a metal-themes soundtrack to anime.  And the animation quality is pretty phenomenal, but it can't gloss over the lack of plot stability and the weak characters.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime to anyone who likes edgy stuff, who is more interested in action than plot, or who has a soft spot for useless MCs who are constantly harping on their own patheticness.",

            "content": "Let me just say right off the bat that this is definitively the most juvenile anime I've ever seen, and this is coming from someone who very recently watched High School of the Dead for the first time. It has a couple of positives that save it from the 2 or 3 rating that it otherwise deserves, but this show is largely an abomination.\r\nArt-\r\nThe art in this anime is actually quite good! Animation is fluid, there are a few presumably difficult to draw and animate moments such as the death race and the carnival corpse fights which were visually impressive and several characters are prettydetailed in their design. I dislike some of the specific artistic choices that were made, but those ultimately come down to the extreme immaturity of the show as a whole rather than the way in which things were drawn and animated being butchered.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the huge positive, the intro sequence and song are truly exceptionally high quality. The intro was among the best I've ever seen, right up there with true standouts such as that of Cowboy Bebop or Death Parade. Also, the soundtrack as a whole is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting as a whole is decent, but it's hard to take it seriously with the ATROCIOUS writing in the dub. The script is among the worst I've ever encountered and is unbelievably juvenile. I am nowhere near an anti-profanity Nazi by any means, but the constant foul language in this anime, and I do mean constant, is not utilized in a \"sometimes people swear in emotional or tense moments\" kind of way. It's much more \"I'm 14 and I want to sound cool/be an adult\" and it simply sounds horrible. Constant F word, C word, P word... All the characters sound like middle schoolers who really need to mature and grow up. There are also loads of instances of characters calling each other \"bro\" or \"dude\" or saying lines such as \"It's called betrayal dude, duh...\" that you'd expect to hear from someone very young and immature.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, while I admit to possible subconscious bias as Greg Ayres is definitely one of my least favorite voice actors as an in general, I find the voice and tone of the main character to be absolutely obnoxious and I find him utterly wimpy, pathetic and unlikable.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there were definitely multiple occasions in the dub where characters were speaking/making sound but their lips/mouth were not moving. It was outright sloppy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Story-\\n\\n\r\nNot saying this in an attempt to be humorous nor am I using hyperbole in order to convey a point- 100% dead serious it's clear to me that the target audience for this show is a troubled kid, probably male and between 12 and 16, who gets picked on or bullied and has no friends and dreams of revenge against his tormentors. I just cannot imagine this show resonating with anyone other than a troubled teenager. I loved the dark and nihilistic base premise of the show and badly wanted to get into the show as a whole but it very quickly derailed into an immature mess.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the plot as a whole is exactly that- a mess. It's absolutely all over the place, has many unexplained elements, has major issues with lack of resolution in regards to multiple important plot elements and overall lacks direction in a big way. It just jumps from here to there to somewhere else and there is very little rhyme or reason to it, all with terrible writing, an obnoxiously voiced lead character and violence and blood for the sake of violence and blood along the way.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of violence and blood, this show has a major case of what my wife and I lovingly refer to as \"Claymore Syndrome\"- that being when the fight scenes themselves are made up of 85% talking and 15% actual fighting and characters routinely pass up on opportunities to finish off their opponent, would rather have a conversation/talk smack/give a warning than actually fight and generally have no interest in actually harming or defeating the main character. The fight scenes should have been some of the highlights of the show but they just aren't. They're largely just more bad dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest positive in the character department is probably that Shiro is a truly unique and memorable character and she's pretty awesome as a whole, but she's not enough to extinguish the dumpster fire that is this show's plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nIf you read up to this point it's probably pretty clear that I largely disliked this show. It's not at all because I don't like dark and weird stuff either. Quite the opposite, actually. I watched and thoroughly enjoyed shows such as Future Diary, Madoka Magica, When They Cry, Hell Girl and others, but this show is just unbearably juvenile and the writing in the dub really is THAT bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt scores a small amount of redemption points for mindless entertainment value- if you watch the entire show on mute and without subtitles- and Shiro is a cool character, but that's about where the positives end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nDark, creepy premise with a ton of potential absolutely butchered by juvenile, all over the place, free of resolution execution. Not a full on abortion because Shiro is awesome and a small amount of mindless entertainment value, but objectively a really bad show that I definitely don't recommend.\\n\\n\r\n+Dark, unique premise with a lot of potential\\n\r\n+Shiro is unique and memorable\\n\r\n+Great intro song and sequence\\n\\n\r\n-Unbelievably juvenile and immature from top to bottom\\n\r\n-Atrocious writing\\n\r\n-Wimpy, unlikable main character\\n\r\n-Plot is all over the place and an overall mess\\n\r\n-Lack of resolution to many important plot elements\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 3\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 4",

            "content": "This is my first review I hope you like. Deadman wonderland was a interesting anime but with a lot of problems.First the story it is a simple story that gets way more complicated than it should be. The story is based on a kid who gets accused of murder which he didn't commit. So he is sent to a prison and has to survive so he can find the man who killed his friends. The problem is it gets wayyy to complicated it's just so annoying and sometimes kind of boring. But it does have a kind of cool idea so it's okay. But whatmakes the story work in this anime is the characters they are just amazing I really felt for Ganta and his predicament I also cared for the people he meets in the prison. The most memorable characters are hummingbird and crow they both are insane but have a reason to be insane they have interesting stories and I though the story should have involved them more. There are more characters later but those were the most memorable but I loved these characters. I have to say this and a lot of people will hate me but the artwork was horrible I hated the colors and it was to dark for my liking I prefer the opening I swear it was like somebody else they were colorfuland the song was so cool I never skip the opening. Overall I'll give this a 7 out of 10 it was a enjoyable anime that while it had problems it was good and like high school of the dead needs a second season to make it better",

            "content": "Allow me to start off by saying that the reason why I began to watch Deadman Wonderland was because of how amazing the manga adaptation was. Because I had set my expectations for this anime so high I was consequently pretty disappointed with its turnout. With that being said, let me jump straight into the review.\r\nStory(8) \r\nAs you may or may not know, Deadman Wonderland revolves around the main character Igarashi Ganta whom is framed after a mysterious character, later known to be the antagonist called the Red man, slaughters his entire class. He is unfairly charged for murder of his classmates just because heis the sole survivor and is sent to Japan's first privately owned prison, Deadman Wonderland. After this life changing experience, Ganta soon learns that he has gained an unbelievable ability that allows him to shoot his own blood (in the anime called \"branches of sin\"). Ganta uses his power to survive through the prison defeating other deadmen (other characters that can also use branch of sin) in brutal carnival corpses to one day hope to face the red man and gain his revenge. The story was something I really enjoyed about the series but because the anime is only 12 episodes long, it only contains the first arc (up to chapter 20 +/- in the manga). That being said, a lot of stuff was rushed in the anime making it not as great as it should have been. There are a lot of mysteries yet to be answered after the 12 episodes which hint a second season. But after seeing the first, you may not want to even see another season.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8)\\n\r\nI dont really have much to say about the art other than it wasn't too bad. It has a decent amount of blood and violence which honestly was all I really liked about the show itself (besides the story). The blood was gruesome and the colors blended nicely with the atmosphere. The characters were also drawn nicely so thats pretty much all there is to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7)\\n\r\nThe opening to the series fitted the anime very nicely. It did a very good job of setting the tone for the anime and gave you an early idea of the horror and psychological mental atmosphere the anime contains. I thought the voice acting was well done and the background music was fine throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(6)\\n\r\nOk so here is where the series begins to lose some major points. Let's start with the main character, Ganta. Ganta is just a pathetic, whiny, and weak character. Because the anime only had 12 episodes and had to rush everything, it didnt give the main character any time to grow. There was little to no character development and it was just hard to fall in love with the main character. Not to mention all the other characters in the anime had even less screen time. Deadman Wonderland had a good cast of characters with great potential but sadly none of it was shown. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment(7)\\n\r\nOverall, this was just another average anime series. I really do feel bad for all the manga fans of the series because this anime had a lot of great potential to be amazing. But hey, its only 12 episodes and if you enjoy blood and gore then it isnt really a bad choice to just kill the time.",

Its not often in anime that you get to experience such brutal and bloody up front action however Deadman Wonderland has certainly provided in that department. Not only does this show get down to the raw details of injuries and deaths, but provides some of the best tension and build ups of any show. In the first episode, we experience the shocking massacre upon Igarashi Ganta and his class mates, however the initial sighting of the 'Red Man'builds a mystery aura and questions around the character which is later subtly solved to the viewers, however kept out of reach of the characters of the show. This for me was an agonizing experience to know more than the characters and anticipate the worst, however this also provided a certain level of adrenaline to the show, and for me, solidified it as one of the greatest short running animes around today.",

            "content": "When Toonami was back and on Adult Swim, my childhood dreams exploded with happiness again. Now that is getting better (they picked the rights for Sym-Bionic Titans now!!), I decided to pay my respect to Toonami by reviewing Deadman Wonderland. Based on the manga by the writer of Eureka Seven, the anime adaptation of Deadman Wonderland is a loose adaptation of it's source material, just like FMA 2003 series and was released as part of the Toonami block but already ended since it's only 12 episodes. I already saw the whole series and I even bought the complete series on DVD, I find this showto be my fun guilty pleasure but with some flaws of course.\\n\\n\r\nDeadman Wonderland takes place in Japan where 10 years ago, an earthquake shattered half of Japan's cities into the ocean and that event was named as The Red Hole, as we see a student named Ganta Igarashi, who has a normal life and has great friends. Then fate takes a turn for the worst when a mysterious man in red appears out of thin air and kills the whole class, leaving Ganta as the only survivor. When he wakes up at the hospital, he's been charged and framed  for all the murders, then Ganta gets sentenced to death and they send him off to Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme park like prison where tourists enjoy cruel and sadistic games that involves around prisoners forced to survive these gruesome games to win Cast Points, which is the currency for Deadman's own economy system. On the prison, he meets a mysterious girl named Shiro, who knows Ganta for a reason and knows everything about Ganta's childhood than he does. Later on, he discovers that he has the power to use his blood as a weapon known as \"Branch of Sin\" and now he must survive the deadly prison in order to find the one who killed the classmates and uncover the dark secrets behind this prison.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very interesting but it offers little answers to all the questions that keeps popping up in each episodes. Like what is the connection between Ganta and Shiro or better yet, what the hell triggered the earthquake to glow red? It's a shame cause the concept for the show is really neat and it offers some interesting themes like society's thirst and hunger for human violence and the corruption of the justice system but instead, it focuses a little too much on the violence and gore. Don't get me wrong, i like violence and fun gore in movies, shows and anime (I'm a gore hound fan), but I also like that the writers can focus on story and character development as well cause I want to know more about the world that a certain film or anime takes place and while Deadman Wonderland does a decent job on introducing the world and it's characters, it falls short and while it doesn't hurt the experience that much, I wish they could expand the world a bit bigger with more episodes instead of 12 and that's my main problem with it: It's only 12 episodes and since the manga has a LOT of story, just 12 episodes isn't enough to end the series. Why they didn't go with 51 episodes just like FMA 2003 series did is beyond my reach.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Deadman Wonderland range between normal to fucked up and to put it simple, they're awesome. Ganta is the normal kid stuck in a complicated mess that was blamed on him and therefore, having his life sentenced to rot in a hellhole like this and even with his Branch of Sin, he is still weak cause he is a child and he's afraid to die despite having such awesome power but keeps moving on to fight for his freedom and exposing the secrets of the prison. Shiro is like the mystery girl. On the outside, she looks and acts as a fun friend to Ganta and in occasions, she helps Ganta in situations that he can't handle but in later episodes, we get to see her real side and there's an episode where it reveals that Shiro is something more dangerous that we could have ever imagined. There other crazy characters like Senji, Tamaki and Toto but the less I say about it the better. The action and violence in Deadman Wonderland is brutal and twisted. Limbs get blown to pieces, characters go AWOL for carnage and little girls transformed from good hearted people to twisted little fucks that wants your ass punished, It's pure insanity but with a twist of fun to it. Something about using blood as your weapon against your enemies just sounds and looks cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Manglobe (Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy) is stunning. The art is luxurious and grand just like the park itself with rich color palette, amazingly detailed background art and top notch character models that each has a neat style on their own. The music by NARASAKI is awesome, kinda like a mix of dark techno rock and industrial music that fits the shows dark tone perfectly and it has it music orchestrated moments but the overall music package is excellent. The dub by Funimation is a big surprise for me just because it's so damn good. Like Greg Ayres, a veteran voice actor who's 43 years old voicing a 14 year old boy and he nails the voice of a 14 year old boy and it's incredible to hear it. That is until I found his record of voice performances and just recently found out that he ALSO voiced a young boy protagonist in Oh-Edo Rocket! Wow, he's damn good. Monica Riel as Shiro was also great and yes at times, she sounds like Stocking cause she voiced Stocking in the anime Panty And Stocking, she does get gradually better in the later episodes delivering the lines in a very chilling kind of way. Leah Clark was a badass in her role as Mitsuki. The scene where the character taunts Ganta like a bitch is probably one of my favorite moments to see her performance go nuts and it's a thrill, you just gotta listen to the dub cause it's very rewarding to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story could have been better if it was expanded to more episodes instead of only 12 episodes, Deadman Wonderland still offers fun thrilling moments of gore and violence while providing a strange but interesting world where a prison is a tourists entertainment park for audiences to enjoy blood splattering goodness and it offers just that: A fun and twisted gory mess of a show. It will be a while to possibly get a season 2 for this show cause it has potential for the story to expand even further instead of leaving unanswered questions behind, but we have to wait and see if it will happen someday. For now, Sit back and enjoy the wonderment of death for your enjoyment.",

            "content": "Let's preface this by saying one thing:  the story may very well be solid and fulfilling if completed in further season (since the manga is still running as I write this).  There are far too many characters in this show for 12 episodes.  The dear friends Ganta spends the entire series grieving are ridiculously underdeveloped.  For this reason, every time he makes a big deal of their loss, I am disconnected from the emotional state of our protagonist.  The underdevelopment doesn't stop with Ganta's late friends.  In fact Shiro, the mysterious C2-esque character whom befriends our Ganta is themost developed character other than Ganta himself.  Every time a character of interest in a particular episode is about to reach the climax of their involvement in the series, the anime gives a brief couple minute insight into their past, which does almost nothing to build a connection with these characters at that point.  Do you want to know more about the cause of the Deadman virus?  The director and promoter?  Shiro's alter-ego?  Other Deadmen?  THAT'S TOO DAMN BAD!!!!  Do you like Yoh?  Well that sucks because he disappears from the story for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, 12 episodes was far too short to develop the amount of story that they tried to do.  If the show fails to return for another season and really follow it to the end, it'll doubtless be because it's first season should have been twice as long for the same amount of story.\\n\\n\r\nI watched in English and always enjoy Greg Ayres's work.  The music was solid, though the ending wasn't very fitting.  And the artwork was simply sub-par for anything made since 2000, more so for 2011.",
