            "content": "Somehow the high expectations I had awaiting the sequel to a fantastic series were not fulfilled. Ryuusei No Gemini isn\u2019t exactly a sequel to Kuro no Keiyakusha, but more like a separate arc in itself. It would be unfair to compare both of them as they vary in their style and storyline. For starters, the series are not bi-episodic; instead revolve around a single storyline involving a Eurasian female protagonist. Hei\u2019s involvement through the series although significant, has not really been up to what it ought to be.  \r\nStoryline: 7/10\r\nSuou Pavlichenko is a 13 year Eurasian girl whose life suddenly changes on a fatefulday when she meets up with Hei. Involved in the mess of politics and war between the contractors, she seeks out on her own quest to find her missing twin, Shion. Alongside her is Hei, a drunk bastard who completely lacks the mannerism and politeness he once had. The personality change might have been necessary in this series as it made things a bit interesting, but it didn\u2019t seem all that good seeing him like that. The storyline, in its individuality served to be interesting though. The protagonist goes through a lot of ordeals throughout her journey. The series also has some graphic and violent killings which made it a little gory at times. The birth and evolution of the contractors was something we had vaguely seen in Kuro no Keiyakusha. The involvement of many groups (CIA, FSB, MI6 and Section 3) could have made for better viewing had they had more air time. They left it a bit incomplete and it felt as if these names were only included to attract attention without proper motive behind it. Also the \u201cSyndicate\u201d that pretty much ruled in Kuro no Keiyakusha was nowhere to be seen, again a disappointment as the whole mysteriousness behind them suddenly disappeared. Altogether though, despite its shortcomings it was somehow good how it ended up being. I guess it may be due to the protagonists\u2019 whole journey from havoc to happiness. As for the name \u201cGemini of the Meteor\u201d, it wasn\u2019t nearly as important to be kept in the title IMO. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterization: 7/10\\n\r\nRyuusei No Gemini had a plethora of characters which made it quite an entertaining prospect to watch. Starting off with Suou, a determined and strong girl entwined between living a life as a human or a contractor. It was touching to see the ordeals she and her school friends went through. Much like a supporting character, July was an example of some nice character development, and his relation with Suou was charming to watch. Hei\u2019s laid-back sake drinking attitude failed to impress me the slightest. And the fact that he was not able to showcase his powers during most of the series made it lamer for me. The agents of Section 3 were pretty good, namely Hizaki and Genma. Hizaki\u2019s remuneration involved kissing someone after the usage of her power added to the humor. Madam Oreille was yet promising character shown but somehow failed to make much of an impact in the Anime. Lot of interesting characters I would say. But somehow they were cramped up in a short series which somehow failed them I believe. They should have been given more time for their characters to be known properly rather than just through some cameo roles.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe original characters were already pretty awesome in how they were made. The new characters were also very nicely put out. From the Russians to the CIA to the Japanese characters, all looked very original. Also the new characters gave the storyline a refreshing experience. The fights were well coordinated and typically good to watch. Hei\u2019s new look was intriguing; Suou\u2019s character was pretty nicely done too. The agents looked good and the whole background of the Anime from Russia to Tokyo was beautiful. The characters are all very nicely drawn and the animation stands out to be pretty good as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nSound was another good factor for Ryuusei No Gemini. The OP was a treat to the ears. I particularly liked it. The voices of the characters were also very good. Suou sounded very sweet whenever she used to shout \u201cTanya\u201d. As there was a mixture of cultures, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how these voices correlate in the dubs that will be out later on. The ED was average I would say. The best thing however would be the background score during the fights. The whole beat-box thing or whatever that was being played surely pepped up the interest to watch. I loved it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nSeeing this series individually without comparing to the previous one and you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s actually good. Although not as epic as Kuro no Keiyakusha, Ryuusei No Gemini offers an entertaining experience with some interesting character portrayals. Combined with good artwork and sound, it is a definite recommendation. Just don\u2019t try and compare it with the first season and you\u2019ll definitely like it. \\n",

            "content": "I had a rather a hard time wrapping my head around the thought process taken up by the scriptwriters of this show. They had an almost infinite pool of ideas to work with, from the origin story and reasoning behind the Hell's Gate manifestation to endless detours that could have been taken up using the Contractors and Dolls as parables for sociological issues plaguing current society; the possibilities were endless. It seemed that with all the mysterious themes being left in a shroud of ambiguity and the multifaceted approaches to tackling them just on the cusp of being explored, any route could have been takenthat would have resulted in a decent sequel. Taking a shot in the dark with any one of these ideas should have yielded something worthwhile. But for reasons beyond comprehension, instead of trying to provide a solid answer to its mysteries or even using it to flesh out its world's lore, they threw that all away. And for what you may ask? Well, lolis, forced comedy, talking squirrels, character resets, raging alcoholics and a sleuth of more idiotic plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nStill wondering why and how the Heaven/Hell Gates appeared? Still wondering why they brought on an augmented sky that warped into the new one? Still wondering why contractors and dolls became a product of this? Still wondering why their lives are correlated with fallen stars? Still wondering what the motivation of the syndicate was? Still trying to decipher this show's bullshit?... Well, join the club. In this second season, the writers said \"fuck it\" once again, as they followed up the events of the first by managing to create something that felt terribly dated from the moment it rolled off the assembly line. It's a husk of the show's former self in every regard. The story, despite being more streamlined this time around, was still very uneventful. All it does was drag us along to a nonsense-filled finale that will likely leave all its mysteries and hackneyed bullshit permanently unanswered. It's the kind of narrative structure when the intent felt like reverse-engineering gone wrong. This is studio Bones after all. A studio that's become infamous for thrusting their own concepts up their asses. \\n\\n\r\nThe 1st season of DTB went from passable action romp to inflated pseudo-concepts by the final stretch of it. And as if that wasn't enough, now it felt like the staff gave up on having decent coherency among its pseudo-thematic jargon and settled for whatever came to mind instead. So this time around, even the pseudo-concepts don't make sense. Like a rough draft of a script passed along a circle of \"fuck its\" and shoulder shrugs, as they rake in the money, tossing what little ideas they had towards the finished product without so much as batting an eye. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of tossing shit together, the art seemed to have become a victim of complacency as well. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know how this is possible, but with fewer episodes to worry about and more years to perfect the art style, the 2nd season felt like it brought no visual improvements to the table. By a side by side comparison, very little was made better, instead, a 2-year gap in its production cycle seemed to have left it in a state of stagnation. It's like the animator team made it back in '07 and just let it gather up dust until it was time to release it. And when placed against other titles made in the same year, it just pales in comparison. And this isn't to say that studio Bones couldn't do any better. They've already proven that they could improve their visual and animation efforts as time goes on. Just looking at the visual output between Eureka Seven's 1st and 2nd season shows that. So seeing how little they cared about improving their craft for DTB's sequel felt like a cheap blow. It's a mediocre patch-job that doesn't deserve any credit whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while I can't offer it much credit, an aspect of this season that might register with some was the new choice of music. \\n\\n\r\nThe great jazz/blues fusion soundtrack of season one took a backseat to a more contemporary House-electronic sound. It's not a bad soundtrack but when compared to the prequel's, it feels out of place. It inadvertently strips the show of its familiar charm and alienates it further from its predecessor. The neo-noir backdrop feels out of place when the smoky croon of a Jazz track is replaced by what's effectively a rave-party anthem. It simply sucks the atmosphere out and replaces it with something more \"in the now\" as opposed to the timeless feeling. Since musical taste is subjective, I won't harp on it any further and leave you to decide where you stand on it. \\n\\n\r\nBut what isn't a decision that needs much debating over was the new cast. \\n\\n\r\nWith fewer contractors, more people characters in their place, there's still no decent characterization to be found. They made a big deal about contractors having no irrational emotion in season one but there's very little differentiating them from other people when they all remain one-note. Also, that sense of maturity that the first season carried for its characters was thrown out the window and replaced with bombastically over-the-top eccentricities. This causes a HUGE tonal shift in how the show is presented and perceived. Similarly to what the switch in musical tones did, this too was a decision that watered down the poignancy that occasionally flicked through in season one. Now, everything was glaringly carefree. They even changed the classy cat to a flying squirrel. LIKE SERIOUSLY? FUCK YOU DTB!\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue comes with Suou, our new protagonist. She takes up more screen time than necessary and is only good for two things: being an inconsistent character that flip-flops from one tonal speed to the other, or loli fanservice. And if that wasn't bad enough, she was degraded to becoming a contrived plot-device halfway through the series.\\n\r\nHei isn't even the same badass we use to love. The writers added over-bloated angst to his characteristics and made a man who was already lacking in emotional range, to begin with, to be presented as a complete nut job of polarizing extremes. In place of the calm and collected demeanor he once had, we're instead given a raging alcoholic who slaps little girls in his spare time and drinks himself silly when he felt like it. Of course, he still kills contractors like the cool electric Batman we grew to love but his conflicting characteristics with his supposed \"emotionless state\" makes it harder for anyone to care for him anymore. He simply became a puppet of the poorly written screenplay, being inserted whenever the writers saw fit.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the worst replacement was that of the side characters introduced for this season. The cast included a tranny bartender with a lolicon obsessed son, Misaki the walking plot-device, antagonists that border on luny, and a sleuth of people that aren't worth the mention. Needless to say, the cast here was far inferior to the show's previous standards. They served no other purpose than being aggravating tagalongs that no one ever wanted. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really, this season itself was just that: an aggravating tagalong that we're forced to accept as a continuation. Instead of getting a decent successor, we're instead given a half-baked effort that couldn't stand on its own. Bones dropped the ball in every conceivable level. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nDisappointment... I found nothing here but unsubstantial fights and cheap attempts at fanservice. This is NOT how you do a sequel to a neo-noir action romp. It doesn't even work as pure schlock entertainment. Apparently, even Pizza Hut said \"oh hell no, fuck that\" since they too were nowhere to be found, wanting nothing to do with this uninspired continuation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are bad sequels then there's DTB's sequel. A sequel that literally scrubbed the show of its previous identity and STILL didn't answer any questions. As it is now, I can only recommend this to completionists. An underwhelming mess that sullied what little credentials the series was desperately clinging onto.",

            "content": "I am \"a bit disappointed\" in the rest of the reviews here, namely that so many of them reflect that this season was dreadful, yet hedge that to \"being a bit disappointed\" with it. This season was balls to the walls, shamelessly awful.\r\nThe defining feature of the entire series: how they manage to draw every character with dead eyes throughout the series, yet expect us to enjoy ourselves. The defining scene: horrible side character creation 1, dreadlock kids, sobbing and venting to horrible side character creation 2, his crossdressing dad, culminating in being more likely to make you laugh than cry as he sobs andwhines into his cake. The defining question: how they expect us to believe Hei can still kick everyone in the world's ass with no powers and reduced to \"living the good life\" (that one was a minor meme joke, do not worry if you did not get it).\\n\\n\r\nThere are already other reviews that detail exactly how the plot is (stupidly) aimless and bereft of basically most of the useful details it should have, so I am not going to rehash that. What I will touch on is how the plot is awful with the characters it uses: it introduces lots of new characters, all poor creations that are impossible to care about; it has a lot of short, impossibly one sided battles; it gives random annoying flashes to some apparently crazy event involving Yin, with absolutely no real explanation as to why they happened; it has random, annoying flashes to these blonde twin girls, who speak in tittery, annoying voices and \"say mysterious things\" i.e. nonsensoleum; it has cop lady chasing desperately after Li, despite the fact that she has no real insight to anything in this series, never does anything, and just wastes our time; it has former cool cat Mao back as an awful, ridiculously (poorly drawn) cartoony flying squirrel like creature (they called it a mamonga or something, whatever). Get the picture?\\n\\n\r\nThis version of Darker Than Black just tries to establish how SAD and AWFUL everything is for everyone, and it definitely does a good job of showing viewers an awful time. Of course, just like people are unwilling to be objective about Code Geass 2 since they loved Code Geass 1, similarly no one will be objective about Darker Than Black 2 since they loved Darker Than Black 1. I cannot wait until the OVAs come out to \"connect the seasons\" and people act like it redeems all the flaws.",

            "content": "I'm not really one for writing long reviews of anime I've watched, but I felt that I had to say something about this one.\r\nDarker than BLACK - Kuro no Keiyakusha had a dark storyline and characters with very distinct traits, especially Hei. Darker than BLACK - Ryuusei no Gemini, the sequel seemed to forget these.\r\n*Mild Spoilers Ahead*\r\nThis anime would have been great if it was a stand-alone, but it was unlucky enough to have expectations to live up to its predecessor. The main character, Hei - once a calm, collected, cold-blooded killer now stars as an umkempt drunk who abducts small children and beats them.Mao, the cat who had previously died, is now a flying squirrel and stays as one even though he had many oppertunities to possess a cat. Yin has turned from a near-silent doll into a... wait, nothing at all was explained about that - but she made a lot of contractors commit suicide so that she could... that wasn't explained either. Kuro no Keiyakusha kept the plot a complete mystery until the end, but Ryuusei no Gemini didn't really explain it at all.\\n\\n\r\nSo, our old friends from Kuro no Keiyakusha have had their characters changed drastically, but what about the new faces? Maybe they will make up for this? A loli with a rifle; a pervert who can turn into a golem and a lesbian with a lightsaber... personally, I didn't find them very original to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nEnough of bashing the characters though - onto the story. The series was half the length of Kuro no Keiyakusha, and the two episode long arcs were discarded. I was dissapointed by this since too many things weren't explained, even for Darker than BLACK. The last episode really needed to be two, maybe three, episodes and again explain a few more things. It was a cliffhanger disguised as closure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a decent anime. If you do plan on watching it, have Kuro no Keiyakusha ready to watch again so that you can get rid of the bad aftertaste - Ryuusei no Gemini doesn't live up to the original and makes you think less of some once great characters.",

            "content": "Oh, Bones, Thank goodness you started DTB in the first place.\r\nTHIS IS A REVIEW ON THE FIRST COUPLE EPISODES, AND I WILL UPDATE IT WHEN MORE EPISODES COME OUT.\r\nFirst off, DTB2 is NOT the original DTB. Bones have made some pretty big changes between seasons: setting main cast of characters, story, etc. It's better to look at DTB2 as more of a spin-off of the original DTB: if you liked season 1 because of the idea of the series (contractors et all), then you will most likely enjoy season 2. Now, onto the review:\r\nStory\r\nIt is VERY different from the original DTB. First of all, itseems to be one continuous narrative instead of two-episode mini-arcs like in the original season. I happened to like the mini-arc format, but BONES obviously knows what they're doing: the story is as rich and detailed as ever. Like season 1, the story is centered around contractors, humans who have super powers but need a remuneration afterward. Instead of focussing on Hei, most of the spotlight is on Suou, a Russian/Japanese girl whose brother is a contractor.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nSome very big changes since season 1. Most notably is Hei's appearance: his mask is scratched, his coat is tattered, and he hasn't shaved in a while. In addition, the animation is sleeker, and the contractor's abilities are truly awe-worthy.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nLike the first season, the sound is superb. The OP is definitely different, but in a good way, and the EP is one of my all time favorites.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nHei takes a minor role so far in the series, which I actually prefer due to the ability to see more stellar characters. Suou is the focus of the series, and she is one of my favorite characters in all DtB, including 1st season Hei and Huang.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nLike always, DtB never ceases to surprise me. I absolutely love the new characters and contractors already introduced, and I expect there to be more as the series progresses. July, the MI6 doll in the first season, also seems to have a larger role than in season 1, which I think is awesome. And, like the first season, it is really fun to piece together each contractor's power and remuneration.",

            "content": "Before you read this one, I would let you know that I am just a newbie when it comes to anime and I am not totally good when it comes to anime terms and words. Also I am not a good reviewer like the others in here. But, still I like to write a review for this and I will deliver it in a simple way based on my own opinions.\r\nWhats new in this series? A lot of changes. Yes a lot of changes, that would includes the characters, appearances, mood, settings and the story itself.\r\nWhat word might really fit in this series is theword \"Explore\" yes, DTB-RNG really explored a lot in many aspects to make this series really great. Though it's just disappointing because it only has 12 episodes and there is no Season III for it unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, here's my score for this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 : This is quite different from the first season in terms of what is currently happening in the story, also you would never know that it is the continuation of the first season if you don't read the synopsis. In fact I can say that Ryuusei no Gemini can stand alone without watching the first season and probably reading the synopsis of this season is enough to understand what happened from the start. What I mean in here is DTB-RNG made some changes being able for the 2nd season to stand alone. But of course it has the linkage between season I and II which is really great, though there are some aspect of the stories that until now really intrigued me.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that one of the greatest investment regarding in the story for this series is by adding some new faces on the story and where does the story takes place.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the abilities of each contractor are really fun to watch this time since the other abilities from the previous season are common.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 : Character's art were delivered very clear and they were matching according to their characteristics & statistics. While some of the scenes out there are not properly delivered when it comes to art.\\n\r\nBut the X-factor of this when it comes to art is the adaptation of the country's dressing style and including it's culture and that's really impressive.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 : For a music lover like me, well this one is the 2nd highest basis for my criteria. Well, I can actually say that DTB-I has a great quality when it comes to SFX and other sound elements but, it's kinda lazy for ears. But, on this series it has been improved more than the previous season. Especially, if you will notice there are a lot of changes with Hei, not only with the personality but, also on how does he speak and reacts in different circumstances. Opening theme of Ryuusei No Gemini is really great, the music is titled \"Tsukiakari No Michishirube\" and it was performed by Stereopony a pop rock band in Okinawa that is already disbanded on 2012. What the most unique in here is Suou I like the way on how she deliver her words and reactions, perfectly matched with her characteristics and also the accent regards on their culture. One more thing regarding with the sound is the beat-box at the point where Hei showed himself and I was really surprised with his appearance, made me think \"Oh wow This is really cool!!\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10 : I am intrigue with the character changes in here especially Hei, a food lover that can probably always win with boodle fights turns into a drunk old looking guy also his polite personality disappeared and turns into a girl slapping guy with a black heart. While at some good point still, Suou Pavlichenko is the one that is totally unique and really, really good in the series. Character development for Suou is really good the way she speaks and the way she acts.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 : I can't say that I totally enjoyed this one especially it is all about syndicates and crimes so I am expecting a lot of actions unfortunately something happened. Since there is an unexpected event that can be added to the thrill that you'll need to find out to watch this series. Other than that, regarding in all aspects well I can say that you can really enjoy this one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 : I'd rather say that I really enjoy this series and you might ending up wanting for this one to have a Season III.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNote : This review never intend to please everybody so if you want to criticize this one you are actually welcome to do it and let me hear some words from you as I want to learn more.",

            "content": "Please note that I just finished watching the last episode minutes ago and I'm kinda trying to sort my thoughts out writing this.\r\nDarker than Black was never known to be the type of anime that explains everything, many things were and are left in the dark adding a whole layer of mystery to this fantastic world. Darker than Black 2 continues in this fashion but with quite a different approach. While the first season was mostly episodic, consisting of various story arcs with two episodes each, the second season is follows a continues storyline that is however developed quite well in my opinion. \r\nIt mightseem a little bit cheese and typical in the beginning, but the story soon begins to ravel up and develop a bit of a darker feeling and the missing elements tying up to season 1 are also implemented, without however spellings things out to the viewer. There are always a few plot twists or single episodes that seem quite silly or pointless, but the greater story develops quite well. It is however not resolved completely and will likely continue into a third season in a similar fashion. I wonder whether we can ever hope for a complete unraveling of mystery, though I doubt it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likeably and only partially reoccurring from the first season. The new characters might seem a bit unfitting at first but I like the way they develop. There is also a huge amount of character death, but in a different way compared to its prequel. The music and art continue in the fashion of season 1, the greatest controversy probably being the new opening and ending, though I personally liked them. The change of flavor is noticeable but not off putting.\\n\\n\r\nAlso despite being a sequel it will probably also be very watchable for people who haven't seen the first season. The feeling is very similar but the direct links, despite being present, aren't major to the story.\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black 2's greatest plus is probably it's enjoyment factor. The story, despite being interesting, is still not all that original and often a bit silly, but the atmosphere of the anime just keeps you glued to the back of your seat wanting to know what happens next and most importantly how it will play out. It may not be a historical masterpiece but is definitely worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, jump in and watch it. You might even like it if you didn't like the first season to the different approach. I highly suggest giving it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10.",

            "content": "Compared to the first season this is pretty bad. Even though I watched episode after episode hoping for something to happen all I ended up with was frustration.\r\nKiko in the first season stuck out enough and now there is the cross-dressing father and his idiot son plus strange characters appearing without barely an explanation. Sure DTB is a series where you have to think about the hows and whys but we are still pretty much left without a hint about contractors and dolls.\r\nThere is a story to it but it feels lacking provably to the way it evolves. There definitely are good parts in itand plenty of them but there is also lots of stuff that could of had been done better. The \"rifle materialization\" scene with Suou is repetitive and feels like it's being used to waste time. Although Hei's ability is not what it used to be if feels like he is not even himself and somehow is very fortunate of the outcomes of his problems.\\n\r\nA least some characters have their own uniqueness to them and we learn a few things about them and their history.\\n\r\nIt's not terrible by its self, but it is when you are expecting something along the lines of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully Darker than BLACK - Kuro no Keiyakusha Gaiden will somehow make up for it.",

            "content": "DtB: Ryuusei no Gemini\r\nThis ''sequel'' is not what i expected at all and i don't want to put any effort on reviewing this to be honest, is bad as a direct sequel, the direction they took with this was awful, just why? and i'm being generous giving it a 6.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is a let down, one may think that it will follow the story of Hei and Yin but forget about that, that comes to a second plane now, the main plot for this is about a girl named Suou who has a twin and wants to go to Tokyo to see his twin brotheragain, she will be accompanied by now an alcoholic and woman beating Hei, who loses his powers and are given to Suou because of a medallion she carries with her, she becomes a contractor with emotions and through her journey with Hei, and the comeback of two characters July and Mao in the form of squirell will find out that she's different because of his brother and also will fall in love with Hei like every girl; The story may be unexpected at times but it's because the story is very irregular, sometimes the story feels it's good but that story was ruined to be a mediocre one, it could be worse tho and it is with that awful ending, they used Yin to make that stupid ending, a ''happy'' open ending by the way with little explanation on to why Hei and Yin story ended abruptly, one question raised WTF was that? Suou's journey seems pretty useless at the end and so was Hei's journey with her and his own to kill Yin (something weird because in the OVA he wanted to save her) then another gate appears but why and how? and much more content to another sequel that would fail if they relesed it, i'm glad they didn't considering this mediocre story.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style was the best (with the sound) because it's almost the same as the first season, the animation was a little better with more smooth fight scenes so in general it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe other best thing from the anime is the music but with again one song that didn't match the situation the rest of them were on point and really enjoyable; The VA did a great job again the OP song was meh but the ED song was good, overall the sound was very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters were fine, but i didn't like the weird change Hei had, and i didn't liked Mao as a squirell even tho he was funny.\\n\r\n-Hei became an alcoholic woman beating who somehow was surprised when he heard Yin was alive and if you go by the OVAs he already knew because the CIA guy told him and he finally quits drinking (even tho i thought he would quit it since the beginning because of the last OVA ep.) and starts to eat like before and slowly comes back to be the old Hei but not as likeable as before, but yeah why make him like that in the first place, he always wanted to save Yin not kill her and at the end he becomes Yei? Hin? that's another WTF? BS.\\n\r\n-Suou is kind of interesting but at the same time not, she feels more like a doll rather than a contractor and at the end is like it doesn't matter, it was another BS.\\n\r\n-Mao was again the comedy relief and finally we get to know his past and how he ended up like an animal forever.\\n\r\n-July is the Yin of this season, everyone needs a doll right? he was reacting to Suou not in the same way as Yin emotions but he was somewhere close there with Suou.\\n\r\n-Yin is forgotten and used for that stupid ending and when they both finally meet again there's no big dialogue between the two just a few words and that's it.\\n\r\n-Kirihara Misaki appears again with a different role and wanting to chase again Hei but not dialogue with them neither, i he was a douche with her when they met again not like in first season when he was nice with her.\\n\r\nAnd another two characters appears again to help Suou in a case the private detective Gai Kurasawa and the pink haired girl Kiko and of course the twin brother of Suou Shion whose role was not as big as you may think but anyways the characters were fine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime at one point, maybe because Hei was there, even tho he changed, i got a fair enjoyment somehow, i don't know why, i really had enjoyment with the comedy but this sequel it's not worth watching.",

            "content": "If \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d was a band than their follow up album would be considered selling out. \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d is nothing like the first season coming across as an entirely different anime. It panders to the audience, the action is over the top, the soundtrack is less memorable, and the direction of the entire anime is different. Not all the pieces connect properly, but it is a decent follow up to the first season of \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d. It never reaches the same heights of season one, but it does have its own strength that makes it worth watching including an ending that isbest described as unsatisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nOh, there will be minor spoilers. While not intentional and kept vague as possible, it takes place a whole year after the first season of Darker Than Black and Darker Than Black: Gaiden four part OVA. It\u2019s recommended you avoid this review for that purpose alone. I suggest seeing the previous season and OVA\u2019s before reading or entirely ignoring this review. \\n\\n\r\nGood: Different direction and different strengths\\n\\n\r\n\u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d from the first episode tells an overarching story. Focusing on two leading characters, Hei and Suou Pavlichenko, each with their own unique storylines. Hei story arc deals with finding Yin while Suou storyline deals more with finding answers about her family and her past. These two characters have different goals allowing the core of the main story to progress smoothly. Providing a different viewpoint from their adventure. How Hei goes about achieving his goal is vastly different to how Suou goes about reaching her goals. Suou goal is more personal vocalizing her thoughts in any situation without hesitation. Understanding how she feels throughout the entire season is plain as day. Hei is more tormented and defeated with his storyline in vein of a redemption story. Attempting to finish what he originally couldn\u2019t because of his emotions. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season of \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d went for capturing noir and \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d goes for capturing the action genre. Accomplishing this by having a major revelation or action scene occur in every episode attempting to imitate the effect of a cliffhanger to encourage the viewer to see the next episode immediately. There is rarely ever a moment of safety for the heroes wherever they go. Someone is always behind them chasing them down. Another added inclusion from the change in direction is the material is allowed to show more emotion. Characters in general across more lively in the series without the usual restrictions emotionless contractors are written in.\\n\\n\r\nOne noticeable difference from \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d from the rest of the series is the comedy plays a bigger role. Jokes are thrown into every episodes instead of spread out through out the series on special occasions. Its favorite kind of jokes involves everyone confusing Suou for her twin brother. There\u2019s a recurring gag involving Genma Shizume making flirtatious remark at Suou unknowing to him she\u2019s actually a girl. It\u2019s a funny recurring joke since it doesn\u2019t reuse it frequently and offers other forms of humor to keep it varied. Mostly from Mao who despite a change of appearance hasn\u2019t lost his ability for spouting sarcastic remarks. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is larger in \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d getting the short end in characterization. This is very noticeable from the first episode when it decides to bring in characters from the first season only sideline them. Within the first episode, a specific character that had a big role in season one gets killed off quickly. The supporting characters that do influence the story generally don\u2019t have much of a screen presence. Little characterization is mostly to blame resulting in a support cast to be only known for a single a trait. Mina Hazuki is a badass when she\u2019s in combat, but the most memorable aspect about her personality is she\u2019s a lesbian. Genma Shizume is a comedic pervert whose terrible at his job. There is not a single scene when he\u2019s shown doing his competently on the field. Another character is Norio who first appears in episode four with a storyline hinting he would play some important role in the story. Norio is forgotten about past episode six and his time in the series is superfluous in the main story. Some other characters fade into the background because they operate behind the scenes, but never is their influence felt. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is a major drawback this season because Suou whole motivation is to find answers. Her arc takes as much time to tell as Hei's does. This gives \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d a whole different direction of solving mysteries so leaving unanswered questions is a negative. By the time episode twelve finishes despite every bit of information being told to the viewer what happened it won\u2019t turn out satisfactory. Hei is the only character who could serve as the backbone for the entire anime series from beginning to end. Details of what occurred to Hei is left in the open interpretation department which is more than a disappointment given at this point Hei is a strong three dimensional character. Leaving an open ending for Hei journey unlike the rest of the cast members makes it that much more unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nMixed: Good Leads, Unwhelming Supporting Cast\\n\\n\r\nHei in \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d is at his lowest point in the franchise. Gone is the carefree side of his personality coping with his inner depression with alcohol. He\u2019s frequently serious in nearly every scene which is a change of character for Hei. In general though, Hei doesn\u2019t get much added to him in terms of characterization. However, he does face new conflicts to overcome this season. Hei might not be the same person he was at the start of the franchise, but is still a well written character. He\u2019s smart in situations that require him to think on the spot to survive. Despite how he turned out he does is sympathetic towards other characters, but expresses it differently from before. \\n\\n\r\nMao goes from a wise cat to a flying squirrel who asides from giving some sarcastic remarks and comedic relief has his importance to the story minimize. No longer does Mao gather intel for Hei or his group and instead helps out the heroes directly in small ways. He\u2019s more active on screen sometime blocking people views or being some sort of distraction. Such moments don\u2019t appear often enough to change the fact his importance to the story is not what it use to be. In return, Mao does receive characterization when fans finally get to see how he looked in his human form. It might only last a single episode seeing his past human self for the first time is a treat for fans. \\n\\n\r\nSuou Pavlichenko is a red hair, 13 year old Russian girl photographer who becomes a sniper. She plays a major role in the story seeing everything in the world of contractors for the first time, but for any viewer following this anime series in order will already know everything Suou does not. Her character will be more relatable for anyone who has not seen the world of \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d at this point, but adds to seeing first hand the evolution of a human turning into a contractor. She\u2019s a decent character...Studio Bones thought otherwise in how she\u2019s used. In 11 out 12 episodes Suou appears naked at some point or appear in some scene that provides fanservice. Yeah, one entire episode out of twelve doesn\u2019t use Suou in some way to pander to its audience. To name a few instances in the first episode there is a (are they ever not) pointless shower scene, episode three she\u2019s in a cabin drying wet clothes only being cover by a blanket follow by interpreted bad position, in episode four there is Suou dancing which would be fine if it weren\u2019t how that moment was framed, in episode eight swimsuits, and can\u2019t forget the anti-tank rifle summoning sequence (in which Suou appears naked) is always shown in its entirety every time it gets summoned. These are a couple of examples of how the anime treats her which is honestly far worse than anything Hei ever does to Suou in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nLike mentioned earlier the supporting cast is larger and some get sidelined. Misaki Kirihara from season gets sideline whose involvement in the story is unneeded. Her role in this season is minimize uncovering a conspiracy behind the scene that doesn\u2019t do add much for the story. What ultimately ends up happening to her in the aftermath of the finale is far more relevant than anything she does before it ends. Due to the length of the anime the characters don\u2019t receive the needed attention to have their own arcs or be fleshed out beyond introduction. Which why the likes of Yoko Sawasaki, Genma Shizume, Mina Hazuki, and Michiru are kept very simplistic from start to finish. The only exceptions to this are Dr. Mikhail Pavlichenko and Shion Pavlichenko because they are connected to Suou storyline. Throughout the series, there are flashbacks that reveal important pieces of information fleshing them out from when the season begins. Once it\u2019s over, Dr. Mikhail and Shion have more to define them unlike the rest of the cast that remains the same. \\n\\n\r\nGood: Bones Studio Aces Their Animation \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by Bones Studio like the rest of the anime series. Animation in \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d allows Studio Bones to show off what they can do. Having a more diverse cast in age range compare to the rest of the series. There\u2019s a fair mix of children and adults where previous entries mostly had adult characters. As usual, all characters have unique designs that can be told apart easily even if all the characters hair color were the same. In movement it moves smoothly with no hiccups regardless what\u2019s on screen. Backgrounds once again are detailed, though this time mostly contained in industrialized cities. There\u2019s no environment that is unique to \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d specifically. However, it does claim the honor of having the best action sequences in the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes have flashy effect with over the top powers use in battles. There\u2019s no usage of 3D in these action scenes as Studio Bones spares no expense for them. Battles are flashy sporting particle effects of all kind from sparks when two melee weapons hitting each other, to an explosion with intense flames, to anti-tank rifle that pierces through concrete or metal, and whatever effects to its disposal. Episode three has a sequence where a stationed train is hit by another train causing train carts to start flying through the air. It does not use 3D in any frame of that sequence which looks great when seen. Unfortunately there isn\u2019t another sequence in the rest of the series that tops that spectacle, but the other action scenes aren\u2019t any less impressive because of it. Every action scene has a flashy effect unique to that specific action sequence. In one episode it has a character merging with a vehicle manipulating it for combat. Goofy sounding as that description is in execution it\u2019s actually creative while not being a one sided battle. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout my reviews for the \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d franchise I always suggested seeing the anime with English subtitles and this season is why. In the English dub, Suou dialogue receives the most alteration of any character changing the tone of several scenes becoming grating to listen too. Alison Viktorin who voices Suou delivers a solid performance, but some of her dialogue does her a disservice making her come across as a little brat. Another factor that prevents her performance from being decent is she doesn\u2019t sound like a thirteen year old. That would be easy to overlook, but she has a few scenes where she has to loudly vocalize her complaints. Due to the English script changes it varies from Suou coming across sympathetic or just wanting to see Hei hit her. As much Alison Viktorin is capable in the role playing off her cast member just fine, the English script gets across something else than originally intended.\\n\\n\r\nIn the Japanese cast Kana Hanazawa voices Suou who sounds more like a thirteen year old. Her performance is more subtle in vocalizing Suou\u2019s emotion. Unlike Alison Viktorin who voices the same character, Hanazawa comes across as sympathetic with her delivery of the dialogue. She makes Suou sympathetic and likable. The closer the anime gets to the ending the more range Kanazawa is allowed. Her chemistry with her co-stars is spot on especially when together Sawaki Ikuya and Hidenobu Kiuchi coming together naturally. \\n\\n\r\nHearing Kent Williams deep voice coming out of a small Momonga (fancy name for a Japanese dwarf flying squirrel) is quite odd. Like in season one, Kent Williams is spot on with his sarcastic remarks being the most hilarious in the English dub cast. Hearing such a small animal talk in such a deep sounding voice sticks out. In the Japanese cast, Sawaki Ikuya voice never becomes noticeable when playing the same character. While I prefer Kent Williams playing Mao in the series, Sawaki Ikuya has a voice that better blends into the character. Never does Ikuya voice become a distraction making it easier to become immerse with the character. \\n\\n\r\nAs usual (no surprise) regardless of who is heard both Hidenobu Kiuchi and Jason Liebrecht shine in their portrayal of Hei. The direction of the anime is different, but the changes does not affect how they portray their characters. Both of voice actors retain Hei characteristics managing to make the transition between seasons seem seamless. Creating a performance that works with the changes of the series. There\u2019re no hiccups in how they portray Hei. The supporting cast in both the Japanese and English dub cast play their characters in a straightforward manner. With more comedy, it\u2019s more difficult to distinguish any standout in the supporting cast. Doesn\u2019t really offer much range when half the cast has to deliver comedy. \\n\\n\r\nIf you had to choose between sub or dub I would recommend English sub for the entire franchise and English subtitles for this season. The Japanese cast performance are consistent throughout the entire anime franchise where the English dub stumbles in important areas as it goes on. There\u2019re also some script changes in the English dub that goes against what was originally intended to get across. The English dub isn\u2019t bad with Kent Williams and Jason Liebrecht reprising their roles they excel in portraying. Making the English worth alone for their performances, but they are the only aspects of the English dub that remain strong in every iteration. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack done compose by Yasushi Ishii this season which forgettable. Like in the four-part Gaiden OVA, the soundtrack is a mixture of rock tracks, techno, and lighter sounding tracks for the more personal moments in the series. None of the tracks stand out on their own without the accompany of visuals. Within the series, it works while simultaneously being forgettable. Instead of strengthening a scene, it just fades into the background. The opening theme \u201cTsukiakari no Michishirube\u201d by Stereopony is a pop/rock track. Optimistic lyrics  with Aimi Haraguni lack of conviction don\u2019t go hand in hand, but is a decent opening song that works fine for the intro. In spite how the series actually is, it\u2019s a great fit for the intro. Same goes with the ending track \u201cFrom Dusk Til Dawn\u201d by Abingdon Boys School. \u201cFrom Dusk Til Dawn\u201d is pop sounding using acoustic guitars and synthesized strings. It starts off soft going to the sounding more melodramatic when it ends. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: More entertaining, but not as good\\n\\n\r\nI was more entertained seeing \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d over the original season since it started with an overarching story and maintained it till completion. It also delivered on the action scenes all which never failed to be a feast for the eyes. However, it was entirely different in tone, pacing, and direction from what season one provided. Everything that made season one great was lost or downgraded in \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d. Season one characters get sideline, there was allot more pandering, contractors powers got over the top, and the ending wasn\u2019t entirely satisfactory. I wasn\u2019t expecting \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d to be the way it was, but at the same time I am not upset it did something different (ironically playing it safe) than rehashing itself. Instead of delivering something out of my expectations it deliver it exactly what I expected from it in the first place. For better and worse, it was still an enjoyable ride.\\n\\n\r\nAnime Series Overview:\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d is an anime series that has something different to offer in each iteration. Season one contains strong writing and great characters. Taking it sweet time before it develops it main cast, but a great first season all the way through. \u201cDarker than Black: Gaiden\u201d four-part OVA offers the best mixture of both season containing the strong writing of season one and the great action scenes of season two. It\u2019s also the most rushed with only four episodes to its story. \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d is pure entertainment that noticeably panders in order to reach a greater audience. Losing traits that made season one great and in return going in another route succeeding for different reasons. It\u2019s not the follow up one would expect the first season to receive, but has its own strength. I have to sound like a broken record at this point writing about this series multiple times in a single month. If you read all my reviews of this anime series or just this one thank you very much.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/3\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/3\\n\\n\r\nProduction Values: 2/3\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 1/1\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nDisappointment would be the defining word for this follow up season to \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d. It\u2019s nothing like the first season and all the characters from season one get sideline for a new cast most of which aren\u2019t developed the same degree of one-shot characters in the first season. It\u2019s not quite the follow up some fans might have wanted, but it\u2019s a decent anime through and through. All the characters story arcs get concluded, the action scenes are fast with great choreography, and ends the series on a positive note. Where Darker Than Black ended up with \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d will be varied when viewers reach the end, but the journey to get there was one thrilling adventure that\u2019s worth taking.\\n",

            "content": "I'm not even going to break this down because I'll spoil something. Also! While this is just as good as the last season, it is different. I cannot stress that enough, and for some it will be a deal breaker.\r\nEDIT: After complaints I decided to expand this review. I'll put out spoiler alerts if they come up.\r\nStory: Excellent, it seems to be a character driven story, and the characters are excellent. The problem is if you don't care for a certain character, then you don't care for the story, so you have to be invested in the story. That being said, somehow, even a characterthat I was annoyed with, just like the protagonist actually made my eyes tear up with the excellent direction, voice acting and overall execution.\\n\\n\r\nIn this story, there are special people called contractors. They're called that because they lack emotion, think logically for themselves, can use superpowers, but at a price. They might have to break a finger, or bake a cake. Hei is an interesting character that you'll care a lot more about later on, even though at first you think he's an absolute jerk, which he basically is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Also excellent, the scenes are even better than the first season which is a definite plus, although, I wasn't terribly fond of the CGI bugs. Whenever there's a fight, everything is fluid and drawn very well. There isn't any sort of exaggerated physics except in some close up deaths, which is more for a shock factor.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Excellent, I liked the English voice overs, although it should be noted that most of the time characters talk in monotone because they're contractors or they're trying to explain something in the same about of talking space as the Japanese version. Still, when something emotional happens, just like the last season, you can feel it in their voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Perfect. I cannot stress this enough, there is so much character development, even in one episode. The writers did an outstanding job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Perfect. I've watched it over and over again. I really would love a Season 3.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'm giving it 9/10 because while I absolutely love it and would rate it 10/10 personally, it is closer to a 9/10 simply because some people will find the story unsatisfying with how it ends.",

            "content": "Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor\r\n(JAP title: Ryuusei no Gemini)\r\nThe sequel to one of my all-time favorites\u2026 I went in with high expectations and I came out confused.\r\n[ 1 MINUTE REVIEW ]\r\nThis is the highly anticipated sequel to the critically acclaimed first season. It does not follow the usual two episode arc style, as in the first season. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it transforms into your more stereotypical shounen anime, which might appeal to many. Sadly, I am not one of them. Due to the complete shift in genre, Darker than Black, Gemini of the Meteor is no longer aslick Ocean\u2019s 11 sort of anime, but rather a more brutal and Contractor version of Karate Kid, with a pro Contractor showing a young one the ropes. The music and animation are on the same plane as last season. However the ending is a tad confusing even after watching the OVA. Those who were absolute devotees of the original DtB should watch it regardless of its transformation to know the fate of their beloved characters. Others keep away!\\n\\n\r\n[ 5 MINUTE REVIEW ]\\n\\n\r\nAlright, let me get one thing straight \u2013 This is not Darker than Black. Maybe technically it is, but in reality, it is not. This show would\u2019ve been better off being named just \u201cGemini of the Meteor\u201d. You can almost consider this anime as a completely new one, featuring Contractors and the cast of Darker than BLACK. If you\u2019re looking for the exact same thing you liked in the first season, then this show is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, let\u2019s gets started with the synopsis. It has been two years since Hei destroyed the Saturn System in Hell\u2019s Gate and a LOT of events has occurred after that and before the beginning of season two. To understand all the changes that took place, one has to watch the OVA. But, I recommend you watch the OVA after you\u2019re done with the second season. I\u2019ll give a brief description on what happens in the time gap without giving any spoilers. Yin is separated from Hei. Hei is a bearded drunkard who works for the CIA. Misaki is fired from her old job and hired in an organization called Section 3, which is made up of Contractors. Oh, and one last thing \u2013 Hei is no longer a Contractor. \\n\\n\r\nIn Dtb:GoM, you follow Suou, a Russian girl who speaks Japanese. I suppose that makes her a Eurasian, but whatever. Young Suou is a normal girl, who goes to school and lives with her father in the mountain. However, her brother is kept a secret from the world as he is a Contractor and in Russia, all Contractors must be enrolled in the army. One day, her life is turned upside down when her best friend turns into a Contractor and Hei appears at Suou\u2019s house. She is then chased by nearly eight contractors and the Soviet army, yet she manages to escape from them all. If every little girl can get past the Soviet army, I really don\u2019t know why they\u2019re called a superpower. Anyway, moving on, Hei and Suou unite and thus begins their journey to go to Japan. The pacing is overall, good, but if you start watching this season immediately after the previous one, you might find it a bit confusing as you would be used to the bi episodic arcs. GoM contains only 1 storyline, which spans 12 episodes. And this storyline does not involve any undercover work, womanizer Li or well-defined side characters. And this is why I said this season is nothing like the previous. But that is not to say it is a bad anime. In fact, it is very entertaining. Once you get over your initial disappointment, you will start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The plot is actually good and it has enough twists and turns to keep you at the edge of your seat. There are some moments when you honestly go \u201cWhoa, I did not see that coming\u2026\u201d and that is proof that the script is very strong. Although the second season was very different from the first, it did have one similarity, DtB\u2019s trump card \u2013 the emotional connection. You are able to truly feel the character\u2019s emotions and this one factor is enough to propel you from the first to the last episode of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier in the short review, there are no major improvements in the visual department, which is still not a setback as the first season boasted one of the best graphics. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is once again solid, with a few more sentimental and soft tracks added. This was a really neat addition as it helps emphasize Suou\u2019s loneliness beautifully. The OP was a great track, with a good beat and definitely worth listening to every time. The ED on the other hand was very generic and doesn\u2019t deserve and special credit. The voice actors have done a solid job, especially Suou\u2019s. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as far characters are concerned, Hei has undergone a major change. He\u2019s grown his hair out, got a beard and has a bottle of sake (alcohol) glued to his hand. When he decides to take Suou under his wing, he trains her using a remarkable method \u2013 If she doesn\u2019t get it right, smack her in the head till she does. Simple isn\u2019t it? (And this \u201cunique\u201d training method was the reason I compared it to Karate Kid). The character development for both is very typical tsundere. Basically, if you like shonen, it\u2019s difficult to go wrong with this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe Bottom-line:\\n\r\nDarker than Black:Gemini of the Meteor is a highly enjoyable anime if you just forgive the generic characters and shonen transformation.\\n\\n\r\n(P.S \u2013 MILD SPOILER AHEAD \u2013 The animation clip of Suou using her ability is an absolute DISGRACE to the slickness of the franchise. I found myself banging my head on the wall every time the anti-tank rifle stuck out of the semi naked kid.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

If you saw the first season then I don't know how anyone can say this season was just as good or better than the first one.  In my opinion the first one was much better.\r\nThe story was decent and even though I do have a few complaints about the story it did keep me mostly interested in what was going to happen next.  I wished more things were explained in the story.  I mean yeah I did kind of expect some mystery like in the first season butcome on in this one barely anything was explained.  The only thing that was explained in full was how Mao lost his body.  I just finished watching it and I'm not sure what exactly the ending was all about.  I kind of understand but in the same time I'm still trying to get it all.  When I saw the ending I was like wait what, that is why Suou existed... and yeah I could go on and on about it but I don't want to spoil the ending.  The story was decent since it kept me interested, but to be honest after watching the first season I felt quite disappointed about this story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were kind of disappointing to be honest.  The only character that personality stayed the same was Mao(the squirrel) who used to be a cat and Misaki who is in Section 3 now.  Hei who used to be the lead protagonist in the first one lost his charm.  It is like he got super depressed after the first one.  Maybe being separated from the doll Yin(which is also not explained) has made him all sad.  Even if life did make him depress why is he beating up on children now?  Even though towards the end he does recover some personality it still wasn't the same Hei I liked back in the first season.  Suou who is the lead female protagonist in the story was good.  The only thing I can complain about her was how lame her power was.  Awesome she can make a big gun materialize which she still has to clean and take care of...?\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy watching this for the most part.  Sure there were a few plot holes here and there(even more than the first season) that were never explained and my favorite character Hei is a drunk who beats up on children now I still weirdly enough kept wanting to watch to know what was going to happen.  It wasn't bad but it definitely did not deserve a 10.  Even if you didn't see the first season therefore didn't have to compare it to that one it still wouldn't deserve a 9 or a 10.  In fact it would probably just make you even more confused.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 7 even though in my head it keeps going between a 6 and a 7.\\n\\n",

One thing about the Anime is that you can never cease to be amazed how superb the animation was done.\r\nThe story takes place after the first season which is more like a continuation of the original series. If you haven't seen season one yet - i strongly suggest you first watch the first season before continuing to read this review.\r\nThe opening and ending tracks of the anime were also a notable feature in the seriesitself wherein other anime don't really give much concern about how the intro and ending soundtracks will affect the anime throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe new characters to the season has a major role in the series, more like a big plot twister. I deeply enjoyed the new characters altogether and the thing with the syndicate was far most the less intrigueing part of the Series.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you guys will enjoy the Anime as well as i did and yet again I can say that it will be one of your best time spent on watching this! \\n",

            "content": "Note:\r\nThis is a review of the first 5 episodes, I will make the possible changes by the end of the season. I also made it so that this review contains the least amount of spoilers possible.\r\nAfter watching the first 2 episodes I was instantly hooked on Darker than Black. It's totally a great amine, and would probably be up in the top 10 after done airing.\r\nIf you haven't seen Darker than Black yet then I highly recommend it. I usually watch drama/romance anime but this got me, this got me good. Darker than Black bases off of these special people named contractors, and yes thesetype of people like in most anime have special abilities, but this is where it becomes different and unique; the contractors have to use remuneration, or something that has to be done to use these so called contractor powers, this could range from making origami to ripping the hell out of your hair.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I love about this anime is how they add in little details like when a meteor falls a contractor supposedly dies. This is not the case with the main character though (watch anime, trying not to spoil), even when he loses his meteor he still lives. Other details would be: flashbacks giving information in the gap between the first and second season, changes to the characters because of factors from the first season, and making more of an emphasis on \"remuneration.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow the sound in Darker than black is superb! The opening tells a story in itself, it basically tries to input the message that when you become a contractor everything that you have, your dreams, and everyone that you hold dear will be lost, and that you have to keep moving forward. You will find this true within the anime as you progress through. The background music in the anime fit it very well, it was fast paced and complimented the action greatly. The voice actors fit each and everyone of their characters and are acted out very well. The only thing I had disagreement on sound was that the ending had pretty much almost nothing to do with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has also improved a considerable amount. In season one of this anime the effects were great and artwork was well done. Now in season two of Darker than Black, the artwork has been given more detail; effects being notched up, lighting and shading more present especially in the effects, and even a 3D perspective is added in.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters in the anime change drastically from season one. This is most likely from the problems aroused from season one. You see big changes from the main characters. One of them transitions from a cold-blooded killer working for a syndicate, to being a alcoholic working for the government. Other major character developments are that innocent people became involved and actually became the once normal living people into emotionless contractors.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime and gave it a 9. The originality, art, and the new ideas coming from this anime convinced me to give it a 9. Hopefully by the end of this season (which I don't want this anime to ever end), I will go over this review again and most likely give it a 10 if this anime keeps impressing me.",

            "content": "Darker than Black Genesis of the Meteor\r\nWell, where should I start? I honestly liked Darker than Black since the first episode, I got that vibe of \u201cI'm going to like this\u201d since the first episode and that\u2019s is basically the same feeling I got with this second season.\r\n[THIS WILL BE A SPOILERS FREE REVIEW - Only the names of the MC will be named]\r\nI\u2019ve seen many people commenting that they hate this season, that is bad, bla bla bla. I tell you what, this season is awesome. Don\u2019t let other people tell you it\u2019s bad because it is not.\r\nYes, this season is different from theoriginal Darker than Black but it keeps the essence.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis season takes another aim to what the first Darker than Black was. It still has our beloved Hei, but it doesn\u2019t take place immediately after the ending of the first season. We find out that this season has a new main character, and Hei takes a secondary role in this story. Take it as a new stage of Hei\u2019s life and his story. There are new and interesting characters, returning old faces, feels and plot twists that made me keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nThis season is different, but different doesn\u2019t mean it is bad. Some people may not be receptive to change but once you accept that you will see the beauty of this season.\\n\\n\r\n[ Story | 7-8 ]\\n\r\nThe new story sets about 2 years after the events of the first season, and at the beginning takes us to Russia where we will meet our new MC. That\u2019s it, I\u2019m not diving more into the story. I will tell you that the changes implemented in this season made it feel fresh, different, mysterious and at the same time familiar with what we\u2019ve been experimented before. My hype went up just with the first episode.\\n\\n\r\n[ Art | 7 ]\\n\r\nThe art style is the same, but the animation got an upgrade. Movements feel good and smooth. The 3DCGI got an improvement too so as the special effects. What I\u2019m trying to say it is pleasant to the eye.\\n\\n\r\n[ Music | 7 ]\\n\r\nThis season packs a new OST that fits the new setting and the standards of Darker than Black. The OP is simply marvelous, I liked a lot the visuals that gave me actual feels when watching certain scenes. The ED has espectacular too, both visuals and music, really relaxing and enjoyable. I never skipped the OP or the ED, not even once.\\n\\n\r\n[ Character | 8 ]\\n\r\nThis part is the most important for this second season because the progress and outcome of the story is tied directly to the evolution of our two MC characters. Yes, I said two. Hei will have a huge development in his character that will be crucial for the story, the same goes for our new MC, Suou. Taking focus on the new character, it was easy to like. I find it easy to understand at some times and interesting to know more about at others.\\n\r\nAs the first season, there will be times you will inevitably laugh, because there are some character interactions that are truly gold. However, there will be times you will feel sorrow or pity, in the end, this is Darker than Black we are talking about. Feels tend to hit out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\n[ Enjoyment | 9 ]\\n\r\nAs I said in the beginning, I knew I was gonna enjoy this season, despite everything I read I knew inside me I was gonna like it and there you see, I loved it.\\n\\n\r\n[ Overall ]\\n\r\nOnce again, it was a fantastic season that left me wanting for more (remember that after this season, there are the 4 OVAs of Darker than Black: Gaiden). Keep your mind open to change and this season will not disappoint you.",

            "content": "Somehow the high expectations I had awaiting the sequel to a fantastic series were not fulfilled. Ryuusei No Gemini isn\u2019t exactly a sequel to Kuro no Keiyakusha, but more like a separate arc in itself. It would be unfair to compare both of them as they vary in their style and storyline. For starters, the series are not bi-episodic; instead revolve around a single storyline involving a Eurasian female protagonist. Hei\u2019s involvement through the series although significant, has not really been up to what it ought to be.  \r\nStoryline: 7/10\r\nSuou Pavlichenko is a 13 year Eurasian girl whose life suddenly changes on a fatefulday when she meets up with Hei. Involved in the mess of politics and war between the contractors, she seeks out on her own quest to find her missing twin, Shion. Alongside her is Hei, a drunk bastard who completely lacks the mannerism and politeness he once had. The personality change might have been necessary in this series as it made things a bit interesting, but it didn\u2019t seem all that good seeing him like that. The storyline, in its individuality served to be interesting though. The protagonist goes through a lot of ordeals throughout her journey. The series also has some graphic and violent killings which made it a little gory at times. The birth and evolution of the contractors was something we had vaguely seen in Kuro no Keiyakusha. The involvement of many groups (CIA, FSB, MI6 and Section 3) could have made for better viewing had they had more air time. They left it a bit incomplete and it felt as if these names were only included to attract attention without proper motive behind it. Also the \u201cSyndicate\u201d that pretty much ruled in Kuro no Keiyakusha was nowhere to be seen, again a disappointment as the whole mysteriousness behind them suddenly disappeared. Altogether though, despite its shortcomings it was somehow good how it ended up being. I guess it may be due to the protagonists\u2019 whole journey from havoc to happiness. As for the name \u201cGemini of the Meteor\u201d, it wasn\u2019t nearly as important to be kept in the title IMO. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterization: 7/10\\n\r\nRyuusei No Gemini had a plethora of characters which made it quite an entertaining prospect to watch. Starting off with Suou, a determined and strong girl entwined between living a life as a human or a contractor. It was touching to see the ordeals she and her school friends went through. Much like a supporting character, July was an example of some nice character development, and his relation with Suou was charming to watch. Hei\u2019s laid-back sake drinking attitude failed to impress me the slightest. And the fact that he was not able to showcase his powers during most of the series made it lamer for me. The agents of Section 3 were pretty good, namely Hizaki and Genma. Hizaki\u2019s remuneration involved kissing someone after the usage of her power added to the humor. Madam Oreille was yet promising character shown but somehow failed to make much of an impact in the Anime. Lot of interesting characters I would say. But somehow they were cramped up in a short series which somehow failed them I believe. They should have been given more time for their characters to be known properly rather than just through some cameo roles.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe original characters were already pretty awesome in how they were made. The new characters were also very nicely put out. From the Russians to the CIA to the Japanese characters, all looked very original. Also the new characters gave the storyline a refreshing experience. The fights were well coordinated and typically good to watch. Hei\u2019s new look was intriguing; Suou\u2019s character was pretty nicely done too. The agents looked good and the whole background of the Anime from Russia to Tokyo was beautiful. The characters are all very nicely drawn and the animation stands out to be pretty good as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nSound was another good factor for Ryuusei No Gemini. The OP was a treat to the ears. I particularly liked it. The voices of the characters were also very good. Suou sounded very sweet whenever she used to shout \u201cTanya\u201d. As there was a mixture of cultures, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how these voices correlate in the dubs that will be out later on. The ED was average I would say. The best thing however would be the background score during the fights. The whole beat-box thing or whatever that was being played surely pepped up the interest to watch. I loved it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nSeeing this series individually without comparing to the previous one and you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s actually good. Although not as epic as Kuro no Keiyakusha, Ryuusei No Gemini offers an entertaining experience with some interesting character portrayals. Combined with good artwork and sound, it is a definite recommendation. Just don\u2019t try and compare it with the first season and you\u2019ll definitely like it. \\n",

            "content": "I had a rather a hard time wrapping my head around the thought process taken up by the scriptwriters of this show. They had an almost infinite pool of ideas to work with, from the origin story and reasoning behind the Hell's Gate manifestation to endless detours that could have been taken up using the Contractors and Dolls as parables for sociological issues plaguing current society; the possibilities were endless. It seemed that with all the mysterious themes being left in a shroud of ambiguity and the multifaceted approaches to tackling them just on the cusp of being explored, any route could have been takenthat would have resulted in a decent sequel. Taking a shot in the dark with any one of these ideas should have yielded something worthwhile. But for reasons beyond comprehension, instead of trying to provide a solid answer to its mysteries or even using it to flesh out its world's lore, they threw that all away. And for what you may ask? Well, lolis, forced comedy, talking squirrels, character resets, raging alcoholics and a sleuth of more idiotic plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nStill wondering why and how the Heaven/Hell Gates appeared? Still wondering why they brought on an augmented sky that warped into the new one? Still wondering why contractors and dolls became a product of this? Still wondering why their lives are correlated with fallen stars? Still wondering what the motivation of the syndicate was? Still trying to decipher this show's bullshit?... Well, join the club. In this second season, the writers said \"fuck it\" once again, as they followed up the events of the first by managing to create something that felt terribly dated from the moment it rolled off the assembly line. It's a husk of the show's former self in every regard. The story, despite being more streamlined this time around, was still very uneventful. All it does was drag us along to a nonsense-filled finale that will likely leave all its mysteries and hackneyed bullshit permanently unanswered. It's the kind of narrative structure when the intent felt like reverse-engineering gone wrong. This is studio Bones after all. A studio that's become infamous for thrusting their own concepts up their asses. \\n\\n\r\nThe 1st season of DTB went from passable action romp to inflated pseudo-concepts by the final stretch of it. And as if that wasn't enough, now it felt like the staff gave up on having decent coherency among its pseudo-thematic jargon and settled for whatever came to mind instead. So this time around, even the pseudo-concepts don't make sense. Like a rough draft of a script passed along a circle of \"fuck its\" and shoulder shrugs, as they rake in the money, tossing what little ideas they had towards the finished product without so much as batting an eye. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of tossing shit together, the art seemed to have become a victim of complacency as well. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know how this is possible, but with fewer episodes to worry about and more years to perfect the art style, the 2nd season felt like it brought no visual improvements to the table. By a side by side comparison, very little was made better, instead, a 2-year gap in its production cycle seemed to have left it in a state of stagnation. It's like the animator team made it back in '07 and just let it gather up dust until it was time to release it. And when placed against other titles made in the same year, it just pales in comparison. And this isn't to say that studio Bones couldn't do any better. They've already proven that they could improve their visual and animation efforts as time goes on. Just looking at the visual output between Eureka Seven's 1st and 2nd season shows that. So seeing how little they cared about improving their craft for DTB's sequel felt like a cheap blow. It's a mediocre patch-job that doesn't deserve any credit whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while I can't offer it much credit, an aspect of this season that might register with some was the new choice of music. \\n\\n\r\nThe great jazz/blues fusion soundtrack of season one took a backseat to a more contemporary House-electronic sound. It's not a bad soundtrack but when compared to the prequel's, it feels out of place. It inadvertently strips the show of its familiar charm and alienates it further from its predecessor. The neo-noir backdrop feels out of place when the smoky croon of a Jazz track is replaced by what's effectively a rave-party anthem. It simply sucks the atmosphere out and replaces it with something more \"in the now\" as opposed to the timeless feeling. Since musical taste is subjective, I won't harp on it any further and leave you to decide where you stand on it. \\n\\n\r\nBut what isn't a decision that needs much debating over was the new cast. \\n\\n\r\nWith fewer contractors, more people characters in their place, there's still no decent characterization to be found. They made a big deal about contractors having no irrational emotion in season one but there's very little differentiating them from other people when they all remain one-note. Also, that sense of maturity that the first season carried for its characters was thrown out the window and replaced with bombastically over-the-top eccentricities. This causes a HUGE tonal shift in how the show is presented and perceived. Similarly to what the switch in musical tones did, this too was a decision that watered down the poignancy that occasionally flicked through in season one. Now, everything was glaringly carefree. They even changed the classy cat to a flying squirrel. LIKE SERIOUSLY? FUCK YOU DTB!\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue comes with Suou, our new protagonist. She takes up more screen time than necessary and is only good for two things: being an inconsistent character that flip-flops from one tonal speed to the other, or loli fanservice. And if that wasn't bad enough, she was degraded to becoming a contrived plot-device halfway through the series.\\n\r\nHei isn't even the same badass we use to love. The writers added over-bloated angst to his characteristics and made a man who was already lacking in emotional range, to begin with, to be presented as a complete nut job of polarizing extremes. In place of the calm and collected demeanor he once had, we're instead given a raging alcoholic who slaps little girls in his spare time and drinks himself silly when he felt like it. Of course, he still kills contractors like the cool electric Batman we grew to love but his conflicting characteristics with his supposed \"emotionless state\" makes it harder for anyone to care for him anymore. He simply became a puppet of the poorly written screenplay, being inserted whenever the writers saw fit.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the worst replacement was that of the side characters introduced for this season. The cast included a tranny bartender with a lolicon obsessed son, Misaki the walking plot-device, antagonists that border on luny, and a sleuth of people that aren't worth the mention. Needless to say, the cast here was far inferior to the show's previous standards. They served no other purpose than being aggravating tagalongs that no one ever wanted. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really, this season itself was just that: an aggravating tagalong that we're forced to accept as a continuation. Instead of getting a decent successor, we're instead given a half-baked effort that couldn't stand on its own. Bones dropped the ball in every conceivable level. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nDisappointment... I found nothing here but unsubstantial fights and cheap attempts at fanservice. This is NOT how you do a sequel to a neo-noir action romp. It doesn't even work as pure schlock entertainment. Apparently, even Pizza Hut said \"oh hell no, fuck that\" since they too were nowhere to be found, wanting nothing to do with this uninspired continuation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are bad sequels then there's DTB's sequel. A sequel that literally scrubbed the show of its previous identity and STILL didn't answer any questions. As it is now, I can only recommend this to completionists. An underwhelming mess that sullied what little credentials the series was desperately clinging onto.",

            "content": "I am \"a bit disappointed\" in the rest of the reviews here, namely that so many of them reflect that this season was dreadful, yet hedge that to \"being a bit disappointed\" with it. This season was balls to the walls, shamelessly awful.\r\nThe defining feature of the entire series: how they manage to draw every character with dead eyes throughout the series, yet expect us to enjoy ourselves. The defining scene: horrible side character creation 1, dreadlock kids, sobbing and venting to horrible side character creation 2, his crossdressing dad, culminating in being more likely to make you laugh than cry as he sobs andwhines into his cake. The defining question: how they expect us to believe Hei can still kick everyone in the world's ass with no powers and reduced to \"living the good life\" (that one was a minor meme joke, do not worry if you did not get it).\\n\\n\r\nThere are already other reviews that detail exactly how the plot is (stupidly) aimless and bereft of basically most of the useful details it should have, so I am not going to rehash that. What I will touch on is how the plot is awful with the characters it uses: it introduces lots of new characters, all poor creations that are impossible to care about; it has a lot of short, impossibly one sided battles; it gives random annoying flashes to some apparently crazy event involving Yin, with absolutely no real explanation as to why they happened; it has random, annoying flashes to these blonde twin girls, who speak in tittery, annoying voices and \"say mysterious things\" i.e. nonsensoleum; it has cop lady chasing desperately after Li, despite the fact that she has no real insight to anything in this series, never does anything, and just wastes our time; it has former cool cat Mao back as an awful, ridiculously (poorly drawn) cartoony flying squirrel like creature (they called it a mamonga or something, whatever). Get the picture?\\n\\n\r\nThis version of Darker Than Black just tries to establish how SAD and AWFUL everything is for everyone, and it definitely does a good job of showing viewers an awful time. Of course, just like people are unwilling to be objective about Code Geass 2 since they loved Code Geass 1, similarly no one will be objective about Darker Than Black 2 since they loved Darker Than Black 1. I cannot wait until the OVAs come out to \"connect the seasons\" and people act like it redeems all the flaws.",

Darker than BLACK - Ryuusei no Gemini, the sequel seemed to forget these.\r\n*Mild Spoilers Ahead*\r\nThis anime would have been great if it was a stand-alone, but it was unlucky enough to have expectations to live up to its predecessor. The main character, Hei - once a calm, collected, cold-blooded killer now stars as an umkempt drunk who abducts small children and beats them.Mao, the cat who had previously died, is now a flying squirrel and stays as one even though he had many oppertunities to possess a cat. Yin has turned from a near-silent doll into a... wait, nothing at all was explained about that - but she made a lot of contractors commit suicide so that she could... that wasn't explained either. Kuro no Keiyakusha kept the plot a complete mystery until the end, but Ryuusei no Gemini didn't really explain it at all.\\n\\n\r\nSo, our old friends from Kuro no Keiyakusha have had their characters changed drastically, but what about the new faces? Maybe they will make up for this? A loli with a rifle; a pervert who can turn into a golem and a lesbian with a lightsaber... personally, I didn't find them very original to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nEnough of bashing the characters though - onto the story. The series was half the length of Kuro no Keiyakusha, and the two episode long arcs were discarded. I was dissapointed by this since too many things weren't explained, even for Darker than BLACK. The last episode really needed to be two, maybe three, episodes and again explain a few more things. It was a cliffhanger disguised as closure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a decent anime. If you do plan on watching it, have Kuro no Keiyakusha ready to watch again so that you can get rid of the bad aftertaste - Ryuusei no Gemini doesn't live up to the original and makes you think less of some once great characters.",

            "content": "Oh, Bones, Thank goodness you started DTB in the first place.\r\nTHIS IS A REVIEW ON THE FIRST COUPLE EPISODES, AND I WILL UPDATE IT WHEN MORE EPISODES COME OUT.\r\nFirst off, DTB2 is NOT the original DTB. Bones have made some pretty big changes between seasons: setting main cast of characters, story, etc. It's better to look at DTB2 as more of a spin-off of the original DTB: if you liked season 1 because of the idea of the series (contractors et all), then you will most likely enjoy season 2. Now, onto the review:\r\nStory\r\nIt is VERY different from the original DTB. First of all, itseems to be one continuous narrative instead of two-episode mini-arcs like in the original season. I happened to like the mini-arc format, but BONES obviously knows what they're doing: the story is as rich and detailed as ever. Like season 1, the story is centered around contractors, humans who have super powers but need a remuneration afterward. Instead of focussing on Hei, most of the spotlight is on Suou, a Russian/Japanese girl whose brother is a contractor.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nSome very big changes since season 1. Most notably is Hei's appearance: his mask is scratched, his coat is tattered, and he hasn't shaved in a while. In addition, the animation is sleeker, and the contractor's abilities are truly awe-worthy.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nLike the first season, the sound is superb. The OP is definitely different, but in a good way, and the EP is one of my all time favorites.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nHei takes a minor role so far in the series, which I actually prefer due to the ability to see more stellar characters. Suou is the focus of the series, and she is one of my favorite characters in all DtB, including 1st season Hei and Huang.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nLike always, DtB never ceases to surprise me. I absolutely love the new characters and contractors already introduced, and I expect there to be more as the series progresses. July, the MI6 doll in the first season, also seems to have a larger role than in season 1, which I think is awesome. And, like the first season, it is really fun to piece together each contractor's power and remuneration.",

            "content": "Before you read this one, I would let you know that I am just a newbie when it comes to anime and I am not totally good when it comes to anime terms and words. Also I am not a good reviewer like the others in here. But, still I like to write a review for this and I will deliver it in a simple way based on my own opinions.\r\nWhats new in this series? A lot of changes. Yes a lot of changes, that would includes the characters, appearances, mood, settings and the story itself.\r\nWhat word might really fit in this series is theword \"Explore\" yes, DTB-RNG really explored a lot in many aspects to make this series really great. Though it's just disappointing because it only has 12 episodes and there is no Season III for it unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, here's my score for this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 : This is quite different from the first season in terms of what is currently happening in the story, also you would never know that it is the continuation of the first season if you don't read the synopsis. In fact I can say that Ryuusei no Gemini can stand alone without watching the first season and probably reading the synopsis of this season is enough to understand what happened from the start. What I mean in here is DTB-RNG made some changes being able for the 2nd season to stand alone. But of course it has the linkage between season I and II which is really great, though there are some aspect of the stories that until now really intrigued me.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that one of the greatest investment regarding in the story for this series is by adding some new faces on the story and where does the story takes place.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the abilities of each contractor are really fun to watch this time since the other abilities from the previous season are common.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 : Character's art were delivered very clear and they were matching according to their characteristics & statistics. While some of the scenes out there are not properly delivered when it comes to art.\\n\r\nBut the X-factor of this when it comes to art is the adaptation of the country's dressing style and including it's culture and that's really impressive.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 : For a music lover like me, well this one is the 2nd highest basis for my criteria. Well, I can actually say that DTB-I has a great quality when it comes to SFX and other sound elements but, it's kinda lazy for ears. But, on this series it has been improved more than the previous season. Especially, if you will notice there are a lot of changes with Hei, not only with the personality but, also on how does he speak and reacts in different circumstances. Opening theme of Ryuusei No Gemini is really great, the music is titled \"Tsukiakari No Michishirube\" and it was performed by Stereopony a pop rock band in Okinawa that is already disbanded on 2012. What the most unique in here is Suou I like the way on how she deliver her words and reactions, perfectly matched with her characteristics and also the accent regards on their culture. One more thing regarding with the sound is the beat-box at the point where Hei showed himself and I was really surprised with his appearance, made me think \"Oh wow This is really cool!!\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10 : I am intrigue with the character changes in here especially Hei, a food lover that can probably always win with boodle fights turns into a drunk old looking guy also his polite personality disappeared and turns into a girl slapping guy with a black heart. While at some good point still, Suou Pavlichenko is the one that is totally unique and really, really good in the series. Character development for Suou is really good the way she speaks and the way she acts.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 : I can't say that I totally enjoyed this one especially it is all about syndicates and crimes so I am expecting a lot of actions unfortunately something happened. Since there is an unexpected event that can be added to the thrill that you'll need to find out to watch this series. Other than that, regarding in all aspects well I can say that you can really enjoy this one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 : I'd rather say that I really enjoy this series and you might ending up wanting for this one to have a Season III.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNote : This review never intend to please everybody so if you want to criticize this one you are actually welcome to do it and let me hear some words from you as I want to learn more.",

            "content": "Please note that I just finished watching the last episode minutes ago and I'm kinda trying to sort my thoughts out writing this.\r\nDarker than Black was never known to be the type of anime that explains everything, many things were and are left in the dark adding a whole layer of mystery to this fantastic world. Darker than Black 2 continues in this fashion but with quite a different approach. While the first season was mostly episodic, consisting of various story arcs with two episodes each, the second season is follows a continues storyline that is however developed quite well in my opinion. \r\nIt mightseem a little bit cheese and typical in the beginning, but the story soon begins to ravel up and develop a bit of a darker feeling and the missing elements tying up to season 1 are also implemented, without however spellings things out to the viewer. There are always a few plot twists or single episodes that seem quite silly or pointless, but the greater story develops quite well. It is however not resolved completely and will likely continue into a third season in a similar fashion. I wonder whether we can ever hope for a complete unraveling of mystery, though I doubt it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likeably and only partially reoccurring from the first season. The new characters might seem a bit unfitting at first but I like the way they develop. There is also a huge amount of character death, but in a different way compared to its prequel. The music and art continue in the fashion of season 1, the greatest controversy probably being the new opening and ending, though I personally liked them. The change of flavor is noticeable but not off putting.\\n\\n\r\nAlso despite being a sequel it will probably also be very watchable for people who haven't seen the first season. The feeling is very similar but the direct links, despite being present, aren't major to the story.\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black 2's greatest plus is probably it's enjoyment factor. The story, despite being interesting, is still not all that original and often a bit silly, but the atmosphere of the anime just keeps you glued to the back of your seat wanting to know what happens next and most importantly how it will play out. It may not be a historical masterpiece but is definitely worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, jump in and watch it. You might even like it if you didn't like the first season to the different approach. I highly suggest giving it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10.",

            "content": "Compared to the first season this is pretty bad. Even though I watched episode after episode hoping for something to happen all I ended up with was frustration.\r\nKiko in the first season stuck out enough and now there is the cross-dressing father and his idiot son plus strange characters appearing without barely an explanation. Sure DTB is a series where you have to think about the hows and whys but we are still pretty much left without a hint about contractors and dolls.\r\nThere is a story to it but it feels lacking provably to the way it evolves. There definitely are good parts in itand plenty of them but there is also lots of stuff that could of had been done better. The \"rifle materialization\" scene with Suou is repetitive and feels like it's being used to waste time. Although Hei's ability is not what it used to be if feels like he is not even himself and somehow is very fortunate of the outcomes of his problems.\\n\r\nA least some characters have their own uniqueness to them and we learn a few things about them and their history.\\n\r\nIt's not terrible by its self, but it is when you are expecting something along the lines of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully Darker than BLACK - Kuro no Keiyakusha Gaiden will somehow make up for it.",

            "content": "DtB: Ryuusei no Gemini\r\nThis ''sequel'' is not what i expected at all and i don't want to put any effort on reviewing this to be honest, is bad as a direct sequel, the direction they took with this was awful, just why? and i'm being generous giving it a 6.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is a let down, one may think that it will follow the story of Hei and Yin but forget about that, that comes to a second plane now, the main plot for this is about a girl named Suou who has a twin and wants to go to Tokyo to see his twin brotheragain, she will be accompanied by now an alcoholic and woman beating Hei, who loses his powers and are given to Suou because of a medallion she carries with her, she becomes a contractor with emotions and through her journey with Hei, and the comeback of two characters July and Mao in the form of squirell will find out that she's different because of his brother and also will fall in love with Hei like every girl; The story may be unexpected at times but it's because the story is very irregular, sometimes the story feels it's good but that story was ruined to be a mediocre one, it could be worse tho and it is with that awful ending, they used Yin to make that stupid ending, a ''happy'' open ending by the way with little explanation on to why Hei and Yin story ended abruptly, one question raised WTF was that? Suou's journey seems pretty useless at the end and so was Hei's journey with her and his own to kill Yin (something weird because in the OVA he wanted to save her) then another gate appears but why and how? and much more content to another sequel that would fail if they relesed it, i'm glad they didn't considering this mediocre story.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style was the best (with the sound) because it's almost the same as the first season, the animation was a little better with more smooth fight scenes so in general it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe other best thing from the anime is the music but with again one song that didn't match the situation the rest of them were on point and really enjoyable; The VA did a great job again the OP song was meh but the ED song was good, overall the sound was very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters were fine, but i didn't like the weird change Hei had, and i didn't liked Mao as a squirell even tho he was funny.\\n\r\n-Hei became an alcoholic woman beating who somehow was surprised when he heard Yin was alive and if you go by the OVAs he already knew because the CIA guy told him and he finally quits drinking (even tho i thought he would quit it since the beginning because of the last OVA ep.) and starts to eat like before and slowly comes back to be the old Hei but not as likeable as before, but yeah why make him like that in the first place, he always wanted to save Yin not kill her and at the end he becomes Yei? Hin? that's another WTF? BS.\\n\r\n-Suou is kind of interesting but at the same time not, she feels more like a doll rather than a contractor and at the end is like it doesn't matter, it was another BS.\\n\r\n-Mao was again the comedy relief and finally we get to know his past and how he ended up like an animal forever.\\n\r\n-July is the Yin of this season, everyone needs a doll right? he was reacting to Suou not in the same way as Yin emotions but he was somewhere close there with Suou.\\n\r\n-Yin is forgotten and used for that stupid ending and when they both finally meet again there's no big dialogue between the two just a few words and that's it.\\n\r\n-Kirihara Misaki appears again with a different role and wanting to chase again Hei but not dialogue with them neither, i he was a douche with her when they met again not like in first season when he was nice with her.\\n\r\nAnd another two characters appears again to help Suou in a case the private detective Gai Kurasawa and the pink haired girl Kiko and of course the twin brother of Suou Shion whose role was not as big as you may think but anyways the characters were fine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime at one point, maybe because Hei was there, even tho he changed, i got a fair enjoyment somehow, i don't know why, i really had enjoyment with the comedy but this sequel it's not worth watching.",

            "content": "If \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d was a band than their follow up album would be considered selling out. \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d is nothing like the first season coming across as an entirely different anime. It panders to the audience, the action is over the top, the soundtrack is less memorable, and the direction of the entire anime is different. Not all the pieces connect properly, but it is a decent follow up to the first season of \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d. It never reaches the same heights of season one, but it does have its own strength that makes it worth watching including an ending that isbest described as unsatisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nOh, there will be minor spoilers. While not intentional and kept vague as possible, it takes place a whole year after the first season of Darker Than Black and Darker Than Black: Gaiden four part OVA. It\u2019s recommended you avoid this review for that purpose alone. I suggest seeing the previous season and OVA\u2019s before reading or entirely ignoring this review. \\n\\n\r\nGood: Different direction and different strengths\\n\\n\r\n\u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d from the first episode tells an overarching story. Focusing on two leading characters, Hei and Suou Pavlichenko, each with their own unique storylines. Hei story arc deals with finding Yin while Suou storyline deals more with finding answers about her family and her past. These two characters have different goals allowing the core of the main story to progress smoothly. Providing a different viewpoint from their adventure. How Hei goes about achieving his goal is vastly different to how Suou goes about reaching her goals. Suou goal is more personal vocalizing her thoughts in any situation without hesitation. Understanding how she feels throughout the entire season is plain as day. Hei is more tormented and defeated with his storyline in vein of a redemption story. Attempting to finish what he originally couldn\u2019t because of his emotions. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season of \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d went for capturing noir and \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d goes for capturing the action genre. Accomplishing this by having a major revelation or action scene occur in every episode attempting to imitate the effect of a cliffhanger to encourage the viewer to see the next episode immediately. There is rarely ever a moment of safety for the heroes wherever they go. Someone is always behind them chasing them down. Another added inclusion from the change in direction is the material is allowed to show more emotion. Characters in general across more lively in the series without the usual restrictions emotionless contractors are written in.\\n\\n\r\nOne noticeable difference from \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d from the rest of the series is the comedy plays a bigger role. Jokes are thrown into every episodes instead of spread out through out the series on special occasions. Its favorite kind of jokes involves everyone confusing Suou for her twin brother. There\u2019s a recurring gag involving Genma Shizume making flirtatious remark at Suou unknowing to him she\u2019s actually a girl. It\u2019s a funny recurring joke since it doesn\u2019t reuse it frequently and offers other forms of humor to keep it varied. Mostly from Mao who despite a change of appearance hasn\u2019t lost his ability for spouting sarcastic remarks. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is larger in \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d getting the short end in characterization. This is very noticeable from the first episode when it decides to bring in characters from the first season only sideline them. Within the first episode, a specific character that had a big role in season one gets killed off quickly. The supporting characters that do influence the story generally don\u2019t have much of a screen presence. Little characterization is mostly to blame resulting in a support cast to be only known for a single a trait. Mina Hazuki is a badass when she\u2019s in combat, but the most memorable aspect about her personality is she\u2019s a lesbian. Genma Shizume is a comedic pervert whose terrible at his job. There is not a single scene when he\u2019s shown doing his competently on the field. Another character is Norio who first appears in episode four with a storyline hinting he would play some important role in the story. Norio is forgotten about past episode six and his time in the series is superfluous in the main story. Some other characters fade into the background because they operate behind the scenes, but never is their influence felt. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is a major drawback this season because Suou whole motivation is to find answers. Her arc takes as much time to tell as Hei's does. This gives \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d a whole different direction of solving mysteries so leaving unanswered questions is a negative. By the time episode twelve finishes despite every bit of information being told to the viewer what happened it won\u2019t turn out satisfactory. Hei is the only character who could serve as the backbone for the entire anime series from beginning to end. Details of what occurred to Hei is left in the open interpretation department which is more than a disappointment given at this point Hei is a strong three dimensional character. Leaving an open ending for Hei journey unlike the rest of the cast members makes it that much more unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nMixed: Good Leads, Unwhelming Supporting Cast\\n\\n\r\nHei in \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d is at his lowest point in the franchise. Gone is the carefree side of his personality coping with his inner depression with alcohol. He\u2019s frequently serious in nearly every scene which is a change of character for Hei. In general though, Hei doesn\u2019t get much added to him in terms of characterization. However, he does face new conflicts to overcome this season. Hei might not be the same person he was at the start of the franchise, but is still a well written character. He\u2019s smart in situations that require him to think on the spot to survive. Despite how he turned out he does is sympathetic towards other characters, but expresses it differently from before. \\n\\n\r\nMao goes from a wise cat to a flying squirrel who asides from giving some sarcastic remarks and comedic relief has his importance to the story minimize. No longer does Mao gather intel for Hei or his group and instead helps out the heroes directly in small ways. He\u2019s more active on screen sometime blocking people views or being some sort of distraction. Such moments don\u2019t appear often enough to change the fact his importance to the story is not what it use to be. In return, Mao does receive characterization when fans finally get to see how he looked in his human form. It might only last a single episode seeing his past human self for the first time is a treat for fans. \\n\\n\r\nSuou Pavlichenko is a red hair, 13 year old Russian girl photographer who becomes a sniper. She plays a major role in the story seeing everything in the world of contractors for the first time, but for any viewer following this anime series in order will already know everything Suou does not. Her character will be more relatable for anyone who has not seen the world of \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d at this point, but adds to seeing first hand the evolution of a human turning into a contractor. She\u2019s a decent character...Studio Bones thought otherwise in how she\u2019s used. In 11 out 12 episodes Suou appears naked at some point or appear in some scene that provides fanservice. Yeah, one entire episode out of twelve doesn\u2019t use Suou in some way to pander to its audience. To name a few instances in the first episode there is a (are they ever not) pointless shower scene, episode three she\u2019s in a cabin drying wet clothes only being cover by a blanket follow by interpreted bad position, in episode four there is Suou dancing which would be fine if it weren\u2019t how that moment was framed, in episode eight swimsuits, and can\u2019t forget the anti-tank rifle summoning sequence (in which Suou appears naked) is always shown in its entirety every time it gets summoned. These are a couple of examples of how the anime treats her which is honestly far worse than anything Hei ever does to Suou in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nLike mentioned earlier the supporting cast is larger and some get sidelined. Misaki Kirihara from season gets sideline whose involvement in the story is unneeded. Her role in this season is minimize uncovering a conspiracy behind the scene that doesn\u2019t do add much for the story. What ultimately ends up happening to her in the aftermath of the finale is far more relevant than anything she does before it ends. Due to the length of the anime the characters don\u2019t receive the needed attention to have their own arcs or be fleshed out beyond introduction. Which why the likes of Yoko Sawasaki, Genma Shizume, Mina Hazuki, and Michiru are kept very simplistic from start to finish. The only exceptions to this are Dr. Mikhail Pavlichenko and Shion Pavlichenko because they are connected to Suou storyline. Throughout the series, there are flashbacks that reveal important pieces of information fleshing them out from when the season begins. Once it\u2019s over, Dr. Mikhail and Shion have more to define them unlike the rest of the cast that remains the same. \\n\\n\r\nGood: Bones Studio Aces Their Animation \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by Bones Studio like the rest of the anime series. Animation in \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d allows Studio Bones to show off what they can do. Having a more diverse cast in age range compare to the rest of the series. There\u2019s a fair mix of children and adults where previous entries mostly had adult characters. As usual, all characters have unique designs that can be told apart easily even if all the characters hair color were the same. In movement it moves smoothly with no hiccups regardless what\u2019s on screen. Backgrounds once again are detailed, though this time mostly contained in industrialized cities. There\u2019s no environment that is unique to \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d specifically. However, it does claim the honor of having the best action sequences in the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes have flashy effect with over the top powers use in battles. There\u2019s no usage of 3D in these action scenes as Studio Bones spares no expense for them. Battles are flashy sporting particle effects of all kind from sparks when two melee weapons hitting each other, to an explosion with intense flames, to anti-tank rifle that pierces through concrete or metal, and whatever effects to its disposal. Episode three has a sequence where a stationed train is hit by another train causing train carts to start flying through the air. It does not use 3D in any frame of that sequence which looks great when seen. Unfortunately there isn\u2019t another sequence in the rest of the series that tops that spectacle, but the other action scenes aren\u2019t any less impressive because of it. Every action scene has a flashy effect unique to that specific action sequence. In one episode it has a character merging with a vehicle manipulating it for combat. Goofy sounding as that description is in execution it\u2019s actually creative while not being a one sided battle. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout my reviews for the \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d franchise I always suggested seeing the anime with English subtitles and this season is why. In the English dub, Suou dialogue receives the most alteration of any character changing the tone of several scenes becoming grating to listen too. Alison Viktorin who voices Suou delivers a solid performance, but some of her dialogue does her a disservice making her come across as a little brat. Another factor that prevents her performance from being decent is she doesn\u2019t sound like a thirteen year old. That would be easy to overlook, but she has a few scenes where she has to loudly vocalize her complaints. Due to the English script changes it varies from Suou coming across sympathetic or just wanting to see Hei hit her. As much Alison Viktorin is capable in the role playing off her cast member just fine, the English script gets across something else than originally intended.\\n\\n\r\nIn the Japanese cast Kana Hanazawa voices Suou who sounds more like a thirteen year old. Her performance is more subtle in vocalizing Suou\u2019s emotion. Unlike Alison Viktorin who voices the same character, Hanazawa comes across as sympathetic with her delivery of the dialogue. She makes Suou sympathetic and likable. The closer the anime gets to the ending the more range Kanazawa is allowed. Her chemistry with her co-stars is spot on especially when together Sawaki Ikuya and Hidenobu Kiuchi coming together naturally. \\n\\n\r\nHearing Kent Williams deep voice coming out of a small Momonga (fancy name for a Japanese dwarf flying squirrel) is quite odd. Like in season one, Kent Williams is spot on with his sarcastic remarks being the most hilarious in the English dub cast. Hearing such a small animal talk in such a deep sounding voice sticks out. In the Japanese cast, Sawaki Ikuya voice never becomes noticeable when playing the same character. While I prefer Kent Williams playing Mao in the series, Sawaki Ikuya has a voice that better blends into the character. Never does Ikuya voice become a distraction making it easier to become immerse with the character. \\n\\n\r\nAs usual (no surprise) regardless of who is heard both Hidenobu Kiuchi and Jason Liebrecht shine in their portrayal of Hei. The direction of the anime is different, but the changes does not affect how they portray their characters. Both of voice actors retain Hei characteristics managing to make the transition between seasons seem seamless. Creating a performance that works with the changes of the series. There\u2019re no hiccups in how they portray Hei. The supporting cast in both the Japanese and English dub cast play their characters in a straightforward manner. With more comedy, it\u2019s more difficult to distinguish any standout in the supporting cast. Doesn\u2019t really offer much range when half the cast has to deliver comedy. \\n\\n\r\nIf you had to choose between sub or dub I would recommend English sub for the entire franchise and English subtitles for this season. The Japanese cast performance are consistent throughout the entire anime franchise where the English dub stumbles in important areas as it goes on. There\u2019re also some script changes in the English dub that goes against what was originally intended to get across. The English dub isn\u2019t bad with Kent Williams and Jason Liebrecht reprising their roles they excel in portraying. Making the English worth alone for their performances, but they are the only aspects of the English dub that remain strong in every iteration. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack done compose by Yasushi Ishii this season which forgettable. Like in the four-part Gaiden OVA, the soundtrack is a mixture of rock tracks, techno, and lighter sounding tracks for the more personal moments in the series. None of the tracks stand out on their own without the accompany of visuals. Within the series, it works while simultaneously being forgettable. Instead of strengthening a scene, it just fades into the background. The opening theme \u201cTsukiakari no Michishirube\u201d by Stereopony is a pop/rock track. Optimistic lyrics  with Aimi Haraguni lack of conviction don\u2019t go hand in hand, but is a decent opening song that works fine for the intro. In spite how the series actually is, it\u2019s a great fit for the intro. Same goes with the ending track \u201cFrom Dusk Til Dawn\u201d by Abingdon Boys School. \u201cFrom Dusk Til Dawn\u201d is pop sounding using acoustic guitars and synthesized strings. It starts off soft going to the sounding more melodramatic when it ends. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: More entertaining, but not as good\\n\\n\r\nI was more entertained seeing \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d over the original season since it started with an overarching story and maintained it till completion. It also delivered on the action scenes all which never failed to be a feast for the eyes. However, it was entirely different in tone, pacing, and direction from what season one provided. Everything that made season one great was lost or downgraded in \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d. Season one characters get sideline, there was allot more pandering, contractors powers got over the top, and the ending wasn\u2019t entirely satisfactory. I wasn\u2019t expecting \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d to be the way it was, but at the same time I am not upset it did something different (ironically playing it safe) than rehashing itself. Instead of delivering something out of my expectations it deliver it exactly what I expected from it in the first place. For better and worse, it was still an enjoyable ride.\\n\\n\r\nAnime Series Overview:\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d is an anime series that has something different to offer in each iteration. Season one contains strong writing and great characters. Taking it sweet time before it develops it main cast, but a great first season all the way through. \u201cDarker than Black: Gaiden\u201d four-part OVA offers the best mixture of both season containing the strong writing of season one and the great action scenes of season two. It\u2019s also the most rushed with only four episodes to its story. \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d is pure entertainment that noticeably panders in order to reach a greater audience. Losing traits that made season one great and in return going in another route succeeding for different reasons. It\u2019s not the follow up one would expect the first season to receive, but has its own strength. I have to sound like a broken record at this point writing about this series multiple times in a single month. If you read all my reviews of this anime series or just this one thank you very much.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/3\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/3\\n\\n\r\nProduction Values: 2/3\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 1/1\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nDisappointment would be the defining word for this follow up season to \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d. It\u2019s nothing like the first season and all the characters from season one get sideline for a new cast most of which aren\u2019t developed the same degree of one-shot characters in the first season. It\u2019s not quite the follow up some fans might have wanted, but it\u2019s a decent anime through and through. All the characters story arcs get concluded, the action scenes are fast with great choreography, and ends the series on a positive note. Where Darker Than Black ended up with \u201cRyuusei no Gemini\u201d will be varied when viewers reach the end, but the journey to get there was one thrilling adventure that\u2019s worth taking.\\n",

I cannot stress that enough, and for some it will be a deal breaker.\r\nEDIT: After complaints I decided to expand this review. I'll put out spoiler alerts if they come up.\r\nStory: Excellent, it seems to be a character driven story, and the characters are excellent. The problem is if you don't care for a certain character, then you don't care for the story, so you have to be invested in the story. That being said, somehow, even a characterthat I was annoyed with, just like the protagonist actually made my eyes tear up with the excellent direction, voice acting and overall execution.\\n\\n\r\nIn this story, there are special people called contractors. They're called that because they lack emotion, think logically for themselves, can use superpowers, but at a price. They might have to break a finger, or bake a cake. Hei is an interesting character that you'll care a lot more about later on, even though at first you think he's an absolute jerk, which he basically is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Also excellent, the scenes are even better than the first season which is a definite plus, although, I wasn't terribly fond of the CGI bugs. Whenever there's a fight, everything is fluid and drawn very well. There isn't any sort of exaggerated physics except in some close up deaths, which is more for a shock factor.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Excellent, I liked the English voice overs, although it should be noted that most of the time characters talk in monotone because they're contractors or they're trying to explain something in the same about of talking space as the Japanese version. Still, when something emotional happens, just like the last season, you can feel it in their voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Perfect. I cannot stress this enough, there is so much character development, even in one episode. The writers did an outstanding job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Perfect. I've watched it over and over again. I really would love a Season 3.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'm giving it 9/10 because while I absolutely love it and would rate it 10/10 personally, it is closer to a 9/10 simply because some people will find the story unsatisfying with how it ends.",

            "content": "Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor\r\n(JAP title: Ryuusei no Gemini)\r\nThe sequel to one of my all-time favorites\u2026 I went in with high expectations and I came out confused.\r\n[ 1 MINUTE REVIEW ]\r\nThis is the highly anticipated sequel to the critically acclaimed first season. It does not follow the usual two episode arc style, as in the first season. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it transforms into your more stereotypical shounen anime, which might appeal to many. Sadly, I am not one of them. Due to the complete shift in genre, Darker than Black, Gemini of the Meteor is no longer aslick Ocean\u2019s 11 sort of anime, but rather a more brutal and Contractor version of Karate Kid, with a pro Contractor showing a young one the ropes. The music and animation are on the same plane as last season. However the ending is a tad confusing even after watching the OVA. Those who were absolute devotees of the original DtB should watch it regardless of its transformation to know the fate of their beloved characters. Others keep away!\\n\\n\r\n[ 5 MINUTE REVIEW ]\\n\\n\r\nAlright, let me get one thing straight \u2013 This is not Darker than Black. Maybe technically it is, but in reality, it is not. This show would\u2019ve been better off being named just \u201cGemini of the Meteor\u201d. You can almost consider this anime as a completely new one, featuring Contractors and the cast of Darker than BLACK. If you\u2019re looking for the exact same thing you liked in the first season, then this show is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, let\u2019s gets started with the synopsis. It has been two years since Hei destroyed the Saturn System in Hell\u2019s Gate and a LOT of events has occurred after that and before the beginning of season two. To understand all the changes that took place, one has to watch the OVA. But, I recommend you watch the OVA after you\u2019re done with the second season. I\u2019ll give a brief description on what happens in the time gap without giving any spoilers. Yin is separated from Hei. Hei is a bearded drunkard who works for the CIA. Misaki is fired from her old job and hired in an organization called Section 3, which is made up of Contractors. Oh, and one last thing \u2013 Hei is no longer a Contractor. \\n\\n\r\nIn Dtb:GoM, you follow Suou, a Russian girl who speaks Japanese. I suppose that makes her a Eurasian, but whatever. Young Suou is a normal girl, who goes to school and lives with her father in the mountain. However, her brother is kept a secret from the world as he is a Contractor and in Russia, all Contractors must be enrolled in the army. One day, her life is turned upside down when her best friend turns into a Contractor and Hei appears at Suou\u2019s house. She is then chased by nearly eight contractors and the Soviet army, yet she manages to escape from them all. If every little girl can get past the Soviet army, I really don\u2019t know why they\u2019re called a superpower. Anyway, moving on, Hei and Suou unite and thus begins their journey to go to Japan. The pacing is overall, good, but if you start watching this season immediately after the previous one, you might find it a bit confusing as you would be used to the bi episodic arcs. GoM contains only 1 storyline, which spans 12 episodes. And this storyline does not involve any undercover work, womanizer Li or well-defined side characters. And this is why I said this season is nothing like the previous. But that is not to say it is a bad anime. In fact, it is very entertaining. Once you get over your initial disappointment, you will start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The plot is actually good and it has enough twists and turns to keep you at the edge of your seat. There are some moments when you honestly go \u201cWhoa, I did not see that coming\u2026\u201d and that is proof that the script is very strong. Although the second season was very different from the first, it did have one similarity, DtB\u2019s trump card \u2013 the emotional connection. You are able to truly feel the character\u2019s emotions and this one factor is enough to propel you from the first to the last episode of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier in the short review, there are no major improvements in the visual department, which is still not a setback as the first season boasted one of the best graphics. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is once again solid, with a few more sentimental and soft tracks added. This was a really neat addition as it helps emphasize Suou\u2019s loneliness beautifully. The OP was a great track, with a good beat and definitely worth listening to every time. The ED on the other hand was very generic and doesn\u2019t deserve and special credit. The voice actors have done a solid job, especially Suou\u2019s. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as far characters are concerned, Hei has undergone a major change. He\u2019s grown his hair out, got a beard and has a bottle of sake (alcohol) glued to his hand. When he decides to take Suou under his wing, he trains her using a remarkable method \u2013 If she doesn\u2019t get it right, smack her in the head till she does. Simple isn\u2019t it? (And this \u201cunique\u201d training method was the reason I compared it to Karate Kid). The character development for both is very typical tsundere. Basically, if you like shonen, it\u2019s difficult to go wrong with this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe Bottom-line:\\n\r\nDarker than Black:Gemini of the Meteor is a highly enjoyable anime if you just forgive the generic characters and shonen transformation.\\n\\n\r\n(P.S \u2013 MILD SPOILER AHEAD \u2013 The animation clip of Suou using her ability is an absolute DISGRACE to the slickness of the franchise. I found myself banging my head on the wall every time the anti-tank rifle stuck out of the semi naked kid.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

He was broken after the events that transpired after The black contractor. We saw another side to Hei and we saw what it did to him with the way he interacted with Suoh and July and even Mao. Upon finding out Yin was alive, he reverted back to his old personality and look. The oly thingi have to complain is that he lost his mask and didn't get a chance to wear it, but those are minor details.",

If you saw the first season then I don't know how anyone can say this season was just as good or better than the first one.  In my opinion the first one was much better.\r\nThe story was decent and even though I do have a few complaints about the story it did keep me mostly interested in what was going to happen next.  I wished more things were explained in the story.  I mean yeah I did kind of expect some mystery like in the first season butcome on in this one barely anything was explained.  The only thing that was explained in full was how Mao lost his body.  I just finished watching it and I'm not sure what exactly the ending was all about.  I kind of understand but in the same time I'm still trying to get it all.  When I saw the ending I was like wait what, that is why Suou existed... and yeah I could go on and on about it but I don't want to spoil the ending.  The story was decent since it kept me interested, but to be honest after watching the first season I felt quite disappointed about this story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were kind of disappointing to be honest.  The only character that personality stayed the same was Mao(the squirrel) who used to be a cat and Misaki who is in Section 3 now.  Hei who used to be the lead protagonist in the first one lost his charm.  It is like he got super depressed after the first one.  Maybe being separated from the doll Yin(which is also not explained) has made him all sad.  Even if life did make him depress why is he beating up on children now?  Even though towards the end he does recover some personality it still wasn't the same Hei I liked back in the first season.  Suou who is the lead female protagonist in the story was good.  The only thing I can complain about her was how lame her power was.  Awesome she can make a big gun materialize which she still has to clean and take care of...?\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy watching this for the most part.  Sure there were a few plot holes here and there(even more than the first season) that were never explained and my favorite character Hei is a drunk who beats up on children now I still weirdly enough kept wanting to watch to know what was going to happen.  It wasn't bad but it definitely did not deserve a 10.  Even if you didn't see the first season therefore didn't have to compare it to that one it still wouldn't deserve a 9 or a 10.  In fact it would probably just make you even more confused.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 7 even though in my head it keeps going between a 6 and a 7.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Note:\r\nThis is a review of the first 5 episodes, I will make the possible changes by the end of the season. I also made it so that this review contains the least amount of spoilers possible.\r\nAfter watching the first 2 episodes I was instantly hooked on Darker than Black. It's totally a great amine, and would probably be up in the top 10 after done airing.\r\nIf you haven't seen Darker than Black yet then I highly recommend it. I usually watch drama/romance anime but this got me, this got me good. Darker than Black bases off of these special people named contractors, and yes thesetype of people like in most anime have special abilities, but this is where it becomes different and unique; the contractors have to use remuneration, or something that has to be done to use these so called contractor powers, this could range from making origami to ripping the hell out of your hair.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I love about this anime is how they add in little details like when a meteor falls a contractor supposedly dies. This is not the case with the main character though (watch anime, trying not to spoil), even when he loses his meteor he still lives. Other details would be: flashbacks giving information in the gap between the first and second season, changes to the characters because of factors from the first season, and making more of an emphasis on \"remuneration.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow the sound in Darker than black is superb! The opening tells a story in itself, it basically tries to input the message that when you become a contractor everything that you have, your dreams, and everyone that you hold dear will be lost, and that you have to keep moving forward. You will find this true within the anime as you progress through. The background music in the anime fit it very well, it was fast paced and complimented the action greatly. The voice actors fit each and everyone of their characters and are acted out very well. The only thing I had disagreement on sound was that the ending had pretty much almost nothing to do with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has also improved a considerable amount. In season one of this anime the effects were great and artwork was well done. Now in season two of Darker than Black, the artwork has been given more detail; effects being notched up, lighting and shading more present especially in the effects, and even a 3D perspective is added in.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters in the anime change drastically from season one. This is most likely from the problems aroused from season one. You see big changes from the main characters. One of them transitions from a cold-blooded killer working for a syndicate, to being a alcoholic working for the government. Other major character developments are that innocent people became involved and actually became the once normal living people into emotionless contractors.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime and gave it a 9. The originality, art, and the new ideas coming from this anime convinced me to give it a 9. Hopefully by the end of this season (which I don't want this anime to ever end), I will go over this review again and most likely give it a 10 if this anime keeps impressing me.",

Some people may not be receptive to change but once you accept that you will see the beauty of this season.\\n\\n\r\n[ Story | 7-8 ]\\n\r\nThe new story sets about 2 years after the events of the first season, and at the beginning takes us to Russia where we will meet our new MC. That\u2019s it, I\u2019m not diving more into the story. I will tell you that the changes implemented in this season made it feel fresh, different, mysterious and at the same time familiar with what we\u2019ve been experimented before. My hype went up just with the first episode.\\n\\n\r\n[ Art | 7 ]\\n\r\nThe art style is the same, but the animation got an upgrade. Movements feel good and smooth. The 3DCGI got an improvement too so as the special effects. What I\u2019m trying to say it is pleasant to the eye.\\n\\n\r\n[ Music | 7 ]\\n\r\nThis season packs a new OST that fits the new setting and the standards of Darker than Black. The OP is simply marvelous, I liked a lot the visuals that gave me actual feels when watching certain scenes. The ED has espectacular too, both visuals and music, really relaxing and enjoyable. I never skipped the OP or the ED, not even once.\\n\\n\r\n[ Character | 8 ]\\n\r\nThis part is the most important for this second season because the progress and outcome of the story is tied directly to the evolution of our two MC characters. Yes, I said two. Hei will have a huge development in his character that will be crucial for the story, the same goes for our new MC, Suou. Taking focus on the new character, it was easy to like. I find it easy to understand at some times and interesting to know more about at others.\\n\r\nAs the first season, there will be times you will inevitably laugh, because there are some character interactions that are truly gold. However, there will be times you will feel sorrow or pity, in the end, this is Darker than Black we are talking about. Feels tend to hit out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\n[ Enjoyment | 9 ]\\n\r\nAs I said in the beginning, I knew I was gonna enjoy this season, despite everything I read I knew inside me I was gonna like it and there you see, I loved it.\\n\\n\r\n[ Overall ]\\n\r\nOnce again, it was a fantastic season that left me wanting for more (remember that after this season, there are the 4 OVAs of Darker than Black: Gaiden). Keep your mind open to change and this season will not disappoint you.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed the first I guess season of Darker than black. It was entertaining, had a good story and enjoyable characters. \r\nDarker than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini is enjoyable as well, but not as enjoyable as the first season. It feels like a completely different series. Like someone has taken the characters from Darker than Black and put them into a different Tv show.  So I will list some pros and cons of this series. \r\nPros\r\n1. The action is good and Hei still kicks ass. \r\n2. The story is good and quite interesting. Quite different from Darker than Black but still enjoyable. \r\n3.The characters are quite well done, the new ones and old ones. \\n\\n\r\n4. I really liked the intro and outro music, this is just personal taste here but it is really good and fits nicely with this series. \\n\\n\r\nCons \\n\\n\r\n1. There isn't that much action, and what little action there is, is over quite quickly. Now I'm not saying there should be non stop action, but the fight scenes they did have could have easily been dragged out a bit to make them more exciting. \\n\\n\r\n2. The story was confusing as hell for me. Now this comes down to a fault of my own, I didn't watch the OVAs that connect Darker than Black with this series. So because of that I was very confused in a lot of parts and couldn't quite figure out what was going on. So anyone reading this, watch the OVAs otherwise you won;t have a clue what is really happening. \\n\\n\r\n3. It was really nothing like the first Darker than Black, which I mentioned above. So anyone who is a real diehard fan of the first season might not like this one as much, though casual watches will enjoy it. I'm not saying fans of the show will hate it, but don't go into it expecting it to be the same as Darker than Black. \\n\\n\r\n4. Since I didn't watch the OVAs this series felt a bit to short for me and could maybe have been a couple episodes longer. Because of the shortness of it, you don't really care as much for the side characters in it. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this was still an enjoyable anime. It had some really great moments in it and is a good anime to watch when you have a day off and just want to chill out. Even if you forget to watch the OVAs like me it's still pretty good, just a lot more confusing.",

The second season made Hei  a drunk and a lot less of a badass in my opinion. The story was confusing and boring, it made Mao a freaking squirrel, and brought us Suou, a really annoying girl with a really dumb contractor ability. The only reason i probably finished this anime was b/c it was darker than black and i decided to keep going to see if got any better but it didnt,Would not reccomend to anyone even if you did enjoy the first season.",

But its got its holes... \r\nArt, sound and animations were amazing. Definitely one of the best I've ever seen in any anime ever made... Truly astounding. Oh and I loved the opening, just so you know...\r\nCharacters were pretty good, but they don't explain themselves well... Why was Hei a drunkard? Does it fit his character? What was Suou's drive to do the actions he did? \r\nReally... Everything was perfect... But not refined...and everything had major holes including the story... which hurt my enjoyment...\\n\\n\r\nWEAKNESS\\n\r\nHere, I'll tell you guys what this story is missing. This sequel lacks what Deathnote and Liar Game specialize in: Explanations. You always know how L figured out how to single out Kira from all other people. \"He's Japanese? Yeah, this is because Kira's first kill was a Japanese person and he killed Lind L. Taylor when shown on a broadcast in Kantou.\" \\n\\n\r\nThis is missing in this pretty dark and serious anime... \\n\\n\r\nIt seems like it wants to be fast paced without the boring explanations, which was a good intention, but overdone... Hei's motive was too vague.... Suou's motives were too vague.. the ending was COMPLETELY VAGUE and well... I didn't really get much enjoyment from going \"WHAT THE FRICK IS GOING ON HERE?!?!?!\" \\n\\n\r\nOkay... so Shion made a second planet earth? Did only Suou and July move over there? What happens to Kirihara now? How is Yin doing? What was the point of those two twin dolls? \\n\\n\r\nIf you can answer all my questions, send me an explanation for the whole show... cuz that is the only thing driving me away from the experience...",

The ending of the first season was sort of messed up I was SO happy to hear it was coming back  BUT...\r\nI saw the first episode and i thought, \"What the heck? What's up with hei? Why's Suou the main character? What the hell's going on? I don't like this.\"\r\nAnd then I watched the 2nd episode, 3rd episode, 4th episode, which is all that's been aired and I must say, it is as good as the first season. There are a lot of mysteries to be solved yes, but the action scenes are amazing,Suou's not bad and the new contractors are SO KICK ASS.\\n\r\nSince it IS DtB, so far the plot has a lot of loose ends, but its still excellent and I know that as the show goes on, we have loads more in store.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are very nice, the seiyuus are brilliant, the animation is pretty good, it has interesting characters though compared to the first season, a bit more flamboyant, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch the episode.\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched Darker than black, go SEE IT NOW.\\n\r\nIf you have but haven't started with this season, SEE IT NOW XD\\n\r\nOverall: 10.

To avoid spoiling anything ill just talk about this in a very critical way. The first season had a episodic type feel (2 episode arcs) and that worked well for its story telling. This season moved away from it and had a full continuing story that revolved around a new character. I was annoyed by this child that i wanted to stop watching, im not sure what her character was suppose to represent but it didnt add any depth at all to the themesdarker than black had in the first part. I probably can troll on and on about how much i disliked the presentation of the plot but to culminate all that, it ends on a very confusing, abrupt manner. The style and art was like the first so i dug it. The fights and inventive powers the contractors had are always cool, but the centralized story wasnt developed enough for me to give a rats arse. I hear they are making 4 ovas about WTF happened before, but i would have wished they had shown those things before instead of after. Too many questions unanswered with too many loose ends to have my satisfaction. I hope they make another series and instead of killing off the entire cast from before build on them and make the story have more depth and feel.",

The style is on par with Season 1 and Gaiden. 3 out of 3.\r\nCharacter - I am not exaggerating when I say that there are no likable characters in Season 2. Hobo Hei? Just a violent drunk child abusing hobo. Suou? A brat. Mao? An annoying squirrel; he barely even features in the story. How did he even survive anyway? He was supposed to have died in Season 1. Yin? Now a suicidal godlike being. I never liked Misaki anyway, she becameobsessed with this one random guy for no apparent reason. It's like she has no life outside of chasing Hei. And then you add in the gender-benders, the lesbians and the pedophiles. I didn't feel anything when the characters died. 0 out of 4 for no likable characters AT ALL. \\n\\n\r\nStory - Absolutely atrocious. Unlike season 1 there are no 2-episode arcs, instead there is one 12-episode arc. The story is complete nonsense as expected. The entire thing is predicated on some prophesy about 2 vague characters \"Izanami\" and \"Izanagi\" coming together to end the world. Here's what actually happened: Shion made a copy of all contractors as well as THE EARTH ITSELF LOL where they can live happily ever after without having those pesky humans bothering them. Also, Shion made a male copy of Yin who goes around killing everyone (only humans, of course) for no apparent reason. If you thought the Season 1 ending was bad, check out Season 2. 0 out of 3 for complete and utter nonsense. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3 out of 10 for having no likable characters and a completely nonsensical story.",

Hope you still can understand me.\r\nDarker than black is  a post-apocalyptic, sci-fi, paranormal, DRAMA anime. Yes, a DRAMA. Although the episodes have some anime characteristics, like some funny scenes and little parodys, this show is a hearth-breaking story which shows how cruel can human be, and the suffering of an involuntary victim of a war. It shows howpainfull can be, how, in a  moment, your life can be broke down. If u have a hearth in your chest, you will fell sorry for every that dies. Although you will find too, romance, and action in the series, and an incredibly well designed suspense story line. Give it a try, it won't disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\nSome times this show is criticized because it seems to have a non-sense endings and story line. That's not true, the problem is that most of the animes are easy to understand; There are the \"evil side\" and the \"good side\". That doesn't happen in Darker Than Black, there is not evil side, just a bunch of people who doesn't know how they ended like this. \\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black is a hard and bitter story, which shows that how cruel we (Humanity) could be.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 10 out of 5, this show is a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nP.D.: About the non-sense endings; i'm working on a explanation of the finals of the second season, which consists in view little details that change the ending completely. I will put it in the discussion are of Darker than Black:  Ryuusei no Gemini.",

            "content": "I think most of the people that wrote the reviews for this season of DtB were ones that were enraged right after watching DtB:RnG. What I'm trying to say is that these reviews are biased.\r\nIn my opinion, I think that everyone, after watching DtB:RnG, should just let everything sink in for a couple of days and then write a review. This is because everyone should seriously admire the beauty of DtB:RnG because for a 12-episode season, it was seriously in depth and captivating. \r\nTrust me, I liked the first season of DtB WAY better than the 2nd, and I want a 3rd season as muchas the next guy. However, I can see how good the 2nd season was and why BONES wished to end it here.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThe story of DtB:RnG takes place a few years after DtB did and now it is about Hei trying to stop Yin from awakening and letting the \"Izanami\" come out. The storyline for this was great except it raised a few questions. One question for example is: Why is Yin the doll that becomes Izanami? Why can't it be literally any other doll out there? If the story really is following the Izanami/Izanagi Myth(Mitaka documents), who is Izanagi? Who is Katsuguchi? Other than this, the storyline was well thought out and it did well enough for to entertain the DtB fans and inspired them to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe artwork took a HUGE turn because it was WAY better than the first DtB. The sinister/dark/gloomy look of Russia and Tokyo were good, but not great.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtracks especially the ending credits were good. However at times I found myself giggling at how \"immature\" the music was when someone was talking/when a serious scene was going on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAh, this raised the most criticism in DtB:RnG. Now instead of Hei/Yin being the main protagonists, a new Russian girl by the name of Suou is the MC. When I first knew about this, i was furious. I almost dropped the anime. However I'm glad that I didnt because only for the first like 2 episodes it only focuses on Suou. After about 2 episodes, you completely forget that Suou is the main character because Hei gets as much screentime as an MC should be getting. I personally really liked Suou because as a 13-15 year old, she was strong and tough as nails to be getting along with the new Hei. Even in depressing situations she never seemed to give up and she was always strong. On the other hand, even though most people HATED the new Hei, I really liked him. The new bum-drunkard Hei is still the same Hei in the end except he becomes a more harsh, unshaven, long hair-dont care Hei. This didn't bother me because lets think for a moment. Hei lost most of the things he ever had in the 1st season of DtB. Now in the 2nd season, Hei lost  the only thing he had left: Yin. It makes sense that he would become a depressed bum after literally losing everything he ever had. However, as the time goes on in DtB:RnG, the relationship that Hei and Suou develop is beautiful and its mainly because of Suou that Hei slowly reverts into the Hei that we know and love. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nOverall, DtB:RnG was very pleasing to me. Even though the usual feel of DtB is gone, DtB:RnG still maintains the strong characteristics that DtB had.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime, if given time to understand it, was great. The possibility of BONES producing a 3rd season is close to 0 since it has been 5 years since DtB:RnG was produced, and the ending of DtB:RnG was very satisfying because it ended in a way for the viewers to interpret the future however way they want to.",

            "content": "This is my personal review/opinion of the show:\r\nI NEVER rewatch animes. I dunno why. Maybe it's difficult to watch a show again knowing what happens already, so maybe that makes it boring for me.\r\nBut for Darker than Black, there is rare exception. I NEVER get bored of that anime. Even if I know what's going to happen, it's always exciting to see it on screen or to try and notice something I didn't see the first time. I've rewatched the anime four times already. It's just that good of a show :') It's also one of the first animes I've seen, so that kinda givesit a bigger advantage other other animes I've watched.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I don't know how on earth I managed to bear through this second season. The second season is the complete opposite of what was a masterpiece of a first. \\n\\n\r\nI haven't seen the second season in almost a year now, but I'm fresh off of my fourth binge on DtB's original. I do vividly remember watching the second season though. I remember being very disappointed and having to take frequent breaks during episodes because it was just so boring and oddly paced. The story didn't really make sense at the time, either. I had to look up the plot on Wikipedia to get a better grasp on what was happening since it was too rushed and jumbled up. The theme and atmosphere were flipped on its head and lost that iconic charm to it that the first season had.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character was pretty annoying and kind of gave me Mary Sue vibes. It just seemed centered around her too much, when who I was really there for was Hei, November 11, Kirihara, and the rest of the iconic cast. But it seemed like they didn't get enough screentime, so that was kinda depressing :'( Even if they did, the characters were still changed drastically. Hei's personality is totally flipped, so he isn't that cool and badass Chinese Batman anymore, but instead, a lame and abusive alcoholic. and MAO IS A SQUIRREL?! WHAT? That was also an odd change.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score is a 5. I think newcomers or people who don't compare it to the first season would find some enjoyment in it. But people who are die-hard DtB fans will probably give their hopes up on this one. \\n\\n\r\nRant over.",

            "content": "I was so exicited when I first heard that Studio Bones was making a new season of Darker Than Black. Then... images of 13-year old girls started cropping up, later it was revealed that one of these teenage girls would be featured in the series as a main character. Personly, Suou, her twin brother and her friends ruined the whole season for me.\r\nWhether Bones found out that teenage girls, like myself, who hacked their parental controls and faked their age to watch the first season, then thought that because teenage girls like the series better than the males for whom the anime was originally madefor that they would actually put silly little girls in a violent assassin/cop science-fiction anime. The reasons why so many girls watched the series is because it wasn't made for them, they didn't want to see a bunch of jolly femnale teenagers go depressed, if they wanted that they only had to watch some shoujou anime, not a shouen.\\n\\n\r\nThe season disapointed me, but I still watch it, good God I own it on DVD. I enjoy watching it, though I would much rather watch the first season. There were points in the 12 epsiode season where I really, really enjoyed watching it, mainly, they were the episodes of momment that had a lack of young females, but there was even scenes with then I liked.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first read about Darker Than Black season two I thought that it would explain more about Hei and his mysterious life in South America with Amber and Pai before Heaven's war. However, we never actually found out more about that matter, which, of course, disapointed me.\\n\\n\r\nStill I like the idea of organisations at war with each other, which what Darker Than Black is mostly about, first season and second season. The mystery in the series always kept me on the edge of my seat every time I watched it for the first time. \\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was brilliant as most animes from Bones are. The anime has high quaity animation and art without doubt.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was good in the Japanese versions, but the first season was dubbed by Funimation (like most of Studio Bones anime are), which probably means that the second season will be poorly dubbed by them too. Such a shame.\\n\\n\r\nThe music featured in the anime was good, yet the two songs that were in the opening and ending I disliked. But hey, we're all entitled to our own say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\\n\r\nWell, some of the characters changed a lot, most Hei, who turns from an assissin bishouen to a drunk and homeless tramp. By the  second episode I wanted to reach out into the animation and cut off his pony tail, it just annoyed me so much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters like Suou and her friends, being typical defenseless character irritated me as they could never stick up for themselves. Except for Suou and her brother, who seemed to kill anyone who got in their way them ran back crying to either Hei or their father.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so after all my ranting about the season, I still enjoyed it very much so. However, I would only recommend it to someone who had watched the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rate the season seven. There are some aspects that I dislike and others where I thoroughly enjoy it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm inevitably going to talk a lot about the first season in this review, due to having watched the both of them back to back - note that I haven't watched the OVA's supposed to connect them just yet. I don't there's any issue with that however, due to the fact that there's no reason anyone should be watching the second season first, and because there's quite some differences compared to the first season.\r\nWhere the original series got to drag on at leisure with it's episodic structure, having very little progress at all for most of it's run, the this series was only half theoriginal's length and had to stick to a strict timetable to be able to tell it's story. Where the first season could develop a great array of good characters with detailed backstories due to this, the second season by comparison was able to create better main characters due to their development with the main story, but the side characters for the most part were left very unfinished and were offered absolutely no closure on.\\n\r\n   Overall I greatly preferred the structure and main characters of the second season and due to that found it even more interesting to watch than the first season I already liked plenty. I believe the short length of the season prevented it from reaching it's potential, and especially the ending was highly unsatisfactory.\\n\r\n   I liked how the series established a good number of strong characters right from the beginning, and did so through showing their personalities in action. This is an improvement over the first season and a necessary one at that. Due to not having the luxury to create in depth backstories for every character like in the first season they had to make strong first impressions to establish them instead - it's also arguably just a superior way to introduce characters, period.\\n\r\n   This lead to some unfortunate consequences also, however. The characters were introduced perhaps even too fast, stealing the focus from each other frantically all over the first episodes. This was another consequence of the short length, presumably, as was the fact that most of these side characters ended up receiving no development at all despite being at times very important to the story. A good number of them ended up dying off surprisingly quickly, used seemingly just to develop the main characters, while the others were completely forgotten. In the end, I think a lot of them should have been ditched completely to create an even more focused experience.\\n\r\n   What this resulted to was establishing the actual main characters even better, making them more interesting - if not likeable - right from episode 1, compared to the first season where they all had long arcs to establish them but barely actually developed at all. This set up a very good ground to build their bonds between each other, which were the driving forces of the entire plot. This is probably the best part of the entire anime, the fantastic development of the characters in the middle episodes of the season.\\n\r\n   Sadly none of the characters received what they deserved with the end of the season. Most of them were simply forgotten completely in favor of trying to desperately wrap up a decent ending. What the main characters got in turn were was some incredibly vague and surreal garbage that starkly contrasted what had been established of the world thus far. While the supernatural is an important part of the story, the general feel of the series is also focused on cold hard reality in which the characters live in. I have similar conclusions on the first season, but the incompleteness made it even worse in this case.\\n\r\n   Again, there's no way around the fact that the series needed more episodes. The ending was incredibly rushed, but even beyond that the series is missing many important parts. The side characters were left husks despite strong characterization, the main plot was very vague and ended as soon at it was established, and a lot of the attention to detail that was present in the first season is gone now, due to the simple lack of screen time.\\n\r\n   The production of the show was all around good, and overall even better than the first show. It did however lack a lot of the attetion to detail that made the first season so interesting, as well as the humor was almost completely gone - probably since it didn't fit the tone of the story as well.\\n\r\n   In conclusion, I really liked the show. Thinking as a whole, I think the first season was a way more satisfactory and complete viewing experience, but I honestly think the second season showed a lot more talent on the writers' part at least. The original was entertaining, something I'd watch when bored, but the focused experience and interesting characters of the second season really grabbed me, compelling me to watch it all in one go, always wanting to find out what happened next. Sadly the conclusion was less than satisfactory. I'd say it's about as good as the first season, with both lower ilows and higher highs, and overall being more to my liking in style.",

The music is once again absolutely brilliant and the animation is quitre strong.\r\nThe ending was a little bit confusing and unsatisfying for me. Hopefully we'll get another season that ismore like the first as this felt more like a mini-series/spin-off.",

The story dragged through pointless crap, got to the point where I justed started skipping through it.  I honestly don't know what they were thinking this newgirl was just annoying.",

Although it centered on the existence of the girl, Suou, and not much of Hei and the casts from DTB 1, the excitement, storyline and transcendance of the anime made me watch out for it every week until the end.  It still has the mysterious aura DTB 1 gave me and left me hanging with lots of questions.  But this does not make one frustrated of the anime.  In fact it made me wonder...\"will there be DTB 3?\". If you like animes that makes you use yourhead and analyze, science fiction,and interpersonal relationships then this is one is for you.  Especially that the Black Reaper BK201 is a very complicated character and well drawn to the point that most of us thinks he's handsome.  All in all, it's thrilling, sad, puzzlingand downright enjoyable.",

            "content": "*I archived this from my account on Anime-Planet*\r\nCritic's Log - Earthdate: June 20, 2012. Review #10: Darker Than Black: Gemini Of The Meteor.\r\nWhen you head into a dark path, your journey may be stained with blood, torment, and despair. It may be very difficult to see a light through the darkness. Once that person finds this light he then will have to decide whether to embrace it or cast it out and sacrifice it, and then... The gate of the soul will open...\r\nOkay, if that didn't make much sense... I did not intend it to... I am making fun of the Next Episode Previews fromthe show if you haven't noticed already, Here is Darker Than BLACK: Gemini of The Meteor.\\n\\n\r\nI got to admit, I enjoyed the first season of this show and I sort of had some expectations for its second season and I sure have something to say about this season like every other anime, that's why I post reviews here on the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe story goes like this. Two years have passed since Hei and Yin escaped The Syndicate. Making their way into Russia, Hei encounters a young girl named Suo Pavlichenko, whose family has been gradually pulled into the conflict between Contractors and various intelligence faction groups. Meanwhile, Misaki Kirihara has quit her position in the Foreign Affairs to begin her own investigation into Hei, the Contractors and The Syndicate.\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, this is obviously a sequel to Darker than BLACK. Just like the first season, it is produced by Studio Bones. This is also the first sequel that Studio Bones has made. The animation has improved slightly and the thing that has gotten better is the action scenes. The action scenes kick ass in this sequel and the animation makes these scenes kick ass.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe humor sure has improved a bit. Some little moments got a chuckle out of me.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one major annoyance from the animation department with this show. It's the repeated scene where Suo's gun appears from her pendant. It worked the first time, but to use it again and again whenever she needs the gun was quite lazy and it sort of annoyed me at times. I have a lot to gripe about this show besides this...\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, if you liked any characters beside Kirihara from the first season and haven't seen Gemini of The Meteor yet, you are going to get bitchslapped. I just want to give a spoiler alert before you continue on...You have been warned... how this show treated its characters really pissed me off. If you liked Hei, say goodbye to his Chinese electric Batman moments early on in Gemini of The Meteor. If you liked Yin. She doesn't appear that much until the last two episodes... If you liked Mao, Say goodbye to his cat appearance, the new character Suo is treated as a main character in this season and the story is about her and what she's going through. There are some minor characters that I guess were interesting and some were pretty cool, especially Mina Hazuki, she\u2019s a katana wielding chick that kicks ass. Her katana looks \"Lightsaber\"-ish, don't you think? If it is... The force is strong with her indeed...\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has a bit of a different tone than the first season, the soundtrack isn't too bad but it can be a bit forgettable at times. If you haven't noticed the credits in the opening or if you do not know this at all. Yoko Kanno did not compose the music for Gemini of The Meteor, the one taking her place is Yasushi Ishii... Don't know him; if you are familiar with the TV show Hellsing, he composed the opening of that show. According to some sources. This is his first composition for a TV anime. The use of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata was a nice touch and of course with vocals as well in the song... But I don't have a lot to say about the soundtrack; there were about 3 songs I thought were good.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting on both sides is good. The Subtitled Version and Dubbed Version are just as good as the first season. You can't go wrong on either version. Although to be fair, some cast choices in the dub could have been slightly better but I didn't mind too much of the dub. I thought Sonny Strait as Suo's Father sounded a bit under aged. Still Zach Bolton's ADR directing does not disappoint greatly\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one big disappointment. It is the story itself. There were some questions from Season one that sort of never gets answered. Season One had a number of subplots going on and it seems that the story is telling the viewer too many things put into 25 episodes, Gemini of The Meteor is one continuing story about that girl Suo. I don't mind the change of how the story is told. But the length of this show is a bit too short and The Last episode was a disappointment. If there is one thing that Bones should have did in the first place, it would be that they should release the OVA's BEFORE GEMINI OF THE METEOR. I AM NOT KIDDING, The OVA Prequel to Gemini of the Meteor explains on WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO HEI AND YIN BEFORE THE SECOND SEASON! I was really puzzled as to why it was released the way it was before. There are some things I did not like about Gemini of The Meteor. When Hei loses his powers, it was a bit early for that to happen, his hobo-drunk personality was an interesting change, but it is somewhat forced to show that he is depressed. Mao's sudden change to appear as a flying squirrel since his cat form was killed, Seriously, WHY!? I liked him as a cat. Yin being \"Izanami\" I guess fits but is explained in the OVA. If you haven't seen Gemini of The Meteor yet, I absolutely recommend watching the OVA first even though it was made after the Second Season and thus making it a prequel to Gemini of The Meteor. It will make watching Season Two less confusing and more easy to follow. The character development still is shot to hell; the treatment of these characters is depressing WAY TOO QUICKLY. Of all the characters, Suo is a far more interesting Contractor than Hei, and Hei was the main character. I really am disappointed on the presentation in the story and this season could have been so much better too... It is such a shame that Tensai Okamura who was known for directing Wolf's Rain to go this low in changing a lot of things in Darker than BLACK. If I really have to say which show is the weakest he's directed. It is Darker than BLACK: Gemini of the Meteor.\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than BLACK: Gemini of The Meteor is available by Funimation.\\n\\n\r\nWith That Said, Darker than BLACK has better action scenes than the first season, but the character development and treatment is shot to hell. The music is okay and the animation is still good. The Story for Gemini of The Meteor does not meet expectations at all. This sequel will most likely disappoint you. If you are willing to distance your disbelief, you might enjoy this. This is a disappointing sequel to a series that had some cool ideas.\\n\\n\r\nI give Darker than BLACK: Gemini of the Meteor a 5.7 out of 10. It is SO and SO\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to comment below and shoot for the stars",

            "content": "Darker than Black (the original season) is the best anime I have ever seen. It is very hard for me to choose a favorite, but if forced to pick just one, it would be Darker than Black. Every aspect of it is tightly woven to create this incredible tapestry of imaginative concepts, enjoyable characters, heady philosophies, mystery and suspense, beautiful art, emotional music, and most of all the story has a very deep, important and relevant message to deliver to viewers about society and the consequences of treating minority groups as subhuman and unequal. There is immense social value to the story outside of justentertainment and art.\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor takes everything beautifully crafted by the first season and smashes it with a mallet. Unfortunately it does not find its way back together to form a cohesive story. The returning characters from the first series are portrayed in ways completely counter to everything that's been set up for them in the first season and there is no believable reason for it. It actually destroys some of the characters' images so badly they are no longer likable in the full context of the story, despite they were incredibly enjoyable characters in the first series. For example some have gone from caring individuals to abusive degenerates. Not to mention some characters who we were glad to see make it through the first series get expelled quite unceremoniously from the second, which is really disappointing, while some characters whose fates were hinted to be somewhat conclusive in the first series are brought back, making their story arc climaxes in the first season seem meaningless or much less effective.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the abilities of the contractors are far less imaginative in Gemini and border on cliche. As for the story, it is boring, trite and convoluted, with an ending that seems random, makes no sense, and leaves many unanswered questions. There are some very unsettling themes such as child abuse and pedophilia, and when you see such potentially harmful themes in storytelling, it's important for the writer to handle them tactfully and clarify the significance of them in the context of the story. There's really no tact or significance to be seen here. It seems careless and thrown together.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know the positive things about this series (there are so few), some of the action scenes and fights are entertaining to watch. Seeing returning characters can be fun for a moment but watching where the writer has the audacity to push their storylines quickly becomes disappointing. My favorite part of most episodes was the ending credits because of the beautiful song \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" by Abingdon Boy's School (who sang the opener \"Howling\" in the first season). It's one of the few things in the series that invokes enjoyable emotions or a sense of beauty, sadly. I had a bad feeling when I saw that Yoko Kanno would not be scoring this series. She only signs on to quality projects, as far as I've seen. I knew that either the budget or time constraints of Gemini of the Meteor had likely prevented it from being able to achieve anything like what the first series did before I even saw it. Shame I was correct. I don't know if Kanno was offered and declined the role as composer, or if she was out of the budget altogether.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest warning to those who have seen the first season and loved it and are considering seeing the second is this: If you watch this show, a lot of what you will see will go against what you saw in the first show and will warp your perception of events in the first show, potentially harming the experience next time you watch the first season. For many viewers, myself included, it is sort of a slap in the face. I have trouble believing that the same writer wrote both shows because the first is so evocative and intelligent, while the second attempts to convert the series into a magical girl anime and is riddled with controversial fan service that deconstructs the first series in quite unwelcome ways. The first series was a self-contained story that needed no expanding upon, so to even create a sequel risks a lot. It'd be like a sequel to Cowboy Bebop, which if I'm not mistaken, the creator of the series actually said the reason he wasn't interested in a sequel to that show is that it is better to leave people wanting more and quit while you're ahead.\\n\\n\r\nI watched Gemini of the Meteor before ever hearing any opinions about it from other people or reviews, so I had no idea whether or not it was well-received when I watched it. My opinion emerged independently from that, and while it is disheartening in a way to know so many find it genuinely poor quality, I'm glad in a way that so many others can see how awful this anime really is because it gives me hope that the integrity of quality storytelling like we saw in the first series is valued and defensible among the anime community. Sadly, Gemini of the Meteor really manages to take the humanity out of Darker than Black, and if you ask me the humanity of the first season's story is the most important thematic element that gave the series it's freshness and substance.",

            "content": "Many people described this 2nd season of DtB as a shitty show which is nonsense and not worth watching. But I think they are wrong and this season is truly great after the 4 OVAs was released. Bones made a risky move with this show: first they gave us a vague and messy show and then they give explanations.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThere are 2 parallel stories in this show: The adventure of Suou and the story of Hei searching for Yin. While the 2nd is quite hard to understand, the 1st is still absorbing and good. Don't let the 2nd interfere with it and you will findit interesting\\n\r\nNow I will talk about Hei's story. It was vague and quite messy without the 4 ovas, I agree with this, but with those 4, it is clearer and more concise. It's very good and deep, but most of the viewers can't understand it, so I give it an 8.\\n\r\nIt's quite funny that Bones was successful in tricking us during the whole story. They intentionally make us believe in something wrong and then we feel that this show is full of plot holes. I can't tell you what it is because it is a big spoiler, but if anyone want to have the true answer to this series' story, leave me a message.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe action scenes are still awesome, in fact, they are longer and more breath-taking than those in the first season. There are only a few contractors, but their powers are interesting and cool, like Mizuki's energy saber or the Magician's true magic... Hei was designed as a drunken hobo but when he put on the mask and black suit, he is still cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening song is great, the back ground music is awesome! When Hei first appeared, it was the BGM that made me feel like jumping out of the chair and dancing :D The ending song is quite normal though\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nHei turned into a hobo and that was quite disappointed, but that will make people think: \"What happend in the 2 years gap?\" Suou is an interesting and strong-willed girl too, and Mao is still the funny part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nWhen I finished watching it, the OVAs was still not released, so I feel very uneasy about the ending, like when I watch \"The end of Evangelion\" but when I watch the OVAs and understand all of the meaning of this show, I have to say this is truly great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

I don't know what the author was thinking when they thought of giving us the future then hey don't worry there's 4 OVA episodes that'll come soon and it'll explain the confusion. Well that doesn't always work. I understand that it is exciting when you show the results then you go back on show how everything led to this result but YOU DON'T DO IT FOR A WHOLE SEASON!!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall I don't really want to say the second season was disappointing but rather confusingly disappointing. They made this season so gloomy and changed the characters personality 180 without really giving a good reason and then at the end it was like hey remember Yin the one you was wondering where the hell she was in the whole season well shes...bad??\\n\\n\r\nDTB was one of my fav animes and the second season really screwed it over but It's hard to admit that since it is a good anime overall. To anyone who watched the first season I advise you watch the in-between season before you watch the second season so the level of frustrating would hopefully be less.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Bad. Simple. The original Darker Than Black series was phenomenal, they used an intuitive way of telling a story though a bi-episodic manner (bar the last few episodes), but apparently a standard over-arcing storyline using a singular episodic structure reigns supreme. It would be ignorant and stupid to say that a bi-episodic structure is what would have made this a good series, as this specific story just couldn't be told in that way. Still, the fact remains that they decided on removing what, in my opinion, was one of the key features that made Darker Than Black a fantastic series.I'd like to mention at this point that I only saw the first two episodes before I had enough and dropped it, so don't bother reading the rest if you don't think my opinion is 'valid'.\\n\\n\r\n    Phew, okay, second point. Hei. In this series they creators seemed to think that Hei's character is something that people wouldn't mind being moulded to suit a certain situation. We see Hei in episode 1(?) talking to a member of the FBI getting work or something similar from him. This angered me because why the hell would Hei work for the FBI, it just isn't coherent from the last series. After Hei's removal from the Syndicate in the last series I would have expected him to go freelance or anything but work with the FBI. It's like if he worked with MI5, it just wouldn't (and shouldn't) happen, why? Because it's just not something that is coherent or easily justifiable. Also, giving away as minimal spoilers as possible, messing with a main character like they did at the end of episode 2 is just, dumb, illogical, and an insult to fans.\\n\\n\r\n   I don't want to end on a bad note when it comes to something Darker Than Black related as the first season is something I love and recommend regularly to people, so I'll talk about what I liked about the series (or, at least, what I saw of it). They managed to keep a magnificent art style to the series with very fluid animation, and they upheld a reputation of providing exceptional opening and ending themes. What was also good is the fact that they left a lot things in the first two episodes that could have had a huge impact later on in the series providing a 'Woah, that was fucking cool' feeling in audience members.\\n\\n\r\n   So, I'll conclude by saying that this series demonstrated more reasons as to why this is the biggest disappointment to Darker Than Black fans in the first two episodes than reasons as to why this is worth actually watching. I'll try Darker Than Black: Gaiden to see if this franchise has redeemed itself.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free broad strokes review. Other reviewers have hashed out just how terrible the plot is, this is here to tell you DTB season 2 might as well be called anther show. \r\nFollowing Darker than Black season 1 my reaction to this show was \"what the **** did I just walk into?\" The first season of the show established a paranormal world with a gritty undercurrent of syndicates, corporations and political alliances. There were assassins and undercover operations and some wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff. Okay, that's cool. But primarily the first season of the show was SERIOUS.\r\nDTB season 2 is NOTSERIOUS. There is a magical girl transformation scene that is in the first episode. The animation studio spent a budget on this and decided that hot damn they were going to make use of this underage bait fanservice, and proceeded to use the FULL transformation sequence every single time the main character decides to use her ability. Other contractors blatantly yell out their powers like they're in a half baked shounen show. This is so far removed from what the first season did, it's entirely like just firing up a completely different anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is dreadful. Returning characters from season 1 are either unfaithful to themselves or are just inconsistent messes. The new characters are boring and hard to take seriously because of magical bullshit. \\n\\n\r\nCan't really complain about the art or sound, but it's obviously not improved from the first season. Oh but the transformation sequence is baller though. They blew their load on animating the **** out of that, and then didn't do any other touch ups to the art style. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show feels like the mother of season 1 ran off with Sailor Moon and Naruto, got impregnated by them, and came back and had season 2. They may share a surname, but from the first look (episode 1) you can tell they're not really related. \\n\\n\r\nAvoid if you like DTB season 1 at all.",

Together they are also trying to find the doll \"yin \". The facts happened two years later after the first season.\r\nComparing to the first season this season is not episodical , what was definitely a plus for me. Hei teamed along with the girl \"Shou \" . Mao will return to the series as a flying squirrel and Hei comes back as a (more) depressed, maybe a disturbing appearance andalcoholic. This will upset the most people, but when you get over it you'll  enjoy this series as much as I do. He also isn't the protagonist anymore, but I think the supportive role suits him the best (by his inaccessible personality).\\n\\n\r\nOverall this season was for me flawless and need more attention. It was for me a 10/10!",

            "content": "It slightly pains me to write this review because I have to write it completely based off this season alone, which dropped my overall Darker than Black score for me. And please note that this review in no way is based off the first season as well. \r\nDarker than Black is set in a world where these mysterious and deadly things called Hell's Gate and Heaven's Gate appear and with it came along humans with super powers (called contractors because they each have a toll to pay for their power) and dolls, who are lifeless humans. There are many different organizations that are trying touncover the truth of the Gates and part of one of them is Hei, the main protagonist. Darker than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini still follows this plot but now everyone is racing to get ahold of Izanami and Izanagi, the new turning points to the story. \\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10 - I couldn't grab hold of what was happening during a lot of the anime. The characters were jumping from place to place and a very weak plot was followed during this point. The storyline then picked up towards the end but it was still quite confusing and everything seemed a little rushed. The ending itself just left you mind blown (in the worst way possible) and the details leading up to it seemed random and pety.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 - This is an area where this anime cannot drop at all. As the rest of the series, the art was exceptional. The scenery was always well done and the amount of detail put into the background always shocks me. The fighting scenes are always done well and just seem oh so cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 - The sound was decent and could have been a lot better. At the start, scenes which lacked complete excitement were over played with heart racing music which made the misplacement really easy to pick up on. Sometimes emotional sound tracks played while the scene lacked emotion which again was easy to pick out. But as per the first season, the OP and ED were amazing and really suited the style of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10 - The characters in this season took on a girly aura, there seemed to be a lot of feelings and love which felt out of place. We saw a whole new side of Hei this season and new characters were introduced. Most characters played a short role but their character art and personality were still unique. Shou was the main character in this season and she is portrayed as an innocent young girl which is different to see in such a dreading future and she is shown to see spots of happiness. We also get to see a deeper side of July.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Darker than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini a 7/10. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first season or the OVAs but it was still a good watch. There were enjoyable scenes but I feel as though it had a lot more potential.",

            "content": "\"Friends, huh? Even that very word is foreign to me.\"\r\nA Review of \"Darker Than BLACK: Ryuusei no Gemini\":\r\nSo, I assume any interest in this show comes from having watched the first season already, so I'm doing this review on the basis that you've seen Kuro no Keiyakusha.\r\nSo this show feels like a very good continuation of the Darker Than BLACK series, and yet, it feels entirely unique all the same. That's not because the main characters are shifted around or because this season is half as long, but it genuinely feels different in overall tone. However, some things remain the same, such as some blandcharacters and crucial parts of the story not being explained well (which were the two things that greatly plagued the first season). That being said, the story, in my opinion, was much better than season one. It's not that season 1's episodic format and mini-arcs were bad, but having one continuous story feels like it fits the story of Darker Than BLACK much better.\\n\\n\r\nLots of characters from season one make a reappearance and they're essentially the same, and the new characters honestly don't bring that much to the show, except for the new main, Suou, who is pretty much the driving force behind the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound and animation are very similar to season one, as they definitely should be, with the soundtrack adding a lot to the story (though I don't consider it nearly as good as the first season's) and the animation being very dark and atmospheric, though it does feel SLIGHTLY brighter, but that's probably due to a lot of the show taking place in snowy territory.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gemini of the Meteor is a competent second season that fits the first very well, being both radically different and very similar. It does suffer from the same things as season one, but it does so to a lesser degree and it works very well.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+The opening theme \"Tsukiakari no Machishirube\" is PERFECT and instantly became one of my top favorites\\n\r\n+Interesting story that develops heavily off of season one\\n\r\n+Sound and animation are solid throughout\\n\r\n+Some characters, such as Suou, really drive the show and make it more interesting\\n\r\n+Quality show from start to finish, unlike season one which took some time to get used to\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-The ending was completely unexplained and confusing\\n\r\n-Lots of characters are dull and uninspired\\n\r\n-Half the length of the first season, which wouldn't be bad if the ending didn't feel so rushed\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed season one of Darker Than Black, you may very well enjoy this season. Then again, you may not, as both season feel different in very prominent ways. The only thing I can say about this show is to give it a shot, because whether or not you liked season one, you may enjoy this season. I don't know; it's really 50/50.\\n\r\nAnd that's why Darker Than BLACK: Ryuusei no Gemini gets a 7 out of 10",

            "content": "Just finished Darker Than BLACK - Ryuusei no Gemini. I had mixed prejudices about this anime before i watched it, i read some reviews saying it was so poor in comparison with the first series, but at the same time i couldnt wait to watch the sequel as the first series was so brilliant.  I purposefully waited a while before watching the second series because i knew i would make too many comparisons if i didnt.  I have judged this anime in its own right, it would score lower if i was rating it as a sequel.\r\nStory - 7 - I really lovedthis story, it wasnt necessarily the sequel to series one as it didnt pick up where the old one left off and revolved around a completely different story.  However i thought it was a great story arc with the exception of the ending which i feel fell into place a little to brutally and didnt make complete sense.  That aside it was fantasticly compelling :D\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7 - Maybe a bit generous on the art mark, its pretty generic stuff nothing spectacular but what i love about these series is if you're paying enough attention you see logo's of real companies all over the place woven into the scenes.  (Look out for the Sony laptop)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 - OP and ED were great, Abingdon Boys School impressed me yet again\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8 - Some awesome new characters as well as new sides and developments of old characters.  I really empathised with the main character Suou, not because I necessarily knew how she felt but because as characters go she was well crafted. I dont want to go into too much detail for spoiler reasons but some of the development of old characters was interesting and horrifying at the same time.  Cant wait for season 3 to build on all of this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 - As i left DTB alone after season 1 to avoid being overly critical of this series i can honestly i thoroughly enjoyed it.  It makes a great stand alone story in its own right so long as you dont have too many expectations\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8 - I said at the begining that this was based on Ryuusei no Gemini alone and i have to say its a great series on all aspects so long as your expectations arent too high",

Yes, I understand Darker Than Black is not a romantic drama, but if you're going to add romance in there, add it well or leave it out altogether. Don't turn the main character into a lolicon just because you want him to stay \"cool\" and \"nice\". I personally don't think there isanything wrong with the characters themselves, neither with their development. In fact, Darker Than Black has many entertaining and well contrasted characters along with in depth development of the main ones we really care about. It's a show that greatly involves the audience to the point of affecting them. It's also not one-sided. Most antagonists get their deserved consolation. Even the minor characters are well developed. They are not just there as plot fillers. Compared to the first season, this season has less action but more of a story to it. I like this contrast between the two seasons. The relaxed pace makes the story more realistic. \\n\\n\r\nThis season doesn't explain many unanswered mysteries in season one, however. I kind of like it since it would mean that this series won't end yet, and we still might see even more interestinc characters along with their stories that would unravel the mysteries one by one. \\n\r\nBut, if they add more to this harem, I won't even consider watching it. \\n\r\nDarker Than Black would be much more honest as a story if they stop introducing more girls to the series and focus more on unraveling the mysteries from now on (if they don't make season 3, I would rate this show a 5, seriously) I usually prefer action thriller with a touch of romance, but not this time. I don't think it's possible now to introduce any love after basically killing off the girls in the harem one by one and then introducing more to compensate.",

Her brother becomes a contractor after he is hit by an explosion caused by a meteor.  Hei is still there, but he doesn't seem to be as central as he was in season one.  All together, the story is good so far, but it doesn't really create anything new from season one.\r\nArt: Great design, some ofthe characters are drawn carelessly though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: brilliant sound\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It really depends on what types of characters you like.  I found that Hei has changed from the previous season in that he's no longer funny, and I feel no attachment to him whatsoever.  Seems to be more apathetic.  But, the problem really lies in Suou.  Unless you're a big fan of tsundere stereotypes, you will likely dislike her.  I found her to have no depth or interesting features whatsoever.  It could change though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even though it doesn't seem as fast-paced as the previous series, I'm still enjoying it thoroughly.  But, seriously, Bones seems to enjoy killing off every single one of the characters that I like.  The only character that appeals to me now is Hei.  However, like I said before, if you don't mind anime stereotypes, the other characters aren't terrible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: My opinion of this anime COULD change, but I doubt it.  I'll probably end up finishing it anyways.",

They give you a new main character that it seems almost forsed that you should try and invest in, and although Hei has had a rough time they make him come across as a complete ass by trying to save the mains life. The return of Mao and July becoming a main character is a bit intresting and made the absensce of Yin easier to deal with. I don't want to spoil but some of the twists they throwin seem like they are just there to try and get me more invested in the character instead of the actual story. The ending leaves something lacking as if they wrote themselves into a corner and tried to make everyone happy with it. Although I'm happy with the main ending of what happens to most characters, but the ending of Hei and Yin is just left up to you to figure out and can be taken down so many roads making it hard to understand. The overall would be improved if DTB got a season 3 or at least an explination on the ending I could easily forget about replacing the main with an argumenative girl and give this series an 8 or 9.",

Perhaps I had high expectations, but when have the sequels ever beat the original? Darker than Black's universe easily could have brought epicness and awesomeness in a second season; instead, my hopes are dashed and I am left wondering: what happened?\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nWHAT HAPPENED HERE. This isn't a second season; it should be the first season of a different show in the same universe. The main character is now a side character and is replaced by a Russian girl?? I don't understand. I wanted tolike the direction the story went, but it was just....bleh. And not to mention nothing was memorable. No scenes, no places, no plot twists - it all melded together like a gushy banana. No one wants a crushed banana. Besides the fact that nothing really stood out, the story chugged along anyway, grinding my nerves down to dust.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was, as expected, gorgeous. There never really was a time where I doubted what world this was, and how depressing everything is. Happiness is as rare as safety, and they kept the artwork stellar the entire time. This was where the show really shone; from here, it goes downhill very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good as well. The intro and ending were both fresh and new from the first season instead of recycled, and it was a nice addition. Still, the original soundtrack was better. This one wasn't bad, however; the moments where epic music was needed, there was epic music. The voice acting, was, as usual, stellar. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI....I was disappointed here. Hei becomes this.....this pitiful excuse of what he used to be. Mao...what happened to you? The main character was whiny. And her power was so unorthodox from what everyone else had. There were hiccups and random unnecessary scenes here and there, and the characters themselves seemed static and unchanging. No one was memorable enough to really remember if and when they stopped appearing in the story, and continually I had trouble trying to remember the minor characters because there seemed to be so many of them. Overall, it was a disappointing cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis fell far flat from my expectations and I was thoroughly disappointed to where the story led to and eventually ended on a weird note. The storyline seemed to stray far from the original, and the characters remained flat and irritatingly normal most of the time. I was expecting bigger and better - but I got a slimmed down version of what should have been something extraordinary. I stand by my score.",

I then thought that it'd follow the manga (a remake, like FMA: Brotherhood with a storyline that relates closely to the manga) because shown at first was a girl.\r\nWhat I liked about this season is that it's a bit more progressive--appropriately paced, compared to the last season where sometimes it's just flat beforethe last two episode... Another reason, is that this season is not as bloody as the last, silly, right? What I especially like about this continuation is that Hei is more relate-able, I hope that was not spoiling.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like about this season is that... less Hei's action, more Suou, though I understand that it is a necessity of the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really like DTB2.",

I kept convincing myself that it\u2019s as good as the first Darker than Black but I had to face the truth that the show sort of sucked. I\ufeff was sad that it screwed up Darker than Black\u2019s legacy\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe plot was extremely hard to understand. It's like solving a puzzle without any clues. The story was so fragmented I can't make any sense out of it. It answered  some questions from the previous Darker Than Black but it wasn't enough. It felt like they made it so mysterious that it ends up not makingsense. The story was absurd and it was so absurd that it's almost unrealistic even for an anime series. Though it's messed up, the plot was still there and it was unique. Although the title is \"Darker Than Black\", the atmosphere had become a little light and not so \"dark\". \\n\\n\r\nArt  9/10\\n\r\nArt was great. It met my expectations from Bones.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe sounds and the background music was refreshing. It gave life to everything especially the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nI was disappointed that Hei was not the same as before. Now he is a drunk, violent hobo that doesn't shave. Seriously! He was the best character and the main protagonist in the previous anime. Now he's like a doll. He lost his powers for more than half of the show and it wasn't fun watching him. As for Suou, she has some character development. She's a very complex person because she's a contractor but she is experiencing changes in her emotions. That's what you call puberty. She's really confused about herself especially near the end of the series. I find it unrealistic that a 13 year old girl was plunged into all of this chaos and confusion and she'still managed to cope with it. Though she's very interesting overall. As for the other characters, some contractors were introduced in one episode and dies in the next. Misaki is the same as ever. July, however, is starting to evolve and it's always cute to see Suou and July together. It's absurd to see Mao as a flying squirrel. A former assassin that became a cute flying squirrel. Of all the animals, why a flying squirrel? Anyway, I liked the characters overall, just a little disappointed over Hei.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI think it was fun overall. The fight scenes were fresh and as interesting as ever. The complicated position that Suou is plunged into is definitely fun to watch as it goes on. The new characters and the nice character designs is absolutely wonderful. The music and the sound are interesting and electrifying (in a good way). I had to watch it twice to figure out the plot but everything was unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nOverall, it's a good anime, though not extraordinary. It may be a disappointment to those who expect a better anime than the previous Darker Than Black. Although, if you don't compare it to the previous anime, Ryusei no Gemini makes a fairly decent anime. It just didn't live up to my expectations and I felt horrible and good at the same time after watching it. My emotions were bittersweet. It made me happy but there is still this gaping hole inside me that was looking for more  Still, it's an unforgettable anime and it will still be a legacy of Darker Than Black.",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nRyuusei no Gemini (RG)\u2019s story is very good. While it is a sequel, the story can stand on its own two legs. However the fact that the plot is sometimes rushed and that many things are unexplained (holes in the story) keep it from getting a higher score. My personal feeling is that while it was engaging enough to keep me watching it, I doubt the impression that story leaves me with wont last, unlike some other anime.\r\nAnimation: 8/10\r\nThe character design and special effects were pleasant to look at. There were a few scenes where the drawings got a little sloppy, however as awhole, the animation is consistently of good quality. Nothing really stood out for me, be it in a good light or a bad light, so I think that means it has at the very least done its job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought the new characters and the old characters are done in a interesting manner for a sequel. However, going back to the idea that there are a lot of questions unanswered in RG really takes away from a possible score of a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nTsukiakari no Michishirube (OP) is my favorite piece of music in this show. While the rest of the sounds of RG were unintrusive and almost non-existent, the opening really gives it extra points. Further, the voice acting was well done for this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of questions left unanswered in this show. However it did keep me interested and watching. I can\u2019t help but feel some feeling of incompleteness after watching this show due to the afore mentioned issue.\\n\\n\r\nAverage Series Rating: 7.8/10 \u2013 Very Good",

I watched this without and lost a lot of the quality I think this could have offered. I was caught up in trying to figure out what the heck happened because it started in on something so remotely different than season one that I was completely lost.\r\nAs for the characters in this one, I was disappointed. I didn't mind Suou as a main character, but she certinly isn't one of my favorite anime characters. Having July as a main characterwas just plain weird. Having Yin in darker then black worked so well because she was a side character. Doll's just don't offer the personality to support a main role. Also if you are a fan of Hei be ready to be disappointed. He has a lesser role in this one, which I didn't mind too much, but he has definitely fallen. Drunk and abusive are just the start. Some of the key points of his personality from Darker than Black are missing here and it really was sad to see. He had none of his appetite, little of his two faced personality (the humor in him is all gone) and even some of his ambiguity that the first season offered is gone. Kirihara is still absolutely clueless as well though she does a bit better job this time around in keeping up on what is really happening. \\n\\n\r\nThe plotline got into prophecy and since I didn't understand why season two seemed to have no connection to season one I was lost, so I can't give a whole lot of input on the plotline. I did manage to follow most of it though and it did have some of the surprises and unexpected outcomes that season one did as well even for its twelve episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending though pulled through with a  bang and was at least worth finishing. The art was of course amazing as always, with the same great quality as the first season. \\n\\n\r\nMy main suggestion though, watch the OVAs! It will certainly boost your enjoyment.",

            "content": "Preface:\r\nI know purists will argue that series should always be watched in the order that they aired, but this is not \"Kara no Ky\u014dkai\"- the mystery and artistic integrity of the show is not ruined by watching it in its chronological order. \r\nI'd argue that this show is one of those exceptions were the CHRONOLOGICAL order is the BEST way to experience the show. So, watch the OVA, \"Darker than Black: Kuro no Keiyakusha Gaiden\" before  this (Gemini), as the story will be more profound and make a lot more sense.  Seriously, The OVA is literally is described as \"Telling the story ofwhat happened to Yin and Hei between the first and second series.\" \\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nI just finished watching this season of darker than black and I must say I don't understand all of the hate and claims that the show changed or switched moods from something darker and more mysterious to something more cartoonish and occasionally even dimwitted. That is not even remotely true. \\n\\n\r\nIf you watched and enjoyed season one of darker than black, then you know that occasionally they did throw in an episode or two of comic relief, and yes, even some slight fan service, and I feel that in this season they pretty much carried on the same tradition.\\n\\n\r\nMore importantly than that, and this is one of the chief complaints against this wonderful continuation of DTB, is the idea that Hei's character has changed too much and is no longer an enjoyable protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nI'd actually argue the opposite. His depth as a character is finally more than a Batman-esque, thin excuse to be mysterious. He and his comrades all went through pretty huge changes and emotional trauma between the first season and this one.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, this season focuses on the fact that Hei went through a lot of heartbreak and tragedy during his time \"on the run\" (as shown in the OVA). However, many people don't understand that because there was so much information missing between the first and second seasons. Its a pretty big, important stretch of time for the characters. That is why I honestly believe that the creators made the OVA specifically to fill in a lot of the plot holes and bridge the two seasons together, so it just makes sense if you are just now getting into the series to watch it in order.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate: the OVA is the necessary bridge between the first and second seasons. \\n\\n\r\nGetting back to the show itself: \\n\\n\r\nThe art style hasn't changed, and still maintains its charming neo-goth/ dystopian style of art. It's not up there with \"Standalone Complex\" or anything, but its still pretty beautifully crafted.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, both opening, ending, and the ambient music during the show itself, is still great and fits perfectly with the brooding and contemplative mood of mystery, and compliments the anxiety and depression of DtB's tragic romance. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending, just like most of the shows main events, is open to interpretation, and I think that's great. People should be more open minded and stop expecting everything to be spelled out for you, because that is just lazy writing. \\n\\n\r\nI love that there will always be a sort of air of mystery to this show, and that we will all likely make theories as to what actually occurred, or what the writers meant. That is the sign of a show that will weather the years to come, and one that will constantly be revisited as a staple in the mystery genre. \\n",

The first season was confusing enough with crapton of answered questions and cliffhangers.But this one only added more confusion to it and made my experience of this anime horrible.\r\nStory 3/10:\r\nThey had SO MUCH storyline to work with.It's not that they were trying to come up with plot as it progressed.They already had enough.But they never bothered to touch on any of them.Bear with me but I sure need to listsome of them.They did not explain:-\\n\r\n1.Why the 2 gates appear in the first place?\\n\r\n2.Who exactly are Syndicate?What is their story? Why and since when they start to exist?\\n\r\n3.Why and how is Amber related to the Heaven's gate?Who the hell is she anyways?\\n\r\n4.[spoiler]EXACTLY WHERE THE HECK DID THIS LOLI COPY-WATEVER SUOU OR SHION OR THEIR FATHER EVEN COME FROM?\\n\r\n5.[spoiler] What the heck eve happened to Misaki?\\n\r\n6.[spoiler]What the heck is Shion?What did he even want?\\n\r\n7. THE GODDAMN ENDING.WTF WAS THAT (sorry i just lost it.it was HORRIBLE)\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10:\\n\r\nThe art-style was pretty nice judging that it came out in 2009.The action scenes was nicely done.I really enjoyed watching all the fight scenes,even though the first season had better and more scenes than this one.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nThe music is astounding! I think the reason why I continued to watch it till the end is because of the background music.It really highlighted the scifi-ness of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10:\\n\r\nI think I am more disappointed by the character development than the plot development.It was even more horrible.Every single character are kept in mystery.And not even like mystery for the sake of making people think about them(like those psychological animes).It was just plain annoying and irritating.I would have to say- all of them are developed half-assed.I don't know if it has a novel or manga where they explain them better later on.But as for the anime,it was disappointing af.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10:\\n\r\nI gotta say,I only enjoyed it because of the soundtracks it had.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10:\\n\r\nThe ending was extremely weak.After watching both of the season,only thing I'm left with is pure disappointment and thought \"I should've just ended it with first season.I shouldn't have watched the second season.\"The first season ending was pretty weak too.But it was WAAAAAY better compared to this one.I hope they would remaster this season or make a movie or something with better explanation about everything.",

The design of this singular arc is to purposefully leave you in the dark for the sake of plot development, and then watch Gaiden after not strictly for an explanation, but further plot development. The creator's developed the story to flow this way and i intended to have you enjoy it as such, i only say this because the person who recommended it to me told me to watch Gaiden first, and then all plot twists of Gemini were ruined for me. \r\nThat said, the actual series is quite the departure from the original andfollows a more linear plot and focuses on a new protagonist. Of course Hei is still present and a main character, but he is not the lead this time around.\\n\r\nThe actual series is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, the problems that people have with it are not the plot or characters, but simply their change from the original series. The appeal of Contractors, Dolls, The Wall, and all the mysteries and alluring aspects of the first series simply aren't as apparent here, and that's why people don't like it. It is by no means bad, but it's true that if you like this series, it's for different reasons than liking the first. \\n\r\nI must say though, that the characters and story are excellent, and that the mysteries of the world of Darker Than Black are not gone or replaced but they decided to add more to those aspects in a different way rather than providing explanations for the still unanswered questions of the first series. By all means enjoy the series, because i'm sure fans of the original series will love Gaiden, but this must be watched first.",

Example of this is the cross dresser who owns a bar because of his wife left him.U may ask what this has to do the plotthe answer nothing.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest Gripe with this anime is how they showed this anime before the OVA leaving the viewer to wonder what happened in between to Hei and Yin.Also how they turned a badass character Hei to a drunk who beats on little girls.\\n\\n\r\nIf your a Fan of Darker than Black Skip this Season because it messed out on the charm of what made it good (Characters,Little Story Arcs, Action) to give a gritter story that falls on it face hard.\\n\\n\r\nInstead read the Manga that is what i call a true sequel to the anime that i love. \\n\r\nDarker than Black: Shikkoku no Hana\\n\r\nhttp://myanimelist.net/manga/14975/Darker_than_Black:_Shikkoku_no_Hana\\n\\n",

            "content": "So as a fan of the first Darker than Black series I was very happy to find out that there was a sequel, a continuation to a great series! I had jumped into it right away, without reading anything on it. I was confused, where was Hei and Yin? He doesn't show up right away? Okay I can deal with that...wait, he's a drunk? Why the hell does he look like that?!\r\nAnd with disgust I had dropped the show after three episodes, vowing to never watch it again and pretend that it was never made.....until I decided to suck it up and watch it twoyears or so later.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit, it wasn't that bad.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nNow I wouldn't say that the story in Ryuusei no Gemini was a direct continuance from the original. It's sort of it's own storyline with throw-ins from the last season with many of the same characters and names (IE The Syndicate). There is a two year gap between the first and second seasons and many things have happened to both Yin and Hei that are never directly answered (although there is a gaiden arc between the seasons, but I haven't seen it yet). Instead we are just left in the dark and are supposed to deal with it. Which may or may not be good, if you consider the fact that Hei comes into the show looking like a haggard empty shell of his former self that has a drinking problem, and WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE HIM THIS WAY.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're expecting a lot of Mao, Hei, and Yin action-- or any answers to questions you had in the first series then you will be sorely disappointed. Ryuusei no Gemini focuses on Suou, a 13 year old Eurasian/Russian girl; she is THE main character, the star of the show. Hei and Mao are kind of nothing more than mentors and guides for Suou to become the gun wielding emotional teen girl that she is. Yin doesn't show up until near the end, and she is incorporated into the plot in a way that you wouldn't expect.\\n\\n\r\nThis is rather disappointing because the first series had enough to go on to continue it, to try to answer some of the questions that it left unanswered. However, instead we get a separate story and a new main character that is vaguely (barely) connected at all. Ryuusei no Gemini is also considerably shorter too, which definitely gave no room to expand on anything but instead forcing us to gun through the plot.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the story was good--on its own. If you let go of practically everything from Kuro no Keiyakusha then you should be alright. But if you are really holding onto anything from the first series, then you're going to be left feeling \"what the fuck did I just watch, and what does this have to do with anything?\" or at least, that's what I thought.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAs always the art was great. Keeping true to the style of the first season Ryuusei no Gemini introduced some interesting looking characters as well as brought back characters that are easily recognizable. The animation was pretty great, but unfortunately not as heavily involved as in Kuro no Keiyakusha. This is because there are less actions scene compared to the first season. Mixed with the different color schemes and style, you can see just how tired and different Hei has become, and just feel when the mood is supposed to be dark or lighthearted (which the story/character interactions failed to complete) .\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nIn terms of heart pounding sound to get you pumped up for the upcoming scene, Ryuusei no Gemini did a great job with it's techno/electronic soundtrack, which seemed to fit the mood perfectly. The opening theme kind of didn't do it for me. I know I know 'but it was upbeat and refreshing!' you are telling me, I get it. I'll admit, it does have a certain charm to it, and I could probably listen to it over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nBut my question is- do I want an upbeat opener for an anime that is supposed to be dark, dramatic and mysterious? The opening for Kuro no Keiyakusha in my opinion, captured the overall feel for the show and how it would turn out. This on the other hand, made me feel like I was going to watch some dramatic slice of life/shoujo anime. Overall, I skipped the opener practically every time. I have nothing to say about the ending theme, as I most often skip those (because I'm binge watching, I don't want to waste my time on ending credits, dammit!) but I can tell you that it's by the same band (Abingdon boys school) that did the opening theme for Kuro no Keiyakusha-so there's that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nHei! Why!? Hei was the single most reason I dropped the show in the first place. I HATED the fact that he had sunk so low, that the man known as BK-201, the Black Reaper, had turned into this drunken mope who slapped Suou around. But now that I came back I can see the importance of making Hei be like this. Even hero's fall, and anyone can hit rock bottom. Hei was our fallen hero, and it hurt to see him like that...but as the show went on, he became less and less of an important character and his problems were swept under the rug by the star, Suou. If Ryuusei no Gemini would have focused more on Hei and the Syndicate then him being the way he is would have been powerful.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Suou, I kind of hated her. Yes, I get the fact that she's going through a bunch of tough ordeals in the series, and she's trying to struggle with who she is and how she's supposed to be. But it was because of this that I felt like I was just watching a girl go through puberty. And as we all know, puberty is never fun.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters seemed rather unimportant to me. They were either there just to serve as a plot mover, a shit stirrer, or for cheap laughes (which there was a lot of). Many new people come and go in Ryuusei no Gemini, and a lot of them had potential to be great. Unfortunately, the time constraints of the show gave them no time to expand on any particular background story, leaving most of the cast two dimensional, and largely unsatisfying. Largely, I felt absolutely nothing for the vast majority of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is a tough one for me to rate. I was holding onto Kuro no Keiyakusha for dear life, and ended up largely confused and unsatisfied with the ending. But the ride along the way was actually pretty great. I wish that they would have given Ryuusei no Gemini a longer season, because it might have made the show even better.\\n\\n\r\nNow time for the Happy Panda and Sad Panda award; this is my little quirk where I point out the best and worst part in the anime and give them an \"award\".\\n\\n\r\nHappy Panda goes to: Hei! \\n\r\nEven though his story had become overshadowed by Suou's I have to say I was deeply moved to see him hitting rock bottom and climbing his way back up. It goes to show that you can kick a hero down, but they will find a way and a reason to get back up.\\n\\n\r\nSad Panda goes to: Suou's gun transmutation scenes!\\n\r\nIf you've watched the show already then you know what I'm talking about. The first time Suou's giant gun slides out of her chest it was kind of cool. But does that really need to happen EVERY TIME she uses it? I don't recall wanting to watch a sailor moon/shugo chara esque transformation sequence.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n37/50\\n\r\n7.6/10= 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMy advice is this:\\n\\n\r\nDO NOT WATCH THIS IMMEDIATELY AFTER KURO NO KEIYAKUSHA!!!\\n\\n\r\nYou will be left disappointed and angry. Give it some time, let it cool down for awhile before trying to watch this. You'll enjoy it more that way. And keep in mind that you should look at this as a separate arc, rather than a direct continuance.",

            "content": "First review don't be mean :3\r\nOn the whole... I LIKED this show. The main idea of the plot was very good so it would be very difficult, however, when compared to the original series/season, they somehow pulled it off and made a rather 'below par' storyline with countless plot holes obviously with the so often encountered over complexity of anime causing so many points leaving you like '...but...why...?' even for those who have seen the first series, this also creates the problem of so many characters being rolled in and off the screen that few backgrounds are truly developed to the fullest extent ( ifat all).\\n\r\n        But, these things set aside, the art style I think of this show is one of the best I have ever seen with detail that does help to immerse a viewer in the right conditions. I also couldn't fault the sound perfect synch runs we what I think of as accurate sound effects ( I don't exactly know how stabbing someone sounds)\\n\r\n       I personally enjoyed this more than would be expected from my statements, mainly due to the fact that I found all of the characters to be humerus or quite relatable (Google says it's a word) at points both, and then those who didn't had a tendency to die.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I say this wasn't particularly bad, but after such a large time skip, you would have expected much more of an explanation for how everything is at this point, I would recommend that they develop a prequel story to explain all of this, although perhaps only as a spin off,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n as the series ended with a cliffhanger\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review, hope you found it informing or agreeable\\n",

            "content": "The overshadowed younger sister always has it pretty rough dosen't she? Having to live up to the phenomenal name of her older sister, never quite given a break. Unless she breaks away, becomes something completely different, and writes her own story. That is who \"Ryuusei no Gemini\" is.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nBeing just 12 episodes, she wasn't quite able to fill in all of the holes presented when she first came into existence. Certain questions remained unanswered, and evolution was distorted in order to keep face (I'll explain that in a sec). But don't get me wrong, the anime didn't present plot lines and then abandon them, theholes are only present within the gap between the two series. Overall the plot within the show is actually very well done, it relates a tale of a girl who never wanted the spotlight, but got it anyways, of her struggle to justify her own existence, of a broken man seeking a new purpose, of a child who never got to be one. It's almost as if the anime itself is arguing it's existence through it's story.\\n\r\nI expect the biggest problem people seem to have is that Hei isn't the main protagonist, but you're just going to have to get over that love affair, he got his season already!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nOutstanding. Just as good as the first. I expect one of the reasons many sequels stink is because they are unwilling to have a half season, and have remarkably lower budget that the original. Not this anime, she seems to have sacrificed the concept of a full season for a more complete feeling about the anime. A very good decision on the part of the staff.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nMy personal preference is always the English Dubbed (provided the voices fit). I can't comment on the original Japanese audio, as I never heard it. The Voices are perfect, all of the original cast is still there, and Suou is played perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 (NOTE: Don't worry references to the first series aren't big enough to be spoilers!)\\n\r\nSo here it is, evolution, as explained in the first series is occurring among Contractors and Dolls. For the series to include Hei and justify Suou's personality, they seem to have misrepresented the process that takes hundred-thousands to millions of years. But Evolution occurs in steps, so it is still somewhat believable, and there's a certain plot device to slightly justify the hasty change. That there is the only flaw among the characters, however. Everything else is executed wonderfully. The back stories of each of the protagonists, Hei, Suou, and July (despite what the MAL page would have you believe), are done remarkably well, they are able to tie many loose ends and answer many questions left open by the first series, not that they needed answering!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nNow I definitely saw a great many things I would do differently, but that was before I began thinking of this series as a stand alone arc. It relates to the main only by it's characters and premise, everything else is different. Realize that and stop comparing this anime to the original, and you will come to really enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nGive her a chance and that younger sister might just surprise you!",

            "content": "Going into season 2, we all had an expectation of Gemini. I was lucky enough to watch Gaiden before beginning this serious so I didn't have as much trouble wondering how the situation got to where it did. \r\nThe positives: \r\nJuly got a real role that he didn't have in S1. He was very cute, adorable and Yin-like and seemingly took her role in the series since she was given the absolute shaft. More random contractors with epic abilities and badass fight scenes. The return of Misaki!! Im so glad she didn't just disapear. Mao the squirrel. \r\nThe negatives:\r\nAs a dedicated fan to the HeixYinship, I was extremely disappointed with how things ended for them. The both became side characters and their reunion in the last ep was underwhelming and no one can be sure what actually became of them. The pseudo-shoujo atmosphere around this season. This time around we welcome a completely pointless main character: Suou. She provided us with a maho shoujo transformation scene and hours of blabbing in what should have been a show about Hei. The ending. What happened. To avoid spoilers I'll just say, \"why?\" \\n\\n\r\nGiven that the above tends to sound really negative, Ryuusei no Gemini is actually a great watch. It has AMAZING op/ed sequences that make up for Suou being a screen whore and some of the characters have great development like Mao, July and Misaki. Overall it is really enjoyable but make sure you watch the first season! It's even better!",

            "content": "After I finished DTB: Gemini of the Meteor I was surprised that so many people disliked it so much. I was able to exhale after reading the reviews on here.\r\nStory: 7.5/10 (but no half numbers of course -_-)\r\nI always walk into movies late, so I was able to sorta-kinda catch onto what was going on- something went wrong and changed the charries. (More on that later.) Alot of people would say it became more of a girl's anime, which I can see, but at the same time the changes in the characters kind of contradict this. It wasn't as extraordinary as the first series, tobe sure, but the sequels are never as good anyway. Held my attention very well and kept me wanting more, I was disappointed with the ending though, especially since BONES has said there won't be a 3rd season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nAs always, the art blew me away. Character designs were awesome, and as always, my main eyecandy is that these characters are believable- no muscle-men or girls whose eyes take up half their faces. The visuals alone can evoke emotion, sound or no sound.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI liked the soundtrack during the anime very much, although when I tried listening to it out of context I couldn't recall which scenes each song was used in, which IRKS ME GREATLY. Probably means I should rewatch. Voices were fine for me, I loved Suou's voice actor particularly because she reflected her youth and was pretty good with the constant indignation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI actually LOVED these characters, especially because of their flaws. Hobo Hei was unexplained without the OVAs but I kind of accepted him after the first episode or so. The lack of his powers was a little bit annoying but the fact that he was able to hold off contractors without them put him on a more level playing field that I appreciated- and the humanness of him knowing when to run. Suou was a little repetitive but captured an element of teen angst that was interesting as an onlooker- easy to sympathize with, too. I HATED Mao's new body, though. Although it had its flying quirks, he could have been something like a hawk or bat or SOMETHING other than the ex-pet flying squirrel. The villains were decently developed- and as always, I love how they're not EVIL-evil, except for Izanami, which was probably the last twist I would have expected, but enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5/10 (written as 8)\\n\r\nAfter tearing through the slightly irking beginning (which I later appreciated for context) I was captivated and loved it up until the end. The teen romance factor? Realistic and interesting- if you're stuck in an extremely stressful, miserable situation with one person, chances are unless they're incredibly unattractive in body or character that something or other will get fired up there. At the end I sat staring at my computer for a good few minutes before finally mustering up the will to go anime-searching again. I REALLY hope BONES changes his mind about a 3rd season, because there is nothing that could bring this thing up more. Only other flaw I saw was the repetition of certain things- although the quick flashbacks were powerful reinforcers for the storyline, some of Suou's lines were a little bit annoying after recurring more than once.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10 (or 8)\\n\r\nFlawed characters are much more interesting to me than perfect ones. Although not as good as the first, it provided a fair extension for those of us that were hungry for more, even though it leaves you with a much deeper dissatisfaction. Although a couple of things could have been cut out (as always) I would definitely recommend this to anyone who saw the first season- WATCH THE OVA. IT ALL MAKES SENSE AFTER THAT. More or less.",
