            "content": "Campione! well that was probably the best anime i've seen with ecchi in it.\r\nOkay guys before starting this i want to make clear that there are 2 versions of ecchi: showoff ecchi and romance ecchi. and this anime has a 90% romance ecchi and 10% showoff ecchi. (showoff echi is KissxSis style, and romance ecchi speaks for it self).\r\nThis is one of those anime's who is in commen with most harem styled anime's \r\nBoy gets powerfull or special, Girls love it and are competing against each other.  \r\nBut this is one of the few times when you watch anime's because of ecchi, you reallywant the action the happend like fighting. becuase it's just epic. \\n\\n\r\nWith this in mind i will give my honnest revieuw about this anime, and call out the good points from this anime and the bad one. enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nwell yeay i like it alot i must say, one of these story's involving taughts in real life like polytheism and the old greek style of believing in their gods. i like it alot that way and that it's implemented in the anime itself, that pretty unique.\\n\r\nalso the idea of becomming a kind of Hero after killing a god is awesome, With some extra Fanservice i think they did a great job with the story.\\n\\n\r\nart:\\n\r\nbasic art like most anime's not the best not the worst. lack in detail lack in extra face expressions. well yeay you have to get used to this in anime's which aren't in the top 100 of the anime list. still a decent job, but nothing to look out for\\n\\n\r\nSound: is like all animes just neutral, nothing special. pretty much the same story as the art, but again you have to get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWell yeay the first time accualy that the origin of the characters is inplemented in the anime: like speaking italian the first time they see the boy. and getting old habbits form back home which is nicely done. good artwork on the characters and great feeling expressions, again not to much face expressions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, that's up to you, I loved it and i think this has to be the most enjoyable anime to watch for me at this moment but well yeay everybody has different interest.\\n\\n\r\noverall: \\n\r\nI need to be honnest i think this anime would be able to get a 9, but if i look in a way of writing a revieuw, i would say 8. well yeay a great anime to have some fun. and i recomend it to you if you prefer it that way.\\n\\n\r\noverall recomended to Ecchi lovers, romance lovers, action lovers and Magic usage lovers.\\n\r\nNot recomended to People who are to serious and can't stand anything unrealisticly in ecchi/romance wise.\\n\\n\r\nThank's for reading, Any suggestions or pointers for me? send me a message i want to inprove myself in making these reviews, My english isn't the best out there so sorry for that. \\n\\n\\n",

Eventhough it ended in Ena's arc they could easily made it 20+ episodes if they put more details in the anime\r\nStory-7\r\nGreat plot.It was definitely nice to watch,I could easily give this a 9 but because they ignored too many little details I have to give it a 7. I mean Ena's battle with Erica prior Godou's meeting with Ena is not in the anime.\r\nArt-9\r\nThe art is nice,It was to my liking.I love anime with this kind of art.It is free flowing and theres not much I can say aboutit\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nThe sound is great.The ques for the music always fits the mood and the battles scenes have interesting sounds(especially the Golden Sword)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nAll the characters are great.They put in effort to introduce everyone and although Im kinda pissed off by Godou taking Liliana-because I like her as well,but its in the story so Its a trivial matter- but other than that,everyone was developed well in the story and I really got to know them all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7\\n\r\nWell,I gave this a 7 because the anime left out the details that I really want animated and they kinda twisted the storyline a bit but it didn't stray from the LN so,Im satisfied with that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\r\nI won't say I hate it because I rather enjoyed the whole anime.It is one of the animes that fit my likings although the story was terribly rushed.",

            "content": "To expect an elaborate storyline, unexpected plot twists, and incredible character development from an ecchi harem show would be one of the greatest you mistakes you can ever make. I came into Campione with no expectations at all. I merely came to watch an ecchi harem and you know what I got? An awesome show that understands how to make a story despite having fan service and a harem. \r\nCampione is a story about a guy named Godou Kusanagi who ends up killing the Persian God of Victory, Verethragna. As a result, he receives Verethragna\u2019s power and the title of God Slayer. After that, hebasically goes around killing out of control gods no one else can take care of. \\n\\n\r\nThe story may not be refreshing, but hey, it\u2019s a still a story and a coherent one at that. You\u2019re not going to gasp at anything or cry, nope, you\u2019re just going to enjoy the action and smile at the romance. \\n\\n\r\nCampione actually does have one unique aspect to it. The way he defeats the Gods is through an ability known as Warrior. In a nutshell, if he has sufficient knowledge of the enemy, their defenses begin to crumble and eventually they become mortal, thus making it easier to kill them. What makes it so interesting that he doesn\u2019t just say he knows a lot about the God then proceed to kill him, he actually tells us what he knows. Regardless of whether or not the information about the Gods is valid, I still found it to be one of the best parts of the show. Even if the information isn't true, I felt like I learned something and it was information that actually fascinated me. There\u2019s just something enjoyable about hearing about the origins of Gods of all cultures. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love this part of the story too.\\n\\n\r\nAction speaks louder than words, so obviously the whole show isn\u2019t just talking on and on and on about some God\u2019s life. Godou has plenty of other abilities. He has a group of 12 incarnation abilities known as Verethragna\u2019s authorities. To be more specific, he can summon a bull that rivals Hercules\u2019 power or a white stallion with the power of the sun. Each one has a chant, so whenever it felt like he was about to chant, I was always excited and ready to see which animal would come out and how much damage it\u2019d do to the opponent. However, they also have a condition. For example, the bull can only be used on people with inhuman strength and the stallion on people who have committed great sins. So there are those times, when you realize a condition is fulfilled, and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, damn, he\u2019s going to do it!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nNow, now Godou. Don\u2019t try to take all the spotlight. The girls need a piece of the action too and luckily, they do. They don\u2019t just sit back and pray for Godou. Nope, they fight. All of the heroines are some of the best to ever exist in the harem genre, simply because of that. It\u2019s always a pleasure to watch both, the male lead and the heroines, provide the action. \\n\\n\r\nNow the romance part of Campione is just satisfying as hell. Funny thing is, if the girl is knowledgeable about the enemy god, she can transfer what she knows through a kiss. The Gods have a long history, so you know what that means ;) The kisses last a good 10, 20 seconds. If that doesn\u2019t satisfy your need for romance, then I don\u2019t know what will. All of the heroines know about some god that the others don\u2019t, so don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re all part of this ever so pleasant romance. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is not going to look like the inside of the Sistine Chapel, but it\u2019s definitely good. The art should not have a negative influence on how you feel about the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn\u2019t exactly memorable or catchy, but it\u2019s not that bad. Plus you can always skip it, so if you end up really not liking the opening and ending, just skip it and go on with the show. Making yourself listen to it, then calling the show mediocre because you didn\u2019t like the opening and ending, wouldn\u2019t be a wise nor friendly decision. Also I didn\u2019t find any of the character\u2019s voices to be annoying, so you shouldn\u2019t have a problem when it comes to the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren\u2019t ones you\u2019re going to relate to or see as well-written, but they certainly do have good character traits that led me to love all of them. Lets start with the main protagonist, Godou Kusanagi. He is a great male lead. He says he\u2019s a pacifist, but when it comes down to it, he\u2019s willing to kill. That is one of the greatest qualities a protagonist can have. Kind, but not the most forgiving. Watching villains get spared is pretty annoying and it\u2019s nice that Godou understands. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the female characters, they\u2019re great. None of them are overly violent or annoying. Not to mention, they\u2019re not princesses waiting to be saved. They\u2019re knights who will protect the citizens of their country at all costs. God, isn\u2019t that just splendid? To have girls who aren\u2019t fragile and emotional train-wrecks. \\n\\n\r\nI, Zeroskye, swear on the River Styx that you will love the protagonist and surely find the bestest girl out of the heroines who just all happen to be best girls.\\n\\n\r\nCampione is an anime that delivers. Nice Action? Check. Awesome Protagonist? Check. Likable Heroines? Check. Romantic Progression? Check. They even decided to educate you about the entities of many different places; from Greece to Persia to Japan. Campione truly is one of the greatest ecchi harem shows to ever exist.",

Story is waaaay too rushed.  And also the cheesiness is beyond logical. I mean for god sake, passing information through a kiss.  The first episode was quite good however it just went downhill, how in the world did the main heroin go from being super embarrassedfrom being seen naked and hating the man character to suddenly sleeping in his room naked and trying to seduce him? First episode hinted this could have been quite a good anime, however the way it's rushed totally ruined it big time. Don't waste your time",

            "content": "To be frank, I had high expectations for the anime, the LN had a solid plot and was generally very enjoyable. Campione was an anime that I had looked forward to, but it has been a disappointment from the very first episode. \r\nStory: The anime is rushed, horribly rushed. Cramming an entire volume of a LN into one episode results in the confusing mess that we see in episode 1.  Understandably the animation would deviate from the LN, however the brutally mutilated storyline just makes me cringe. \r\nArt: The art was superb, everything from the detailed spell insignias in battle scenes to the characterart were more than satisfactory. Although not as spectacular as say \"Fate/Zero\", there was little to find fault with in the art for Campione, the only thing I could find wrong was how derp Godou's face looks. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Both the music and SFX were well done, synergizing with the tone of each scenario. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Yes, not everyone has been properly introduced, and it's too early to have a final verdict , but from the way things are heading, characterization is likely to be another victim of the horrible pacing of the adaptation. The rapid introduction of one heroine after another without any significant effort to develop each character as we have seen in the first two episodes is likely to continue as the anime continues at the blistering pace it has set itself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  The anime itself is very enjoyable and appeals to a wide range of audiences. Everything from the action and battles to the fanservice attributes to a very entertaining and fun anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Although I was disappointed with it and it could have been potentially much better, Campione is by no means \"bad\". It is extremely fun to watch and an enjoyable experience and you will by no means regret watching it.",

For a fairly interesting concept it does very little to wow me in the ways of story or characters.\r\nI find most of the characters not very likable or even memorable so far. With the exception of one cast member i feel most are far to obnoxious,silent or superfluous to the show so far. Even character designs are lack luster and leave more to be desired. With cliche things like a shrine maiden,school boy and samurai girl i feelpretty unimpressed with the cast.\\n\\n\r\nBack on topic with plot, it feels very minimal and just sloppy in a way. When i watch this i feel like they did not really put much effort into it. I mean the initial episode had clashes of gods but everything after was just owls and swords which is just to literal. For a character gifted with 10 god powers he uses them all very scarcely and focuses more time on impressing a shrine girl. And despite the fact he has 10 powers it still always ends in one last desperate strike to end it all a anime staple of the genre but very poorly done for this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are generic and not note worthy in anyway. \\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment of this show is so low i find watching this to be my low point of the day and i actually put it off and pause it numerous times just cause i get bored of it so quickly. I really think this anime lacks far too much and most people will find it tasteless and without substance so i give you a 3.  A poorly done anime.",

Expect a lot of girl/guy interactions at all times, especially during the fighting scenes.  On top of that, do you like well-designed girls, magic, and an MC who isn't a enfeebled, useless, chump? In other words, if you have expressed some interest into watching this show you must be into the shounen/ecchi genres, so this review will be how adept this anime performs in being a worthy shounen/ecchi action anime.  This is a review, so I'm just tryingto be helpful in judging whether or not you will like this show\u2014this is some insight without any spoilers to give a hint of the overall gist of the story. \\n\r\n===== Basic Info =====\\n\r\nCampione! is set in modern-day and begins with a normal, somewhat lackadaisical main protagonist, Kusanagi Godou who is ignorant to all of the magic present in the world.  One day, while unknowingly delivering a precious magical artifact as an errand for his grandfather, he encounters a Great Knight, and gets caught up in the world of magic.  In an overwhelming series of events, he defeats a god using his magical artifact, and thus begins Campione!\\n\\n\r\n====== Characters: 7.5 ======\\n\r\n Kusanagi Godou\\n\r\nHe typifies the dense MC archetype, the lucky chum loved by a variety of females, and a character done many times before.  Nothing special can define him: he is your typical shounen hero who girls fawn over due to his exhibition of such a righteous sense of ethical altruism, though his character design/voice isn't unlikable unlike some other harem characters (cough*  Makoto cough*.)  He can actually be a decent character that can actually be badass, uhhhh sometimes.  The girls ostensibly think of him as someone who is very 'different' and 'worthy' compared to all of the other gods, and this is their basis for their feelings for him.\\n\\n\r\nThe Girls(The good girls)\\n\r\nEach of the girl has errrr say a realistic looking body size, bust and everything.  No abnormally flat-chested girls, or the girl with the gigantic cow udders.  This is actually a positive thing for this anime/genre.  This show, often compared to The Familiar of Zero or Shakugan no Shana actually offers a fresh set of WORTHY(not saying the Shana or Louise are bad characters at all! ) girls who all get a decent chance at the MC.  I found myself rooting for a side character I got personally attached to, not the main girl at times due to the fact that all of these girls' personalities are not entirely clich\u00e9d.  Like real life, the girls have unique in the way they act towards the MC, but at the same time, they possess similar tendency and disposition in that they all, in someway, feel for the MC.  I felt like most of the girls had a real chance with the MC, which is fresh and a welcoming harem aspect, from other similar animes where the harems are so obvious that we facepalm at every new girl that interacts with the MC.  Needless to say, the interactions between the girls and the MC are quirky at times and are overall, designed fairly well.\\n\\n\r\nAntagonists(See second paragraph of Story Section)\\n\\n\r\n====== Story: 6.5 ======\\n\r\nStraightforwardly, Campione! is an uncomplex, linear, story that typifies the bash-em-up shounen/ecchi anime with set in the premise of Greek and Roman mythology; the story may be a weaker component of this anime, but that doesn't make the anime a 'not watch' for any reason.  The plot is driven through Kusanagi Godou and his onslaught of various gods.  As you can probably already tell, Kusanagi Godou is a God-Slayer, higher than a god (an overpowered character), so the results for each fight is practically predictable.  In almost every other episode, there is always a sense of imminent danger to the highest degree, god scaled world threatening situations where the puissant protagonist is always thrown into.  However, unlike other animes, the way that the show goes about this is . . . an edification of greek and roman god knowledge.  WAIT, what, the plot moves forward through history lessons? Yes, as implausible as this sounds, this is the defining factor in this anime, it is whoever knows more about the true identity of the deity triumphs.  As Godou learns more and more about Greek and Roman mythology, he taps into his otherworldly power.  However, the only way for him to gain this knowledge is through kissing (no joke).  Learning = kissing = power.  This is how the MC wins, every time he learns new 'history' about Greek and Roman deities through and punishes the enemy 'gods', who are often 'messing around' because they are bored.  \\n\\n\r\n\"I used to think that they were these mighty, omniscient beings. But now that I've actually met them, gods seem more childish than anyone.\" \u2014Kusanagi Godou.  This quote is in actuality, a very accurate representation for the motive behind the misbehaving of the gods(the antagonists); it displays why these gods are all antagonistic.  These gods, like children,  just want to have some fun because they are just THAT bored and carefree.  Watching gods mess around might sound interesting, but  this leads to the clich\u00e9d 'The world will end if we don't defeat the enemy theme' in almost EVERY episode, starting from episode one. This anime is not spectacular by any means but does not fall into a pit of inferiority due to its strong cast and really catering to people who love kickass-shounen at heart.  It is an anime without a deep intricate plot.  Uncomplex and simplistic, the story revolves around how the main character literally runs around his unraveling the history of gods, which defeat the enemy, all while gathering more girls to be a part of his troupe.  Rinse and repeat this.  This archetype of an anime has been done many times before and is therefore not a high priority must watch, but is a fine-dandy anime if you find you have some desperate time to dawdle\u2014it's solid watch for shounen/ecchi fans.\\n\\n\r\n===== Art: 9 ======  \\n\r\nNo squabbles here, the characters, all of them are well-drawn.  The girls are distinctly different from each other, without being too blatant.  This show does a wonderful of keeping the girls' appearances realistic, avoiding the all too common geeky super smart nerdy girl with zero tits who is actually a surprisingly talented fighter, or the ironic innocent, big breasted girl who has had no experiences with males.  The anime had a decent budget, and thus the art for the time was pretty good art.  Watching the show in HD actually makes a difference as the art is fluid and natural with well-animated fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\n===== Sound: 8 =====\\n\r\nNot much to comment about here.  The opening and ending are standard upbeat j-pop songs with nothing too special.  The music really sets the mood for this anime.  Other background tunes are unobtrusive and to a certain degree, somewhat enthralling, but there are no 'standout' must listen to soundtracks.  Right off the bat, it can be easily observed that this anime will be a lighthearted ecchi/shounen flick with a developING(never fully develops) romantic subplot.  Voice acting is superb with a talented cast, no annoying characters/voices here.\\n\\n\r\n  ====== Enjoyment: 7.5 rounded to 8 /Final Note ======\\n\r\nOverall, an enjoyable shounen/ecchi built on its solid cast, gorgeous girls, refined artwork, and fluid animations.  Do not expect to expect to be too immersed into a deep story here.  Watching this show is effortless; don't think too much on the simplistic plot, but indulge yourself into the other elements that were well executed.  I quite enjoyed this show due to the attractive, realistic looking characters, and their quirky interactions they had with the MC.  The ending for was quite lackluster, par at best, but there is always the completed (translated) light novel that continues the story if you are left craving for more.\\n",

            "content": "Do you love tales of gods and mythology ranging from Athena the goddess of wisdom to Osiris the Egyptian god of death?\r\nWell, Campione, revolves around slaying gods and making their powers your own.\r\nStory-8\r\nIt's a truly fascinating story. Kusanagi, a boy steals a gods power and continues to slay gods. However he's no ordinary god slayer. He does as he wishes and tries to avoid slaying and fighting. Instead of slaying gods for their powers, he becomes a traditional kind hero and gains support. Beside him are a priestess princess and erica, a \"red devil\", who counter eachother's ideals and both try to make kusanagi theirideal campione. \\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nThe art is lovely. It has great modern 21st century art. Just looking at it makes me proud of how far the world has advanced. The battle scenes are absolutely fantastic and the background on every image makes you go woah, amazing ( well it made me say that ;P ).\\n\r\nSound-9 \\n\r\nThe music fits the scenes very well. For example the battle music helps you get excited and the background music helps you focus on what is happening, rather than distract you from the show and I can hear all the dialogue very clearly. The voice acting is great and lets you get into the mood. The opener and closing songs are fit the show and are quite nice.\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nNo character really pisses you off too much and the characters are not monotoned robots. They all have their own personalities. Personally I prefer heroes willing to kill but everyone has their own tastes. There is a harem which may be a little bit annoying but I personally think Godou ( the main character) deserves it as he earned them and boost the fun in the show and lightens the show up after a fight scene or whatever. I also really love the character's interactions with cute jealousy and funny humor. There also isn't that much fanservice and gets straight to the point.\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nThe series is really enjoyable if you're looking for shounen hero powns everyone show. This is one of the best in my opinion with the great art, nice plot without holes, fantastic music, fun character interactions and more.  This is shounen.\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nThe show seems very promising but a bit rushed as many things are skipped ( I didn't read the light novel but it's quite obvious). This isn't a \"genius against genius\" show like Death note or code geass but it is an enjoyable show, very similar to bleach or naruto but god slaying instead of ninjas or shinigami. It has a few flaws but the fantastic quality makes up for it and makes this show worth watching. I personally think everyone should at least give it a shot to see whether or not you like it.",

            "content": "There are a few basic conditions that you have to meet to like this anime.\r\n1. Do you like mythology? (Mostly Greek, with a little bit of Persian and Egyptian)\r\n2. Do you like harem? \r\nThe first one is extremely important. The entire story revolves around mythical gods and heroes, so if you get bored from that kind of stuff or just straight out don't like it, this anime is not for you. \r\nGodou, the main character, defeats a god called Verethragna, the Oriental god of War and Victory. He takes his powers, called Authorities, and basically his job is to fight other mythological gods who threatenhumanity's safety, although that's not really the focal point. The overall threat is the Prophecy of the Starless Night, which says a rogue god will claim his/her powers and end the world. But being a God-Slayer and all, he naturally attracts girls and that's where the harem part comes in, but the girls play a crucial part in each of his battles, so it's not just about them falling in love with him. The plot sounds a bit cheesy, and to some extent, it is. That's why it's so important that you do enjoy stories about mythology, or else this show will bore you. \\n\r\nBut if you do love mythology like I do, you're going to love this show. The fight scenes are epic; not just the action, but the dialogue exchanged between the opponents. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are brilliant; the battle theme used is pretty incredible; search it up on Youtube if you want a listen. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, I really liked the male harem lead since he was kind but also badass; some harem leads may be kind but they're too weak. He tries to be a pacifist, but if one of his friends is in trouble, he'll do anything to help them. \\n\r\nThe main girl, Erica Blandelli, is powerful, seductive, and intelligent. She saves Godou's life multiple times, and he definitely could not have made it far without her. She constantly professes her love to him, but he remains doubtful, and you will see why after the second episode. He doubts her, but he also says he trusts her completely, so their interaction is pretty entertaining as you try to figure out who's really in control of their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime because I have an obsession with mythology, so if you like that kind of stuff too, definitely give this a watch. If not, I'd still recommend it if you like comedy and harem mixed in with epic fight scenes. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Who the heck is Athena? Perseus? Metis?\r\nGet your answer in this anime!  Nah kidding. Google it! Much as this anime about Gods, I believe you don't want to watch this anime because you want to learn more about Gods right? Unless you want to use this as an excuse to learn Greek history about Gods when you got banned by your parents and not allowed to use the internet to watch anime.\r\nStory:6/10\r\n  Ok, this story about a high-schooler, defeating a god unintentionally and became a god slayer. Well, the story is simple. He wants to lead a normal and peaceful life, not botheringabout Gods even though he is supposed to slay them. However, the Gods interfered with his normal and peaceful life. A few episodes each dedicated to fighting the Gods. Simple and boring plot as some might see. I mean come on! Repeating the story type of plot again and again with different characters? Boring? NO! Even though the plot is a little repetitive the action in every episode is unique and somewhat different which never fail to surprise me. Trust me, though the plot may seem a little repetitive, I dare say that it doesn't feel that way when you actually get down and watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:5/10\\n\r\n  Not very desirable in my opinion for a 2012 produced anime. When I first watched it, I was like: Oh! Why haven't I seen this anime a few years back. Went to research, got mind-blown because it was a 2012 produced anime. This kind of art kind of gives people a sense of lethargy, so don't ever start the anime if you are already feeling tired because you might just be lullabied by the art of this anime. Get over the first episode and you finally get the story, you'll be fine with the rest of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:8/10\\n\r\n  Really catchy OSTs, opening and ending. To me, when an anime has really good sounds, it's practically a sign that this anime is gonna be awesome. The OSTs just sets the audience into the right mood. Battle-type OST, you'll be prepared that a epic battle is about to happen. Escape-type OST, you'll know that there will be an epic escape from people. Beautiful opening: Brave blade by Megu Sakuragawa. Really catchy and allows me to get into this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8/10\\n\r\n  The characters are all quite funny, especially Erica,who enjoys teasing Godou. And not to mention when Godou responds to her teasing. However funny the characters may be, there is a serious side to them. The serious side    to them is when they get really frustrated and determined to do something, becoming a over-powering hero.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10\\n\r\n  Really enjoyed this anime because it is action-driven anime. I love action animes. Kind of gets you to the chuunibyou mood. On top of that, I actually get to learn more about Gods! Warning: Beware not to watch the 2nd last episode of the anime in front of your parents. You have been warned! \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watch this anime, go watch it. I'm almost 75% sure you'll enjoy this anime. Thank you.",

Every week I feel as though I'm forcing myself to keep up and continue watching (I've watched tons of animes and this is the first time I felt that way). Perhaps it's because the story has a lot of little details and feels kind of rush...though at the same time it really doesn't go anywhere. It's definitely worth ashot, but don't get your hopes to high. The biggest reason why I'm still watching this is probably for the romance and since I refuse to drop an anime.",

Campione is also a very original anime which brings a whole new experience to us viewers .\r\nThe story\r\nCampione is a story where a sixteen year old boy who got into an adventure and ended up slaying one of the heretic gods , Verethragna . Thus he became the 7th and the youngest campione , and he have to stop other troublesome gods alongside with his companions . Campione set itselfin a supernatural theme and it succeeded in combining different elements along its progression . The plot was superb and it gives viewers a whole new experience .However every anime has its flaws , pushing the positive factors aside , the series really felt rushed and they left out lots of background information . This sometimes causes me to wonder if I have missed an episode . Especially during the last arc , when they tried to squeeze everything in just 2 episodes . I'd rather wait for a 2nd season . Nevertheless the story never failed to make me crave for the next episode\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe character design was average and it was too generic .However the action scenes was spectacular in particular the part where Godou had to fight against sasha voban . Whereas some scenes were so intensely portrayed that it became rather disturbing - \"ahem\" . But these made campione such an unique anime compared to other typical animes\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe series make excellent use of its soundtracks . It was fabulously presented . The action scenes were definitely more intense . At the same time , they managed to balance out between light-hearted moments and serious action scenes . The opening song Brave Blade was average .\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast was top notch , it can be seen that they had put in their upmost effort and they deserved to be praised . Their voices \u00a0fit their roles perfectly and it highlights their personalities even more . I definitely have to mention Yo-shit-sugu matsuoka who did a great job in voicing Godou.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters in Campione have their own unique personalities . However it was not fully developed and this causes the anime to go downhill as it progresses .\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nGodou Kusanagi - the main protagonist of this series . He has a personality that makes him shine as a main character . Godou has often shown very oxymoronic and self contradictory behaviour . For e.g he is a shy young man but yet he is a natural lady-killer . He is also a self-proclaimed pacifist and will fight only when needed . However nothing about his history was mentioned , thus we do not know anything beyond his current self .\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nErica Blandelli - the main female protagonist of the series . She is a courageous woman who feels no shame in declaring her love for Godou to everyone else . She is also passionate and strong willed . She too , lacked development and it is clearly seen in the drastic change of feelings towards Godou in merely one episode. It really felt extremely rushed .\\n\\n\r\nYuri Mariya - the second main female protagonist . She is very shy and normally speaks politely . And the scary thing is that when she gets angry , it's hard to distinguish if she's speaking politely or she's angry . Even though the series slightly touched on her past , it was merely the tip of an iceberg and we still don't know anything more than simply just a maiden who was involved in a ritual and now falls in love with Godou .\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLiliana kranjcar - the third main female protagonist of the series . She is a beautiful , slender girl who has a serious and knight-like personality . Because of her personality , she is often made fun of by Erica and the rest . She also tends to hide her feelings for Godou ,which is the exact opposite of Erica .\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least , Ena seishuuin . The last main female protagonist of the series . She has a very strange personality that she seems relaxed about the things in the modern world\\n\r\nbut still has a slight naivet\u00e9 in her . She acts on her instinct and impulse , rather than her wits . I personally do not think that her existence was necessary and I rather the producers to use the time to focus more on the other characters' development . It felt so \" forced\" as \u00a0her appearance did not really contribute to the plot at all .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nOverall , this series was surprisingly pleasurable to watch . The good parts made up for the flaws that series has . Even though there is a lot of ecchi-ness and fan service , but it overall maintains its themes well , also without shifting away from its original focus. However it's painful to watch a MC who does not realised that the girls around him have fallen in love with him . :3\\n\\n\r\nStory-8\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nCharacter-5\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8\\n\r\nOverall -7\\n",

            "content": "This anime seems to have the curse that afflicts many anime these days, the curse of having lots of potential and then failing to utilize it.\r\nWhen watching Campione you're going to realize the the people staffed to work this anime had two conflicting groups with different goals. One group had a pretty cool story idea they wanted to make, the other group wanted to make a really well animated hentai. These two groups had to share a budget and share characters, and thus we get Campione.\r\nThe story was a really interesting idea with compelling characters and unique style in many ways, but it was boggeddown with I'm assuming a small budget, not enough time, and the fact that a lot of people wanted this to be hentai. Seriously, there are several times you'll think, why didn't they just make it a mature rating and go a little further? Near the end you'll see a scene that will make no sense, and then it will click and you'll understand all the heavy handed symbolism they're using and be rife with confusion about it. I won't put any spoilers here, but episode 12 something happens, and when you realize what they're trying to get across to you it will confuse you to no end why they did it the way they did.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there is plenty to complain about, the characters are each entertaining and developed, the art is beautiful, and the music is very enjoyable. This anime could have been a lot better but it's not, it's simply good, not great.",

            "content": "The ancient gods of myth and legend, whether it be Athena the goddess of Wisdom, or heroes like Perseus, we humans thought that world to be outside of our realm. We saw the gods as untouchable, immortal, all powerful beings, yet those who overcome that barrier earn the title known as Campione, or God-Slayer. \r\nCampione! : Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maou, phew, I'm outta breath, for future reference, I'm going to shorten it to Campione. Campione focuses an a young high schoolboy by the name of Kusanagi, Godou. Godou, on a trip to deliver an old stone tablet for his grandfather (whom is never revealed) is suddenly and accidentally thrust into a world he previously thought didn't exist. With the help of the Italian, Bronze Black Cross knight, Erica Blandelli, they manage to slay their first god, which turns Godou into a Campione. The title of Campione can have many benefits and many downsides. Those negative effects may be the attraction of organizations who want them for their own purposes, or the positives of women flocking around him. Godou must survive the interactions of gods coming to earth and a prophecy that foretells to destroy the world. Of course, he can't do this without hot, sexy knights by his side. \\n\\n\r\nTo startoff, the anime Campione may have been ecchi based to start off, seeing as though there is two different types of ecchi included. Quoting my friend Milanvde, Showoff and Romance, examples of these types can be seen as; The anime KissxSis is a Showoff anime, pushing the borders of anime and hentai, whereas Romance can be seen as an attempt of showing some skin in the character's attempts at a romantic relationship. Campione, unlike KissxSis isn't entirely about showing off, yet focuses more on an overall plot line while including some nice fan service from time to time. \\n\\n\r\nThe story: The story was a nice balance of the standard harem / high school story lines, and the other side of a shounen, god-slayer, foreboding prophecy type of storyline. The unique part of Campione for me would be the inclusion of gods in the anime, which led to the addition of the Campiones (sounds a lot like champions, doesn't it?). Using their god powers or authorities that they received from killing their respective gods, the fights in Campione can be very exciting and cool. Not only stopping at the powers from almighty gods, Campione included magic which is controlled mainly by organizations around the Campione. Campione unfortunately cannot use magic and cannot be effected by it, unless through a kiss, which brings about the ecchi based part of the anime. The producers definitely did a nice job of not having an overbearing presence of the common day to day harem style and kept their own originality through the world of myth and legend. A big plus IMO. The ecchi was tastefully included, and the main plot line following the prophecy that is told by a princess (whom is also never revealed) isn't that bad either. The plot line never felt rushed to me, and the introduction of each harem girl wasn't that bad, in fact it was done in some original ways that stayed true to the main theme of Campione!. Overall, the Story, the biggest focus of Campione! is very well done, and provides a nice balance between the ecchi, the common harem outline, and the world of God's from Greek mythology.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound: The art and sound I've never had to complain about from an anime. That being said I think that the animations of the characters were done very nicely, not too sharp and focused that it can be considered high quality graphics, like Guilty Crown, but not too smooth to be considered for a romantic anime. This can be said in other words, also contributing the amount of talented balance this anime had. It not only balanced the story quite well, but also the quality of the drawings. The sound complimented the scenes in the anime well, it wasn't too over the top, but also provided the extra cherries on the top, when needed. These topics were both well done. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were pretty standard, being that this anime is also harem themed. One can see the common inclusion of the Tsundere, the slighty Yandere, the lolicon, the shy type, and the just overall unusual submissive type. The main character however was a little different, to my surprise. In common harem themed anime, he didn't fall under the type that had to be protected by his girls, he didn't fall under the type to be the kind-hearted saviour either. If I were to put an example that is close to Kusanagi Godou, it would be... Teppei Arima from the Princess Lover! series, I liked both series very much mainly because of how the main character steps outside the box from common main characters and sets themselves apart from the latter. The characters IMO were introduced nicely and the relationships between them didn't seemed rushed at all. Although in some parts of the anime (you'll understand near the end of Campione!) when the relationship got serious, I wish they just went through with  it instead of creating an awkward cliche scene... I mean come on, nobody would have complained if they went all the way.\\n\r\n(SPOILER ALERT- \"I'm going to inject you with my divine protection!\" XD WTF.)\\n\r\n Overall, a good job, and I thoroughly enjoyed Campione!.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As I said above, Campione! has to be one of my favorite anime with ecchi in it so far, rivaling IS: Infinite Stratos, I also sincerely hope a second season is released because of some unanswered questions I have, and the continuation of this unique style. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, \\n\r\n-Nebarto\\n\\n",

            "content": "Robert's Too Late Reviews is rolling on the scene! We're going to be discussing the dubbed version of Campione which I found to be a pretty nice show, and it would have cleared an 8 overall from me if not for a handful of small missteps. Quick of it is, if you don't mind some lighter ecchi elements and harems don't make you want to stab someone, then Campione might just rock the house for ya. Let's look at the breakdown and see if there are any new Red Devils for the RTLR wall of harem queens!\r\nStory: 7\r\nI'm a total sucker for mythology and thesupernatural/occult, and Campione delivers pretty well in this area. The two biggest mistakes are ones that (theoretically could still be fixed) there aren't enough of the 'avatar' powers the male lead inherits showcased, and there's not that many godly enemies for him to fight. I think this series would have been actually better served by being 26 episodes long, which would give the creators time to showcase the different abilities the male lead gains. There are ten in total, but we basically get about three or four used on a regular basis, and some are not ever used or even explained. If there was a longer run, they could explore what each power is, what it does, and how he can utilize it. The other problem with length is that there's not very many rogue gods for him to face down, and one of them ends up being basically a 'clone' of another. I'm wishing they would do another season, as this story is compelling and fun, just it ends right as its starting to ramp up. What? They could do it still, they waited like what? fifteen years between seasons in Full Metal Panic! so it's not like gaps aren't unheard of. Course I hope they don't wait that long before dipping back into the mythology of this one. \\n\\n\r\nIts got a good start, it just needs to follow up. When everything starts humming, the series is over. For example, the last member of the harem basically doesn't show up until the last couple of episodes, even though she is featured in the opening prominently (more on that later) so they have room to work for sure. I mean, he has some cool powers, but instead of using the same few over and over (hello MISTER pig!) they could expound on what the others do. There is also a huge catalog of gods and deities for them to pick through to use as foes for the hero. They have a good start utilizing the ones they bring out, and while one might be able to question some of the connections they make while explaining the gods' true origins, they have a good system started. It's not enough for the hero to know a little bit about the guise the god appears in initially, he has to know the true history of the god's development to have the information needed to know what power to deploy against them. This is primarily gained by kissing his knights and them magically kiss-teaching him what he needs to know. They get a little contrived on how that works, but they wanted to throw in some lighter ecchi elements, and so the kiss-teaching became a part of the story. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the ecchi elements, they really are on the lighter end of the spectrum. I came off watching Shinmai no Testament recently and into this, and believe me, compared to the super boinking going on in Testament, kissing here and there isn't anything. There's no nips for these buds if you follow my meaning, and only once do I really remember anyone putting a hand on another in a way that might be considered inappropriate (i.e. sexy). That one time happens between two girls, and one's not even human. The male lead is nowhere to be seen when this goes down, and it only lasts a split second. There's a few spots where the girls are naked (especially Erica) when the male lead stumbles by or into them, but never are they exposed or anything like that. Just some heavier kissing, with perhaps a little tongue twisting, but nothing even close to Testament's all banging all the time, or even anywhere in DxD's neighborhood of nip slips. Pretty tame overall. \\n\\n\r\nThey also keep this part of the content pretty well under control. Again I compare it to my recent viewing of Testament, where they would spend a third to a half of an episode on the ecchi material. Campione does not do this, instead settling for a few minutes of awkwardness before a spicy kiss, then right back to ass-kicking. I find that it struck a really good balance between the different story telling elements. Not too much ecchi, not too much shenanigans, and not one constant battle either. Campione features a nice mix of all these elements and a few others in a manner that keeps the pacing just right. Laugh for a moment before the tension of battle, then break that tension for a moment for an ecchi-level event, usually a blushing kiss, then back around again. \\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys for the most part are rogue gods, and they have an interesting twist to them. They are more than they just appear as. For example (one not used in the show) a god might show as a Greek fertility goddess, but to be able to defeat her, the male lead needs to know her true origins, which usually reaches much farther back than just Greek culture. They might say that the god was actually an interpretation the Greeks made of an older god that existed in the Babylonian pantheon or what have you. This knowledge, which isn't readily apparent, is what the male lead must gain before he has the power to truly subdue the god. This is the info translated to him via magic-kiss from his knights or harem members. I haven't had the time to double check their mythology, but even if their connections aren't historically accurate, they present them in such a way that they seem reasonable. At first, I found the explanation of the gods origins plausible enough to just roll with in the moment. So even if not accurate, it's not so far fetched to be unbelievable. \\n\\n\r\nThis gives the story a good bit of lore to work with, and as long as harem cliches and light ecchi elements aren't a deal breaker for you, there's some enjoyment to be had here. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art looks good, I really like the way they have the powers deployed, especially the avatar powers the male lead has. If I ever get godly powers, I hope I can summon MISTER pig like he does. I love the way they portray the powers in use. The colors all pop, and the characters look pretty good for the most part. I didn't notice any huge things to knock in general. \\n\\n\r\nThe things that did bother me were things like the male lead's 'pocket plane' or ability to move the fight into a special dimension. If you've ever seen Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works, then you'll immediately compare this place to the place Archer has. The difference is that this plane in Campione is filled with golden swords, which makes the place a little gaudy looking and a little silly. Personal preference I imagine, but compared to the Archer's wasteland, the one in this series is garish. They don't stay long in that place, thankfully.\\n\\n\r\nThe other big knock I have is somewhat spoiler related. If you're eagle eyed enough, notice what Athena is wearing in the opening theme. They give away Athena's final disposition (which isn't too surprising anyway) by what she chooses to wear. I think that's a sign there might have been at least a consideration as to making more of the series, her apparel seems to indicate a closer relationship with the male lead than what they develop in these few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThere is one slide in the opening, at the end of the song, that is just silly. It has the entire bevy of beauties draped over the hero in his golden sword place like they are all his honeys and he's the big pimp daddy. I think this distracts a bit from the story itself, as its not as stereotypical as that one shot would indicate.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise things looked fine. Not eye popping, not disappointing, just well, a seven. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe voice actors in this anime are really good, which as we know isn't always the case with dubs. Erica's voice actress rolls that Italian off her tongue and sounds good doing it. Athena features a voice by Brittney Karbowski, which is fitting for her size and stature. She does a good job of personalizing the voice as well, making sure Athena doesn't sound like the other characters she's played in other shows. There are a few more well known dub VA's in the show, but none of them carry in such a way to be distracting or too reminiscent of other characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is fitting, rising and falling well with the action onscreen. The theme songs are appropriately rocking, and I did pull the themes to be listened to alone, especially the opener. They are fitting to the material, and not bad by any means on their own. The sound matches well to the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are all pretty well done. The male lead isn't a complete moron (thank you!) like they are in most harem based shows. He also states himself to be a pacifist, and while he does lay the smackdown when forced, he does show mercy whenever he can. He is convincing in regards to the fact that he doesn't see himself as some great demon slaying king or what have you. He actually treats the girls well, not wanting to push them even into something as simple (or as important) as the magic-teaching kiss. He's not too stupid, nor is he too wrapped up in lusting after his harem. He strays close to being goofy with the embarrassment when he fumbles into a girl in a compromising situation, but that's kind of par for the course so I can't complain too much. He also actually seems to care about the girls in that he isn't having internal monologues about nailing them, ala Issei from DxD. He seems to genuinely care about his flock. \\n\\n\r\nThe Italian knight is overall pretty well done, except for her constant need to remind everyone, including the hero himself, that she is his 'first' wife to be, and that she will always be number one. She drops the hammer and kicks some ass when needed, but always under a veil of being superior to the other girls in the lead's affections. She has some pretty impressive battle abilities, and doesn't hesitate to engage a foe that threatens her man even if its a fight she could not possibly ever win. She's willing to give her life for him, if the need arises. \\n\\n\r\nThe second knight is more interested in being the Italian knight's rival than she is interested in the male lead some of the time. She's from a different organization from Italy girl, and so they kind of butt heads here and there on procedure and such. She also changes alliances from another to the male lead in a way that seems slightly weak. She is then the girl who falls in love with the hero, but cannot admit it and is all embarrassed around him. She's kind of a foil to the Italian knight in that she's always protesting the other's assertion that she's his number one woman. She is ass kicking in her own right, and is quick to engage also, especially if the other knight is fighting. Gotta show that blonde girl her place, this one. \\n\\n\r\nThe shrine maiden is the classic 'stay pure but don't let blondie win' kind of character. She's always trying to protect the male lead from what she considers the lechery of the blonde knight. She reminds me a lot of Asia from DxD if you're familiar. She is always telling the Italian girl to back off, then acting all shy when a situation happens where there is any romantic action between her and the hero. Of course she's in love with him as well, but has to do the whole 'innocent little me?' act. She wanders close to annoying sometimes, but that's more because I like tsundere girls than likely any fault in her character. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few more girls that come around, an exasperated little sister who cant believe her brother's sudden popularity, a powerful woman of some sorts that kicks off the adventure, and apparently doesn't age, as she was young when the male lead's grandfather knew her, and is young still. A couple of maids from the organizations the knights represent pop up here and there, along with Athena making repeated appearances in the show. This is basically just as one would expect with the harem category, so it doesn't break any new ground, but it also doesn't hammer them into some big orgy as some stories try to do. A large and somewhat varied cast overall, even if some of them are fairly one note. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this series. I loved when the Italian knight said her little catchphrase that called forth her sword. I liked how the different powers came into play. I even enjoyed the lore they tried to build as they led the story forward. It was a promising start, and I just wish they would keep going in the direction they ended with. As it stands, its an enjoyable enough ride to take, it just left me wanting to see more. They also skip over some events quickly, such as offhandedly mentioning that the male lead had met and sparred with another campione from Italy, but we're never shown anything about that. With more episodes they could draw out elements like these and give them real legs, instead of having to rush through to be close to where they needed to be for the ending. A little bit more lore building and god fighting, and this would have ranked a solid eight ore even a nine, easily. \\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Erica the Italian knight. I know I say I have a thing for tsundere characters and I usually do, but Erica was just too awesome to not love in this one. Her whole 'it appears its time to duel' speeches, her ass kicking ways, just loved her from top to bottom. Mean is good, but sometimes confidence is awesome too, and Erica's one confident chick. \\n\\n\r\nSo I say take the ride, and for sure check out the narrator's voiceover in the dub version. He's so over the top its hilarious. There's enough action to keep the story moving, there's a great balance of blushing ecchi vs jokes vs fights to keep one's attention. If there's an element you don't care for, there's little to worry, as each element isn't dwelt on overlong as they can be in other titles. Erica, the Italian Red Devil makes an entry on the RTLR wall of babes with blades. Thumbs up!",

            "content": "Campione! is an unfortunate anime.\r\nThe set up is cool, at least for the harem genre - random guy kills a diety and inherits his powers, which causes him to fight other deities and attract various pretty girls during his adventures who compete for his affections.  And if you bother to read the light novels (there are over fifteen of them I think), the story and characters are pretty good for the most part. \r\nBut Campione! in its desire to hit the apparently required minimum harem four-girl threshold by the end of the series decides to cover way too much material in too short oftime.  It feels rushed from the beginning, making every development with the female characters feel even more unbelievable than normal for this type of anime.  It also makes the misstep of taking the story chronologically instead of following the storyline in the books.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, for those of us that watch dubs, the voice acting in this one is bad.  The voice actress for Erica is terribly miscast.  \\n\\n\r\nArt is good, not great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime could be a lot better if the anime staff had put more faith into the underlying source material rather than making a checklist and forcing too much into too little space.  Do yourself a favor if you are thinking about this series.  First read the light novels (you can find them online).  Then check out the series so you'll be able to fill in the gaps in your head.  \\n\\n\r\nHopefully, another studio will take a crack at this one after the light novel series puts out a bunch more volumes in another few years.  There is a lot of potential with the source material.  But I doubt the anime made enough of an impact to get another season green-lit.",

            "content": "Not As Bad As I Expected It To Be\r\n*note* I have not read the LN so do not judge me on this review as an adaptation. I am not familiar with the LN and I do not know how accurate it is as an adaptation. *note*\r\nI'll admit, when I started watching this anime, I wasn't getting my hopes up for it. I figured it might have some decent action with a couple decent comedy scenes amongst the harem. As it turned out, this anime was actually quite a bit better than I expected. I wouldn't call it great, but it was far from the mediocreharem anime I thought it might be.\\n\\n\r\nI felt what made this anime so good was the hilarious character interaction when comedy was intended and the romantic/dramatic interaction when the scenes became tense. While Goudou didn't necessarily like it, I found the chemistry between him and Erica was fantastic. Erica Blandelli might be one of my favorite characters from any anime of 2012 with just how liberal, yet forceful and strong she is. She is madly in love with Goudou even though she permits him to have another mistress as long as that mistress is useful. I found that to be hilarious. This was also one of the few harems where I didn't find the rest of the women in the harem to be completely annoying and useless. Liliana, Yuri, and Ena all have their moments and their personalities are well on display. \\n\\n\r\nI was also pleasantly surprised with the action/combat in this series. The fight scenes were entertaining and dramatic. I did groan a little at first when I discovered Goudou had to learn about the gods he was fighting through \"informational kissing\" with those in his harem, but it soon became somewhat comical and eventually second-nature. It barely became noticeable as the series progressed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought the artwork was pretty solid as well with the best aspect being the action sequences and environmental artwork. My dock against the artwork was the character designs which for those that are familiar with harem animes know what I'm talking about...odd proportions and alike. It wasn't exactly \"Code Geass\" bad but it was noticeable at times. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting was fantastic in my opinion. It really felt like I was watching something that would appear in a Percy Jackson movie (modernized Roman, Greek, etc. warfare). That actually reminds me of yet another thing I liked about this anime. I LOVED the diversity this anime used with its gods. This wasn't just Roman or Greek mythology. There were Middle Eastern gods as well as Japanese/Eastern culture gods as well. I found it to be a refreshing mix. \\n\\n\r\nThe downsides of this series are pretty slight. I didn't feel like this anime had a real strong conclusion. I thought the final episode was a little bit of a letdown and the sequence during the final battle to be somewhat cheesy. My other major beef was the obvious omission of light novel content missing from the anime. I haven't even read the light novel and even I could tell that this anime skipped ahead. One such example is when Salvatore Doni is introduced. He came completely out of left field and after listening to his phone conversation with Goudou, it felt as though I missed something important by not reading the LN. I understand that this anime was only 13 episodes and might not have had the production time to explore the entirety of the LN, but it was apparent that this anime probably should've ran longer to include that content (perhaps 24 episodes instead of 13). \\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, I can't complain a whole lot about this series. I was especially thrilled with the romantic developments between Goudou and Erica as the season wore on and it was refreshing to see a harem anime that put its foot down and said Erica IS the lead female. There have been too many harems that I've seen where they left things way too open to debate. Not this one. I'm not even a big harem anime fan and even I can admit that I am completely open to a 2nd season of Campione!",

(showoff echi is KissxSis style, and romance ecchi speaks for it self).\r\nThis is one of those anime's who is in commen with most harem styled anime's \r\nBoy gets powerfull or special, Girls love it and are competing against each other.  \r\nBut this is one of the few times when you watch anime's because of ecchi, you reallywant the action the happend like fighting. becuase it's just epic. \\n\\n\r\nWith this in mind i will give my honnest revieuw about this anime, and call out the good points from this anime and the bad one. enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nwell yeay i like it alot i must say, one of these story's involving taughts in real life like polytheism and the old greek style of believing in their gods. i like it alot that way and that it's implemented in the anime itself, that pretty unique.\\n\r\nalso the idea of becomming a kind of Hero after killing a god is awesome, With some extra Fanservice i think they did a great job with the story.\\n\\n\r\nart:\\n\r\nbasic art like most anime's not the best not the worst. lack in detail lack in extra face expressions. well yeay you have to get used to this in anime's which aren't in the top 100 of the anime list. still a decent job, but nothing to look out for\\n\\n\r\nSound: is like all animes just neutral, nothing special. pretty much the same story as the art, but again you have to get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWell yeay the first time accualy that the origin of the characters is inplemented in the anime: like speaking italian the first time they see the boy. and getting old habbits form back home which is nicely done. good artwork on the characters and great feeling expressions, again not to much face expressions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, that's up to you, I loved it and i think this has to be the most enjoyable anime to watch for me at this moment but well yeay everybody has different interest.\\n\\n\r\noverall: \\n\r\nI need to be honnest i think this anime would be able to get a 9, but if i look in a way of writing a revieuw, i would say 8. well yeay a great anime to have some fun. and i recomend it to you if you prefer it that way.\\n\\n\r\noverall recomended to Ecchi lovers, romance lovers, action lovers and Magic usage lovers.\\n\r\nNot recomended to People who are to serious and can't stand anything unrealisticly in ecchi/romance wise.\\n\\n\r\nThank's for reading, Any suggestions or pointers for me? send me a message i want to inprove myself in making these reviews, My english isn't the best out there so sorry for that. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To expect an elaborate storyline, unexpected plot twists, and incredible character development from an ecchi harem show would be one of the greatest you mistakes you can ever make. I came into Campione with no expectations at all. I merely came to watch an ecchi harem and you know what I got? An awesome show that understands how to make a story despite having fan service and a harem. \r\nCampione is a story about a guy named Godou Kusanagi who ends up killing the Persian God of Victory, Verethragna. As a result, he receives Verethragna\u2019s power and the title of God Slayer. After that, hebasically goes around killing out of control gods no one else can take care of. \\n\\n\r\nThe story may not be refreshing, but hey, it\u2019s a still a story and a coherent one at that. You\u2019re not going to gasp at anything or cry, nope, you\u2019re just going to enjoy the action and smile at the romance. \\n\\n\r\nCampione actually does have one unique aspect to it. The way he defeats the Gods is through an ability known as Warrior. In a nutshell, if he has sufficient knowledge of the enemy, their defenses begin to crumble and eventually they become mortal, thus making it easier to kill them. What makes it so interesting that he doesn\u2019t just say he knows a lot about the God then proceed to kill him, he actually tells us what he knows. Regardless of whether or not the information about the Gods is valid, I still found it to be one of the best parts of the show. Even if the information isn't true, I felt like I learned something and it was information that actually fascinated me. There\u2019s just something enjoyable about hearing about the origins of Gods of all cultures. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love this part of the story too.\\n\\n\r\nAction speaks louder than words, so obviously the whole show isn\u2019t just talking on and on and on about some God\u2019s life. Godou has plenty of other abilities. He has a group of 12 incarnation abilities known as Verethragna\u2019s authorities. To be more specific, he can summon a bull that rivals Hercules\u2019 power or a white stallion with the power of the sun. Each one has a chant, so whenever it felt like he was about to chant, I was always excited and ready to see which animal would come out and how much damage it\u2019d do to the opponent. However, they also have a condition. For example, the bull can only be used on people with inhuman strength and the stallion on people who have committed great sins. So there are those times, when you realize a condition is fulfilled, and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, damn, he\u2019s going to do it!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nNow, now Godou. Don\u2019t try to take all the spotlight. The girls need a piece of the action too and luckily, they do. They don\u2019t just sit back and pray for Godou. Nope, they fight. All of the heroines are some of the best to ever exist in the harem genre, simply because of that. It\u2019s always a pleasure to watch both, the male lead and the heroines, provide the action. \\n\\n\r\nNow the romance part of Campione is just satisfying as hell. Funny thing is, if the girl is knowledgeable about the enemy god, she can transfer what she knows through a kiss. The Gods have a long history, so you know what that means ;) The kisses last a good 10, 20 seconds. If that doesn\u2019t satisfy your need for romance, then I don\u2019t know what will. All of the heroines know about some god that the others don\u2019t, so don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re all part of this ever so pleasant romance. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is not going to look like the inside of the Sistine Chapel, but it\u2019s definitely good. The art should not have a negative influence on how you feel about the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn\u2019t exactly memorable or catchy, but it\u2019s not that bad. Plus you can always skip it, so if you end up really not liking the opening and ending, just skip it and go on with the show. Making yourself listen to it, then calling the show mediocre because you didn\u2019t like the opening and ending, wouldn\u2019t be a wise nor friendly decision. Also I didn\u2019t find any of the character\u2019s voices to be annoying, so you shouldn\u2019t have a problem when it comes to the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren\u2019t ones you\u2019re going to relate to or see as well-written, but they certainly do have good character traits that led me to love all of them. Lets start with the main protagonist, Godou Kusanagi. He is a great male lead. He says he\u2019s a pacifist, but when it comes down to it, he\u2019s willing to kill. That is one of the greatest qualities a protagonist can have. Kind, but not the most forgiving. Watching villains get spared is pretty annoying and it\u2019s nice that Godou understands. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the female characters, they\u2019re great. None of them are overly violent or annoying. Not to mention, they\u2019re not princesses waiting to be saved. They\u2019re knights who will protect the citizens of their country at all costs. God, isn\u2019t that just splendid? To have girls who aren\u2019t fragile and emotional train-wrecks. \\n\\n\r\nI, Zeroskye, swear on the River Styx that you will love the protagonist and surely find the bestest girl out of the heroines who just all happen to be best girls.\\n\\n\r\nCampione is an anime that delivers. Nice Action? Check. Awesome Protagonist? Check. Likable Heroines? Check. Romantic Progression? Check. They even decided to educate you about the entities of many different places; from Greece to Persia to Japan. Campione truly is one of the greatest ecchi harem shows to ever exist.",

Story is waaaay too rushed.  And also the cheesiness is beyond logical. I mean for god sake, passing information through a kiss.  The first episode was quite good however it just went downhill, how in the world did the main heroin go from being super embarrassedfrom being seen naked and hating the man character to suddenly sleeping in his room naked and trying to seduce him? First episode hinted this could have been quite a good anime, however the way it's rushed totally ruined it big time. Don't waste your time",

            "content": "To be frank, I had high expectations for the anime, the LN had a solid plot and was generally very enjoyable. Campione was an anime that I had looked forward to, but it has been a disappointment from the very first episode. \r\nStory: The anime is rushed, horribly rushed. Cramming an entire volume of a LN into one episode results in the confusing mess that we see in episode 1.  Understandably the animation would deviate from the LN, however the brutally mutilated storyline just makes me cringe. \r\nArt: The art was superb, everything from the detailed spell insignias in battle scenes to the characterart were more than satisfactory. Although not as spectacular as say \"Fate/Zero\", there was little to find fault with in the art for Campione, the only thing I could find wrong was how derp Godou's face looks. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Both the music and SFX were well done, synergizing with the tone of each scenario. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Yes, not everyone has been properly introduced, and it's too early to have a final verdict , but from the way things are heading, characterization is likely to be another victim of the horrible pacing of the adaptation. The rapid introduction of one heroine after another without any significant effort to develop each character as we have seen in the first two episodes is likely to continue as the anime continues at the blistering pace it has set itself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  The anime itself is very enjoyable and appeals to a wide range of audiences. Everything from the action and battles to the fanservice attributes to a very entertaining and fun anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Although I was disappointed with it and it could have been potentially much better, Campione is by no means \"bad\". It is extremely fun to watch and an enjoyable experience and you will by no means regret watching it.",

            "content": "Alright so when i watched the first episode of Campione i said to myself, i wonder where this is going. The answer i got was to sleep. For a fairly interesting concept it does very little to wow me in the ways of story or characters.\r\nI find most of the characters not very likable or even memorable so far. With the exception of one cast member i feel most are far to obnoxious,silent or superfluous to the show so far. Even character designs are lack luster and leave more to be desired. With cliche things like a shrine maiden,school boy and samurai girl i feelpretty unimpressed with the cast.\\n\\n\r\nBack on topic with plot, it feels very minimal and just sloppy in a way. When i watch this i feel like they did not really put much effort into it. I mean the initial episode had clashes of gods but everything after was just owls and swords which is just to literal. For a character gifted with 10 god powers he uses them all very scarcely and focuses more time on impressing a shrine girl. And despite the fact he has 10 powers it still always ends in one last desperate strike to end it all a anime staple of the genre but very poorly done for this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are generic and not note worthy in anyway. \\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment of this show is so low i find watching this to be my low point of the day and i actually put it off and pause it numerous times just cause i get bored of it so quickly. I really think this anime lacks far too much and most people will find it tasteless and without substance so i give you a 3.  A poorly done anime.",

            "content": "\"She must submit to me, and act to ensure my victory!\"\r\nAh, how fitting, this quote essentially sums up all of the action fight scenes.  Expect a lot of girl/guy interactions at all times, especially during the fighting scenes.  On top of that, do you like well-designed girls, magic, and an MC who isn't a enfeebled, useless, chump? In other words, if you have expressed some interest into watching this show you must be into the shounen/ecchi genres, so this review will be how adept this anime performs in being a worthy shounen/ecchi action anime.  This is a review, so I'm just tryingto be helpful in judging whether or not you will like this show\u2014this is some insight without any spoilers to give a hint of the overall gist of the story. \\n\r\n===== Basic Info =====\\n\r\nCampione! is set in modern-day and begins with a normal, somewhat lackadaisical main protagonist, Kusanagi Godou who is ignorant to all of the magic present in the world.  One day, while unknowingly delivering a precious magical artifact as an errand for his grandfather, he encounters a Great Knight, and gets caught up in the world of magic.  In an overwhelming series of events, he defeats a god using his magical artifact, and thus begins Campione!\\n\\n\r\n====== Characters: 7.5 ======\\n\r\n Kusanagi Godou\\n\r\nHe typifies the dense MC archetype, the lucky chum loved by a variety of females, and a character done many times before.  Nothing special can define him: he is your typical shounen hero who girls fawn over due to his exhibition of such a righteous sense of ethical altruism, though his character design/voice isn't unlikable unlike some other harem characters (cough*  Makoto cough*.)  He can actually be a decent character that can actually be badass, uhhhh sometimes.  The girls ostensibly think of him as someone who is very 'different' and 'worthy' compared to all of the other gods, and this is their basis for their feelings for him.\\n\\n\r\nThe Girls(The good girls)\\n\r\nEach of the girl has errrr say a realistic looking body size, bust and everything.  No abnormally flat-chested girls, or the girl with the gigantic cow udders.  This is actually a positive thing for this anime/genre.  This show, often compared to The Familiar of Zero or Shakugan no Shana actually offers a fresh set of WORTHY(not saying the Shana or Louise are bad characters at all! ) girls who all get a decent chance at the MC.  I found myself rooting for a side character I got personally attached to, not the main girl at times due to the fact that all of these girls' personalities are not entirely clich\u00e9d.  Like real life, the girls have unique in the way they act towards the MC, but at the same time, they possess similar tendency and disposition in that they all, in someway, feel for the MC.  I felt like most of the girls had a real chance with the MC, which is fresh and a welcoming harem aspect, from other similar animes where the harems are so obvious that we facepalm at every new girl that interacts with the MC.  Needless to say, the interactions between the girls and the MC are quirky at times and are overall, designed fairly well.\\n\\n\r\nAntagonists(See second paragraph of Story Section)\\n\\n\r\n====== Story: 6.5 ======\\n\r\nStraightforwardly, Campione! is an uncomplex, linear, story that typifies the bash-em-up shounen/ecchi anime with set in the premise of Greek and Roman mythology; the story may be a weaker component of this anime, but that doesn't make the anime a 'not watch' for any reason.  The plot is driven through Kusanagi Godou and his onslaught of various gods.  As you can probably already tell, Kusanagi Godou is a God-Slayer, higher than a god (an overpowered character), so the results for each fight is practically predictable.  In almost every other episode, there is always a sense of imminent danger to the highest degree, god scaled world threatening situations where the puissant protagonist is always thrown into.  However, unlike other animes, the way that the show goes about this is . . . an edification of greek and roman god knowledge.  WAIT, what, the plot moves forward through history lessons? Yes, as implausible as this sounds, this is the defining factor in this anime, it is whoever knows more about the true identity of the deity triumphs.  As Godou learns more and more about Greek and Roman mythology, he taps into his otherworldly power.  However, the only way for him to gain this knowledge is through kissing (no joke).  Learning = kissing = power.  This is how the MC wins, every time he learns new 'history' about Greek and Roman deities through and punishes the enemy 'gods', who are often 'messing around' because they are bored.  \\n\\n\r\n\"I used to think that they were these mighty, omniscient beings. But now that I've actually met them, gods seem more childish than anyone.\" \u2014Kusanagi Godou.  This quote is in actuality, a very accurate representation for the motive behind the misbehaving of the gods(the antagonists); it displays why these gods are all antagonistic.  These gods, like children,  just want to have some fun because they are just THAT bored and carefree.  Watching gods mess around might sound interesting, but  this leads to the clich\u00e9d 'The world will end if we don't defeat the enemy theme' in almost EVERY episode, starting from episode one. This anime is not spectacular by any means but does not fall into a pit of inferiority due to its strong cast and really catering to people who love kickass-shounen at heart.  It is an anime without a deep intricate plot.  Uncomplex and simplistic, the story revolves around how the main character literally runs around his unraveling the history of gods, which defeat the enemy, all while gathering more girls to be a part of his troupe.  Rinse and repeat this.  This archetype of an anime has been done many times before and is therefore not a high priority must watch, but is a fine-dandy anime if you find you have some desperate time to dawdle\u2014it's solid watch for shounen/ecchi fans.\\n\\n\r\n===== Art: 9 ======  \\n\r\nNo squabbles here, the characters, all of them are well-drawn.  The girls are distinctly different from each other, without being too blatant.  This show does a wonderful of keeping the girls' appearances realistic, avoiding the all too common geeky super smart nerdy girl with zero tits who is actually a surprisingly talented fighter, or the ironic innocent, big breasted girl who has had no experiences with males.  The anime had a decent budget, and thus the art for the time was pretty good art.  Watching the show in HD actually makes a difference as the art is fluid and natural with well-animated fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\n===== Sound: 8 =====\\n\r\nNot much to comment about here.  The opening and ending are standard upbeat j-pop songs with nothing too special.  The music really sets the mood for this anime.  Other background tunes are unobtrusive and to a certain degree, somewhat enthralling, but there are no 'standout' must listen to soundtracks.  Right off the bat, it can be easily observed that this anime will be a lighthearted ecchi/shounen flick with a developING(never fully develops) romantic subplot.  Voice acting is superb with a talented cast, no annoying characters/voices here.\\n\\n\r\n  ====== Enjoyment: 7.5 rounded to 8 /Final Note ======\\n\r\nOverall, an enjoyable shounen/ecchi built on its solid cast, gorgeous girls, refined artwork, and fluid animations.  Do not expect to expect to be too immersed into a deep story here.  Watching this show is effortless; don't think too much on the simplistic plot, but indulge yourself into the other elements that were well executed.  I quite enjoyed this show due to the attractive, realistic looking characters, and their quirky interactions they had with the MC.  The ending for was quite lackluster, par at best, but there is always the completed (translated) light novel that continues the story if you are left craving for more.\\n",

            "content": "Do you love tales of gods and mythology ranging from Athena the goddess of wisdom to Osiris the Egyptian god of death?\r\nWell, Campione, revolves around slaying gods and making their powers your own.\r\nStory-8\r\nIt's a truly fascinating story. Kusanagi, a boy steals a gods power and continues to slay gods. However he's no ordinary god slayer. He does as he wishes and tries to avoid slaying and fighting. Instead of slaying gods for their powers, he becomes a traditional kind hero and gains support. Beside him are a priestess princess and erica, a \"red devil\", who counter eachother's ideals and both try to make kusanagi theirideal campione. \\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nThe art is lovely. It has great modern 21st century art. Just looking at it makes me proud of how far the world has advanced. The battle scenes are absolutely fantastic and the background on every image makes you go woah, amazing ( well it made me say that ;P ).\\n\r\nSound-9 \\n\r\nThe music fits the scenes very well. For example the battle music helps you get excited and the background music helps you focus on what is happening, rather than distract you from the show and I can hear all the dialogue very clearly. The voice acting is great and lets you get into the mood. The opener and closing songs are fit the show and are quite nice.\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nNo character really pisses you off too much and the characters are not monotoned robots. They all have their own personalities. Personally I prefer heroes willing to kill but everyone has their own tastes. There is a harem which may be a little bit annoying but I personally think Godou ( the main character) deserves it as he earned them and boost the fun in the show and lightens the show up after a fight scene or whatever. I also really love the character's interactions with cute jealousy and funny humor. There also isn't that much fanservice and gets straight to the point.\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nThe series is really enjoyable if you're looking for shounen hero powns everyone show. This is one of the best in my opinion with the great art, nice plot without holes, fantastic music, fun character interactions and more.  This is shounen.\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nThe show seems very promising but a bit rushed as many things are skipped ( I didn't read the light novel but it's quite obvious). This isn't a \"genius against genius\" show like Death note or code geass but it is an enjoyable show, very similar to bleach or naruto but god slaying instead of ninjas or shinigami. It has a few flaws but the fantastic quality makes up for it and makes this show worth watching. I personally think everyone should at least give it a shot to see whether or not you like it.",

            "content": "There are a few basic conditions that you have to meet to like this anime.\r\n1. Do you like mythology? (Mostly Greek, with a little bit of Persian and Egyptian)\r\n2. Do you like harem? \r\nThe first one is extremely important. The entire story revolves around mythical gods and heroes, so if you get bored from that kind of stuff or just straight out don't like it, this anime is not for you. \r\nGodou, the main character, defeats a god called Verethragna, the Oriental god of War and Victory. He takes his powers, called Authorities, and basically his job is to fight other mythological gods who threatenhumanity's safety, although that's not really the focal point. The overall threat is the Prophecy of the Starless Night, which says a rogue god will claim his/her powers and end the world. But being a God-Slayer and all, he naturally attracts girls and that's where the harem part comes in, but the girls play a crucial part in each of his battles, so it's not just about them falling in love with him. The plot sounds a bit cheesy, and to some extent, it is. That's why it's so important that you do enjoy stories about mythology, or else this show will bore you. \\n\r\nBut if you do love mythology like I do, you're going to love this show. The fight scenes are epic; not just the action, but the dialogue exchanged between the opponents. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are brilliant; the battle theme used is pretty incredible; search it up on Youtube if you want a listen. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, I really liked the male harem lead since he was kind but also badass; some harem leads may be kind but they're too weak. He tries to be a pacifist, but if one of his friends is in trouble, he'll do anything to help them. \\n\r\nThe main girl, Erica Blandelli, is powerful, seductive, and intelligent. She saves Godou's life multiple times, and he definitely could not have made it far without her. She constantly professes her love to him, but he remains doubtful, and you will see why after the second episode. He doubts her, but he also says he trusts her completely, so their interaction is pretty entertaining as you try to figure out who's really in control of their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime because I have an obsession with mythology, so if you like that kind of stuff too, definitely give this a watch. If not, I'd still recommend it if you like comedy and harem mixed in with epic fight scenes. \\n\\n",

Much as this anime about Gods, I believe you don't want to watch this anime because you want to learn more about Gods right? Unless you want to use this as an excuse to learn Greek history about Gods when you got banned by your parents and not allowed to use the internet to watch anime.\r\nStory:6/10\r\n  Ok, this story about a high-schooler, defeating a god unintentionally and became a god slayer. Well, the story is simple. He wants to lead a normal and peaceful life, not botheringabout Gods even though he is supposed to slay them. However, the Gods interfered with his normal and peaceful life. A few episodes each dedicated to fighting the Gods. Simple and boring plot as some might see. I mean come on! Repeating the story type of plot again and again with different characters? Boring? NO! Even though the plot is a little repetitive the action in every episode is unique and somewhat different which never fail to surprise me. Trust me, though the plot may seem a little repetitive, I dare say that it doesn't feel that way when you actually get down and watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:5/10\\n\r\n  Not very desirable in my opinion for a 2012 produced anime. When I first watched it, I was like: Oh! Why haven't I seen this anime a few years back. Went to research, got mind-blown because it was a 2012 produced anime. This kind of art kind of gives people a sense of lethargy, so don't ever start the anime if you are already feeling tired because you might just be lullabied by the art of this anime. Get over the first episode and you finally get the story, you'll be fine with the rest of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:8/10\\n\r\n  Really catchy OSTs, opening and ending. To me, when an anime has really good sounds, it's practically a sign that this anime is gonna be awesome. The OSTs just sets the audience into the right mood. Battle-type OST, you'll be prepared that a epic battle is about to happen. Escape-type OST, you'll know that there will be an epic escape from people. Beautiful opening: Brave blade by Megu Sakuragawa. Really catchy and allows me to get into this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8/10\\n\r\n  The characters are all quite funny, especially Erica,who enjoys teasing Godou. And not to mention when Godou responds to her teasing. However funny the characters may be, there is a serious side to them. The serious side    to them is when they get really frustrated and determined to do something, becoming a over-powering hero.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10\\n\r\n  Really enjoyed this anime because it is action-driven anime. I love action animes. Kind of gets you to the chuunibyou mood. On top of that, I actually get to learn more about Gods! Warning: Beware not to watch the 2nd last episode of the anime in front of your parents. You have been warned! \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watch this anime, go watch it. I'm almost 75% sure you'll enjoy this anime. Thank you.",

It has all the elements (great art, sound, characters, etc.) but in my opinion it didn't come together. Every week I feel as though I'm forcing myself to keep up and continue watching (I've watched tons of animes and this is the first time I felt that way). Perhaps it's because the story has a lot of little details and feels kind of rush...though at the same time it really doesn't go anywhere. It's definitely worth ashot, but don't get your hopes to high. The biggest reason why I'm still watching this is probably for the romance and since I refuse to drop an anime.",

            "content": "When a god is slain , the slayer inherits its powers .\r\nCampione is a unique anime which appeals to its audiences by how it portrays its scenes and its extraordinary \" vivid details \" . Campione is also a very original anime which brings a whole new experience to us viewers .\r\nThe story\r\nCampione is a story where a sixteen year old boy who got into an adventure and ended up slaying one of the heretic gods , Verethragna . Thus he became the 7th and the youngest campione , and he have to stop other troublesome gods alongside with his companions . Campione set itselfin a supernatural theme and it succeeded in combining different elements along its progression . The plot was superb and it gives viewers a whole new experience .However every anime has its flaws , pushing the positive factors aside , the series really felt rushed and they left out lots of background information . This sometimes causes me to wonder if I have missed an episode . Especially during the last arc , when they tried to squeeze everything in just 2 episodes . I'd rather wait for a 2nd season . Nevertheless the story never failed to make me crave for the next episode\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe character design was average and it was too generic .However the action scenes was spectacular in particular the part where Godou had to fight against sasha voban . Whereas some scenes were so intensely portrayed that it became rather disturbing - \"ahem\" . But these made campione such an unique anime compared to other typical animes\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe series make excellent use of its soundtracks . It was fabulously presented . The action scenes were definitely more intense . At the same time , they managed to balance out between light-hearted moments and serious action scenes . The opening song Brave Blade was average .\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast was top notch , it can be seen that they had put in their upmost effort and they deserved to be praised . Their voices \u00a0fit their roles perfectly and it highlights their personalities even more . I definitely have to mention Yo-shit-sugu matsuoka who did a great job in voicing Godou.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters in Campione have their own unique personalities . However it was not fully developed and this causes the anime to go downhill as it progresses .\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nGodou Kusanagi - the main protagonist of this series . He has a personality that makes him shine as a main character . Godou has often shown very oxymoronic and self contradictory behaviour . For e.g he is a shy young man but yet he is a natural lady-killer . He is also a self-proclaimed pacifist and will fight only when needed . However nothing about his history was mentioned , thus we do not know anything beyond his current self .\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nErica Blandelli - the main female protagonist of the series . She is a courageous woman who feels no shame in declaring her love for Godou to everyone else . She is also passionate and strong willed . She too , lacked development and it is clearly seen in the drastic change of feelings towards Godou in merely one episode. It really felt extremely rushed .\\n\\n\r\nYuri Mariya - the second main female protagonist . She is very shy and normally speaks politely . And the scary thing is that when she gets angry , it's hard to distinguish if she's speaking politely or she's angry . Even though the series slightly touched on her past , it was merely the tip of an iceberg and we still don't know anything more than simply just a maiden who was involved in a ritual and now falls in love with Godou .\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLiliana kranjcar - the third main female protagonist of the series . She is a beautiful , slender girl who has a serious and knight-like personality . Because of her personality , she is often made fun of by Erica and the rest . She also tends to hide her feelings for Godou ,which is the exact opposite of Erica .\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least , Ena seishuuin . The last main female protagonist of the series . She has a very strange personality that she seems relaxed about the things in the modern world\\n\r\nbut still has a slight naivet\u00e9 in her . She acts on her instinct and impulse , rather than her wits . I personally do not think that her existence was necessary and I rather the producers to use the time to focus more on the other characters' development . It felt so \" forced\" as \u00a0her appearance did not really contribute to the plot at all .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nOverall , this series was surprisingly pleasurable to watch . The good parts made up for the flaws that series has . Even though there is a lot of ecchi-ness and fan service , but it overall maintains its themes well , also without shifting away from its original focus. However it's painful to watch a MC who does not realised that the girls around him have fallen in love with him . :3\\n\\n\r\nStory-8\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nCharacter-5\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8\\n\r\nOverall -7\\n",

One group had a pretty cool story idea they wanted to make, the other group wanted to make a really well animated hentai. These two groups had to share a budget and share characters, and thus we get Campione.\r\nThe story was a really interesting idea with compelling characters and unique style in many ways, but it was boggeddown with I'm assuming a small budget, not enough time, and the fact that a lot of people wanted this to be hentai. Seriously, there are several times you'll think, why didn't they just make it a mature rating and go a little further? Near the end you'll see a scene that will make no sense, and then it will click and you'll understand all the heavy handed symbolism they're using and be rife with confusion about it. I won't put any spoilers here, but episode 12 something happens, and when you realize what they're trying to get across to you it will confuse you to no end why they did it the way they did.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there is plenty to complain about, the characters are each entertaining and developed, the art is beautiful, and the music is very enjoyable. This anime could have been a lot better but it's not, it's simply good, not great.",

            "content": "The ancient gods of myth and legend, whether it be Athena the goddess of Wisdom, or heroes like Perseus, we humans thought that world to be outside of our realm. We saw the gods as untouchable, immortal, all powerful beings, yet those who overcome that barrier earn the title known as Campione, or God-Slayer. \r\nCampione! : Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maou, phew, I'm outta breath, for future reference, I'm going to shorten it to Campione. Campione focuses an a young high schoolboy by the name of Kusanagi, Godou. Godou, on a trip to deliver an old stone tablet for his grandfather (whom is never revealed) is suddenly and accidentally thrust into a world he previously thought didn't exist. With the help of the Italian, Bronze Black Cross knight, Erica Blandelli, they manage to slay their first god, which turns Godou into a Campione. The title of Campione can have many benefits and many downsides. Those negative effects may be the attraction of organizations who want them for their own purposes, or the positives of women flocking around him. Godou must survive the interactions of gods coming to earth and a prophecy that foretells to destroy the world. Of course, he can't do this without hot, sexy knights by his side. \\n\\n\r\nTo startoff, the anime Campione may have been ecchi based to start off, seeing as though there is two different types of ecchi included. Quoting my friend Milanvde, Showoff and Romance, examples of these types can be seen as; The anime KissxSis is a Showoff anime, pushing the borders of anime and hentai, whereas Romance can be seen as an attempt of showing some skin in the character's attempts at a romantic relationship. Campione, unlike KissxSis isn't entirely about showing off, yet focuses more on an overall plot line while including some nice fan service from time to time. \\n\\n\r\nThe story: The story was a nice balance of the standard harem / high school story lines, and the other side of a shounen, god-slayer, foreboding prophecy type of storyline. The unique part of Campione for me would be the inclusion of gods in the anime, which led to the addition of the Campiones (sounds a lot like champions, doesn't it?). Using their god powers or authorities that they received from killing their respective gods, the fights in Campione can be very exciting and cool. Not only stopping at the powers from almighty gods, Campione included magic which is controlled mainly by organizations around the Campione. Campione unfortunately cannot use magic and cannot be effected by it, unless through a kiss, which brings about the ecchi based part of the anime. The producers definitely did a nice job of not having an overbearing presence of the common day to day harem style and kept their own originality through the world of myth and legend. A big plus IMO. The ecchi was tastefully included, and the main plot line following the prophecy that is told by a princess (whom is also never revealed) isn't that bad either. The plot line never felt rushed to me, and the introduction of each harem girl wasn't that bad, in fact it was done in some original ways that stayed true to the main theme of Campione!. Overall, the Story, the biggest focus of Campione! is very well done, and provides a nice balance between the ecchi, the common harem outline, and the world of God's from Greek mythology.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound: The art and sound I've never had to complain about from an anime. That being said I think that the animations of the characters were done very nicely, not too sharp and focused that it can be considered high quality graphics, like Guilty Crown, but not too smooth to be considered for a romantic anime. This can be said in other words, also contributing the amount of talented balance this anime had. It not only balanced the story quite well, but also the quality of the drawings. The sound complimented the scenes in the anime well, it wasn't too over the top, but also provided the extra cherries on the top, when needed. These topics were both well done. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were pretty standard, being that this anime is also harem themed. One can see the common inclusion of the Tsundere, the slighty Yandere, the lolicon, the shy type, and the just overall unusual submissive type. The main character however was a little different, to my surprise. In common harem themed anime, he didn't fall under the type that had to be protected by his girls, he didn't fall under the type to be the kind-hearted saviour either. If I were to put an example that is close to Kusanagi Godou, it would be... Teppei Arima from the Princess Lover! series, I liked both series very much mainly because of how the main character steps outside the box from common main characters and sets themselves apart from the latter. The characters IMO were introduced nicely and the relationships between them didn't seemed rushed at all. Although in some parts of the anime (you'll understand near the end of Campione!) when the relationship got serious, I wish they just went through with  it instead of creating an awkward cliche scene... I mean come on, nobody would have complained if they went all the way.\\n\r\n(SPOILER ALERT- \"I'm going to inject you with my divine protection!\" XD WTF.)\\n\r\n Overall, a good job, and I thoroughly enjoyed Campione!.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As I said above, Campione! has to be one of my favorite anime with ecchi in it so far, rivaling IS: Infinite Stratos, I also sincerely hope a second season is released because of some unanswered questions I have, and the continuation of this unique style. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, \\n\r\n-Nebarto\\n\\n",

We're going to be discussing the dubbed version of Campione which I found to be a pretty nice show, and it would have cleared an 8 overall from me if not for a handful of small missteps. Quick of it is, if you don't mind some lighter ecchi elements and harems don't make you want to stab someone, then Campione might just rock the house for ya. Let's look at the breakdown and see if there are any new Red Devils for the RTLR wall of harem queens!\r\nStory: 7\r\nI'm a total sucker for mythology and thesupernatural/occult, and Campione delivers pretty well in this area. The two biggest mistakes are ones that (theoretically could still be fixed) there aren't enough of the 'avatar' powers the male lead inherits showcased, and there's not that many godly enemies for him to fight. I think this series would have been actually better served by being 26 episodes long, which would give the creators time to showcase the different abilities the male lead gains. There are ten in total, but we basically get about three or four used on a regular basis, and some are not ever used or even explained. If there was a longer run, they could explore what each power is, what it does, and how he can utilize it. The other problem with length is that there's not very many rogue gods for him to face down, and one of them ends up being basically a 'clone' of another. I'm wishing they would do another season, as this story is compelling and fun, just it ends right as its starting to ramp up. What? They could do it still, they waited like what? fifteen years between seasons in Full Metal Panic! so it's not like gaps aren't unheard of. Course I hope they don't wait that long before dipping back into the mythology of this one. \\n\\n\r\nIts got a good start, it just needs to follow up. When everything starts humming, the series is over. For example, the last member of the harem basically doesn't show up until the last couple of episodes, even though she is featured in the opening prominently (more on that later) so they have room to work for sure. I mean, he has some cool powers, but instead of using the same few over and over (hello MISTER pig!) they could expound on what the others do. There is also a huge catalog of gods and deities for them to pick through to use as foes for the hero. They have a good start utilizing the ones they bring out, and while one might be able to question some of the connections they make while explaining the gods' true origins, they have a good system started. It's not enough for the hero to know a little bit about the guise the god appears in initially, he has to know the true history of the god's development to have the information needed to know what power to deploy against them. This is primarily gained by kissing his knights and them magically kiss-teaching him what he needs to know. They get a little contrived on how that works, but they wanted to throw in some lighter ecchi elements, and so the kiss-teaching became a part of the story. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the ecchi elements, they really are on the lighter end of the spectrum. I came off watching Shinmai no Testament recently and into this, and believe me, compared to the super boinking going on in Testament, kissing here and there isn't anything. There's no nips for these buds if you follow my meaning, and only once do I really remember anyone putting a hand on another in a way that might be considered inappropriate (i.e. sexy). That one time happens between two girls, and one's not even human. The male lead is nowhere to be seen when this goes down, and it only lasts a split second. There's a few spots where the girls are naked (especially Erica) when the male lead stumbles by or into them, but never are they exposed or anything like that. Just some heavier kissing, with perhaps a little tongue twisting, but nothing even close to Testament's all banging all the time, or even anywhere in DxD's neighborhood of nip slips. Pretty tame overall. \\n\\n\r\nThey also keep this part of the content pretty well under control. Again I compare it to my recent viewing of Testament, where they would spend a third to a half of an episode on the ecchi material. Campione does not do this, instead settling for a few minutes of awkwardness before a spicy kiss, then right back to ass-kicking. I find that it struck a really good balance between the different story telling elements. Not too much ecchi, not too much shenanigans, and not one constant battle either. Campione features a nice mix of all these elements and a few others in a manner that keeps the pacing just right. Laugh for a moment before the tension of battle, then break that tension for a moment for an ecchi-level event, usually a blushing kiss, then back around again. \\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys for the most part are rogue gods, and they have an interesting twist to them. They are more than they just appear as. For example (one not used in the show) a god might show as a Greek fertility goddess, but to be able to defeat her, the male lead needs to know her true origins, which usually reaches much farther back than just Greek culture. They might say that the god was actually an interpretation the Greeks made of an older god that existed in the Babylonian pantheon or what have you. This knowledge, which isn't readily apparent, is what the male lead must gain before he has the power to truly subdue the god. This is the info translated to him via magic-kiss from his knights or harem members. I haven't had the time to double check their mythology, but even if their connections aren't historically accurate, they present them in such a way that they seem reasonable. At first, I found the explanation of the gods origins plausible enough to just roll with in the moment. So even if not accurate, it's not so far fetched to be unbelievable. \\n\\n\r\nThis gives the story a good bit of lore to work with, and as long as harem cliches and light ecchi elements aren't a deal breaker for you, there's some enjoyment to be had here. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art looks good, I really like the way they have the powers deployed, especially the avatar powers the male lead has. If I ever get godly powers, I hope I can summon MISTER pig like he does. I love the way they portray the powers in use. The colors all pop, and the characters look pretty good for the most part. I didn't notice any huge things to knock in general. \\n\\n\r\nThe things that did bother me were things like the male lead's 'pocket plane' or ability to move the fight into a special dimension. If you've ever seen Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works, then you'll immediately compare this place to the place Archer has. The difference is that this plane in Campione is filled with golden swords, which makes the place a little gaudy looking and a little silly. Personal preference I imagine, but compared to the Archer's wasteland, the one in this series is garish. They don't stay long in that place, thankfully.\\n\\n\r\nThe other big knock I have is somewhat spoiler related. If you're eagle eyed enough, notice what Athena is wearing in the opening theme. They give away Athena's final disposition (which isn't too surprising anyway) by what she chooses to wear. I think that's a sign there might have been at least a consideration as to making more of the series, her apparel seems to indicate a closer relationship with the male lead than what they develop in these few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThere is one slide in the opening, at the end of the song, that is just silly. It has the entire bevy of beauties draped over the hero in his golden sword place like they are all his honeys and he's the big pimp daddy. I think this distracts a bit from the story itself, as its not as stereotypical as that one shot would indicate.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise things looked fine. Not eye popping, not disappointing, just well, a seven. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe voice actors in this anime are really good, which as we know isn't always the case with dubs. Erica's voice actress rolls that Italian off her tongue and sounds good doing it. Athena features a voice by Brittney Karbowski, which is fitting for her size and stature. She does a good job of personalizing the voice as well, making sure Athena doesn't sound like the other characters she's played in other shows. There are a few more well known dub VA's in the show, but none of them carry in such a way to be distracting or too reminiscent of other characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is fitting, rising and falling well with the action onscreen. The theme songs are appropriately rocking, and I did pull the themes to be listened to alone, especially the opener. They are fitting to the material, and not bad by any means on their own. The sound matches well to the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are all pretty well done. The male lead isn't a complete moron (thank you!) like they are in most harem based shows. He also states himself to be a pacifist, and while he does lay the smackdown when forced, he does show mercy whenever he can. He is convincing in regards to the fact that he doesn't see himself as some great demon slaying king or what have you. He actually treats the girls well, not wanting to push them even into something as simple (or as important) as the magic-teaching kiss. He's not too stupid, nor is he too wrapped up in lusting after his harem. He strays close to being goofy with the embarrassment when he fumbles into a girl in a compromising situation, but that's kind of par for the course so I can't complain too much. He also actually seems to care about the girls in that he isn't having internal monologues about nailing them, ala Issei from DxD. He seems to genuinely care about his flock. \\n\\n\r\nThe Italian knight is overall pretty well done, except for her constant need to remind everyone, including the hero himself, that she is his 'first' wife to be, and that she will always be number one. She drops the hammer and kicks some ass when needed, but always under a veil of being superior to the other girls in the lead's affections. She has some pretty impressive battle abilities, and doesn't hesitate to engage a foe that threatens her man even if its a fight she could not possibly ever win. She's willing to give her life for him, if the need arises. \\n\\n\r\nThe second knight is more interested in being the Italian knight's rival than she is interested in the male lead some of the time. She's from a different organization from Italy girl, and so they kind of butt heads here and there on procedure and such. She also changes alliances from another to the male lead in a way that seems slightly weak. She is then the girl who falls in love with the hero, but cannot admit it and is all embarrassed around him. She's kind of a foil to the Italian knight in that she's always protesting the other's assertion that she's his number one woman. She is ass kicking in her own right, and is quick to engage also, especially if the other knight is fighting. Gotta show that blonde girl her place, this one. \\n\\n\r\nThe shrine maiden is the classic 'stay pure but don't let blondie win' kind of character. She's always trying to protect the male lead from what she considers the lechery of the blonde knight. She reminds me a lot of Asia from DxD if you're familiar. She is always telling the Italian girl to back off, then acting all shy when a situation happens where there is any romantic action between her and the hero. Of course she's in love with him as well, but has to do the whole 'innocent little me?' act. She wanders close to annoying sometimes, but that's more because I like tsundere girls than likely any fault in her character. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few more girls that come around, an exasperated little sister who cant believe her brother's sudden popularity, a powerful woman of some sorts that kicks off the adventure, and apparently doesn't age, as she was young when the male lead's grandfather knew her, and is young still. A couple of maids from the organizations the knights represent pop up here and there, along with Athena making repeated appearances in the show. This is basically just as one would expect with the harem category, so it doesn't break any new ground, but it also doesn't hammer them into some big orgy as some stories try to do. A large and somewhat varied cast overall, even if some of them are fairly one note. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this series. I loved when the Italian knight said her little catchphrase that called forth her sword. I liked how the different powers came into play. I even enjoyed the lore they tried to build as they led the story forward. It was a promising start, and I just wish they would keep going in the direction they ended with. As it stands, its an enjoyable enough ride to take, it just left me wanting to see more. They also skip over some events quickly, such as offhandedly mentioning that the male lead had met and sparred with another campione from Italy, but we're never shown anything about that. With more episodes they could draw out elements like these and give them real legs, instead of having to rush through to be close to where they needed to be for the ending. A little bit more lore building and god fighting, and this would have ranked a solid eight ore even a nine, easily. \\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Erica the Italian knight. I know I say I have a thing for tsundere characters and I usually do, but Erica was just too awesome to not love in this one. Her whole 'it appears its time to duel' speeches, her ass kicking ways, just loved her from top to bottom. Mean is good, but sometimes confidence is awesome too, and Erica's one confident chick. \\n\\n\r\nSo I say take the ride, and for sure check out the narrator's voiceover in the dub version. He's so over the top its hilarious. There's enough action to keep the story moving, there's a great balance of blushing ecchi vs jokes vs fights to keep one's attention. If there's an element you don't care for, there's little to worry, as each element isn't dwelt on overlong as they can be in other titles. Erica, the Italian Red Devil makes an entry on the RTLR wall of babes with blades. Thumbs up!",

            "content": "Campione! is an unfortunate anime.\r\nThe set up is cool, at least for the harem genre - random guy kills a diety and inherits his powers, which causes him to fight other deities and attract various pretty girls during his adventures who compete for his affections.  And if you bother to read the light novels (there are over fifteen of them I think), the story and characters are pretty good for the most part. \r\nBut Campione! in its desire to hit the apparently required minimum harem four-girl threshold by the end of the series decides to cover way too much material in too short oftime.  It feels rushed from the beginning, making every development with the female characters feel even more unbelievable than normal for this type of anime.  It also makes the misstep of taking the story chronologically instead of following the storyline in the books.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, for those of us that watch dubs, the voice acting in this one is bad.  The voice actress for Erica is terribly miscast.  \\n\\n\r\nArt is good, not great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime could be a lot better if the anime staff had put more faith into the underlying source material rather than making a checklist and forcing too much into too little space.  Do yourself a favor if you are thinking about this series.  First read the light novels (you can find them online).  Then check out the series so you'll be able to fill in the gaps in your head.  \\n\\n\r\nHopefully, another studio will take a crack at this one after the light novel series puts out a bunch more volumes in another few years.  There is a lot of potential with the source material.  But I doubt the anime made enough of an impact to get another season green-lit.",

            "content": "Not As Bad As I Expected It To Be\r\n*note* I have not read the LN so do not judge me on this review as an adaptation. I am not familiar with the LN and I do not know how accurate it is as an adaptation. *note*\r\nI'll admit, when I started watching this anime, I wasn't getting my hopes up for it. I figured it might have some decent action with a couple decent comedy scenes amongst the harem. As it turned out, this anime was actually quite a bit better than I expected. I wouldn't call it great, but it was far from the mediocreharem anime I thought it might be.\\n\\n\r\nI felt what made this anime so good was the hilarious character interaction when comedy was intended and the romantic/dramatic interaction when the scenes became tense. While Goudou didn't necessarily like it, I found the chemistry between him and Erica was fantastic. Erica Blandelli might be one of my favorite characters from any anime of 2012 with just how liberal, yet forceful and strong she is. She is madly in love with Goudou even though she permits him to have another mistress as long as that mistress is useful. I found that to be hilarious. This was also one of the few harems where I didn't find the rest of the women in the harem to be completely annoying and useless. Liliana, Yuri, and Ena all have their moments and their personalities are well on display. \\n\\n\r\nI was also pleasantly surprised with the action/combat in this series. The fight scenes were entertaining and dramatic. I did groan a little at first when I discovered Goudou had to learn about the gods he was fighting through \"informational kissing\" with those in his harem, but it soon became somewhat comical and eventually second-nature. It barely became noticeable as the series progressed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought the artwork was pretty solid as well with the best aspect being the action sequences and environmental artwork. My dock against the artwork was the character designs which for those that are familiar with harem animes know what I'm talking about...odd proportions and alike. It wasn't exactly \"Code Geass\" bad but it was noticeable at times. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting was fantastic in my opinion. It really felt like I was watching something that would appear in a Percy Jackson movie (modernized Roman, Greek, etc. warfare). That actually reminds me of yet another thing I liked about this anime. I LOVED the diversity this anime used with its gods. This wasn't just Roman or Greek mythology. There were Middle Eastern gods as well as Japanese/Eastern culture gods as well. I found it to be a refreshing mix. \\n\\n\r\nThe downsides of this series are pretty slight. I didn't feel like this anime had a real strong conclusion. I thought the final episode was a little bit of a letdown and the sequence during the final battle to be somewhat cheesy. My other major beef was the obvious omission of light novel content missing from the anime. I haven't even read the light novel and even I could tell that this anime skipped ahead. One such example is when Salvatore Doni is introduced. He came completely out of left field and after listening to his phone conversation with Goudou, it felt as though I missed something important by not reading the LN. I understand that this anime was only 13 episodes and might not have had the production time to explore the entirety of the LN, but it was apparent that this anime probably should've ran longer to include that content (perhaps 24 episodes instead of 13). \\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, I can't complain a whole lot about this series. I was especially thrilled with the romantic developments between Goudou and Erica as the season wore on and it was refreshing to see a harem anime that put its foot down and said Erica IS the lead female. There have been too many harems that I've seen where they left things way too open to debate. Not this one. I'm not even a big harem anime fan and even I can admit that I am completely open to a 2nd season of Campione!",

So after meeting Erica and slaying his first God, thats pretty much how his life is.\r\nArt: Great art that i found was just like most recent animes with very good background as well as character details.

Fanservice too good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Just normal sound for a recent anime (it was made in 2012) so nothing too special, good voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character development was actually very good for the short amount of time that they had, and the actual characters were fairly like-able, personality and actions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed pretty much everything in this anime, there was pretty much nothing wrong with it, being that its the only anime that I've seen so far( i haven't watched many) that i was truthfully give a 10 to.

            "content": "GEEZ!!!! And you thought Asterisk War was bad?\r\nAnyway, I actually haven't finished this anime yet, but I felt like I just had to review it.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nI honestly don't care much for the story. It's about our main protagonist Godou becoming a god slayer, or Campione as their called, and then begins his quest to acquire the biggest harem in all of anime history. I'm just kidding about the harem stuff, but what actually happens is that Godou just fights gods and other Campione for some reason like one of the girls in his harem gets kidnapped. It kind of reminds me of A Certain MagicalIndex how there really isn't just one main storyline, but a bunch of small storylines in one anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nNow for the cringiest section of the review. The characters possibly couldn't get any more cliche. Our main protagonist Godou is pretty much your average boring main character that acquires a harem throughout the anime. But I think his harem is cringier than himself. First is our main heroine, Erica Blandelli. When I first watched Campione, I thought she was going to be more like a tsundere or majestic like Saber, but OH GAAAAAAWWWWWWD!!!!!! I was so wrong. She is a cringy, unoriginal, flirtfested slut. I mean, Godou and Erica kissed on the mouth ON THE FIRST EPISODE!!! She continues to be a slutty maniac throughout the anime. There should be a new type of here for anime girls like Erica. I wonder how a sluttere or a cringidere would fit? Anyway next is Mariya Yuri. She's pretty much a dandere and theres nothing really special about her. There is also Liliana who also fell for Godou's clicheness. She's pretty obedient to Godou. Oh there's also the villain Athena, but she's also kind of boring. A lot of the characters are very similar to the Asterisk War characters. Godou is like Ayato. Mariya is like Kirin. Erica is like Claudia. The cringe is too much. Nothing original about the characters at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nThere is a lot of freaking hardcore ecchi and kissing in this anime. I haven't watched Highschool DxD, but that's probably worse though. Now you might think since I'm a teenage boy and all that I might enjoy this kinda stuff, but the ecchi scenes were just extremely cringy and it distracted me from the other stuff like the action and plot. I guess the action scenes were alright, but not really too much to enjoy besides the ecchi, if you like that kind of stuff.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8/10\\n\r\nNow the OSTs and the art are definitely Campione's best qualities. It's actually why I wanted to watch this anime. The OST is just simply amazing and awesome. Campione probably has some of the best music I've heard in an anime. While the soundtrack is great, the op and ed aren't really that great in my opinion. The art is pretty generic, but I think it's still a good art style that's appealing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:5/10\\n\r\nIf you don't like cliche, cringy anime, then I recommend you stay far away from Campione. If you like ecchi, Campione will probably be one of your favorites. If you're looking for anime to add to your list, I think you should try to postpone watching this anime. I guess it mostly depends on your tastes. If you like SAO, Asterisk War, or generally an ecchi genre, I think you'll be able to find a good amount of enjoyment from Campione. If your tastes are not what I just listed, then you should probably not watch Campione, although I highly recommend you check out its OST cause it's simply epic. I don't mind anime like SAO or Asterisk War too much, but the ecchi and harem stuff was just way too much for me. Thx for reading.",

            "content": "Campione, the series I kept mispronouncing as \"champion\", is a subpar action-based harem with a very uneven plot line and so many incorrect uses of classical mythology that it would cause a classics professor to commit suicide. If you enjoyed the likewise-confused plot line of Hagure Yuusha no Estetica, know that this is very similar except with (more traditional) stronger female leads.\r\nSo basically, a dude returns a tablet-like relic that his grandfather passed down (no explanation) to a mage/slut and, soon after being asked to keep it, decides to use it against a god and successfully becomes a god-slayer. Now with literally god-like powers, hesoon attracts a harem; conveniently enough, the only way for magic to work on his surprisingly human looking non-human body is through his lips. You can probably guess the rest from there...\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. Take an ordinary person and mix with a handful of girls, a CGI ripoff of the Unlimited Blade Works reality marble, and random classical mythology jargon to get out of any sticky situations and poof you have a winner! Right? ... If you make it through episode two, consider yourself a stalwart.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nOverall, CGI aside, the animation quality isn't as bad as my intro above would have you think. This is actually a fairly drawn series with some fairly decent fight sequences, literally so good that it throws gods around! Puns aside, in addition to pleasing colors and effects, you'll find a nice array of character designs- if only they used as much effort on the character development, but more on that later. Surprisingly, for a harem-based series, the first female lead transforms into an actually reasonable fighting outfit rather than your expected tiny miniskirt.\\n\\n\r\nThe action consists of a mix of swordplay and hurling magical energy back and forth- just like in Hagure. There is a slight sense of greater urgency here as Godou is nowhere near as confident as the lead in Hagure. As alluded to above, there is a substantial dosage of ecchi here be it girls forcing themselves on Godou (as you must not anger a godslayer- for undisclosed reasons) or the random excuses for additional French kissing (and, probably intentional, figurative sex act in ep 11- for you fanatics).\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show opens with a standard J-pop song with light hints of rock and electronica- if only the melody were a bit more defined. The ED is a much cleaner, crisp song performed by a 17-year-old. The BGM is nothing special except for the opera/orchestra-heavy reality marble moments where they really up the tension to blabber some more gibberish comparable to stating that OMG if I apply a rubber band to quantum mechanics, cause it is found wrapped around packaged sandwiches, suddenly the concepts are compatible with classical physics so Eureka! (giant sword appears out of nowhere and the entire world trembles).\\n\\n\r\nAs for VAs, the standout is, this is a new one, the announcer! He does a tremendous job of pumping up a character that really doesn't deserve any of it. Youko Hikasa did a great job as Erica as well, if only there was a bit more development to validate her character actions.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis story is incredible in many ways. Not only does it challenge my definition of epically bad pacing, it challenges my definition of the worst special attack to defeat your opponent. I'll give the director some \"guts\" points for not pulling the string on this one. The show starts as an interesting thriller, paralleling the beginning of Shana (suddenly forced into a new world and instantly protected by a tsundere-turned-girlfriend). However, it soon reverts to an arc-based harem where the abilities of Godou gives him an ultimate plot shield so strong that you really start to lose interest. With each antagonist/god, it's the same rinse and repeat formula that reminds you of Sailor Moon and Power Rangers.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing to keep things interesting is the seemingly random direction that the plot meanders. Here are some examples: antagonists will suddenly change sides, random side characters will come save the day, lolis will morph into milfs, and the characters get transported to an alternate dimension. Don't expect any explanations for any of the wacky setting either. In summary, if you enjoy being thrown in random plot directions, that are all conveniently solved by the same magic formula, then by all means dig in to this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the pain continues here as well. The series spends so much time focusing on battles and dizzyingly random plot directions that you really don't get a feel for any of the girls- is that not the point of a harem? Heck, Erica even condones Godou getting a subordinate wife. There will be a few bouts of jealousy to try to ameliorate this- nowhere near enough. Girls are continuously introduced throughout the series, all the way through to the final climax; thus expect an unnecessary number of unimportant supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nI am happy to report that not everything is under the weather for this series. In terms of male leads, Godou is a bit shy (kind of the trend in harems) but at least he's not a reserved chicken. And the interactions with the girls, in general, are fair, if only lacking in some context and (occasionally) explanation.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nPlease let me conclude with a parody of the show's introduction:\\n\\n\r\nCampione - a Godslayer - is a supreme flop.\\n\r\nSince the main character can kill celestial beings, it must be worth watching, regardless of whether events make sense.\\n\\n\r\nCampione - a Godslayer - is a bore.\\n\r\nSince the power to kill a deity is in his hands, nothing can really harm him- so what's the point?\\n\\n\r\nCampione - a Godslayer - is a devil.\\n\r\nAs the series tempts you with attractive girls, only to throw you around in a pointless roller coaster.",

            "content": "Updated 10/3/12\r\nWell, this year was my first year back at major anime watching in a long time. I started up again this spring, and I've got to say, it's either me-- or anime got super ecchi. \r\nEveryone has their own standards as to what floats his/her boat, and I can openly say that this anime did pretty well.\r\nStory- 7\r\nUPDATE: I've finished the series. My expectations weren't off at all considering that I watched every episode, except for 13, while it was still airing. The ending was meh, but what could I have expected. But the same can go for a majority of the previous season'sanime (Hagure no Yuusha Ecstetica, Dakara  Boku Wa H Ga Denkai). Wait-- not only last season's, but it can apply for a lot of recent day animes. If I did not come back and watch anime, I would have been REALLY bothered by the ending. However, I did come back to watching anime this year-- and was disappointed by numerous endings. Luckily I got used to the bleh endings after watching a few bleh endings.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist, Kusanagi Godou is a campione-- a god slayer.A campione has his/her set of special abilities called authorities. The campione's abilities come from a god that one has slayed. I can openly say that this is very original. At the moment, I can't think of any anime/manga that mimics or comes close to the ideas in this anime/novel. \\n\\n\r\nNot much background is given about life before the series, given that this is a 13 episode anime. Although it is a harem, it's not all about the ecchi related things. Everything did flow, but maybe everything flowed too fast. Godou does get stronger indeed, but how is the question. Besides the fact that he has 4 knights/women standing beside him, doesn't change the fact that he gets stronger in a flash. I know that he does get stronger through acquiring the knowledge of/about the gods, but that doesn't explain how he learns how to fight and uses Verethragna's authorities. Otherwise everything flowed very smoothly. Considering that it's 13 episodes long, I can't expect this anime to go out in a BANG. It might be left open for a second season, or it might be altered story-wise (like some anime-- Pandora Hearts to just give an example). \\n\\n\r\nThere was a lot missing from the anime that was in the novel, and if the studio would have chosen to put those parts in, I personally thought it would have been a lot better. Instead of a really rushed, mundane 11-13 episode anime-- it could have been so much more. Just an opinion, as is this review.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nThey did great with the animation and artwork. They didn't cut corners in any of the 12 episodes so far. Everything was VERY detailed. I have personally gone to Italy, and I can say that they did a good job of portraying Italy. The scene where Godou first encounters Perseus was a place where I went, and they did a good job of putting it in. The train station from the 1st episode could have actually looked like that in real life, but with more people.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's just me, but I didn't hear that many catchy tracks. They did a good job here, too. The seiyuu did splendid jobs (spare me episode 12). ANYWAYS, there wasn't anything that bothered me at all. Everything sounded as it should have.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10->9\\n\\n\r\nUpdate:\\n\\n\r\nI do believe that the characters did have SOME time to develop/show more character. Erica was pretty much the same from beginning to end (considering that she was somewhat of a tsundere, opening up to Goudo when she found out he was a campione). I really thought that Ena could have had more screen time/character development. However, I guess this all can also be attributed to the fact that it was 13 episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nI think I'll be able to remember these characters in a few years time. Godou isn't a weak lead in this harem. He's actually just right in the middle. Not too strong, and not too weak. Godou isn't oblivious (if I remember correctly), and he isn't over confident either. He's what I'd call a homeostatic lead. Not extreme in any way. Liliana and Erica are the 2 more memorable of the 4 in Godou's harem, primarily due to more screen time is what I think. Erica is probably the most horny yet elegant female lead. Yeah, an oxymoron right there... Liliana, although she somewhat follows the norm of a shy girl, doesn't follow the norm at the same time. She eventually opens up and openly shows her feelings for her king. Ena is very lax. Not something you find everyday in a harem. Her personality is a bit different. She's laid back, but at the same time she likes Godou. She was introduced rather spontaneously, so I guess that's why she seems different. Yuri is closest to the visual novel norm... the shy innocent girl. Not a bad thing FOR ME, but not a good thing either. Even though she was introduced early on, and was shown throughout the series, I had the most trouble remembering her. And then comes Athena. She's not an \"official\" member of Kusanagi's harem, but she is a part of it. Unique to her is the way she joined it. She started off as an antagonist and became an unclear character later on, although it can be assumed she is on Godou's side. \\n\r\nOverall, I think these are the most memorable characters of Summer 2012. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 10\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: Overall it stayed the same. I am used to seeing the cliffhanger/bad/so-so endings, so the 13th episode did not really subtract from anything.\\n\\n\r\nI thought this to be one of the best, if not the best of Summer 2012, and *maybe* this year for me. Godou was unique in that he was close to normal. He and Issei are my favorite leads of this year, and possibly of all that I have watched. The 1st episode reeled me in. I've seen tons of anime with spirits, but I don't think I've seen any with mythical gods. The story is great so far for 12/13 episodes done. I'm almost positive that this is the best of Summer 2012. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I've completed the series, I'll update the review and give it my final thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nDone with the updates!\\n\\n",

I rarely get the level of romantic satisfaction I want out of an anime, let alone an ECCHI HAREM anime.

            "content": "Let me tell you THIS anime \"COULD\" have been REALLY GOOD! Okay, so i finished this anime the moment the last episode aired and I was disappointed from the start till the end. I can tell you the powers in the anime was REALLY magnificent. The powers could have turned the anime into a god-like action anime but it happened so that it became quite unexpectedly bad... :( Well here are the reasons: Firstly, the character development was horrible... I mean i know its a grave situation and all but how can someone fall for a guy after \"1\" kiss?! Seriously? And also the KusanagiGodou's power could have been shown a bit more flashy. It looked like twigs when you compare it with other action animes. Not only that but the fact that every single harem anime endings are so cliche, I thought i would suffocate. Is it a must for harem anime to end with someone saying \"WHAT IS GOING ON?!!!!\"... Seriously, its TOO cliche.And it seemed like the ending was rushed too much. I like how the guy has the power to shoot golden swords and all...Thats cool but the fact that how he uses it is so stupid from the start till the end, i feel i need to slap him and tell him to use it better... Anyways this anime could have been way better if the powers and characters were developed better...",

            "content": "Campione! a series with lots of potentials. \r\n(This series is a bit special for me so, please forgive me for this big intro, that is needed to explain the background I found myself while watching it...)\r\n  -First of all, let me tell that I have a history with this anime! Before 2012 I was ignorant about anime, about Japan culture and industry, and the only anime I had watched was Naruto, and those typical famous and classic childhood anime, that pass alot into the TV's, that everyone knows about... then in 2012 when I was \"re-introduced\" into the anime world, one of the firstanimes I heared alot, was Campione!, the show was on the first episodes and people keep saying it was promising and it was great, etc etc...\\n\r\n-After the show ended, I had it to watch, I was ready to see the whole thing, but since then (2012) to a few weeks ago I never gave it a try. \\n\r\nBetween this whole time, I saw alot anime, read alot manga and many Light Novel (LN) volumes!!\\n\r\n-So when I gave a oportunity to this anime this year, I had already heard the anime was disapoint and didnt lived to its hype. \\n\r\nI also knew the anime was an adaptation of the original work, the Light Novel (which as of now spawns 16 volumes), my experience told me to read the LN first before watching the anime, as the original work would be better... Indeed, and to everyone that has seen the anime and loved it, READ THE LN, you will love the series even more, I m now at vol 6, and I LOVE IT! \\n\r\n  -But getting to the point, reading the volumes of the LN before seeing the respective arcs of the anime... it was a wise decision!\\n\r\n  -A quick comparation between the anime and the LN, lots of details were cut from the LN to the anime! Fights are more epic, everything from story to characters is better developed, feels more natural, and most of the cast of the LN never appeared on the anime (for example Godou's grandfather, his classmates, and many more!, in the end most of the \"side stories\" of the LN were skipped because of this, thus alot of the background of the LN is missed into the anime, so the anime seems to be much more rushed and messy)! \\n\r\nSo my experience with the anime after reading the corresponding volumes, it was a big resume, without some vital scenes, thus the LN is much more entertaining and better paced overall!\\n\r\nNow lets review the this:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: \\n\r\n  -The story is unique in the sense that you have Campiones, human beings that surpassed humanity boundaries, and managed to LUCKY kill a [Heretic God] (gods that go beyond their miths, they show themselves on Earth and cause great havic and panick for they selfish needs, these gods appear as enviromental hazards, like hurricanes, tsunamis, storms, on their trails of destruction)! \\n\r\nONLY Campiones themselves can defy and kill these [Heretic Gods], and only Campiones or [Heretic Gods] stand a change confronting a another Campione! Thus making the Campiones the \"King of Kings\", the \"Devils Kings\" of  all of the humanity that is aware of all these phenomenons, Campiones are the hope of humanity agaisnt the calamity called the [Heretic Gods], Campiones are the ultimate warriors for whom humanity pledges and serves as their masters!\\n\r\n  -The story follows Godou a newly born Campione, and his up to 4 increasing harem of beautiful girls, as they fight [Heretic Gods] and other beings... this is a bit generic, but it also makes for lots of light hearted, warm moments, ecchi scenes (if it is a harem...), comedy and action, thus you get a nice mix to entertainment, and if you are accostumated to harem action stuff, you will find some value entertainment here.\\n\r\nSTORY: 8\\n\\n\r\nART: \\n\r\n   -Its actually not bad, indeed great, the action scenes could be more loyal and epic compared to those of the LN, but there are already pretty entertaining, the anime tells the story of the first 5 volumes, so expect alot of different scenarios and even beautiful enviroments, and except for all that I said before, reading the LN and coming see the anime, it was quite good to see all those various adventures animated, and the 4 harem girls are all very moe, cute and charming in their own ways, and then you get the daring kiss scenes... downgraded from the LN, but as I had feedback of the LN, I understood all of what happened more, and gave it more meaning , lets say for me, it was less like ecchi, and more like emotional scenes of the cast.\\n\r\nDefinitly a big PRO after seeing the anime.\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\r\n  -Quite good, saw the OP's and END's fully in almost all of the episodes, and the music and voice acting was quite decent for the what the anime is about.\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: \\n\r\n  -The thing I most love in the series are the characters, they are unique, for the first time, I want the guy to fall in love for all the 4 girls and acknownledge them and their support to him!! In the anime these are rushed, but are still funny and engaging to enjoy while watching them, while the story unfolds. \\n\r\n  -There are flaws, like I said, but most of the main cast key development is good enough to give you same favorites. Each girl is distinct and unique enough, and they all give much charm to the anime, along with the battles and mythology stuff.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \\n\r\n  -This is where I m influenced by the original work, the Light Novel.\\n\r\nAt first I though reading the LN would make me enjoy less the anime... I WAS WRONG!! I knew everything that happens and that should had happened (but it was skipped and cut from the original work)! \\n\r\n  -I eargly found myself giving more time to read a whole volume, so I could see how it's arc, was animated! Because I deeply enjoyed the feelings and emotions (either laugh, love or sadness and anger), the LN transmit upon me, \"I need see this is action!!\", or \"I need to see how will this power be shown, or how that enemy will appear!\".\\n\r\n  -I was a bit mad that some great some didnt get animated, that some characters didnt appear, that whole scenarios werent portrait as well as they were in the LN, and that some scenes that were emotional and meaningfull on the LN appeared to be much more cheap and for fanservice only, in the anime!\\n\r\nBUT as I said I had the feedback, and the background that having read those scenarios hours ago, gave me... SO suddently I was starting to love reading the LN, finding what happens next, and then hopefully see it mostly animated, after!!\\n\r\n  -This turned out extremely well, and made me love the anime, MORE, than if I hadnt read it first on the LN. So, yea, this will be very biased!!\\n\r\nFor me, I really love the whole thing of the LN, though generic and cliche at times, I found it to be very charming and to my taste! (I m quite suprised honestly, didnt expect to love the characters this much, it is like Highschool DxD, they make for their plainess, by giving me alot of LMAO moments) soo... \\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo OVERALL:\\n\r\n   -You like action, romcom, and can afford to see ecchi scenes without feeling disgusted, do you want some cute, warm lovely moments of \"power of the young\"?! Also if you like Highschool DxD, most probably you will enjoy this (although the ecchi is much less on Campione!). If with all that I stated you are interested, I give you 2 options:\\n\r\n     -Read the volumes before seeing their corresponding animated arcs;\\n\r\n(Best choice)\\n\r\n   -Or watch the anime, fall in love for it and curse it after (still loving it), because you then gave the LN a try and found everything was better and more epic!!!\\n\\n\r\nEither way, OVERALL: (8+9+8+8+9)/5= 8.4 --> 8",

            "content": "A great anime. Really enjoyable.\r\nThe anime starts with a slightly cliched approach, but it has you by the seat of your pants by the end of the first episode. The stories are very interesting (although somewhat strange) and are a unique twist on mythology. the \"Gods\" are pretty well thought out (still slightly puzzled by loli Athena ~~~hard to say why without spoilers). Interesting approach to battles (dialogue driven) sounds like it would be terrible, however it is very interesting. There are a few blatant Harem suggestions and hints (not the \"Pick one from a harem\", but a \"Like everyone in harem equally\" way). Someof the characters are not fully developed, with hints that they will be developed in the sequel/OVAs.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: very enjoyable anime that you will want to \"*Netflix*\" through. although there are some issues, you will be enjoying the action too much to notice. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*to Netflix* to watch all the seasons/episodes of a show within minutes of each other",

            "content": "this anime anyone should look at is a masterpiece !!\r\nI like it a lot, a harem with a rather original story, but one that does not excite.\r\nThe fact that it was set also in Italy intrigued me a lot but in the end the result is an enjoyable series that does not excel in any aspect, except perhaps for the unusual setting, among other things rather cured, of Cagliari.\r\nThe story revolves around Godou Kusanagi, a Japanese boy who is in Italy (Sardinia) to deliver, under request of his grandfather, an old stone tablet. Here he has his first contact with the gods and the supernatural,having to even face the mythical Persian god of victory Verethragna. Thanks to the help of Erica Blandelli, an Italian girl known a little earlier, and to the stone tablet - which in reality is a powerful grimoire - the protagonist manages to defeat the Persian god and acquire his powers, thus becoming a Champion : a killer of gods. The plot develops with Godou who must learn to use the \"ten powers\" of Verethragna, each of which has a specific characteristic (Wind, Taurus, White Horse, Camel, Boar, Young, Raptor, Goat, Aries, Warrior), a check the Golden Sword - an instrument always belonging to the Persian god - which, being of divine nature, can hurt any deity and face both other Champions (Salvatore Doni and Lord Sasha Voban) and deities (Athena and Perseus). In the meantime it also encircles other girls, like the vestal princess Mariya, the knight Liliana and Ena.\\n\r\nThe mythological component is very important within the soul since multiple divinities are presented, which are characterized and analyzed in a fairly specific and detailed way. It does not slow down or even make the anime boring.\\n\r\nThe graphics are accurate and detailed for the fights, a little less for the characters; a small comparison must also be made with the anime \"Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works\" because the \"world of swords\" by Shirou Emiya is very similar to that of Godou Kusanagi.",

What this anime has though in strides is ridiculousness, so ridiculous that you will be rolling of the floor laughing.  To not spoil anything but give you a basic understanding, he basically cannot use his power to defeat a god unless he knows a lot about a god.  No magic works on him from the outside only magic cast inside him works.  He must then lock lipswith his harem for them to transfer the knowledge and have him defeat his enemy.   Something about this just made me laugh probably because I had no idea what I was getting into.  The characters are so serious but they just make out mid battle.. and you would think they were trying to drown the other with their saliva.  All this and me drinking I almost died laughing.",

If things were properly explained, then I probably would've given this anime a 9, or even a 10. (sorry bruh, but I can't understand anything you say about the god's background when you speed through it, even though I am pretty knowledgeable about Greek/Roman mythology)\r\nSometimes though it feelsas if the harem is fake -- the people are only sticking to him because they want to win his power over to their side. This is probably because it seems as if all four of them fell over to his side a little too quickly (except for maybe Mariya). \\n\r\nThe art was pretty good, the animations too. The sound was pretty good too. The intro wasn't too catchy, but I did enjoy the outro. The characters were pretty well represented... however the lack of a prominent tsundere made it seem as if it was lacking (because, you know, every good harem needs that one tsundere)\\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself was different than most harem animes -- the MC is pretty strong himself, but needs to rely on the girls for his powers to work. For this reason, it's pretty good anime, and I would recommend it people who need a new refresher on the harem genre.",

Also possible spiritual successor to Demon King Daimou.\r\nThis is a harem anime where your main character (male) accidentally kills a god, becomes uber powerful, then all the girls fall head over heels for him because hes god like literally. Before he even gets powerful, he meets two sexy girls, one which immediately asks him for sex, and the other who first threatens him with a knife, becomes his buddy, then gets drunk and asks him to unzip her dress revealingher lacy white unmentionables. The first girl then locks the two in the bedroom and the rest is history. Fast forward literally 10 minutes later and she's professing her love, kissing him multiple times, and the dude just became the new god slayer. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the plot is him using his godly powers to fight other gods around the area. This plot of fighting gods, which are just monsters really, is secondary to harem/ecchi comedy since there are literally girls every 5 minutes trying to bone this guy. Even in his dreams there's a god girl trying to lock lips with him, crazy. I wish the MC would act a little more like a real person and just give into his inner desires instead of playing the \"poor me I am so unfortunate to become godlike and have women want me so badly\". That would be pretty cool imo.\\n\\n\r\nIf you dont want to think and want to watch sexy women try to bang this guy while he feebly tries to move the plot along so he can fight some monst- I mean gods, then this is just what the doctor ordered to kill some time with.\\n",

This anime is absolutely epic and awesome.\r\nStory: This anime has parts and parts of stories relating towards myths and ancient society/religion/beliefs. An anime that has 12 episodes with one big major story is just boring, it will be better if the anime has about 20+ episodes to focus on 1 story. Campione is divided with different stories and goals that the MC has to fight on and after that another conflict happens. Is similar to main stream anime, Ex. Fairy Tail, Bleach, Hitman Reborn etc. Like in each 10-20 episodes involves a storywhen the anime itself is over a 100 episodes. Campione is ingenious using that idea on 12 episode series. Is not time consuming unlike main stream anime. Mark me wrong if there is other anime like that but this anime is ECCHI at the same time. The voice actor of the main character is the same actor as Kirito from SAO, the perfect harem king, and the voice actor of the heroine is the voice actor of High School DxD, the well known, curving body Rias Gremory.\\n\r\nThe story applies to mythology and using them to make it's own story in the anime to make it interesting. So the creator of Campione is manipulating Mythology into his own custom story and still make it true and valid. Smart man.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Is an ECCHI anime, ofc the anime is gonna have excellent art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Is an anime that is relevant to mythology and gods. Is all about gods, of course there will be GODLY soundtrack. The soundtrack is epic and is featured in anime osts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I don't need to say much about it, because most of the characters were veterans of ancient mythology and they already have their own EPIC character/nature/behavior. Gods as arrogant or wise. Then the main character acting was awkward, how he can remain so calm when he learned the truth of gods and him becoming a god slayer, which makes it kinda unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I love it, myths that explains extraterrestrial events that you may or may not know that is truth. While being manipulated and creates a \" human god slayer\" which doesn't exist in mythology. While kissing is a way to transfer knowledge, ingenious, too wonderful. IS ECCHI TOO, DID I MENTION IS ECCHI?",

            "content": "4 Months. It took me 4 months to finish this series (while watching others in between, obviously). I think this should already say a lot about my opinion on this show. It kind of disappointed me as after reading the reviews I came with good expectations. \r\nArt/Animation- \r\nThe art and the animation is pretty normal. Most characters (sadly not the main one) have an original and unique character design, but other than that there isn't much interesting. Sometimes in battle they reuse the same animation for a specific move, and I don't like this. As for the animation on the OP and ED, it's normalas well. \\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nSo, the OST here is really good in my opinion. It fits the situations very well, and you can enjoy it even if the scene you are watching is executed poorly. If it was for the soundtrack alone I would probably give the Sound a higher rating, however unfortunately the voice acting was pretty disappointing most of the time. This show features more than 5 popular voice actors which I know are great and I have watched them do great in many other shows. However there is a lack of any real emotion behind the voice acting for this show, and I can almost assure you it's the lines themselves and not the voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\r\nThe story revolves around gods, the main character who (kind of) killed a god and now has a harem (yeah, that's all I got from this). The first episode was not bad, but one of the biggest problems of this show was shown quickly: It's too fast. And while you can understand the basic situations, you will have a hard time listening to the MC explaining about some god during every climax of every battle. I honestly gave up very quickly. The battles were extremely predictable and while they were ment to be \"Epic\", I found them to be just stacked too many clich\u00e9s. As I said it took me 4 months to finish this, and that's because I just didn't want to watch another episode, even after a cliffhanger. (And I know you are going to ask, \"why did you finish it then?\". Well, I hope you believe me when I say I am one of the people who can't start something without finishing it. Took my time though.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\nI think this is just adding to my negative opinions on the story itself. I think that by their personalities, ALL of the characters are the same version of that character you see like 1 of (or hopefully none) in other anime. The main character is normal, which is absolutely fine; However, the show tries to make you think he is actually SPECIAL. Same goes for the other female characters, who have the normal (and pretty cringy) harem-like interactions with the MC. And as much as I would like to give you examples, and as much as I don't reccomend you watch this, I can't give spoilers. But I hope you can still understand what i'm saying. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Personal Opinion-\\n\r\nIf you read the whole review you will know I did not like this show. The best thing I can say is that I had fun laughing at some of the cringy moments. I can only reccomend it if you are writing a story or something, and want to avoid as much clich\u00e9s as possible- well here you have the best examples for pretty much all of them.",

That's when it hit me: an epiphany, a moment of bliss when I became one with the Universe. What i'm refering to of course is the \"suggestive\" sex scene.\r\nJust when I was getting excited about the MC finally getting angry and turning BADASS MODE on, he forcefully gets on top of a girl and kisses her, while saying ridiculous things like \"take it in..\" and she's screaming in her head \"I can feel your power\". And the true climax? She saysit's the first time he really \"kissed\" her and he then kisses her so hard that she bleeds a little.\\n\\n\r\nThis started as a cool anime but then it turned into something so absurd and cringy, that I can't help but love it even if it's not for the reasons than the creators intended.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 would recommend!

            "content": "Going into Campione! I wasn't really expecting much from it. I'm not a particularly big fan of the harem genre, but the mythology angle of the series intrigued me. While I can't say it's a great show, I will say that it was better than I expected in some ways. That said, it still falters in the areas I expected, namely story and characters.\r\nStory - 4\r\nSimply put, Campione! has no central story. The show relies completely on episodic plots; the most you get is a arc that spans 2 episodes. Normally I'd be fine with that, but there needs to be some kind of over-arcingstory behind what's going on here, and that's what Campione! fails to deliver. The closest thing to this you'll get is in the romance aspect of the show, but even so, it still feels loose and disjointed. It's all very unfortunate too since the premise of the show had so much promise for a truly epic tale.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nI actually liked the art and animation a lot in the show. It's all very bright and crisp; very pleasing to watch. Particularly well done are the battle scenes. The many different attacks the characters use are flashy, but generally not too overbearing. Particularly spectacular are the various powers the main character GoDo uses...though the whole golden field of swords thing is a bit overused...I understand that it's an important part of GoDo's abilities, but it's a very baren, featureless place. Regardless, art is definitely one of the shows strongest parts.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nSound here is also pretty well done, once again, shining brightest in the battles taking place. The sounds of the weapons and attacks are all fitting and do a good job of representing the power behind them. I don't do subtitles so I always watch dubbed versions, and in here it's good, but not really amazing...though I was impressed with Monica Rial, who does a really good job in making Erica sound like the Italian she's supposed to be. As far as music goes, nothing really stood out as being particularly impressive aside from the Opening song, BRAVE BLADE!, which is pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, characters here are pretty run-of-the-mill. The male lead is some hapless nobody who stumbles upon some kind of power that makes him special. There's the overbearing family member, the innocent girl, the bossy girl, the stuck-up girl, etc. There's nothing really new, and hardly any character development aside from Erica, who's assigned the role of GoDo's primary love interest, or at least that's the impression I got from a hilariously awkward fully clothed \"sex\" scene. The only reason I don't rate lower on this is due to the antagonists of the show who are all pretty cool, especially those introduced in the latter half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nAgain, given my dislike of the harem genre, I wasn't expecting much from this show. As it turns out, the show didn't really try to push that as its selling point. The biggest draw for this show is in the fights, for sure. Everything about them is just really fun. They're where the animation and sound are at their best, and the dialogue is surprisingly cool to. Throughout the most climactic parts of the fights GoDo will start relaying his foes backstories while preparing to finish them off in a pretty epic fashion. I know that sounds kind of gimmicky, but it's pulled off really well. There is ecchi in the show, but short of the first few episodes it's used pretty tastefully, only happening when it would be sensible given the situation.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I'd have to say Campione! was an unexpected pleasant surprise to me. I wouldn't call it great, but it's certainly worth your time.",

            "content": "Campione is about a world where gods exist and seem to roam free. If you are able to defeat one of these gods, you gain their power or \"authority\" and are labelled a Campione, and a king. \r\nThe story itself is about an individual who managed to become a Campione without really meaning to in a \"chance\" battle. As a Campione the protagonist then gets forced into battles with other Campiones and gods, with a strong harem overtone.\r\nIt would be a great anime if the writers didn't swing more and more ridiculously towards the harem side, and fan service. With extremely explicit kiss scenes thatmake less and less sense why they are even necessary as the anime goes along; it really starts to ruin the anime. So if you can deal with that I'd recommend this anime; the god inclusion is quite cool, and the characters are very likeable, and art style is really good. \\n",
