            "content": "The Mahou Shoujo genre is all too often populated with casts of sweet, brightly animated lolis who are surrounded by perverted adults and magical animals.  Couple this together with overly long and usually indecent (given the ages of the characters) transformation scenes and stupid inane plots that make watching children's programming with your kids seem smart by comparison.  Shugo Chara! takes those stereotypes and blows them up completely, and leaves us with one of the most wonderful and enjoyable anime experiences ever.\r\nI found this series to be a breath of fresh air.  While the premise of the story is nothing that wehaven\u2019t seen before, it just feels like an original idea.  The plot is very much typical of a Mahou Shoujo series.  If you\u2019ve seen a series such as Sailor Moon, then you\u2019re going to find a lot of similarities.  Our heroine, Amu Hinamori, finds herself thrust into a magical world she never realized was around her until she wakes up one morning with three eggs in her bed.  These eggs soon hatch revealing her Shugo Chara, or Guardian Characters.  We soon find out that everyone has these eggs in their hearts as a representation of their hopes and dreams for the future.  Amu becomes friends with others who have guardian characters and begins to battle against the evil organization called Easter, to protect everyone\u2019s heart egg and find the mysterious one known as the embryo.\\n\\n\r\nThe story moves along nicely early on, introducing us to the world and the characters while explaining origins and back story.  There is a lot of pretty good magical action and surprises along the way.  What was maybe the most surprising to me was the depth of the romance and relationships part of the story.  Considering the ages of the characters, I was not initially all that optimistic about a story that myself, a twenty-something adult could relate that much to.  But I was surprised to find Amu to be a very complex character with a lot of emotional depth.  She grows tremendously as a character from the beginning to the end of this season.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Shugo Chara! is not without its faults.  One of the most glaring is the number of recap episodes throughout the series.  I never have understood the necessity to devote an entire episode towards a recap in this day and age.  In the age of DVRs, internet streaming, and downloading, the necessity to have recaps for new viewers seems like a waste of time to me.  The other major issue was that there was a lot of what I would term \"filler\" episodes.  Stories that did nothing to advance the overall plot in anyway.  For filler they were not bad stories and a lot of them did serve to let us get to know the series huge cast.  But really the most annoying was the amount of it after the main plotline from the second half was concluded.  It felt a bit anti-climatic and was disappointing to have to sit through 7-8 episodes before the season finally concluded with something involving the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast for Shugo Chara is enormous.  Normally I would say this is a major drawback but in this case it really wasn\u2019t.  The key to the whole series is Amu and her guardians.  For me, Amu has already moved into my favorite anime characters of all time.  She is someone I think every girl (and boys too I think) will find something to relate to themselves.  I think her internal insecurities and her outside persona and the struggle to be accepted by society yet still be true to yourself is something that will resonate with viewers.  Her conflicted heart over her romantic feelings for various boys and her own lack of confidence over her own \"true self\" I believe will also strike a nerve.  In a lot of ways I think she is the most \"real\" anime character I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are simply too many other characters to cover in detail with the scope of this review.  Amu's guardians Ran, Miki, and Su are adorable and lovable aspects of her personality.  The same could be said for all of the other guardian characters and their relationships with their owners.  The most important and interesting of the supporting cast is Ikuto.  I see him as a Tuxedo Mask type character from Sailor Moon.  He comes to Amu's rescue when she needs it but isn\u2019t necessarily on her side.  His intentions remain obscure for the entire season so we will have to wait to find the answers to that.  The rest of the cast, while enjoyable, is far more stereotypical and shallow.  You\u2019re bound to have a few favorites from them and even the villains, but this is a story about Amu.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation is outstanding.  I absolutely loved the character designs and styling.  I felt it was a very fresh look.  The backgrounds and settings are a bit over the top at times but beautifully drawn.  The guardian characters are completely adorable and are a certainty to steal your heart away.  The various magical transformations, even in their full form are reasonably short and devoid of pedo fan service.  This was possibly the most refreshing aspect of the whole show.  The music is equally brilliant.  The various opening and ending themes were catchy tunes that captured the spirit and essence of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this series was really off the charts.  I really wanted to give this show a perfect score but the way the story drags on with little happening towards the end hurts its overall score.  If you\u2019re even have a passing interest in Mahou Shoujo stories, then Shugo Chara! has to be at the top of your watch list.  For everyone else, your mileage may vary but I think your seriously missing out if you don\u2019t give this show a try.\\n",

            "content": "Any fan of Mahou Shoujo anime should really enjoy Shugo Chara!, especially since it's been a while since we've seen a Mahou Shoujo anime which has more plot than using sparkle rays to blast some monsters.\r\nShugo Chara! has all the classic Mahou Shoujo elements; blasting away a similar enemy in fillers, overly long transformation sequences, a \"chosen\" and \"special\" heroine, and the classic idea of making enemies into friends.\r\nBut Shugo Chara! has what a lot of Mahou Shoujo seem to be missing. A nice message and some good romance. It's not just about blasting away the enemy, it's about a young girls confusion over her&quot;true self,&quot; something that a lot of people can probably identify with. Amu also finds herself confused very often over what she's feeling over certain guys in her life. After all, good shoujo needs a nice love triangle, doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters in Shugo Chara! are also incredibly entertaining. The Guardians, Easter's two pawns Ikuto and Utau, and certainly Amu herself. Even the fillers are mildly fun to watch...if you're not looking for substance, but just fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shugo Chara! is a good anime to watch. It's been compared to great anime like CardCaptor Sakura, and while I wouldn't go that far, it is definitely the best Mahou Shoujo anime in a while and it does have the appeal to span multiple ages (I've encountered fans from ages 10-30). So, if you're a fan of mahou shoujo, or just shoujo in general, you really can't miss Shugo Chara! (though, I will just leave off mentioning the fillers to warn any impatient viewers).",

For one thing it revolves around an elementary student, and for another it was labled under romance. (I watch a ton of High School Drama's so I'm always on the lookout for a good romance anime)\r\nI clicked on episode one and figured \"Eh, why not give it a try\".  Within the first two seconds I almost stopped it.\r\n\"All kids have an egg in their soul\"..... You can see where im coming from?\r\nBut I didn't, I stuck to it. And I am soglad I did.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has me on the edge of my seat and I can't wait until the next episode comes out. For one thing It does have a great romance plot developing, (Ikuto Tsukiyomi is soooo hot *Im not a fangirl, i swear*) and, although the story is cheesy sometimes, something about it has just hooked me and I cannot stop watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, basically what im trying to say is, Give this anime a try.\\n\r\nYou may love it,\\n\r\nYou may hate it,\\n\r\nYou may become obssesed with it (Which is actually quite easy to do)\\n\r\nHowever you react, you have to at least give this anime a shot.\\n\\n\r\nIm glad I did.",

            "content": "I don't feel like sugar coating this, so I'll just come out and say it: I hated Shugo Chara. Despite the pages of praise, the only thing I found I actually liked about this were the characters. Not all of them, mind. Just five or six. \r\nThe premise was cute, I'll admit, having a special place in your heart for who you want to be, and sometimes being able to meet that person. But by episode 30, I really wanted to stop watching it. By episode 35, I did, until someone told me the final arc of Doki was really good. Man, am I gullible.The sad thing is, most of the fanfiction of this utilizes this idea in a better way than the canon story. \\n\\n\r\nMost episodes being filler didn't help, either. They even had a formula: Amu meets n, a person who is skilled at/in love with n. At/before a really important event, n will somehow mess up/be rejected, and a member of Easter will replace n's heart's egg with an X egg. Amu wil find the egg, make the same gasping noise, character transform,l then spew some stunningly cliche trite and purify n's heart egg. n then usually proceeds to never show his or her face again. They eventually do some variations, such as the x eggs hatching (Gasp.), or the X egg is a person's chara. Expanding on that more, if someone is not a Guardian or an employee of Easter ends up with a chara, you can bet it's going to become an X Egg. Out of the 50 episodes, I recall about 30 being filler.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in Shugo Chara vary greatly. Amongst the main cast, there was a pleasant diversity, although there were a few obnoxious characters. I'm not talking about the reoccurring characters like Saaya, I'm thinking of Kiseki. Was he supposed to be funny? He almost annoyed me as much as Tadase. Why did I find Tadase irritating? Because a main character should be memorable, but I can barely remember anything about him other Amu's endless fawning over him.\\n\\n\r\nOnto aesthetics! The art in Shugo Chara is fine, but there isn't anything truly outstanding. I liked most day to day outfits for the characters, Amu's in particular, but I disliked ALL of the character transformations, though. If I had to pick the absolute worst of the transformations, I'd say Amulet Clover, Clown Drop, and Dear Baby. They missed cute by miles, and strayed far into the territories of awkwardness and stupidity. As for the music in the anime, the openings are all guaranteed starters of uncomfortable conversations. Generally, the sound track was unimpressive unless Ikuto was playing on his violin, or Utau was debuting a new song.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up, Shugo Chara is an anime I might have enjoyed, however the huge portion of filler, and the general dragged out impression it gave me ruined it. For me, the show (including Doki!) was dull and altogether not worth the 102 episodes I struggled through, and certainly not deserving of the praise many of the reviews give it. The fact that so many animes I adore have run for a single season, while this one goes on for 3, with two of the seasons having double, or even quadruple times the amount of episodes as them really annoys me, especially as a simple story like this could have been done in half the episodes at double quality. I wouldn't really recommend this for a person who likes seeing characters ending up together  (due to how it has the most disappointing romance ending ever devised by man) , but if you're a magical girl fan, go nuts.",

It's a childish show, and the transformation of her character is overly dramatized.  I also hate how each episode starts with a weird voice saying \"All kids have an egg in their soul...\" in English.  The story is interesting, and has some plot twists, but not very many.  If you like light, easy-going shows with not much complications, then you will like Shugo Chara!  The art is also great.  I love how much detailis everywhere, and the different outfits the characters wear when they &quot;Chara-Change.&quot;  Sounds are alright, I haven't really noticed them so they're not overly great, and not overly annoying.  Also, the time it takes for Amu-chan to do her &quot;Chara-Change&quot; is too long.  But pretty much any anime with transformations take a long time for the characters to transform.  Overall it's a great show and I would recommend it to anyone, guy or girl, even thou it's on the 'cute' side.",

She wishes to become her would-be self and gets three shugo chara which are like guardian angels that represent your would be self. The story revolves around the guardians a soceity of people with shugo charas includingAmu and their adventures to find themselves and the ledgerndary Embryo which grants any wish.\r\nThis anime has a unique storyline and is a pleasure to watch. Like any typical magical girl anime you have flashy transformation and destroying evil which takes the form of X eggs and charactersin this anime, because of this it can be a bit cliche. The story does have some interesting developments but it also contains a lo of fillers which can be quite annoying at times. It is lighthearted and comical with a tinge of drama.However, for such a long series the story still lacks depth and this could have been made up by using the filler episodes to create more developments in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was so-so. Nothing special, just your typical shuojo style characters with big eyes and varying hair styles.Nothing bad about it but nothing good either.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also ok. I think the voice actors did a good job though and each character was fitted with the perfect voices(quite cute especially the shugo charas). Besides that the songs sung during the show by Utau were quite good. But other than that not much else was done to enhance the atmosphere through the songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were done up quite well partly due to the long span of the anime, most of the characters received some kind of depth and character development was visible throughoutthe show. Perhaps the fillers could have helped create even more depth for the characters. Even the villains get some depth. Very little romance is involved in this anime and is very suttle. Most of the interactions between the characters is merely friendly not intimate but there are some small occurences here and there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i think the anime was not not as good as i had anticipated because it lacked the depth for a long span of 51 episodes and the fillers were quite annoying towards the end with the anime not going anywhere. But it is an interesting anime to watch because many can identify with the theme of a would be self and there are some meaningful messages embedded in the anime. Hopefully the second series will outdo the first.",

I would like to grade it thus far.\r\nI might update this after the first season has finished airing\r\nStory : The story for Shugo Chara is your typical magical girl anime, and yet, it's not. You have the one girl who falls in love with a prince type character but cannot confess her love and nothing seems to go her way. But Amu is not the typical girl who nobody likes and doesn't fit in. No, she's the complete opposite. 'Cool and Spicy' schoolgirl, Hinamori Amu, who doesn't know exactally how to act. Bornfrom these feelings were three eggs, and the story follows through there. Some parts can be pretty generic, but other parts have you on the edge of your seat, wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nArt : I have heard that some people are not fond of the artwork, but I for one adore it. It's a very average style, nothing much to rave about and yet nothing to completely complain about. I still laugh at all of Amu's expressions though, the sparkles around Tadase, and Ikuto's generic 'I don't care' glance. \\n\\n\r\nSound : I love all of the voice actors for this series. Each one fits so very well. You also might recognize Ikuto Tsukiyomi's voice actor, who also played Tomoya Okazaki in Clannad. And Utau is voiced by the extremally talented singer, Nana Mizuki. All and all, the staff did an awesome job with this cast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Characters. Characters. So many characters in Shugo Chara. Yet, all so unique, having some special attribute that when you hear a description word your mind automatically jumps to a specific character in Shugo Chara. I personally adore all the characters in my own way, some may have favorites and some may dislike a certain character to no end, but you'll certainly never forget them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : So far, I have really enjoyed Shugo Chara! It may have it's extreme ups and it can certainly have it's extreme downs, but I think many people will in fact, enjoy this series. There are rumors of a second season because of the increasing manga material and I am pretty sure I am going to watch and compare, telling you guys if you should stick around or if you should drop the series completely, but it's up to you to take the first step. Will you dare to try Shugo Chara?",

            "content": "First Review\r\nAt first, I wasn't sure if I should begin watching a maho shojo anime about elementary school characters. However, when I began watching it, I couldn't have been more wrong. The story, art, and sound were all above average, but what stuck out most was how well the characters were designed, and how much each character developed through the course of the story. However, the thing that held it down was just how much filler there was throughout the series.\r\nShugo Chara tells the story of cool, and \"spicy\", elementary student Amu Hinamori, who actually turns out to be a shy girl who has difficultyexpressing herself. One day, she hears on TV about the guardian characters (shugo chara) that are always protecting them. The next day, she wakes up and find 4 eggs, each containing their own guardian character, and each a person that Amu wants to be. Throughout the story, she meets others with guardian characters, and X eggs, which are the guardian characters of those with no hope, which Amu has the power to purify, and the Embryo, the mysterious character egg the corporation Easter wants to get their hands on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this is one of my favorite MANGA ever for a multitude of reasons. First of all, the characters and story were absolutely amazing, a romance that actually made sense, and some genuinely funny scenes. On the other hand, the art and music were only slightly above average unlike the latter. Flaws included the below average, slow, \"action\" scenes, that were honestly unneeded (you'll see what I mean if you watch the show).\\n\\n\r\nRANT\\n\r\n*A few minor spoilers*\\n\r\n What killed the ANIME nearly entirely were the absolutely terrible amount of useless random characters and an entire unnecessary story arc in the anime. This extends the show far more than it needed to be, and really undermines Amu's special abilities and the X eggs introduced in the beginning. The supposedly rare and exclusive X eggs and Amu and the rest of the Guardians' character transformations are completely put down. Most of the episodes are the same useless thing, in which the guardians find some random kid with a troubled mindset, who gets an X egg, and the guardians come purify them. This becomes worse, and more prevalent close to the end, and every time I saw the same garbage over and over, I wanted to put a gun to my head, because it nearly ruined how great Shugo Chara is supposed to be. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the manga is honestly the better of the two, as it retains everything great about Shugo Chara, but without the things that kept down the anime. However, if you simply don't like reading, then feel free to watch the anime, as it is still an enjoyable anime as long as you don't think to much in the many filler episodes.",

            "content": "Shugo chara didn't caught my eyes in the first place. when i was surfing on crunchyroll.com i saw this anime being featured and it is an all time favourite.\r\nthe first thing that came to my mind is \" it look kinda childish, the pink hair girl is a kid so this should be a kiddy anime \" . but later on my friend told me that shugo chara is nice and ask me to give it a try. i trusted her as she know more about anime stuffs than me, i was totally a noob. the plot found on internet is very simplified. so iguess it won't interest you if you only base on the given storyline. the anime is so much better than i thought. \\n\\n\r\nthe first episode makes me wanna go on to the next and suprisingly i finished 49 episodes in 3 days. i am currently waiting for episode 50 to be subbed. \\n\\n\r\nthe storyline is quite unique, it says that every kid has their would-be self and one day they will become their would-be self. amu, (the main character of the anime) who appear to be cool with attitude to the others. but actually she is just an ordinary girl who is shy inside. she has 3 eggs heart, spade, clover who turns into her shugo charas which are good in sport, art and cooking respectively. she can do a character change to her would-be self and also tranformation which fight the x characters. her alliances are the so called guardians who act as the student council in school. they each have their own shugo chara too but they can't transform like what amu did. \\n\\n\r\namu soon joined them but part of the reason is to get close to her ideal prince tadase. their main aim is to find an embryo which can grant any wishes. i really like the bond of their friendship and also the different characteristics of their shugo charas and it is really fun to see them having a character change. the one who look gentle and elegant actually turns out to be a fierce and harsh one and tadase character change is really hilarious.\\n\r\nnever mention the word prince in front of him cause the 'king' will appear.\\n\\n\r\nanother reason that i love this anime so much is because of another character which is ikuto. go to episode 3, you will fall in love with the scene where amu and ikuto has the eye contact at the kitchen. the way ikuto teases amu is really cute. this is why many of us gone crazy over amuto moments. another character utau who is a popular singer inside act another important role too. i think she is really pretty and her transformations are cool and awesome too. that is why i think the art of shugo chara worth a 9.\\n\\n\r\nall the characters have their unique point and the story developed very well. one of my favourite episode is 29 because so many unexpected things happened in one episode. \\n\\n\r\nIT IS A 'COOL AND SPICY' ANIME ! recommend for shoujo lover. i don't think it suit guys but it depends actually. i can't say that every girls will like this or no guys will get addicted to it. you shall give it a try yourself.\\n\\n\r\nmy first review , sorry if there are any grammer error .",

            "content": "Shugo Chara! Stands out amoungst mahou shojou (magical girl) anime. While it appeases all aspects of mahou shoujo, girl with powers, transformations, roamance, 'cute' themes and such it also includes just that little something that stands out so much.\r\nStory:\r\nThe basic theme of every episode is simple, beat the bad guys, cleanse some eggs, drabble in romance and the such. However, Shugo Chara! has an over all story which brings the main cahracter, Amu, to the brink of depression and the theme of becoming ones true self is interesting. Rather than the story being about the powers and the magic and some war that's been goingon for years, the story is about the characters themselves, finding themselves and others. This is something that stands out for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe orignal style of Peach-Pit carries over to the anime. It's a sweet style that dosn't have the cliche 'my-eyes-are-twice-the-size-of-my-face'. The proportions are nice and the characters are cute, suiting the anime perfectly!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI can't particully say I love the op's and ed's however they are fun. The voices are not ear splitting nor whining, it's very refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAmu is a character that impresses me alot. She isn't overly ditsy or loud. Instead she is character who eveyone thinks is cool and calm but is actually shy and cute. She reminds me of Ryuuji from ToraDora (looks like a deliquint but is actually quite kind). This is so rare in a magical girl it's also quite refreshing. \\n\r\nAnother thing that amazes me is the love triangles. This developed to the point of a RPG game! While she could fall for the prince, Tadase, her relationship with the cliche boy seems so shallow and a much deeper understanding is shown between her and Ikuto. But you never know.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall:\\n\r\nI personally love this anime, it's a nice surprise and twist on the mahou shoujo genre that was much needed! Thankyou Peach-Pit!",

            "content": "Giving Shugo Chara! a try is an absolute must for anyone who is a fan of shoujo or mahou shoujo: because basically, it has all the ingrediants for one. Costumes that cannot possibly be practical but are cute, enemies that are defeated by the power of good, bright colours, younger aged characters and so on. But it doesn't only have that. It has a lot more alongside it. Much more - stuff that other mahou shoujo doesn't tend to have.\r\nIt's geared for younger viewers esentially, but Shugo Chara! is one of those animes that has many levels. It''s underneath its typical deminour that it shines.It's in those many levels that it has the ability to span to so many different people in so many different ways.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: As I've said before, it's typically beat the bad guys by cleansing the eggs, lots of sparkles and shiny moments and some romance here and there. There's also a lot of laughs and unsuspecting moments along the way, which makes watching SC! all the more worthwhile. But it has a very essential message behind it, a message that everyone can connect with. How many times have you pretended to be different to fit in? How many times have you wished you could be more like your true self in front of everyone? That's what Shugo Chara seems to ask and addresses. The focus is on the characters and the routes they take to become their true selves; it's not all about defeating good and evil.\\n\\n\r\nART: To be blunt, it's adorable. It's quite bright to appeal to younger viewers, but it isn't blinding. The colours all work together to create a believable world. It's very rare for any of it to be cheaply done - it's usually very good quality animation and artwork. Overall, it really adds to the atmosphere Shugo Chara brings - and even if the story and everything else is wonderful, if the art is bad, it isn't likely you're going to be able to watch it week in week out.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Typically simple, nice sounds throughout the episodes with recurring ones for the themes of characters and the cleansing of X-Eggs, with slight changes for each transformation. But I like the sound - it adds to the atmosphere. The opening and endings also deserve a mention here - Buono! was a wonderful creation for SC!, and even if I don't have the time or should be doing something else, I always watch through the opening and endings because I like the music. It's very cutesy, which isn't typically what I'm into, but I like it. It's different.\\n\\n\r\nLastly for sound, the voices are all a wonderful pick. I'd say a shout out for Kanae Ito (Amu) is in order here - it's her first role, but she does it all perfectly. She isn't overbearing or annoying or frustrating - but she's believable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: This is another area where SC! shines. The characters are not so-mind-blowingly-over-powered that they're unbelievable. Each one has their own flaws, their own doubts and personal problems. Each character is loveable on varying degrees, and that's because they're so believable. For several characters, too, I didn't like them for the first few episodes they were in. But as I grew to understand them and learn why they act like they do, what they're hiding behind the mask they give to the outside world, you start to fall in love with them. Because you can relate. \\n\\n\r\nAmu is also a refreshing heroine for shoujo. She completely contradicts the trend of cute characters that need protecting by everyone around her - she can be cute, but not overbearingly so. Her complete attitude is a draw in which is why peope like her, even though she fines it fake. Overall, the characters will grow on you in their own way over time.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: It's funny, it has romance, it's not too hard to understand and isn't at all confusing. It's simple in some respects but very effective. And it's easy to connect to, so very much easy to enjoy.",

            "content": "(My First Review)\r\nIn this Anime, \u201cTrue Self Character\u201d and one\u2019s \u201cDream\u201d are the keys to the plot/story and these are represented by \u201cShugoChara\u201d (Character Guardian) and \u201cEgg\u201d.\r\nCharacter, everyone has a character, the way we act, Energetic, Cool, Quiet, Arrogant etc. So often due to our surrounding, we have to employ different characters for instance, Amu had to create a elder sister character due to her younger sister. We hold different characters and in Shugo Chara!, these \u201cCharacter Guardians\u201d are born out of your wish or your true character.\r\nDreams, everyone has a dream. A dream is very fragile, it can easily disappear due under many circumstancesand it may affect your life. The dream is usually what we want to be in future, it can be a person you admire or a career you dream of working towards. And as we know, a dream act as very important role for a kid, it is a great motivation and decides the future of one\u2019s life. In other cases than your wished and true character, Character Guardians can also be born out of your dream, which is also partly our true self. As I said, dream is very fragile, and due to the fragility, Character Guardians may disappear or the Egg will become somewhat \u201chopeless\u201d the way I call it. The fragility may apply to lack of self-confidence, feels hopeless, loss of trust to your dream or your Character Guardian.\\n\\n\r\nSo that\u2019s the plot. The story features Amu, a girl who has a very different character from her \u201cTrue Self\u201d. She didn\u2019t like her fa\u00e7ade character and prayed to be her \u201cWould-be self\u201d. Since then she holds three Character Guardians that presents different characters for her. She is a unique person or \u201cthe chosen one\u201d, she holds three character guardians as other usually holds one. She was also given the \u201clock\u201d later that makes her stronger such as the ability to use \u201cCharacter Transform\u201d that allows her to save other people\u2019s egg/dream.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s one more important thing, that is the \u201cEmbryo\u201d, the special egg that grants any wish. All characters in the Shugo Chara! seeks and fights for it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nHeartwarming, inspirational slice of life, school story accompanied with magic theme combining with the plot above, it brings you a potential story. The only thing left is to see how well it develops throughout the 52 episodes. \\n\r\nMost episodes are stand-alone episodes, some spanning across a few episodes. Each arc/episodes features Amu saving other kids\u2019 egg/dream from being destroyed as well as dealing her own problems and her friends. As the story develops, she makes friend and she meets different challenges that some wavers her confidence and the question of right and wrong. It is a very relaxing anime as well as Amu\u2019s different characters and her character guardians bring her troubles time to time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\r\nCharacter art is good but sometimes inconsistent, the environment art is great for a TV series, its consistent. The typical shoujo magical girl transforming is up to my expectation, but nothing unique. The colourful palette brings relaxation and joy to fun, happy, heartwarming episodes and turns dull during episodes with Amu being depressing. The palette is being used appropriately. There are also some cute scenes with cute expressions making the anime more enjoyable. The animation is smooth, nothing wrong. Overall, it\u2019s good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\r\nJoyful music and dramatic music used appropriately, but not particularly special. Sparkling sound effects used during character transformation and when magical power was used. Great voice acting for each character, as expected from anime, I really liked the voices for the Character Guardians, they\u2019re cute and funny. Overall it\u2019s great. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nDiverse characters. The one that attracted me towards the anime is the plot and the main character, Amu. Amu\u2019s character design is excellent with punk rock style clothing in pink not just in casual clothing but also applying to her school uniform. One thing we get bored with an anime is the main character\u2019s character. But in Shugo Chara!, you\u2019ll never get bored because she has another three characters!! You\u2019ll never get bored of Amu, trust me and you\u2019ll get amused with her being in other three characters, almost being like a person with bipolar disorder. Other characters are great with interesting multiple personality and character guardian contributing to the energetic, fun story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\r\nVery enjoyable. Overall, great plot with good story development, amusing characters, it\u2019s just so fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\r\nI really liked it. One thing we get from an animation is inspiration towards our real life, what we learn from the story. Shugo Chara! has been very inspirational and what I really like is the plot of metaphor of \u201cCharacter Guardian\u201d (Our Would-be self) and \u201cEgg\u201d (Dream) is so true that simple captures the struggle and the fragile dreams of all kids.\\n",

            "content": "Shugo Chara!!!! I'm just going to come right out and say it: It's AWESOME! Finally, a shoujo that isn't like all the others! \r\nShugo Chara is about Amu, a girl who is known as \"Cool & spicy\" [if that doesn't already make you laugh, I don't know what will] by her classmates. She doesn't have any friends because she gives off this cool, \"do whatever you want\" demeanor, but inside she is very lonely and doesn't like how people see her. Amu, convinced she is not her \"would be self\" prays to be remade, and the next morning wakes up to find three eggs inher bed.\\n\r\nSo let me say here: DO NOT LET THE EGGS THROW YOU OFF!!!! The whole egg concept is kind of dumb [the opening theme starts out saying &quot;all kids have an egg in their heart&quot; which, if you think about it, kind of sounds like some illness] but it totally works. Amu can be remade into three different would-be-selves, and her Charas (the would-be-selves that were born from the eggs) are so cute! \\n\r\nThe romance in Shugo Chara is also wonderful. Coming from someone that is a huge Itazura na Kiss fan, I really wanted to watch something that had some romance in it and Shugo Chara delivers. What's so great is that you have absolutely no idea who she will end up with (but you'll be voting for Ikuto, because he is H-O-T). \\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint is the egg thing again. The fact that she her transformation, er, &quot;thing&quot; (like Sailor Moon's mirror compact) is called the Humpty Lock, and that the evil force is called the Easter Company. I don't like the egg-ness of all of that, but if you ignore it, you see some GREAT characters. The character transformations are hilarious, and this anime will guarantee you some laughs. DEFINITELY give it a try and you'll see how great it is. Shugo Chara is quickly becoming my favorite shoujo of all time!\\n\\n\r\nStory--like I said, it's a good story, typical shoujo, but with a twist. That's why I gave it a ten. The villains are not what you're used to!\\n\\n\r\nArt--I personally love the art, you get used to Amu's pink hair. :p\\n\\n\r\nSound--The voices fit each character and Amu actually has a really good voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter--Amu is not your typical shoujo girl. Though she is weak because she doesn't know who she really is, she is funny and never acts in the typical shoujo-ditzy-clueless-I'm-Sailor Moon/Mermaid Melody-way. She doesn't act for the guys that she likes, she acts for herself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment--Fantastic! Like I said, it's a hilarious story and I rarely laugh when watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall--A perfect ten. Even the filler episodes are great.",

            "content": "Story: 10/10. Mostly because of the message behind the whole 51 episodes. At first glance, this anime might look like the usual school life, shoujo anime. If you think about it, there's actually a strong message behind the whole thing. It's just outstanding how such a simple message developing into a whole 51 episode anime... and a couple more seasons after that. (Still didn't get the message? HINT: think about how the eggs represents your dreams) I also really like the original storyline about guardian characters, x-eggs etc. Not to forget about the comedy. I also like how the anime doesn't just focus on onecharacter's problems.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 I personally really like the art. It's detailed and the clothing/hair styles of the characters are unique. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 I really like the opening and the endings. I'm also a fan of Utau's songs (well, maybe not a mega fan but...). I personally think that the voice actors have also done a great job overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10 In some way, the characters are stereotypical and not properly developed. Like how the guardians were popular, how Ikuto appears to be the stereotypical tsundere etc. On the other hand, it wasn't too obvious as the storyline and surroundings 'blends it in' (if I've made any sense at all x__x) Also, no Mary Sues/Gary Stus. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 Personally, this is the anime I've enjoyed most so far. It's quite surprising because this isn't the genre I usually like watching. I suggest you could try watching it even if it's not really your type of anime. It's also a sweet, funny and a somehow relate-able anime, especially the message behind the whole thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 It's alright if you disagree with me. You might not like it as much as I do. I have nothing against that. One final word to sum up: A W E S O M E!!!",

            "content": "Of all the numerous Mahou Shoujo/Magical Girls anime series, Shugo Chara! is one of the best. The majority of animes in this genre tend to be along the same plotline: a ditzy heroine gets magical powers and is given the responsibility to save the world somehow; we all know the story. Shugo Chara!, however, is a breath of fresh air amidst this crazy monotony. First off, Amu, our main character, isn't the stereotypical ditzy heroine (gasp!). Instead, she the \"cool and spicy\" new student. Second, Amu and Co. aren't just saving the world. Instead, this anime focuses on dreams, goals, wishes, and your \"would-be self\".How many times can we honestly say we've seen that in a Mahou Shoujo anime? It may not be a story comparable to, say,the infamous Cardcaptor Sakura, but it ranks fairly high up there. And as a bonus, it's comparitavely free of filler. (That's just RELATIVELY, though.)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great, the art is colorful, and some of the objects (e.g., Heart's Eggs, X Eggs, Humpty Lock, etc.) look almost computer-animeated. The art style is the standard big-eyed Shoujo style, which complements the anime's story and charcters pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, too, is also great. The two openings are a lot less cutesy than the ones in the Doki!! series, which I'm sure most of us older fans appreciate. Even some of the background music, specifically the action scene music, is catchy enough to make you want to download it. No, seriously. Not to mention Utau's songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are unique. Some may get annoying at times, but every series has its share of obnoxious characters. Each character has their quirks, hidden traits, likes and dislikes. Some characters do seem to be slightly stereotypical (e.g., Ran, Suu, etc.), though.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a series to watch, Shugo Chara! is a good pick. The filler may become a nuisance in the Doki! season, but don't let that deter you from the first.",

The storyline is about the same, Easter tries to find the embryo by using schemes, Amu destroys them, and thats about it. Also i don't think they should be using romance in elementary school. I mean save it till middle school at least?\r\nThe artwas good ,but i saw better. The sound i liked, but i think Amu's voice was too high pitched. I didn't enjoy it very much, and the only character i liked was Utau . Sorry for the bad score . I have to say that this anime seems too perfect, it need like a little tragedy ,like Ikuto hating her for like a week , then they make up.",

She didn't really know anything about herself and she felt like she made the wrong impression. As I continued watching, I saw how everything just came together perfectly. There's reason's behind everyone's dream, they didn't just say \"Ok! This character wants to be a ___ when they grow up,\" for no reason. You really got toconnect with each of them to the point where you want their wildest dreams to come true(after you've watched it, it's pretty obvious who I'm talking about...).\\n\\n\r\n It really tells anyone who watches it, \"Hey, dreams are very easily broken, but you should chase them.\" \\n\r\nAlthough the anime could never happen, it seems to show reality more than fantasy. You are going to have fights with your friends, you are going to get hurt and you might even cry, but you shouldn't just give up everything just because one little thing. If you fall, let your friends pick you up and don't care about what others think of you.

            "content": "The Mahou Shoujo genre is all too often populated with casts of sweet, brightly animated lolis who are surrounded by perverted adults and magical animals.  Couple this together with overly long and usually indecent (given the ages of the characters) transformation scenes and stupid inane plots that make watching children's programming with your kids seem smart by comparison.  Shugo Chara! takes those stereotypes and blows them up completely, and leaves us with one of the most wonderful and enjoyable anime experiences ever.\r\nI found this series to be a breath of fresh air.  While the premise of the story is nothing that wehaven\u2019t seen before, it just feels like an original idea.  The plot is very much typical of a Mahou Shoujo series.  If you\u2019ve seen a series such as Sailor Moon, then you\u2019re going to find a lot of similarities.  Our heroine, Amu Hinamori, finds herself thrust into a magical world she never realized was around her until she wakes up one morning with three eggs in her bed.  These eggs soon hatch revealing her Shugo Chara, or Guardian Characters.  We soon find out that everyone has these eggs in their hearts as a representation of their hopes and dreams for the future.  Amu becomes friends with others who have guardian characters and begins to battle against the evil organization called Easter, to protect everyone\u2019s heart egg and find the mysterious one known as the embryo.\\n\\n\r\nThe story moves along nicely early on, introducing us to the world and the characters while explaining origins and back story.  There is a lot of pretty good magical action and surprises along the way.  What was maybe the most surprising to me was the depth of the romance and relationships part of the story.  Considering the ages of the characters, I was not initially all that optimistic about a story that myself, a twenty-something adult could relate that much to.  But I was surprised to find Amu to be a very complex character with a lot of emotional depth.  She grows tremendously as a character from the beginning to the end of this season.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Shugo Chara! is not without its faults.  One of the most glaring is the number of recap episodes throughout the series.  I never have understood the necessity to devote an entire episode towards a recap in this day and age.  In the age of DVRs, internet streaming, and downloading, the necessity to have recaps for new viewers seems like a waste of time to me.  The other major issue was that there was a lot of what I would term \"filler\" episodes.  Stories that did nothing to advance the overall plot in anyway.  For filler they were not bad stories and a lot of them did serve to let us get to know the series huge cast.  But really the most annoying was the amount of it after the main plotline from the second half was concluded.  It felt a bit anti-climatic and was disappointing to have to sit through 7-8 episodes before the season finally concluded with something involving the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast for Shugo Chara is enormous.  Normally I would say this is a major drawback but in this case it really wasn\u2019t.  The key to the whole series is Amu and her guardians.  For me, Amu has already moved into my favorite anime characters of all time.  She is someone I think every girl (and boys too I think) will find something to relate to themselves.  I think her internal insecurities and her outside persona and the struggle to be accepted by society yet still be true to yourself is something that will resonate with viewers.  Her conflicted heart over her romantic feelings for various boys and her own lack of confidence over her own \"true self\" I believe will also strike a nerve.  In a lot of ways I think she is the most \"real\" anime character I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are simply too many other characters to cover in detail with the scope of this review.  Amu's guardians Ran, Miki, and Su are adorable and lovable aspects of her personality.  The same could be said for all of the other guardian characters and their relationships with their owners.  The most important and interesting of the supporting cast is Ikuto.  I see him as a Tuxedo Mask type character from Sailor Moon.  He comes to Amu's rescue when she needs it but isn\u2019t necessarily on her side.  His intentions remain obscure for the entire season so we will have to wait to find the answers to that.  The rest of the cast, while enjoyable, is far more stereotypical and shallow.  You\u2019re bound to have a few favorites from them and even the villains, but this is a story about Amu.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation is outstanding.  I absolutely loved the character designs and styling.  I felt it was a very fresh look.  The backgrounds and settings are a bit over the top at times but beautifully drawn.  The guardian characters are completely adorable and are a certainty to steal your heart away.  The various magical transformations, even in their full form are reasonably short and devoid of pedo fan service.  This was possibly the most refreshing aspect of the whole show.  The music is equally brilliant.  The various opening and ending themes were catchy tunes that captured the spirit and essence of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this series was really off the charts.  I really wanted to give this show a perfect score but the way the story drags on with little happening towards the end hurts its overall score.  If you\u2019re even have a passing interest in Mahou Shoujo stories, then Shugo Chara! has to be at the top of your watch list.  For everyone else, your mileage may vary but I think your seriously missing out if you don\u2019t give this show a try.\\n",

            "content": "Any fan of Mahou Shoujo anime should really enjoy Shugo Chara!, especially since it's been a while since we've seen a Mahou Shoujo anime which has more plot than using sparkle rays to blast some monsters.\r\nShugo Chara! has all the classic Mahou Shoujo elements; blasting away a similar enemy in fillers, overly long transformation sequences, a \"chosen\" and \"special\" heroine, and the classic idea of making enemies into friends.\r\nBut Shugo Chara! has what a lot of Mahou Shoujo seem to be missing. A nice message and some good romance. It's not just about blasting away the enemy, it's about a young girls confusion over her&quot;true self,&quot; something that a lot of people can probably identify with. Amu also finds herself confused very often over what she's feeling over certain guys in her life. After all, good shoujo needs a nice love triangle, doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters in Shugo Chara! are also incredibly entertaining. The Guardians, Easter's two pawns Ikuto and Utau, and certainly Amu herself. Even the fillers are mildly fun to watch...if you're not looking for substance, but just fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shugo Chara! is a good anime to watch. It's been compared to great anime like CardCaptor Sakura, and while I wouldn't go that far, it is definitely the best Mahou Shoujo anime in a while and it does have the appeal to span multiple ages (I've encountered fans from ages 10-30). So, if you're a fan of mahou shoujo, or just shoujo in general, you really can't miss Shugo Chara! (though, I will just leave off mentioning the fillers to warn any impatient viewers).",

For one thing it revolves around an elementary student, and for another it was labled under romance. (I watch a ton of High School Drama's so I'm always on the lookout for a good romance anime)\r\nI clicked on episode one and figured \"Eh, why not give it a try\".  Within the first two seconds I almost stopped it.\r\n\"All kids have an egg in their soul\"..... You can see where im coming from?\r\nBut I didn't, I stuck to it. And I am soglad I did.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has me on the edge of my seat and I can't wait until the next episode comes out. For one thing It does have a great romance plot developing, (Ikuto Tsukiyomi is soooo hot *Im not a fangirl, i swear*) and, although the story is cheesy sometimes, something about it has just hooked me and I cannot stop watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, basically what im trying to say is, Give this anime a try.\\n\r\nYou may love it,\\n\r\nYou may hate it,\\n\r\nYou may become obssesed with it (Which is actually quite easy to do)\\n\r\nHowever you react, you have to at least give this anime a shot.\\n\\n\r\nIm glad I did.",

            "content": "I don't feel like sugar coating this, so I'll just come out and say it: I hated Shugo Chara. Despite the pages of praise, the only thing I found I actually liked about this were the characters. Not all of them, mind. Just five or six. \r\nThe premise was cute, I'll admit, having a special place in your heart for who you want to be, and sometimes being able to meet that person. But by episode 30, I really wanted to stop watching it. By episode 35, I did, until someone told me the final arc of Doki was really good. Man, am I gullible.The sad thing is, most of the fanfiction of this utilizes this idea in a better way than the canon story. \\n\\n\r\nMost episodes being filler didn't help, either. They even had a formula: Amu meets n, a person who is skilled at/in love with n. At/before a really important event, n will somehow mess up/be rejected, and a member of Easter will replace n's heart's egg with an X egg. Amu wil find the egg, make the same gasping noise, character transform,l then spew some stunningly cliche trite and purify n's heart egg. n then usually proceeds to never show his or her face again. They eventually do some variations, such as the x eggs hatching (Gasp.), or the X egg is a person's chara. Expanding on that more, if someone is not a Guardian or an employee of Easter ends up with a chara, you can bet it's going to become an X Egg. Out of the 50 episodes, I recall about 30 being filler.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in Shugo Chara vary greatly. Amongst the main cast, there was a pleasant diversity, although there were a few obnoxious characters. I'm not talking about the reoccurring characters like Saaya, I'm thinking of Kiseki. Was he supposed to be funny? He almost annoyed me as much as Tadase. Why did I find Tadase irritating? Because a main character should be memorable, but I can barely remember anything about him other Amu's endless fawning over him.\\n\\n\r\nOnto aesthetics! The art in Shugo Chara is fine, but there isn't anything truly outstanding. I liked most day to day outfits for the characters, Amu's in particular, but I disliked ALL of the character transformations, though. If I had to pick the absolute worst of the transformations, I'd say Amulet Clover, Clown Drop, and Dear Baby. They missed cute by miles, and strayed far into the territories of awkwardness and stupidity. As for the music in the anime, the openings are all guaranteed starters of uncomfortable conversations. Generally, the sound track was unimpressive unless Ikuto was playing on his violin, or Utau was debuting a new song.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up, Shugo Chara is an anime I might have enjoyed, however the huge portion of filler, and the general dragged out impression it gave me ruined it. For me, the show (including Doki!) was dull and altogether not worth the 102 episodes I struggled through, and certainly not deserving of the praise many of the reviews give it. The fact that so many animes I adore have run for a single season, while this one goes on for 3, with two of the seasons having double, or even quadruple times the amount of episodes as them really annoys me, especially as a simple story like this could have been done in half the episodes at double quality. I wouldn't really recommend this for a person who likes seeing characters ending up together  (due to how it has the most disappointing romance ending ever devised by man) , but if you're a magical girl fan, go nuts.",

It's a childish show, and the transformation of her character is overly dramatized.  I also hate how each episode starts with a weird voice saying \"All kids have an egg in their soul...\" in English.  The story is interesting, and has some plot twists, but not very many.  If you like light, easy-going shows with not much complications, then you will like Shugo Chara!  The art is also great.  I love how much detailis everywhere, and the different outfits the characters wear when they &quot;Chara-Change.&quot;  Sounds are alright, I haven't really noticed them so they're not overly great, and not overly annoying.  Also, the time it takes for Amu-chan to do her &quot;Chara-Change&quot; is too long.  But pretty much any anime with transformations take a long time for the characters to transform.  Overall it's a great show and I would recommend it to anyone, guy or girl, even thou it's on the 'cute' side.",

            "content": "Shugo Chara! is about a teenage girl named Hinamori Amu, who acts cool on the outside but is actually very shy. She wishes to become her would-be self and gets three shugo chara which are like guardian angels that represent your would be self. The story revolves around the guardians a soceity of people with shugo charas includingAmu and their adventures to find themselves and the ledgerndary Embryo which grants any wish.\r\nThis anime has a unique storyline and is a pleasure to watch. Like any typical magical girl anime you have flashy transformation and destroying evil which takes the form of X eggs and charactersin this anime, because of this it can be a bit cliche. The story does have some interesting developments but it also contains a lo of fillers which can be quite annoying at times. It is lighthearted and comical with a tinge of drama.However, for such a long series the story still lacks depth and this could have been made up by using the filler episodes to create more developments in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was so-so. Nothing special, just your typical shuojo style characters with big eyes and varying hair styles.Nothing bad about it but nothing good either.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also ok. I think the voice actors did a good job though and each character was fitted with the perfect voices(quite cute especially the shugo charas). Besides that the songs sung during the show by Utau were quite good. But other than that not much else was done to enhance the atmosphere through the songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were done up quite well partly due to the long span of the anime, most of the characters received some kind of depth and character development was visible throughoutthe show. Perhaps the fillers could have helped create even more depth for the characters. Even the villains get some depth. Very little romance is involved in this anime and is very suttle. Most of the interactions between the characters is merely friendly not intimate but there are some small occurences here and there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i think the anime was not not as good as i had anticipated because it lacked the depth for a long span of 51 episodes and the fillers were quite annoying towards the end with the anime not going anywhere. But it is an interesting anime to watch because many can identify with the theme of a would be self and there are some meaningful messages embedded in the anime. Hopefully the second series will outdo the first.",

            "content": "Alright..\r\nSince the first season of Shugo Chara is coming to a close.. I would like to grade it thus far.\r\nI might update this after the first season has finished airing\r\nStory : The story for Shugo Chara is your typical magical girl anime, and yet, it's not. You have the one girl who falls in love with a prince type character but cannot confess her love and nothing seems to go her way. But Amu is not the typical girl who nobody likes and doesn't fit in. No, she's the complete opposite. 'Cool and Spicy' schoolgirl, Hinamori Amu, who doesn't know exactally how to act. Bornfrom these feelings were three eggs, and the story follows through there. Some parts can be pretty generic, but other parts have you on the edge of your seat, wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nArt : I have heard that some people are not fond of the artwork, but I for one adore it. It's a very average style, nothing much to rave about and yet nothing to completely complain about. I still laugh at all of Amu's expressions though, the sparkles around Tadase, and Ikuto's generic 'I don't care' glance. \\n\\n\r\nSound : I love all of the voice actors for this series. Each one fits so very well. You also might recognize Ikuto Tsukiyomi's voice actor, who also played Tomoya Okazaki in Clannad. And Utau is voiced by the extremally talented singer, Nana Mizuki. All and all, the staff did an awesome job with this cast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Characters. Characters. So many characters in Shugo Chara. Yet, all so unique, having some special attribute that when you hear a description word your mind automatically jumps to a specific character in Shugo Chara. I personally adore all the characters in my own way, some may have favorites and some may dislike a certain character to no end, but you'll certainly never forget them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : So far, I have really enjoyed Shugo Chara! It may have it's extreme ups and it can certainly have it's extreme downs, but I think many people will in fact, enjoy this series. There are rumors of a second season because of the increasing manga material and I am pretty sure I am going to watch and compare, telling you guys if you should stick around or if you should drop the series completely, but it's up to you to take the first step. Will you dare to try Shugo Chara?",

            "content": "First Review\r\nAt first, I wasn't sure if I should begin watching a maho shojo anime about elementary school characters. However, when I began watching it, I couldn't have been more wrong. The story, art, and sound were all above average, but what stuck out most was how well the characters were designed, and how much each character developed through the course of the story. However, the thing that held it down was just how much filler there was throughout the series.\r\nShugo Chara tells the story of cool, and \"spicy\", elementary student Amu Hinamori, who actually turns out to be a shy girl who has difficultyexpressing herself. One day, she hears on TV about the guardian characters (shugo chara) that are always protecting them. The next day, she wakes up and find 4 eggs, each containing their own guardian character, and each a person that Amu wants to be. Throughout the story, she meets others with guardian characters, and X eggs, which are the guardian characters of those with no hope, which Amu has the power to purify, and the Embryo, the mysterious character egg the corporation Easter wants to get their hands on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this is one of my favorite MANGA ever for a multitude of reasons. First of all, the characters and story were absolutely amazing, a romance that actually made sense, and some genuinely funny scenes. On the other hand, the art and music were only slightly above average unlike the latter. Flaws included the below average, slow, \"action\" scenes, that were honestly unneeded (you'll see what I mean if you watch the show).\\n\\n\r\nRANT\\n\r\n*A few minor spoilers*\\n\r\n What killed the ANIME nearly entirely were the absolutely terrible amount of useless random characters and an entire unnecessary story arc in the anime. This extends the show far more than it needed to be, and really undermines Amu's special abilities and the X eggs introduced in the beginning. The supposedly rare and exclusive X eggs and Amu and the rest of the Guardians' character transformations are completely put down. Most of the episodes are the same useless thing, in which the guardians find some random kid with a troubled mindset, who gets an X egg, and the guardians come purify them. This becomes worse, and more prevalent close to the end, and every time I saw the same garbage over and over, I wanted to put a gun to my head, because it nearly ruined how great Shugo Chara is supposed to be. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the manga is honestly the better of the two, as it retains everything great about Shugo Chara, but without the things that kept down the anime. However, if you simply don't like reading, then feel free to watch the anime, as it is still an enjoyable anime as long as you don't think to much in the many filler episodes.",

            "content": "Shugo chara didn't caught my eyes in the first place. when i was surfing on crunchyroll.com i saw this anime being featured and it is an all time favourite.\r\nthe first thing that came to my mind is \" it look kinda childish, the pink hair girl is a kid so this should be a kiddy anime \" . but later on my friend told me that shugo chara is nice and ask me to give it a try. i trusted her as she know more about anime stuffs than me, i was totally a noob. the plot found on internet is very simplified. so iguess it won't interest you if you only base on the given storyline. the anime is so much better than i thought. \\n\\n\r\nthe first episode makes me wanna go on to the next and suprisingly i finished 49 episodes in 3 days. i am currently waiting for episode 50 to be subbed. \\n\\n\r\nthe storyline is quite unique, it says that every kid has their would-be self and one day they will become their would-be self. amu, (the main character of the anime) who appear to be cool with attitude to the others. but actually she is just an ordinary girl who is shy inside. she has 3 eggs heart, spade, clover who turns into her shugo charas which are good in sport, art and cooking respectively. she can do a character change to her would-be self and also tranformation which fight the x characters. her alliances are the so called guardians who act as the student council in school. they each have their own shugo chara too but they can't transform like what amu did. \\n\\n\r\namu soon joined them but part of the reason is to get close to her ideal prince tadase. their main aim is to find an embryo which can grant any wishes. i really like the bond of their friendship and also the different characteristics of their shugo charas and it is really fun to see them having a character change. the one who look gentle and elegant actually turns out to be a fierce and harsh one and tadase character change is really hilarious.\\n\r\nnever mention the word prince in front of him cause the 'king' will appear.\\n\\n\r\nanother reason that i love this anime so much is because of another character which is ikuto. go to episode 3, you will fall in love with the scene where amu and ikuto has the eye contact at the kitchen. the way ikuto teases amu is really cute. this is why many of us gone crazy over amuto moments. another character utau who is a popular singer inside act another important role too. i think she is really pretty and her transformations are cool and awesome too. that is why i think the art of shugo chara worth a 9.\\n\\n\r\nall the characters have their unique point and the story developed very well. one of my favourite episode is 29 because so many unexpected things happened in one episode. \\n\\n\r\nIT IS A 'COOL AND SPICY' ANIME ! recommend for shoujo lover. i don't think it suit guys but it depends actually. i can't say that every girls will like this or no guys will get addicted to it. you shall give it a try yourself.\\n\\n\r\nmy first review , sorry if there are any grammer error .",

            "content": "Shugo Chara! Stands out amoungst mahou shojou (magical girl) anime. While it appeases all aspects of mahou shoujo, girl with powers, transformations, roamance, 'cute' themes and such it also includes just that little something that stands out so much.\r\nStory:\r\nThe basic theme of every episode is simple, beat the bad guys, cleanse some eggs, drabble in romance and the such. However, Shugo Chara! has an over all story which brings the main cahracter, Amu, to the brink of depression and the theme of becoming ones true self is interesting. Rather than the story being about the powers and the magic and some war that's been goingon for years, the story is about the characters themselves, finding themselves and others. This is something that stands out for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe orignal style of Peach-Pit carries over to the anime. It's a sweet style that dosn't have the cliche 'my-eyes-are-twice-the-size-of-my-face'. The proportions are nice and the characters are cute, suiting the anime perfectly!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI can't particully say I love the op's and ed's however they are fun. The voices are not ear splitting nor whining, it's very refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAmu is a character that impresses me alot. She isn't overly ditsy or loud. Instead she is character who eveyone thinks is cool and calm but is actually shy and cute. She reminds me of Ryuuji from ToraDora (looks like a deliquint but is actually quite kind). This is so rare in a magical girl it's also quite refreshing. \\n\r\nAnother thing that amazes me is the love triangles. This developed to the point of a RPG game! While she could fall for the prince, Tadase, her relationship with the cliche boy seems so shallow and a much deeper understanding is shown between her and Ikuto. But you never know.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall:\\n\r\nI personally love this anime, it's a nice surprise and twist on the mahou shoujo genre that was much needed! Thankyou Peach-Pit!",

            "content": "Giving Shugo Chara! a try is an absolute must for anyone who is a fan of shoujo or mahou shoujo: because basically, it has all the ingrediants for one. Costumes that cannot possibly be practical but are cute, enemies that are defeated by the power of good, bright colours, younger aged characters and so on. But it doesn't only have that. It has a lot more alongside it. Much more - stuff that other mahou shoujo doesn't tend to have.\r\nIt's geared for younger viewers esentially, but Shugo Chara! is one of those animes that has many levels. It''s underneath its typical deminour that it shines.It's in those many levels that it has the ability to span to so many different people in so many different ways.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: As I've said before, it's typically beat the bad guys by cleansing the eggs, lots of sparkles and shiny moments and some romance here and there. There's also a lot of laughs and unsuspecting moments along the way, which makes watching SC! all the more worthwhile. But it has a very essential message behind it, a message that everyone can connect with. How many times have you pretended to be different to fit in? How many times have you wished you could be more like your true self in front of everyone? That's what Shugo Chara seems to ask and addresses. The focus is on the characters and the routes they take to become their true selves; it's not all about defeating good and evil.\\n\\n\r\nART: To be blunt, it's adorable. It's quite bright to appeal to younger viewers, but it isn't blinding. The colours all work together to create a believable world. It's very rare for any of it to be cheaply done - it's usually very good quality animation and artwork. Overall, it really adds to the atmosphere Shugo Chara brings - and even if the story and everything else is wonderful, if the art is bad, it isn't likely you're going to be able to watch it week in week out.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Typically simple, nice sounds throughout the episodes with recurring ones for the themes of characters and the cleansing of X-Eggs, with slight changes for each transformation. But I like the sound - it adds to the atmosphere. The opening and endings also deserve a mention here - Buono! was a wonderful creation for SC!, and even if I don't have the time or should be doing something else, I always watch through the opening and endings because I like the music. It's very cutesy, which isn't typically what I'm into, but I like it. It's different.\\n\\n\r\nLastly for sound, the voices are all a wonderful pick. I'd say a shout out for Kanae Ito (Amu) is in order here - it's her first role, but she does it all perfectly. She isn't overbearing or annoying or frustrating - but she's believable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: This is another area where SC! shines. The characters are not so-mind-blowingly-over-powered that they're unbelievable. Each one has their own flaws, their own doubts and personal problems. Each character is loveable on varying degrees, and that's because they're so believable. For several characters, too, I didn't like them for the first few episodes they were in. But as I grew to understand them and learn why they act like they do, what they're hiding behind the mask they give to the outside world, you start to fall in love with them. Because you can relate. \\n\\n\r\nAmu is also a refreshing heroine for shoujo. She completely contradicts the trend of cute characters that need protecting by everyone around her - she can be cute, but not overbearingly so. Her complete attitude is a draw in which is why peope like her, even though she fines it fake. Overall, the characters will grow on you in their own way over time.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: It's funny, it has romance, it's not too hard to understand and isn't at all confusing. It's simple in some respects but very effective. And it's easy to connect to, so very much easy to enjoy.",

            "content": "(My First Review)\r\nIn this Anime, \u201cTrue Self Character\u201d and one\u2019s \u201cDream\u201d are the keys to the plot/story and these are represented by \u201cShugoChara\u201d (Character Guardian) and \u201cEgg\u201d.\r\nCharacter, everyone has a character, the way we act, Energetic, Cool, Quiet, Arrogant etc. So often due to our surrounding, we have to employ different characters for instance, Amu had to create a elder sister character due to her younger sister. We hold different characters and in Shugo Chara!, these \u201cCharacter Guardians\u201d are born out of your wish or your true character.\r\nDreams, everyone has a dream. A dream is very fragile, it can easily disappear due under many circumstancesand it may affect your life. The dream is usually what we want to be in future, it can be a person you admire or a career you dream of working towards. And as we know, a dream act as very important role for a kid, it is a great motivation and decides the future of one\u2019s life. In other cases than your wished and true character, Character Guardians can also be born out of your dream, which is also partly our true self. As I said, dream is very fragile, and due to the fragility, Character Guardians may disappear or the Egg will become somewhat \u201chopeless\u201d the way I call it. The fragility may apply to lack of self-confidence, feels hopeless, loss of trust to your dream or your Character Guardian.\\n\\n\r\nSo that\u2019s the plot. The story features Amu, a girl who has a very different character from her \u201cTrue Self\u201d. She didn\u2019t like her fa\u00e7ade character and prayed to be her \u201cWould-be self\u201d. Since then she holds three Character Guardians that presents different characters for her. She is a unique person or \u201cthe chosen one\u201d, she holds three character guardians as other usually holds one. She was also given the \u201clock\u201d later that makes her stronger such as the ability to use \u201cCharacter Transform\u201d that allows her to save other people\u2019s egg/dream.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s one more important thing, that is the \u201cEmbryo\u201d, the special egg that grants any wish. All characters in the Shugo Chara! seeks and fights for it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nHeartwarming, inspirational slice of life, school story accompanied with magic theme combining with the plot above, it brings you a potential story. The only thing left is to see how well it develops throughout the 52 episodes. \\n\r\nMost episodes are stand-alone episodes, some spanning across a few episodes. Each arc/episodes features Amu saving other kids\u2019 egg/dream from being destroyed as well as dealing her own problems and her friends. As the story develops, she makes friend and she meets different challenges that some wavers her confidence and the question of right and wrong. It is a very relaxing anime as well as Amu\u2019s different characters and her character guardians bring her troubles time to time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\r\nCharacter art is good but sometimes inconsistent, the environment art is great for a TV series, its consistent. The typical shoujo magical girl transforming is up to my expectation, but nothing unique. The colourful palette brings relaxation and joy to fun, happy, heartwarming episodes and turns dull during episodes with Amu being depressing. The palette is being used appropriately. There are also some cute scenes with cute expressions making the anime more enjoyable. The animation is smooth, nothing wrong. Overall, it\u2019s good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\r\nJoyful music and dramatic music used appropriately, but not particularly special. Sparkling sound effects used during character transformation and when magical power was used. Great voice acting for each character, as expected from anime, I really liked the voices for the Character Guardians, they\u2019re cute and funny. Overall it\u2019s great. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nDiverse characters. The one that attracted me towards the anime is the plot and the main character, Amu. Amu\u2019s character design is excellent with punk rock style clothing in pink not just in casual clothing but also applying to her school uniform. One thing we get bored with an anime is the main character\u2019s character. But in Shugo Chara!, you\u2019ll never get bored because she has another three characters!! You\u2019ll never get bored of Amu, trust me and you\u2019ll get amused with her being in other three characters, almost being like a person with bipolar disorder. Other characters are great with interesting multiple personality and character guardian contributing to the energetic, fun story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\r\nVery enjoyable. Overall, great plot with good story development, amusing characters, it\u2019s just so fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\r\nI really liked it. One thing we get from an animation is inspiration towards our real life, what we learn from the story. Shugo Chara! has been very inspirational and what I really like is the plot of metaphor of \u201cCharacter Guardian\u201d (Our Would-be self) and \u201cEgg\u201d (Dream) is so true that simple captures the struggle and the fragile dreams of all kids.\\n",

            "content": "Shugo Chara!!!! I'm just going to come right out and say it: It's AWESOME! Finally, a shoujo that isn't like all the others! \r\nShugo Chara is about Amu, a girl who is known as \"Cool & spicy\" [if that doesn't already make you laugh, I don't know what will] by her classmates. She doesn't have any friends because she gives off this cool, \"do whatever you want\" demeanor, but inside she is very lonely and doesn't like how people see her. Amu, convinced she is not her \"would be self\" prays to be remade, and the next morning wakes up to find three eggs inher bed.\\n\r\nSo let me say here: DO NOT LET THE EGGS THROW YOU OFF!!!! The whole egg concept is kind of dumb [the opening theme starts out saying &quot;all kids have an egg in their heart&quot; which, if you think about it, kind of sounds like some illness] but it totally works. Amu can be remade into three different would-be-selves, and her Charas (the would-be-selves that were born from the eggs) are so cute! \\n\r\nThe romance in Shugo Chara is also wonderful. Coming from someone that is a huge Itazura na Kiss fan, I really wanted to watch something that had some romance in it and Shugo Chara delivers. What's so great is that you have absolutely no idea who she will end up with (but you'll be voting for Ikuto, because he is H-O-T). \\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint is the egg thing again. The fact that she her transformation, er, &quot;thing&quot; (like Sailor Moon's mirror compact) is called the Humpty Lock, and that the evil force is called the Easter Company. I don't like the egg-ness of all of that, but if you ignore it, you see some GREAT characters. The character transformations are hilarious, and this anime will guarantee you some laughs. DEFINITELY give it a try and you'll see how great it is. Shugo Chara is quickly becoming my favorite shoujo of all time!\\n\\n\r\nStory--like I said, it's a good story, typical shoujo, but with a twist. That's why I gave it a ten. The villains are not what you're used to!\\n\\n\r\nArt--I personally love the art, you get used to Amu's pink hair. :p\\n\\n\r\nSound--The voices fit each character and Amu actually has a really good voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter--Amu is not your typical shoujo girl. Though she is weak because she doesn't know who she really is, she is funny and never acts in the typical shoujo-ditzy-clueless-I'm-Sailor Moon/Mermaid Melody-way. She doesn't act for the guys that she likes, she acts for herself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment--Fantastic! Like I said, it's a hilarious story and I rarely laugh when watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall--A perfect ten. Even the filler episodes are great.",

            "content": "Story: 10/10. Mostly because of the message behind the whole 51 episodes. At first glance, this anime might look like the usual school life, shoujo anime. If you think about it, there's actually a strong message behind the whole thing. It's just outstanding how such a simple message developing into a whole 51 episode anime... and a couple more seasons after that. (Still didn't get the message? HINT: think about how the eggs represents your dreams) I also really like the original storyline about guardian characters, x-eggs etc. Not to forget about the comedy. I also like how the anime doesn't just focus on onecharacter's problems.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 I personally really like the art. It's detailed and the clothing/hair styles of the characters are unique. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 I really like the opening and the endings. I'm also a fan of Utau's songs (well, maybe not a mega fan but...). I personally think that the voice actors have also done a great job overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10 In some way, the characters are stereotypical and not properly developed. Like how the guardians were popular, how Ikuto appears to be the stereotypical tsundere etc. On the other hand, it wasn't too obvious as the storyline and surroundings 'blends it in' (if I've made any sense at all x__x) Also, no Mary Sues/Gary Stus. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 Personally, this is the anime I've enjoyed most so far. It's quite surprising because this isn't the genre I usually like watching. I suggest you could try watching it even if it's not really your type of anime. It's also a sweet, funny and a somehow relate-able anime, especially the message behind the whole thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 It's alright if you disagree with me. You might not like it as much as I do. I have nothing against that. One final word to sum up: A W E S O M E!!!",

            "content": "Of all the numerous Mahou Shoujo/Magical Girls anime series, Shugo Chara! is one of the best. The majority of animes in this genre tend to be along the same plotline: a ditzy heroine gets magical powers and is given the responsibility to save the world somehow; we all know the story. Shugo Chara!, however, is a breath of fresh air amidst this crazy monotony. First off, Amu, our main character, isn't the stereotypical ditzy heroine (gasp!). Instead, she the \"cool and spicy\" new student. Second, Amu and Co. aren't just saving the world. Instead, this anime focuses on dreams, goals, wishes, and your \"would-be self\".How many times can we honestly say we've seen that in a Mahou Shoujo anime? It may not be a story comparable to, say,the infamous Cardcaptor Sakura, but it ranks fairly high up there. And as a bonus, it's comparitavely free of filler. (That's just RELATIVELY, though.)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great, the art is colorful, and some of the objects (e.g., Heart's Eggs, X Eggs, Humpty Lock, etc.) look almost computer-animeated. The art style is the standard big-eyed Shoujo style, which complements the anime's story and charcters pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, too, is also great. The two openings are a lot less cutesy than the ones in the Doki!! series, which I'm sure most of us older fans appreciate. Even some of the background music, specifically the action scene music, is catchy enough to make you want to download it. No, seriously. Not to mention Utau's songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are unique. Some may get annoying at times, but every series has its share of obnoxious characters. Each character has their quirks, hidden traits, likes and dislikes. Some characters do seem to be slightly stereotypical (e.g., Ran, Suu, etc.), though.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a series to watch, Shugo Chara! is a good pick. The filler may become a nuisance in the Doki! season, but don't let that deter you from the first.",

When i saw the cover i said why not give it a try. I watched 1 and i liked it , but then it began to go downhill on like episode 7 . The storyline is about the same, Easter tries to find the embryo by using schemes, Amu destroys them, and thats about it. Also i don't think they should be using romance in elementary school. I mean save it till middle school at least?\r\nThe artwas good ,but i saw better. The sound i liked, but i think Amu's voice was too high pitched. I didn't enjoy it very much, and the only character i liked was Utau . Sorry for the bad score . I have to say that this anime seems too perfect, it need like a little tragedy ,like Ikuto hating her for like a week , then they make up.",

Wanting to change and be her real self, three Charas eggs appear, who are there to helpAmu find her would be self. Along the way she becomes a member of the Gardians as the Jocker, and find out she has to defeat X eggs. (I don't know why i put this here, seeing as many people have already done reviews similar to this) As the story progresses you get to know each character more, and go into fan mode of choosing a pairing such as Amy x Ikuto. \\n\\n\r\nFor thoughs who have put Shugo Chara! aside, you should probably pick it back up and dust it off, and give Shugo Chara! a chance.",

She didn't really know anything about herself and she felt like she made the wrong impression. As I continued watching, I saw how everything just came together perfectly. There's reason's behind everyone's dream, they didn't just say \"Ok! This character wants to be a ___ when they grow up,\" for no reason. You really got toconnect with each of them to the point where you want their wildest dreams to come true(after you've watched it, it's pretty obvious who I'm talking about...).\\n\\n\r\n It really tells anyone who watches it, \"Hey, dreams are very easily broken, but you should chase them.\" \\n\r\nAlthough the anime could never happen, it seems to show reality more than fantasy. You are going to have fights with your friends, you are going to get hurt and you might even cry, but you shouldn't just give up everything just because one little thing. If you fall, let your friends pick you up and don't care about what others think of you. Others might stab you in the back, but you do the same afterwords, it will be an unending war. \\n\\n\r\nShugo Chara has many plot twists that you couldn't really see coming. I would give you an example, but that'd ruin it for you if you choose to watch it(I saw a picture that gave one away. It sucked).",

            "content": "Let me have a disclaimer here. I have not seen the entire anime, but I've lost my place in the anime and the amount of episodes I have listed on my list is inaccurate. I have definitely watched a decent amount of episodes of this Shugo Chara!\r\nThis anime is obviously targeted towards a younger audience, and I was 11 when I first watched this anime. (2010) Even then, I wasn't amused.\r\nIn context of the time this anime was created, the art was pretty standard. Nothing that really popped out. I'll admit, some of the character designs are really simple, yet aesthetically nice to look at.However, they are very basic. Ikuto's, specifically, is immensely boring and basic. In Shugo Chara!'s defense, this is after all an anime about high school students, so there can only be so much variation in character design. I will admit that I do like the difference in the school uniform. It's a nice difference compared to other anime with school uniforms.\\n\r\nAmu's initial \"personality\" is pretty hard to fathom, because all we really know about her is that she's \"spicy\" and \"cool.\" She's clearly unsatisfied with how she is, but we hardly even know how empty her personality is to begin with. Amu, as a character, is pretty bland. \\n\r\nThe heavily implied \"romantic\" spark with two characters gives me a really uncomfortable vibe, especially considering there is a 4-6 years difference. With one of them being a preteen and the other being in their late teens. The maturity differences is what really creeps me out. (Though you could argue that they're both really immature, but still.)\\n\r\nThe romantic \"plot\" in Shugo Chara! is pretty irrelevant, and I find it to be distracting from the message the anime is trying to convey. \\n\r\nThe concept of this anime is truly pure, and I do appreciate the message that it's trying to send out. But it's just too painstakingly drawn out. It bored me far too easily, and I tried really hard to get invested into this anime. I really did.\\n\r\nI suppose a large part of this anime that I didn't like was that it was far too cutesy and cheesy. I definitely give credit to this anime in a lot of aspects, but this just wasn't for me. I can see it being far more appreciated by those who love the genre, as I will admit it is pretty unique for the genre itself. (At least in the presentation of the message, rather than the message itself.)",

Its about this girl, amu hinamori, who has this outside character. You know, like sometime how some people act tough when they're really nice. Anyway, thats Amu. Then one day she wishes she had courage to be herself. and she gets 3 guardian chara. Thats how the whole adventure starts. I like how there's a bit of romance and a bit of action. It has almost everything one needs.\r\nArt and Sound: Theart is really good. Most of the guys I think look totally hot, so thats something to look forward too. And i think the voices match each character perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I absolutely love each character. I love Amu, Ikuto, Tadase, and Ran. They're some of my favorites. Each character's personality matches them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I gave it a 10 because i really enjoyed it. It was really funny and I loved it. It might not be the same for you, but i think everyone would enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10. 10. 10. 10. 10. 10. I thought the overall was a 10 because it was just perfect in most aspects.

            "content": "Honestly, I had never heard of Shugo Chara! before I saw a fairly bad fan dub audition for it. At the time, I was low on good animes and was just searching for one to watch. I really didn't care if it was bad or amazing. I thought the animation looked cute so I promptly typed in \"Shugo Chara! 1\" into the search bar and started watching. In that one day, I watched 12 episodes in a row. Call me a hermit if you want, but it's just that addicting. As of now I have finished the first series (Seasons 1 & 2) and havemoved on to Shugo Chara! Doki!, the second series.\\n\\n\r\nI have always enjoyed shojo anime but this one stands. Throughout my entire life, I've found strength in being myself, but I often struggle trying to figure out who exactly that is. I didn't know what I was going to do with my life. This anime taught me my what I was searching for the entire time. My dream became to protect other's dreams. I want people to be happy, while being themselves and doing what they love. This anime encourages just that and using some of the cutest transformations I've ever seen. With each character having their own story and personality, there is, not doubt, someone you can relate to. Every person can benfit from this anime, whether you need just a good laugh or a life lesson.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this anime isn't just about finding yourself. There are countless love rivals for the main character, Hinamori Amu. The romance in this anime is captivating and colorful. You can't seem to chose which couple you want to support. \\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime will make you want to create a chara of your own. You might even think you're going insane, but that's just how much you will love it.\\n\\n\r\nWho knew that on that very broing summer day earlier this year I would find an anime that would awaken my passion again? To every girl from 5 to 25, I highly suugest that you watch this anime.",

I mean i know their were times for me, were i wished i could come out of my shell and just be the real me around people, and that's one of the things this show is about.\r\nI give the story a 10. In my opinion this wasn't your everyday shoujo manga. There is a lot to this show, that people of all ages can relate to in one way or another. As the story progressed you could clearly see all of the characterstruly coming out of their shells and start being true to who they really are.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the art an 8. I really liked the art. I thought it was cute and totally fit the aspect of the characters. Although their was nothing that really stuck out to me in the WOW factor, but overall it was still pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nI gave the characters a 10. The thing ii loved most about this anime was certain characters, and how they grew with each episode. Although their were some of your typical shoujo characters. You had your jock, your prince, and your bad boy. However each one of them brought something different to these typical types of characters. And you see it more and more as the story progresses's.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i gave the anime a 10. It was sweet, funny, and very relate-able more so than any other anime i have ever seen. And it is one of those shows that you can re-watch as many times as you like and never get sick of it! I highly recommend this show!!",

Overall, the show was fine, but for me it was not exactly the type of anime I would watch again. Everything is found to be really ''girly'', and focusing on a typical theme of magic powers, and a group of girls that go out to save the world. In fact, a lot of previous tv shows, as well as anime have a similar concept, such as the Power Puff Girls, and Tokyo Mew Mew. Of course, I'm not sayingthat the series does not have any potential, but it just wasn't exactly the series for me. If perhaps you enjoy such story lines, then go for it, but it's simply not my thing.",

            "content": "Its my first time writing a review so... I will try my best. Just note that what I am writing now will be my impression of both 'Shugo chara!' and 'shugo chara doki!' (both seasons). \r\nI thought the anime started off really well. First of all, some people may not mind the art in anime so much, saying tings like \"Oh, art doesn't matter so much as long as I can differentiate between different characters\" but for me, I can't stand to watch an anime that does not have good art. But for this anime, that was not a problem at all. The artwork wasperfect! and most of all hinamori amu (the most important protagonist) was designed really well. I would further like to mention that her voice acting was great too! It was natural, and really did suit the character well I think. Thus in terms of art and voice, no problems what so ever. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea of the story itself, I thought, was unique and captured my interest initially at the beginning. However, bearing in mind that this show is meant for children, it became pretty repetitive throughout with lots, and I mean lots of filler episodes (especially in season 2) . Now, my age is definitely not be categorized as 'child' so I really don't have the right to complain about fillers despite how annoyed I felt during my way through the episodes. It felt as though these fillers blocked the progression of the story way too much. But if I put myself in perspective of a child watching the same anime, I'm sure I would have gotten excited whenever Amu did a character transformation. In fact,  that would have been ALL I cared about so as a child, filler or not, as long as she made that transformation I would have enjoyed it. My point is that given my age, and yours too (i'm sure) we don't have the right to complain about fillers since we, in the first place, are watching a show that was meant for kids in the first place. So for me at least, despite my hatred of these filler episodes, I came to understand their worth and managed to keep hold till the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season went pretty well I thought. The story progressed well, posing questions and uncertainty, developments between character relationships etc. Its this 'development' that we look for, and the first season managed to do just this and made it enjoyable for me to view. However the second season was different. It undoubtedly lacked the depth which was present in the first season and, as I said above, was highly concentrated with fillers. I'm sure even with these, the story could have progressed as well as it did in the first season, but instead, I felt like there was a huge separation from the 'main plot' to 'side plot'. For instance, serious event takes place and causes despair but in the next episode all the seriousness is suddenly neutralized by a rather boring filler episode. I'm sure the fillers could have been made better than that, or even, made in a different order so that it does not interrupt the tension that was built up from before. I am not complaining about the existence of these filler episodes, do not misunderstand. I am merely noting that these could have been made with a bit more care so that it does not disturb the development of the anime. Perhaps then, for older audiences, it could have been much more enjoyable. \\n\r\n So I thought that there was a dramatic change in the level of enjoyment from  my initial sense of satisfaction in the first season to utter disappointment in the second. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters.. I really liked Hinamori Amu. She is energetic, kind, cute and straightforward. All the qualities that you would look for in a perfect protagonist in an anime like this. Not just her, but all the other characters were great too. In terms of the relationships between these characters, I really initially loved the fact that Nadeshiko and Amu were so close. After all, she was Amu's first friend ever and her 'best' friend. The close friendship between them made me feel happy for Amu but I was rather disappointed later on, and the reason for that is not what you may expect. But since I don't want to write any spoilers, I will prohibit myself from saying it out loud. The other two main characters of the story is Ikuto and Tadase. The love triangle the goes on between the two and amu is rather obvious from the start so no spoilers there. Given that amu and tadase are elementary school students, a part of me says that heavy romance is not possible. However there indeed exists elements of romance in here and so another part of me screams that even if 'light' romance, there should be a proper pair at least. The ending of the anime provided me with the worst pairings possible and I'm sure 99% of mature viewers were disappointed with the outcome . But Oh well, that is my opinion only. I'm only suggesting that if romance is what you are looking for, this anime is not really the right one to watch but i must admit, it is cute when amu blushes. Maybe that may perhaps change your thoughts, I don't know. Romance is not really a big part so... yeah. Anyway the character desgns, I thought, were really good. Tadase the typical princely figure with Ikuto being the character that has a much more playful attitude, especially towards the one he likes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this show was good. It was good, but not good enough. Note that I haven't written anything to do with the third season, 'shugo chara party' because it is useless to write about. There is absolutely no point in watching that. Not only is Ikuto kicked out from it, even Amu appears less and less frequently. Anyway, I thought initially shugo chara was great, but as I watched on, it became less and less enjoyable for me to watch. Eventually I dropped in during the third season. And trust me, it is not only me who feels this way. Season 3 only has under 30 episodes because of the loss of popularity. I don't find that strange given that they changed the whole show completely. \\n\\n\r\nSo to finalize, I do not recommend you to put hours and hours watching this. My recommendation is for you to read the manga and enjoy the story with better development, formation of a proper pair, and most of all less time!. The manga is concise and follows the story directly! it will take you less time to  finish with more enjoyment than the manga.",

            "content": "It's true that Shugo Chara is your average Shojou anime with it's group of child heroes and their transformations as well as some romance added into the mix... but Shugo Chara was the first anime series I ever watched and the feeling I got from it was different to other Shojou animes... I don't know how to explain it, but watching Shugo Chara  reminded me how it felt to hope, how it felt to try and enjoy life.\r\nThe first thing I really liked about the show was Amu herself - she's a 10 year old with sass and I really liked that. I meanokay, when she immediately fell for Tadase I was kinda annoyed but then I remembered that she was only 10. That's a thing about this show - you forget that they're just elementary school kids. Amu is actually really mature for her age and that's why I sort of looked up to her in a sense, despite me being 7 years older than her, because of the way she tries her hardest in life, how she gets along with her friends and family, how she goes through everything.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing I really liked about the show was Ikuto. Tsukiyomi Ikuto was definitely my first anime crush - I shipped him and Amu from the first episode! As well as the Amuto shipping feels, however, Ikuto's character has quite a lot of depth, especially considering the fact that this is a Shojou anime aimed at a younger demographic, and it's because of him I think that I was able to enjoy this anime so much. The way he took the burden of everything on himself, the way he felt trapped by Easter... it just helped me identify with him and the way he and Amu interacted just put a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nThe Chara's themselves were another thing which I really liked about the show - so it seems to be a sort of recurring Shojou theme to have little mascot-type characters but the Charas are just... I don't know how to describe it but personally I was able to identify with both Yoru and Miki in a way and I have no idea why! The fact that the Charas are born through a person's desire to change themselves is actually a rather brilliant idea, because I think it sort of shows how if you have that wanting to change and better yourself within you, you'll be able to.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an anime which gives you hope and puts a smile on your face while telling you that you can change if you really want to, that the world has a happier side to it. That's why it's always going to be one of my favourite animes.",

            "content": "This is my first review so please bare with me. Thank you. ovo\r\nShugo Chara is a magical girl anime, you know, girls/guys transforming into weird/cute outfits. You get the idea. At first I really liked the anime, then it sort of went down the hill. \r\nStory: \r\nI think the story was very good and creative. i never seen an anime like this before. I really liked the parts where Amu would panic. Hilarious xD Then it seems like the story repeats over again. Like an X-egg appears, Amu notices it and returns it back to normal. Now if you think about it, there are alot of episodes like that , and I like interesting new things in episodes. \\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was great. Even the art style supports the magical-girl theme. Amazing.\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI enjoyed the sound very much. I really thought Amu's voice suits her, and that the voice actor did an amazing job on the \"cool and spicy\" part. I also liked Utau's voice, and of course, Ikuto's sexy voice :D\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNow this is the part that I really found a problem with. Amu acts as the \"cool and spicy\" girl, but really, she is shy. At first I didn't have a problem with that, but if you notice, everyone seems to like Amu, cool or not. Also I don't really get why the characters have only one Shugo Chara, but Amu has 4? For me I feel like Amu is a bit overly perfect.(Im sorry if you hate me for this ;v; ) I did like Utau a lot, mainly because i like those \"tsundere moe characters\". I absolutely LOVE Ikuto. His personality just makes me want to squeal every time i see him. I also liked Kukai and Nagehiko(Nadeshiko). Also I dont think you should bring romance into elementary school. My favorite couple was Kukai and Utau, and i though Tadase and Amu looked so adorable!~I completely DESPISED Amuto (Amu and Ikuto) mainly because the age difference. Or i was just jealous because Ikuto would flirt with Amu all day xD \\n\\n\r\nAnyways thank you for reading ; v ;",

            "content": "I don't think there are words to describe how riled up this series gets me. I'm not saying this series is horrible, but there are so many ideologies presented in the anime that just make me infuriated. I'm not going to really comment on the story and the pacing of this show. If I have to quickly say something about it I'd say the pacing is mediocre and there are far too many characters introduced who go nowhere and are just one-dimensional and hollow. \r\nNo, this review is going to be...special. I am a lover of character writing and world building. What do your charactersbelieve? What is acceptable in their world? What are their personalities and how do they clash with the other characters...ext. This anime shot my love for characters in the chest, and the saddest part has I enjoyed it at first..sort of. I think I'm being a bit dramatic. \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes had me interested and I was okay with it. I had a few characters I had one character I particularly enjoyed. Just one and that was the character by the name of Kukai. He wasn't the best character sure, but every moment with him made me giggle he had motivations, but I think the best part about him was the fact that he actually acted like a kid for his age would. While every other character acted like they were high schoolers. \\n\\n\r\nThis just makes me wonder towards the mangaka...why in gods name did you write these characters in elementary school/middle school if you gave them highschooler attitudes. I really don't think it would've affected the plot that much and the characters basically look like high schoolers so I really don't understand the point. \\n\\n\r\nAs I was saying a particular episode came along that made me hate whoever was writing this story. I am a person who watches a lot of law and order svu and when I see a relationship that is creepy. I freak out. This mostly spawned from the fact that Kukai had a friend who was going to college please note that Kukai was a 6th grader while this person was a graduating high schooler probably about 18. What annoyed me was the fact that Kukai's friends were saying that romance would spark between him and his childhood friend! Then, Amu brought up a very good point the very large age gap between him and his friend, but they simply said \"No, love has no age!\" and she just believed it. By the end of the episode, he receives a hug from his friend and says \"maybe it just is love\" or some shit. Which is tolerable I guess I can understand why little 5th and 6th graders might think that falling in love with someone way older than you is okay as long as the older character didn't act on it. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, then I found out that the character of Ikuto was a senior. A senior and he were flirting with and making sexual remarks about a 11/12-year-old girl. To anyone who is saying I'm exaggerating I'm really not. He brings up her small breast size on multiple occasions.  Anyone who says they ship them together regardless of the age, then I wonder would any of you let your little sibling date someone who was that much older than them. I really don't think you would. \\n\\n\r\n(spoilers ahoy) The scene that made me drop the show was a scene with the lock and the key. Ikuto decides to put his key in Amu's lock and what follows is a really weird scene. Cue Amu blushing and there being a particular emphasis on her looking slightly frightened and both of them blushing and he puts the key in the hole. I really thought I was exaggerating, but then I remembered there have been scenes that put Amu in a really uncomfortable looking position for a girl her age. Like the scene where she is sitting on his lap and they're both licking the same ice cream cone or some shit. It was really creepy and I felt gross all over just watching the key and lock scene and finally she screams \"I\"m scared!\" and the key is no longer able to fit. \\n\\n\r\nI feel really disgusted that an adult wrote these situations about a young girl. They shouldn't be making shows for preteens and teenage girls because she's shoving her beliefs in other people's faces and trying to make huge age gaps \"cute.\". I'm really glad I watched this show now instead of when I was younger because I don't know how I would've turned out if I believed Ikuto and Amu's love was \"so pure and perfect.\"\\n\\n\r\nSorry if I didn't really write a technical review, but I really needed to get this off my mind.",

            "content": "\"All kids have an egg in their heart...\"\r\nNot the most mature or out of this world beginning to an anime, but it was to be expected with a child's anime such as Shugo Chara. In the messy world of anime and ratings to be 13+ for 17+, it was a pleasant surprise to see an anime with an EVERYONE rating and with that, I decided to watch it and I fell in love with it almost instantly. I've watched the whole series 5 times and each time, I learned something new and compelling which made me love the characters even more. \r\nThe story was easyto follow. Having that said, I guess I could say that out of all of the anime I've seen thus far, it was the easiest in the sense of that you remember everything that happened last episode up until you watch the next and the next. Because of the simplicity of the story, I was able to watch it many times without losing interest. \\n\\n\r\nThe transformations were unique and colorful, even when the boys transformed. But it was to be expected from a magic-based anime that everyone would transform. The idea that their Charas was what gave them the ability to do so and if the Chara and the owner had mixed feelings then you couldn't transform was deep and it was a very nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, when you fulfill your dream, your character goes back into your heart and you grow up. This aspect made the anime have a more realistic touch and in accompaniment in reading the manga, the story becomes a tear fest and you actually feel for the characters. The whole atmosphere was childish and made it feel warm and fuzzy. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I didn't like about the anime was that some of the characters had stories that made you feel pitiful for them instead of actually being sentimental or such. Not that I don't like myself mysterious characters but mystery had to come out of something more developed. \\n\\n\r\nThe amount of filler episodes was a bit annoying but they were equally as entertaining as well. Yet if you were to remove them and just focus on the main story, the anime would become significantly shorter by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I didn't like was the third season not having a story following the main heroine, Amu, or even any of the characters as well. It introduced live action cosplayers, a new and annoying character who had little to no development, and suddenly in the end, she and Amu become the best of friends without any substance. To get the best of the anime, you'd only have to watch seasons one and two; the third one is optional and is just for fun if you would still like to get a bit more out of Shugo Chara but not much.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you're looking for something that is easy to follow, colorful, and something that you won't feel bad about showing a seven year old child, then Shugo Chara is a fabulous choice! You just have to be patient around the filler episodes and love each character for what they have to offer to the anime and as a character themselves. Don't go hating on one just because the fandom does. Also, just be prepared to sing along with all seven of the openings and endings too. They can be quite catchy.",

            "content": "I hope this review helps! :)\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story was quite interesting, and so was the idea of Shugo Charas/Guardian Characters, would-be selves. I liked the fact that the story explored many different characters and why they have a Shugo Chara (if they do), as well as the twists. However, the only bad thing I can say about the story is that like many magical girl anime, there is a lot of filler. Although interesting, wouldn't it be better if they could just skip to the next important parts? But all the same, the filler was enjoyable too.\r\nArt: 6\r\nCan't say much because this isn't a verynew anime, but I like the art style. It's rather basic, and simple. It gives off a cheery and bright mood. Animation is fine, and yeah, there are the typical magical girl transformation scenes, but I don't mind them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs are really good and memorable. Also, the songs in the anime (Utau's songs) are really good as well. The background music also really suits the anime, and the characters all had brilliant voices that showed their personality well, I applaud the seiyuus.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI quite liked the character bonding and relationships that improved over time. This is the good part of all the filler. I also liked all the characters' designs and personalities, which are all really different and individual. Although this is something that happens in a lot of magical girl anime, I liked the fact that the enemies became allies after the main characters defeated them or persuaded them to become good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed watching all 51 episodes of this, because it always made me laugh. Even though there was a lot of filler, this anime really gave me a lot of hope in my life. I'm not ashamed at all to say that I watched this and loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to those who like magical girl anime, as well as cheerful and funny ones with great messages. Do try not to fall asleep during the filler though.",

There aren't any plot twists as far as I can remember, but the plot is still rather enjoyable. There is quite a lot of filler to help us connect with the characters, but it still seems to move at a reasonable pace.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe art is reasonably good, with some nice character designs. There are lots of girly shimmersand sparkles, which is typical in magical girl anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Shugo Chara! is really good; the theme songs are catchy, and the songs that Utau sings are also really good. The voice acting is rather good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThere weren't really any characters that annoyed me in Shugo Chara! I could easily sympathise with them all- even the villains had their moments. Amu is a strong heroine, with an interesting personality, and anyone can relate to her struggle for indentity. Her never-give-up attitude also makes her a good role model.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe great storyline and characters make this anime a joy to watch. There are also a few humourous moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is one of the best magical girl animes out there; a good moral, solid characters and a great storyline. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "(please note that this review only covers the first season) \r\nShugo Chara is the first true magical girl series that I've watched and as such, I must say that it was a very good introduction to the genre for me. I feel no small amount of shame in saying this, but I really like Shugo Chara!\r\nStory: \r\nThe story of Shugo Chara seems extremely simple at first. Essentially it boils down to main character Amu Hinamori saving the hopes and dreams of her classmates using the powers that her Shugo Caras grant her. The real story is a romance involving Amu a love triangle between Amu,Tadase, and Ikuto. The romance is very good though it is worth noting that the rather large age gap between Ikuto and Amu can make for some rather uncomfortable scenes, I was personally able to overlook it but I feel that it's worth mentioning as it could be a deal breaker for some people. It is also worth noting that there are many episodes of filler and even some clip shows. The filler is actually pretty good in the beginning since it helps flesh out all of the characters but at certain points, espicially near the end it can get really frustrating. As for the clip shows... They're about as enjoyable as you'd expect (read not at all). The story is really secondary to Shugo Chara's amazing characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art is Shugo Chara is very well done and never really disappoints. The screen is filled with all sorts of bright colors and shots such as the school at sunset or the city at night really look amazing. A lot of people will also be happy to know that the infamous magical girl transformation scenes, while still present here, are very quick and sometimes are removed entirely. All the human character designs look good both when normal and character transformed. As for the Shugo Chara's, they take cute Chibi art to a whole new level and looking at them for too long can give you diabetes. The diabetes is totally worth it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI've only seen the Japanese version subtitled so I can't really speak on the English dub, but all of the Japanese voices are well cast and talented. The background music is also well done and adds a lot to some of the scenes. The sound effects while not the best are still very good. All of the Openings and Endings are great as well with the first opening serving as a real standout. All and all Shugo Chara's sound is very well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nShugo Chara may have a massive cast of characters but don't let this deter you, since all of the characters are very well done. Amu Hinamori is one of the most complicated and most realistic characters I've ever seen and I managed to relate to her almost instantly. The story effectively revolves around Amu's insecurity and her quest to find her true self and it's a story that we've all been through at least once. The other characters are all very well done also, such as Tadase and his desire to be a stronger person or the truth about Nadeshiko. The Shugo Charas, while not really deep due to their nature, are very likable and often times hilarious. The only character who doesn't quie match up is Ikuto Tsukiyomi. It's not that he's a bad character (like another black wearing multiple blade wearing Anime guy I could name) it's just that he is essentially introduced as the \"Lord Byron\" of the series and stays that way the entire 51 episodes. He does play his role as a dark and mysterious character very well but it would have been cool to see some character development or some more background surrounding him. All in all though the characters are amazing and a real selling point for the show.\\n\\n\r\nShugo Chara may, at first glance, look like a generic, childish block of filler designed to sell toys, but it's amazing characters, great art, and excellent sound definitely make it worth watching. Give it a try and you might fall for it like I have.",

This anime is one of those cutesy girls that gets powers and all the hearts. Usually I wouldn't like this anime because of how girly it is but it is evened out with funny characters, drama and deep feelings from Ikuto (one of the hottest anime charasyou will see ! I named my violin after this guy and he has kitty ears XDDDD!! )* fangirl moment* \\n\\n\r\n       This special girl Amu wishes to be her true self but can't bring herself to show it. So she sees that she finds 3 adorable Easter eggs and out comes these little guardians that help her. She becomes part of a group who others just think as a elite club but really are the few kids that have guardian characters. The Guardians are faced with trouble when they are faced with Ikuto a boy working for the bad side making peoples hearts eggs turning into X eggs ( when people give up on their hopes and dreams ) Ikuto is a violin playing , troubled bad boy every girl loves and every guy wants to be. Amu starts meeting new people, having new adventures and tons of drama in the sad and confusing struggle between Ikuto I'm  not going to spoil anything so yeah just go watch it ! You need to !My  brother and I would have marathons on the computer for hours watching this show X33 Warning though around the last 2 seasons they start getting real girls for the first half to do competitions and trivia and stuff .It's kinda boring but you can just skip it lol ahh the skip button how I love you so much ^Ps also this show is how I learned the name Nadeshiko .. if I ever had a Japanese daughter or adopted I would call her Nadeshiko. It means strong powerful woman ..It is also used for a term like couragous women who stand up for what they believe in and don't let society put them down. Or to put it simply to be stong in spirit ^",

The story is unique and different and all forms of magic reflect the character's personality rather then just transforming to save the world. This is because they transform, or \"character change\" into someone they want to be in the future.\r\nART: No complaints on the art. It was very well done especially on Ikuto",

            "content": "Okay, so here's my first ever review so bear with me. \r\nShugo Chara was one of those anime that I REALLY was hesitant to watch. I read some of the manga and was, quite frankly, very disappointed with it. I didn't know why so many people were hyped up about it. After finally pushing myself to get over the absolute girlyness of it, I finally got an appreciation for the anime. This is coming from someone who would rather watch Black Lagoon or Mirai Nikki, by the way.\r\nStory:\r\nOkay, so it's a pretty average \"Monster of the Week\" kind of plot. Basically, everyone has an \"egg\"in their heart and if you awaken that egg, you get your own Guardian Character and can transform with them to get a Character Transformation. However, your egg can also become an X character if you're going through a lot of stress. The main characters fight the X characters and save the day. There ya go. There is a real plot that goes on, but 90% of the anime is just that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I have to say, I normally hate Peach Pit (the manga duo who also created DearS and Rozen Maiden) but I found the art and animation of Shugo Chara very appealing. It was bright and colorful with very detailed lineart. The animation was well done (nothing amazing, but definitely not terrible) so it was nice to admire. The transformation scenes are especially cute and well executed. It was actually the transformations I saw on YouTube that got me wanting to watch Shugo Chara.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing amazing. Catchy J-Pop songs for openings and endings that are easy to sing to, but nothing spectacular. I don't even remember the BGM so it never stood out to me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: A VERY large cast of characters. Many of the characters start off as anime stereotypes but do become more developed as the story goes on (at an EXTREMELY slow pace though). The main character, Amu Hinamori, is a young girl who people think is \"cool and spicy\" when she really is shy and girly. You will most probably find her as a very annoying character. I most certainly did. She does develop as a character, but I could care less about her.  There are the school Guardians who are enjoyable too (my favorites being Kairi, Kukai, and Rima). There's also Ikuto who is the classic bad boy that all the fangirls fawn over (I personally never cared for him) and Utau Hoshina (who I wish was the main character, quite frankly). And there are also all of the Guardian Characters that you'll meet. Overall, it's a very wide cast and there is bound to be at least one character that you'll come to love. They all get developed pretty well and each of their stories are interesting to watch (except Yaya...).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you can put up with the absolutely girliness and some really annoying characters, Shugo Chara is an incredibly enjoyable anime. Each time I watched a new episode, I felt happier and ready to do anything. Shugo Chara makes a bad day much better with the different morals that each episode teaches (no matter how cheesy some might be). Many of the situations the characters go through are relatable so it's makes the viewer more connected with the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Not an amazing or incredibly unique anime, but very fun and light-hearted. You should definitely watch this if you're having a bad day and need something bright and happy to cheer your up. I give this a 7/10 because although it's nothing very unique, it's has several redeeming qualities that will make you stick through all 51 episodes and even through to the 2nd season (but don't bother watching the 3rd season...).",
