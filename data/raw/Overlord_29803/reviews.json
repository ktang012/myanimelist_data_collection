            "content": "Obligatory spoiler warning because Overlord is a masterpiece that must be experienced first-hand. So apparently what Sword Art Online needed was for Kirito to be a skeleton wizard and Asuna to be Mahouka's Miyuki. The concept of this series is the same as what most people are already familiar with; A guy is playing a game, and then he's suddenly trapped in it because of some unexplained reason. Overlord does absolutely nothing original aside from having a few aesthetic and irrelevant differences from the rest, and people seem to consider it as a brilliant masterpiece because it apparently managed to appeal to those who wantedto play as the bad guy in a roleplaying forum. \\n\\n\r\nThe original LN has some pretty nice art and cool character designs. That's about the only good thing about the series as a whole- Everything else, including the writing, ranges from mediocre to genuinely awful. Apparently when Madhouse realized that they were going to be animating One Punch Man, they saw Overlord's amazing budget saving potential- Most notably, zooming in the unmoving skeleton man's face so they don't have to animate anything at all while he's talking. The animation is really subpar, and there's a lot of terrible looking CGI in the show while it's not focusing on Momonga's face. It only truly picks up in quality at the very end of the series, and even then, it doesn't manage to be very impressive. The OST is very forgettable to the point that I might even consider it one of the worst in the shows I've seen- Basically take whatever Yasuharu Takanashi does and make it even more generic than some of his worst works. That about describes it. Visually and aurally, it's definitely below average.\\n\\n\r\nBut surely despite all that mediocrity, the writing must be amazing. After all, the main character is a skeleton wizard and leads an army of Saturday morning cartoon villains. Despite the series attempting to present the protagonist and his group as evil, the best it does is having them kill completely unlikable characters that barely get more than a minute of screen time. That's some evil right there.\\n\\n\r\nMomonga is an incredibly boring character. Aside from providing exposition after exposition through his internal monologues from his experience with the MMO when describing what's happening on the screen, he really does not have much personality. His entire character motivation is to find out about the world he's trapped in, just like the viewers- Basically, it can be summed up that his motivation pretty much does not exist because it simply exists as a parallel to the plot itself. Furthermore, he's very powerful- Apparently overpowered MCs are acceptable as long as they're not designed like teenage boys, which makes it admitedly harder for neckbeards to relate to. But Momonga's degree of power exceeds even that- He's powerful to the point that nearly nothing poses a serious threat to him. This is a problem in storytelling because no conflict is ever relevant- Momonga's powerful enough to just solve it easily without any effort. One could say that it was the writer's intent to make Momonga seem powerful and impressive, but it doesn't even do that correctly. Power is relative, so when Momonga just one-shots random fodders that spend more time boasting about themselves than actually showing what they're capable of, it's not impressive in the slightest. A key example of this happens in the fourth episode, where the bad guy summons what is supposedly a super-powerful monster, and when Momonga kills it, it's supposed to look impressive. But the audience doesn't know what this monster was even capable of, outside of the bad guy boasting about its supposed strength, so it just feels completely flat. \\n\\n\r\nWhile he makes all these unnecessary convoluted plans about how he would spread his name around the world to catch the attention of those who might have been trapped in the world like him, he essentially just solves all his problems through his raw power. His problems are more self-imposed than anything due to his tendency to be incredibly paranoid due to his fear of something that \u201cmight\u201d be more powerful than him. And to make it worse, he just outright contradicts himself near the end of the show by risking his life in an unnecessary one-on-one combat due to his ego. Brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to make it more brilliant, there really was no reason for the MMO backdrop at all- It's a completely unnecessary addition. The series could have worked just as well with Momonga being a genuine evil skeleton lich in a genuine fantasy world instead of \u201csome guy trapped in a MMO world that became REAL.\u201d All this does, essentially, is to give an excuse for some parts of poor storytelling to exist, such as exposition dumps from Momonga based on his experience with the MMO, and floor guardians being completely, unquestionably loyal to him for no reason. The series never references back to the real world, so it might as well not exist- And since the audience has no idea about the said MMO, it only emphasizes the point about this just being a pointless hook, and a justification for awful storytelling that relies on the backwards idea of \u201cTell, don't show.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAll the floor guardians and Momonga's lackies are uninteresting and flat- They have some interesting designs, especially the maids, but all their personality is about as interesting as a rock. First few episodes make it clear that they absolutely adore Momonga, and they spend their entire screen time thinking and/or talking about how great Momonga is. One of the worst examples is Albedo, who spends every moment of her screen time doing just all that. She never does anything outside of praising Momonga, whether he's in the same scene as her or not- Comparing this to Mahouka, she's basically this series' equivalent of Miyuki if Miyuki did absolutely nothing outside of praising Tatsuya, which makes Albedo far, far more annoying. Remember how people absolutely despised Miyuki because she wouldn't shut up about her onii-sama? There's an exact same character here, if arguably worse, but Albedo gets a free pass because her target of affection looks like a skeleton wizard and has a fanservice design. \\n\r\nThere's also nothing interesting about floor guardians' interaction with one another, as all they talk about is how great Momonga is and how they should do their job and serve him. I guess the assumption the author made was that his target audience was so stupid that they needed to be reminded of the obvious every scene, every line. \\n\\n\r\nAnother awful aspect of this series is the pacing- It's always painfully slow. A lot of people seem to defend slow pacing by claiming that it's character development, but there's no development. I'm not sure where people got the idea that character interaction equate to character development, but I guess just listening to pointless filler dialogue gives some people a false impression that something must be going on even though nothing is really going on. This is especially noticeable in the episodes where Momonga teams up with a lower class group of adventurers to complete a quest- The show spends several episodes attempting to develop this group of nobodies by giving them cardboard personalities, but in the end it's completely pointless. They're not likable because they haven't really done anything, their interaction with Momonga is pretty bland, and the series makes it clear that they're not important to begin with. And surprise, it turns out they were completely irrelevant. Amazing character development for characters that never mattered with pointless, drawn-out character interaction that did nothing for everyone in the cast. \\n\\n\r\nIf all that wasn't enough, the series doesn't even tie itself up properly- The last part of the show involves one of Momonga's minions, who is just as powerful as he is, suddenly being brainwashed through the power of plot convenience because the author thought an actually threatening conflict was needed around this time in the series. Despite taking all the safety precautions with all his power previously, Momonga decides that he needs to make a point about how he's the leader, even though there was absolutely no need for him to do so when all the floor guardians already adore him unquestionably. Basically, Momonga is not very intelligent- Everything goes as he plans because of his raw power and having so many tools to work with- Not because he's actually skilled at strategizing. It also should be noted that this last part of the show was incredibly grating, because the brainwashed minion still sucks up to Momonga while still opposing him. Really, Overlord?\\n\\n\r\nSo to summarize what happened in this entire cour: First quarter spends its time on just introductions on characters that have no personality whatsoever outside of all sucking up to Momonga in perfect unison. Second quarter is about Momonga effortlessly beating an army of literal nobodies that won't matter for the rest of the season. Third quarter is about Momonga effortlessly beating an army of zombies and two bad guys that won't matter for the rest of the season. And finally, the last quarter is about Momonga beating a brainwashed minion only because he handicapped himself even though it would've been just as effortless because he's a poorly written character. I can't even really claim that this is a pacing issue with the show itself- This is more like a pacing issue of the novels because the show covers fair amount of the novels. Remember that statement about how MMO setting is used as nothing more than an exposition tool? Yeah, it's apparently being used as a filler as well in the novels, explaining things that nobody gives a shit about to pad out the content. \\n\\n\r\nI really don't understand the praise for this series- Aside from simple aesthetic differences, this series has all the flaws that all generic light novels have. The MC is just yet another generic Stu protagonist that has next to no character motivation, the side characters are cardboard cutouts that constantly suck up to Momonga only because they were quite literally made to do so, and the storytelling is a complete mess where the MMO backdrop is only used as a convenient excuse to make way for exposition through Momonga's inner monologues. Instead of being from a perspective of a genuine evil villain, it's from a perspective of a generic MC that only looks like a villain with underlings who are about as laughably as evil as Akame ga Kill's antagonists. As an adaptation, it fails- And as for the series as a whole, it's just another generic fantasy novel with a gimmick element as a hook. There's literally nothing positive about the series, aside from the LN's art and character designs, which all just seem like a waste of talent and effort. Both of which are not present in the adaptation or the writer. \\n\\n\r\nThe spin-off series, Ple Ple Pleiades is actually far more entertaining. Go watch that instead.",

            "content": "Overlord, as the rank itself was an outstanding rank to symbolize the tremendous power of the user. Unfortunately the rank failed to save Momonga from trapped in a world of fantasy game, thus there is only one thing that you can do. Time for some real action. He himself will pass the judgments upon Yggdrasil. Which future will Momonga bring? A bright future filled with joy or a living hell full with horrors, pain, anguish, and punishment. Regarded as the highest of the Almighty 41 Supreme Beings of the Great Tomb of Nazarick. This is the right time to conquer Yggdrasil, a world of fantasygame. Anyone who tried to resist or oppose him shall face the ultimate humiliation and loss, to suffer for eternally. \\n\\n\r\nReview \\n\r\nThe series has been adapted out of Overlord manga written by Maruyama Kugane which is not yet finished and still ongoing. This manga received a very well welcome when it was published for the first time. By no time, Overlord manga has already successful hooked a lot of fans. However, the series is still far from succeeding. The glory will be decided upon when the author ensures not to rush the storyline and naturally follow its own pace. The sole purpose is to justify the right of Manga and the Novel. Do not misunderstand me, this series has a really great potential. It is a fact that you must know. Anyways, this series is already exceeding my expectations by proven that it one of the best anime in summer seasons. You might miss a few of the deeper plot elements, but it is still an enjoyable and often times the story is rather buffoonery. Nonetheless, this series is standing victorious over the field.\\n\\n\r\nThe series fight scene is rather excessive in violence, bloody, and such a bloody rain in term of gore. To put it clearly, it\u2019s rather a brutal way to been presented. I did not expect this since I\u2019ve been put my mind that this series probably will be censored the scene. Regretful, it does not apply. For people who kind of new to anime series, and anime fans who can\u2019t stand a pure bloody gore, you probably will not like this one aspect. The rating for this series is R - 17+ (violence & profanity). Keep this on your mind. Gore fans, this is a birthday gift for you. Recommended audience for this series is adult and teenagers who are mature enough to evaluate. Anyway, if some parents trying to consider watching this series with your kids or putting it simply kid underage, please never do.  Kid underage tend to imitate what they have see in the program show even though it just animation. Kids are basically pure. They still do not know anything about adult world. Worse case, they may have trauma, laugh if you want but people should take this matter more seriously for their own goodness. In the end, undeniably Overlord is still a good series to watch. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nMomonga perfectly define the best figure for main villain and undeniably brilliant to be disliked, much less hated. He's such a manly man although his humanity is slowly fading away. His skills are a significant to assess the abilities each of his comrade to the fullest. To some extent though, Momonga does not really mind being insulted by the enemy purely because want to see for him selves, how superior it is the enemy powers and abilities. Momonga also is able to intelligently manipulate people without even shows his powerful demonic aura. With Momonga abilities, knowledge and experience he had go through, the series allows one's imagination to run wild thinking how superior Momonga existence itself.  That\u2019s one of the beauties from Overlord. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\r\nThe animation for this series is very good and flawless. The artwork is colorful and each of the character designs is very well done. Concept of creating a non human for the main lead is also fresh scene once in a while. The Great Tomb of Nazarick also carefully designed and each floor has a different design as well as the keepers. Bluntly, I seriously like Momonga. The way He cast a simple magic trick or a powerful magic attack make it as realistic as it was definitely real. In other words, with a short brief of how his power works, we can accept it easily without too much thinking. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening series is very catchy with a rather interesting lyric. While the Eds has symbolize the purity of Albedo.  These two Op and Eds is actually quite a good song. The sound is slowly embracing us gently and I quite impressed by the incredible sound effects in this series. Indeed such an incredible effort by the voice actors, Op and Eds vocalist to keep up the best performance to date. The series music section deems another one extra point. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\r\nBut what makes it so great is the story of the game itself. Little biased with a previous concept such as Sword Art Online (SAO) and Log Horizon (LH) but amazingly arise and ascend amongst them. In my own opinion, the story, the sound and adding with art animation together were creating such a masterpiece. The only problem is our hero does not have skin, blood or any human organs. He is totally undead beings. The skeleton body is kind of cool, but highly no fan girls will attracted to our main lead. Fortunately, our main lead shines bright through the ugliness. No need to worry about romance; he still has Albeldo who's totally love him deeply and the other girls to be with him at times of thick and thin. I'm not quite sure why but he was the only person I doesn\u2019t mind getting harem. Magically, I'm supporting him. For my second problems with this show is the number of episodes. The episode in the series is way too short. I do not mean the episode length, rather why this series only has 13 episodes per series that make it such a huge disappointment. Anyways, I still recommended this series as it was highly entertaining and give you quite a ride up to the finish line.\\n\\n",

The show quickly sets itself apart from its contemporaries by giving us a protagonist who plays the role of an antagonist and loves it. \r\nAfter a brief period of confusion, the easewith which Ainz/Momon takes charge of his servants and powers is refreshing to see. Every move he makes defines his character as a person who is a veteran of MMORPG games. And while he uses his tactics as he would in a game, he knows the consequences of his actions and accepts them without hesitation. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Music of the show compliment each other brilliantly, and the characters are a good mix of perverse, lovable and obedient. If you've ever had a dream of ruling your own world, then this show will make an excellent guide.",

            "content": "Anime adaptation revolving around RPG and MMORPG themed worlds can usually be a hit or miss. As a fan of MMORPG games in real life, there should be expectations with the world fiction such as the monsters, mechanics, story, setting, and overall execution. Where does that put Overlord? A bit overboard? Underwhelming? It\u2019s not really like that but Overlord is the type of show that can be hard to judge.\r\nThe series is based on a light novel that originated from a Japanese web novel. The original source has about 9 volumes although the adaptation by Madhouse studio consists of only a single cour. (13 episodes)That usually sets off a red flag with the story pacing. And it isn\u2019t wrong either as the first two or so episodes carries a weak weight on itself. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in the online world of Yggdrasil, we meet Momonga, a salary-man who apparently tried to log out at the very last minute. Things go a bit wary and he gets stuck in-game as an online avatar in the form of a \u2018skeletal lich\u2019. It also just happens so that the avatar is also a very powerful wizard. What\u2019s more is that the NPC around him also exhibit their own personalities as if they are alive and have minds of their own. Essentially, the story marks its territory at the Tomb of Nazarick. The first two episodes establishes Momonga (or going by his in-game name Ainz Ooal Gown) as someone with immense powers. Now, I have a problem with overrated characters and Ainz is no exception to this. The show demonstrates his invulnerability to poison along with elite fighting skills, weapon set, and even an intellectual mind as the story progresses. However, the series also takes a few different turns. Monomga still display his human traits as he interacts with the NPCs he encounters. Apparently, they serve him like he is their God so it takes time for him to adapt. Momonga\u2019s personality also becomes suppressed and he displays cunning behavior throughout the show. However, I would not say that he is an arrogant character as he is quite loyal, honest, and respects his servants. As the story progresses, there is a lack of feeling he develops towards death. (Given the irony that he himself is a skeleton, a personification of death)\\n\\n\r\nThe show can be taken to light from different perspectives. From the perspective of a light novel reader and adaptation, it\u2019s easy to say that the series focuses quite a bit on Momonga. Almost every episode highlights his role, personality, or overall character. The relationship building and associations he establishes with other characters are also played out in a variety of ways. This can be seen with the seductive Albedo who is utterly in love with him. Even among the Floor Guardians of Momonga\u2019s guild, she is one of the most loyal and obsessive towards Momonga. It doesn\u2019t help that the show also introduces rivals such as Shalltear who shows sexual tendencies. The show\u2019s initial impressions sets off this red flag as it almost makes fun of itself. It also introduces other characters that each get a little bit of his or her screen time such as the Mare and Aura twins, butler Sebas, Cocytus, and intelligent demon Demiurge. In relation to Momonga, they all seemingly show an undying love and respect for him; just expressed definitely from one way or another. As a bit of character driven story, this is really a miss as the characters are unappealing from first impressions. Only Momonga can be legitimately interesting as we want to find out his potential as a guild master and person in real life. It makes us wonder what he is capable of with his new role and how these new changes can apply to his character.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder course of the show opens up realms of possibilities. Like most MMORPG worlds, Yggdrasil seems to be resourceful with landscapes, guilds, and monsters. The story mechanics of the series is explained such as weaponry, skills, and monsters that exhibit its world. It\u2019s nothing original when compared to some other MMORPG style shows. In the past, series such as Sword Art Online and Log Horizon also has fantasy game mechanics; albeit in different fashion. For Overlord, it slowly does this while unraveling the main course of the story. There\u2019s also some common monsters you\u2019ll usually find in fantasy worlds such as goblins, undead beings, and even angels. What makes Overlord stands out a little bit more is that the show is more than just about conquering and survival. I think the key word is the title itself, \u201cOverlord\u201d. This is because Momonga/Ainz is actually trying to take over the world as the new ruler. So in a way, he wants to be an overlord despite his lack of inexperience. This is clearly shown throughout the show with his intentions.\\n\\n\r\nAs both a character and story driven series, it will definitely takes patience and adapting to get used to the show. I actually recommend re-watching some scenes to get a better understanding of the series\u2019 intentions at few cases. Examples such as Momonga\u2019s lack of remorse towards death, Albedo\u2019s distasteful view on humans, and other ideals makes the show appealing. It makes the NPCs feel real. In addition, the game mechanics such as spells, weaponry, magical items, and potion making really brings out its fantasy realm to life. There\u2019s some good amount of action as well although fairly predictable with Momonga\u2019s newfound skills. In addition, the story also makes it clear that he isn\u2019t the only character that matters. Others he encounters and associates with such as the Sword of Darkness and his own battle maids get their additional spotlight too. The story also introduces antagonists with their own independent malevolent intentions. It shouldn\u2019t take too long for viewers to realize that Overlord isn\u2019t just Momonga\u2019s personal show. \\n\\n\r\nBut for all its creativity, the series suffers much from the over emphasis of Momonga. It focuses far too much on his character while adding the ridiculousness of his servants\u2019 love for him. The first two episodes will likely be a make or break for most viewers as the feeling of an MMORPG game feels isolated. There\u2019s also die-hard comedy with character rivalries, expressions, and overall tone of their generalization. I will say the show has a diverse cast of the characters though. And given the set up for the world, it introduces plenty of important ones to bring the best of Momonga. However, be very aware of the pacing of this story. The first half really tests the patience of the viewers despite foreshadowing some future events and making small promises of improvement. While it\u2019s doing all of this, the comedy is also a hit or miss with its controversially timed scenarios. And lastly, it seems like the adaptation itself is more of a tease for viewers to \u201cread the novels\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse puts their work into this show\u2019s animation style. Taking place in such a fantasy world, the colors are focused on the characters rather than the background. Characters are diverse and decorated distinctively that makes them look unique. Momonga/Ainz is obviously the one that stands out the most with his skeletal avatar. When on the road, he takes the form of a dark warrior encased in an armor that makes him look like a badass hero. And that\u2019s really an underrated word. Among Momonga\u2019s followers, the term \u2018badass\u2019 can be applied to several characters with their designs such as Albedo, Shelltear, and the battle maid Nabe. There\u2019s also the monsters introduced that is classic to most MMORPG worlds. Human characters are created to look human and most of them gives the impressions of themselves as adventurers. As a fantasy adventure, the show is also no stranger to action and violence. In essence, the action is decent in terms of fantasy standards. It\u2019s the type of stuff you\u2019ll see often in MMORPG related games. On the other hand, the violence creates a grimmer tone. There\u2019s no censorship with the blood and even gore-like scenes during battle sequences. Fan service also exists with Albedo\u2019s role in the story. But what really brings out their characters is the expressions. It has the experimental feel when you see how they react as NPCs while displaying human traits.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want stereo music, then you got stereo music. Namely, the OP theme song is an intense beat to the ears while the ED theme always decorates itself with unorthodox imagery. The OST displays a familiar fantasy feel in terms of content. And for all that\u2019s worth, character voice mannerism plays some key roles to make their characters into life. Momonga is actually one of the less noticeable characters for his voice because he sounds similarly like a human. On the other hand, the NPCs has a distinctive voice with their character roles. These voice diversity ranges from Albedo\u2019s seductiveness, Sheltear\u2019s aggressiveness, Sebas\u2019 sophisticated personality, or Nabes\u2019 loyalty. Clementine also gives off a presence of violence thanks to her sinister voice tone that persuades viewers to see how far she will go with her plans. Despite the large cast of characters, a strength of the show does come from the voices.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Overlord is more or less a refreshingly adventurous tale about a dude stuck in a skeletal avatar. It has functioning creative imagination with a colorful cast of characters. But when it comes to story, Overlord smells like a show with money in mind. In other words, it seems like an advertisement to the main novel. Director Naoyuki Itou puts his experience with other fantasy series at work and is a bit of a mixed bag. The adaptation isn\u2019t unique in either pacing or leaves strong first impressions. The fantasy world itself does generate a decent amount of interest when it comes to its core mechanics. But for a show like Overlord, it needed to hold together and makes sense. Sometimes it accomplishes that, other times it doesn\u2019t. Overlord is a show that needs improvement so pick your poison.\\n",

            "content": "[NO SPOILER REVIEW]\r\nLet me start this review by stating the reason I started watching Overlord; it had an 8.14 on MAL. I figured it must be pretty damn good, considering it was the second highest rated new anime of the Summer 2015 season. Wow was I wrong to assume that.\r\nStory: 3 - Poor\r\n      So this anime starts off with a really generic crappy MMO story, nothing amazing about it, nothing that hooks the viewer. However, you can't always judge an anime by its first few episodes. Gurren Lagann had a pretty slow beginning; as did Rokka no Yuusha and numerousother shows, so it's nothing to be ashamed about.\\n\\n\r\n   About 4 episodes in, I found myself thinking, \"Oh Boy, I bet something cool's gonna happen and this show is gonna become amazing to overcome it's lackluster start!\". But the story just never hooked me. Ever.\\n\\n\r\n Was there a story? \\n\r\nIt's been 10 minutes since I finished watching and already I'm beginning to wonder if there was any semblance of plot in that giant pile of garbage. But you know what? Story isn't everything. K-On!, WataMote, Gintama, all lack a straightforward and cohesive story, yet they are some of my favorite animes of all-time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 1 - Pathetic\\n\r\n   So in terms of artistic design, it's probably the worst anime I've ever seen. I am taking into account that it's 2015, and this anime looks like a garbage-tier animation product from 2001. Seriously the original Yu-Gi-Oh looks nicer than this. The CGI is actually great 100% of the time, 10% of the time. So I guess it has that going for it, which is nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3 - Poor\\n\r\n Was there an OST? I can't recall. I know the Opening was pretty good, and the Ending was so bad that I skipped it half the time. So all in all, sound is one of this anime's better aspects, because it makes itself scarce. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4 - Decent\\n\r\n  I feel like if I had read the manga, the characters might have been okay. But I didn't. I watched this anime. \\n\\n\r\nYou know how there are a plethora of extremely generic anime male leads with the same look and personality? Brown short-medium hair, with a plain looking face, and a very bland personality, with no real character at all? Well this anime tries to cover up its extremely generic male lead by putting him in this \"cool\" looking MMO Undead Lich skin. But it doesn't work. He's still generic. He's still uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters all have okay aesthetic designs (besides Shalltear, who is just stupid amounts of cliche), but we don't get to know any of them on a personal level, so the design is mostly wasted. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are interested in the really bad acting that pornstars do in the beginning of their videos (like pretending to be a pizza guy, a mailman, a nurse, an innocent virgin schoolgirl) then you will be pleased to know that 2 of the 3 \"main\" female side characters emulate this form of acting every time they're on the screen. Unfortunately, this kind of thing is not quite my cup of tea, so I'm only adding 5 points to this category's rating for it. \\n\\n\r\n  In terms of character development, there is none. I'm trying incredibly hard to think of one example where a character is different from how they were when they were introduced; but there is no example. I'm reaching for stars that don't exist. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2 - Dreadful\\n\r\n   I think watching this anime was the first time I seriously considered gouging my own eyeballs out. I might need some sort of third party confirmation on this; but was this show supposed to be funny? I felt like it was missing a laugh track. I didn't smile a single time during the course of the show, but I feel like it might have attempted to be funny a few times during each episode. \\n\\n\r\nAgain if somebody could PM me to confirm my suspicions that'd be great; because I honestly couldn't tell. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3 - Poor\\n\r\n   I have years of MMO experience. I regularly watch shows of the same genre. I am a straight male. I am this show's target demographic. I feel like my words have to carry some amount of weight here. And so this is my final verdict:\\n\\n\r\n  This show is a work of \"Art\"; if you consider \"Art\" smearing your own feces all over a wall and then furiously licking it up whilst listening to the the Barney Theme Song on loop for 5 to 6 hours.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS \r\nI, for the life of me, cannot understand how this show garners universal praise.  Simply put, this show was a total dumpster fire.  While I have many criticisms in the following incoherent rant I've prepared, I think it best to start with Momonga.  \r\nMomonga is one of the most egregious power fantasies I\u2019ve ever seen.  I say that as someone who doesn't hate power fantasies.  Indiana Jones and James bond are some of my favorite movie series, and they are both clear power fantasies.  The problem is Momonga's image as an infallible deity took precedenceover every other element of story telling.  Indy and Bond can lose battles and still win the war.  Obviously, they will beat the bad guy in the end, but there is tension in each skirmish.  They can be betrayed at any moment by one of their allies or captured and imprisoned by the antagonist with his superior forces and resources;  All leading up to the cathartic climax where the protagonist wins out with their superior wit and cunning, leaving the villain powerless against them.  Momonga can't do any of that.  He must be objectively more powerful than every other entity.  He must win every fight in a convincing fashion.  He cannot be betrayed.  The result is a bland, tension-less, meaningless mess.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s what I mean:  \\n\\n\r\nMomonga was just thrust into a new world where he understands almost none of the mechanics of combat.  Albeit lazy isekai writing, this creates a perfect opportunity for our MC to fulfill his boundless potential as he learns the mechanics of combat.  This would be great for satisfying, fast-paced yet believable progression.  We could have the satisfaction of an OP MC, and the satisfaction of seeing his power rapidly increase over time.  The creator squanders these opportunities entirely, as any perceived weakness in Momonga could interrupt the power fantasy.  Momonga easily beats any enemy that stands before him starting day 1.  He typically needlessly draws fights out on the flimsy excuse he\u2019s learning from them.  This usually amounts to him standing in front of his opponent for a while as their fear slowly grows and I slowly nod off.  Eventually, he effortlessly blows them away with a spell more powerful and complex than anything his opponents use in the fight.  What is there to learn when you know magic more powerful than any human in the entire world?  The writing fails miserably right at the outset.\\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019re off to a rough start, but things are still salvageable, right?  Even if no human can challenge him, we still have the floor guardians.  Momonga will have to use careful planning and wit to appease all these extremely powerful beings and prevent any treachery or betray\u2026 oh, never mind.  The floor guardians are nothing but his mindless servants.  In an rpg, it's almost a requirement to create a slave-master relationship between The MC and their party members.  If characters were able to act on their own agendas, you couldn't tailor your party as you see fit; hence party members tend to become empty pawns with which you can do as you please.  This isn't too egregious in rpgs purely for its convenience, but it's an awful device to use in un-interactive media.  The \"excellent cast and character relationships\" in Overlord are nothing more than an array of master-slave relationships with cosmetic personalities to hide a universal lack of agency.  The floor guardians are boring because of this.  There\u2019s no thoughtfulness required in their writing or weight to the conflicts between them, as Momonga can simply tell them to stop bickering with each other and they gladly and immediately comply.  This makes all character relationships in Nazarick superficial, regardless of how much effort is put into developing them.        \\n\\n\r\nIntelligence and situational awareness are two of the best characteristics in a power fantasy, that\u2019s why Indy is so keen at spotting traps and solving ancient puzzles.  That\u2019s why Bond\u2019s charisma and wit can weasel him out of any situation.  Overlord tries to make us think that Momonga is an intricate web weaver with these traits, but it uses dull scouting and intelligence missions instead of situations that require tactful writing and hold significance to the plot.  Appeasing these powerful and dangerous floor guardians was a great opportunity to put these traits to use in a worthwhile way.  Yet again, this great opportunity is immediately squandered in lieu of easy writing for an absolute power fantasy.   \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the Overlord gimmick.  This portion, apparently, makes the show interesting and unique.  I disagree.  Momonga\u2019s evil overlord gimmick is hardly even that.  I\u2019d call it an evil overlord aesthetic.  All he does throughout the show is help humans and tell his minions not to kill his human friends (they all gladly comply with no further thought or fuss, despite this notion being directly antithetical to all his servants\u2019 beliefs.  To reiterate:  Cosmetic personality, zero agency.).  All but one of the people he kills are plainly evil, and the one that\u2019s not evil isn\u2019t likable.  The only things that make him the \"villain\" are his largely unexplored world conquest goals and his lich body.    \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve ragged on momonga enough for now.  Let\u2019s talk about the plot:\\n\\n\r\n A decent amount of effort was put into crafting an interesting world by the author.  I can see why, if this is really what a person is in to, one could enjoy this anime.  It\u2019s a real shame a majority of worldbuilding in this show is done through monologues over still-frames.  Momonga is new to this world and needs to learn almost everything about it, but a believable excuse doesn't make the simplistic delivery any more enjoyable.  Monologue explanations should be a crutch used only when absolutely necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe almost praiseworthy worldbuilding falls flat on its face once we get to combat mechanics.  Overlord uses your typical MMO Isekai combat tropes.  Momonga has a high physical resistance so low-level melee monsters can\u2019t possibly hurt him.  How can our protagonist beat a monster with protection from up to 6th tier magic spells?  With a 7th tier magic spell, of course.  There\u2019s nothing lazier than a combat system that makes lower level characters powerless against higher level characters.  The obvious MMO combat mechanics contrasted heavily with the pure fantasy world the author created, and I never managed to be immersed in either.  \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of combat:  All the fights in this show are extremely boring.  Momonga typically does not move while fighting as a mage, and rarely moves as a warrior.  Ex:  His fight with clementine amounts to her hitting him for 10 minutes until he decides to just hug her to death.  Gripping stuff.  No tactics, no interesting strategies.  The only tension in that fight was acting on the walls of Clementine's arteries as she was unceremoniously squeezed to death.  Every fight in this season took place in an open field.  Environment never played an interesting role in strategy or actual combat.  Momonga\u2019s encounter with the Slain knights was in a clearing in the forest.  The Death Knight fought the Slain Theocracy in a convenient clearing in the middle of town.  Momonga\u2019s encounter with the Slain mage was in a field outside the town, etc.   Not only were the environments inconsequential, but Overlord\u2019s fights were barely even animated at all.  Compared to other Madhouse shows around this time, the fights in overlord were nothing short of abhorrent.   \\n\\n\r\nThe addition of a revival system is nice.  I was almost concerned that our immortal Gary Stu couldn\u2019t save his friends from death.  Glad that was cleared up.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really talk much about the actual overarching plot in this section, and that\u2019s because there is none.  I don\u2019t even know what the main plot is, Momonga\u2019s world conquest?  Momonga\u2019s exploratory adventures?  It\u2019s impossible to analyze the progress of the overarching plot if the overarching plot isn\u2019t even defined.  At least shows like Konosuba had a goal.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  \\n\\n\r\nMadhouse, why?  This is some of the most atrocious animation I\u2019ve seen from the modern era, and its from madhouse, no less.  The Drawn characters and CG monsters don\u2019t feel at all like they belong in the same world.  Almost all Momonga\u2019s dialogue is delivered either while he is entirely inanimate or with about 4 animated frames of head turn.  There\u2019s absolutely no expression whatsoever for an anime so heavily praised for its characters.  The Guardians have some cool character designs and are decently expressive, but Momonga does not translate well into an anime format.  The side characters, humans especially, have bland character designs.  Background art is typical isekai fare.  Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a hair below average for anime, but unacceptable for madhouse in 2015.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s alright.  Music was used well enough.  OP is forgettable.  Sound can complement a good piece of media, it can\u2019t save a bad one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  \\n\\n\r\nI got more enjoyment out of dissecting every element I hate about the show than I did watching it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts:  \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t see the value in this show (and neither did madhouse, judging by the animation).  The creator\u2019s masturbatory power fantasy writing overshadowed all other aspects of the show.  There was never any tension in the conflicts, the character relationships were inconsequential because of momonga\u2019s total control over their actions, and the fights were boring to watch because of the total afterthought combat mechanics, boring settings, OP MC, and dismal animation quality.  It baffles me that this anime receives almost universal praise and is one of the most popular shows out today.  \\n\\n\r\nFeel free to guess whether or not I recommend this anime.  You get 3 chances.       \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nHanging out in the front of Ironforge. Karazhan runs. The snowy hills of Northrend. World of Warcraft is not just a game, it is its own, complete world. Beasts to slay, treasure to find, and quests to complete. Dailies for gold. Instances for gear. Fishing for fun. There is so much to do that it more or less became my second life for a sizeable chunk of my teenage years. After going to school, chatting with friends, and taking care of what needed to be done in the real world, I would hop onto the computerand become someone that was not technically me but might as well have been.\\n\\n\r\nThat sounds bonkers, but it is the truth. The amount of time, the resources, and the effort I sunk into that game were enough to make my avatar a natural extension of myself. Of course, I did not don armor, I did not ride an undead horse, and I did not have a gray beard, but I shaped my character into the kind of person I saw myself to be.\\n\\n\r\nI was always big on questing. I loved going to the different countries like Stranglethorn Vale and Tanaris, searching high and low for those distinctive yellow exclamation marks above Hemet Nesingwary or the Goblins of the desert. I will never forget, for as long as I live, how I was one of the earliest players (within the first year or so) to earn the \u201cInsane in the Membrane\u201d achievement before it was nerfed. The requirements were being near or at \u201cExalted\u201d reputation for some of the most obscure factions. Ones like Darkmoon Faire, which needed thousands of gold and cards, and Ravenholdt, which needed me to make a brand new \u201cRogue\u201d class character specifically tooled to steal over 2000 junkboxes from enemies. Getting the \u201cFeat of Strength\u201d took months, but it was worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThe tedious work earned me a sweet new title of \u201cthe Insane\u201d next to my character\u2019s name. But that was not what ultimately made the game worthwhile. What made World of Warcraft worthwhile were the people around me. The guild I was a part of, my brother going with me to get some levels, and the various friends I made throughout my time in the Eastern Kingdoms is something that I will always hold dear. The game is way too addictive and way too much of a time-sink. And the game was not always smiles. But the memories I have of the game and the people I played alongside are and will only ever be positive.\\n\\n\r\nOverlord gets at the same notion, how the past, while no longer with us, never truly leaves. However, unlike my time in World of Warcraft, Overlord is not all positivity.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Overlord, its narrative is somewhat sloppy in its execution. Plot lines are unresolved, entire areas are ignored, and its overall purpose is lacking. Often relying on the same trope \u2013 that Ainz Ooal Gown is impossibly strong \u2013 the show stops itself from doing much of anything else, severely hampering the experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has essentially three arcs: the opening arc, the undead arc, and the Shalltear arc. The beginning arc is mostly setup. Characters are introduced, parts of the world are explained, and Ainz Ooal Gown\u2019s absolutely overpowered self is made known. Nothing wrong exists at this point since the anime is simply gearing itself for the rest of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems start with the second arc. First, the anime moves away from the literal home base of Nazarick. This would be fine but the show introduces and works with another new character (Nabel) rather than using the already-established and yet-to-be used rest of the cast like Albedo, Cocytus, and Demiurge. Second, the anime then continues to introduce more people, like a bunch of random adventurers and the protector of the forest, that further detract from what the anime provided earlier. Third, and worse still, these adventurers are killed and the protector of the forest is hardly referenced again, meaning their inclusion means little in the grand scheme of things. Fourth and furthermore, simple tactics like explaining more of the world \u2013 how the magic works, the various factions, and so on \u2013 and not fully showing specific moments \u2013 the assassin attacking the adventurers, what happened immediately after saving the alchemist\u2019s grandson, and so on \u2013 create holes in the narrative that stop the narrative from staying afloat. The point of this arc is to extend Ainz Ooal Gown\u2019s reputation further, in order to attract attention and gain fame. But because the following, final arc does not build off of what happened in the second arc, the plot comes off as directionless. Having this problem already occur between the first and the second, and then having it occur again between the second and the third, disjoints the narrative, thereby ruining the tale Overlord is telling.\\n\\n\r\nThis third arc, featuring Shalltear\u2019s \u201cbetrayal,\u201d does not stop Overlord\u2019s downward trend. Disregarding the shift from spreading reputation to saving Shalltear, the plot introduces another new character (that is used only once), the background forces-at-work are very briefly alluded to (while still making next to no sense), and the outcome effectively returned everything to how it was before the debacle (meaning it was a diversion that minimally affected the narrative). All the while, the rest of the cast is still underutilized, the world is still unmapped, and the previous plot points \u2013 like the original general he helped and the need for more reputation \u2013 are forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThe cause for these dilemmas: Ainz Ooal Gown. More specifically, it is his elite status that causes the narrative to tumble over itself. Interestingly, the point of the show is the overpowered-ness. Watching him wreck a group\u2019s trump card with just his finger. Seeing him literally hug a woman until her insides explode. Witnessing him going through legendary weapon after legendary weapon. The anime always has to showcase him in his ridiculously unfair state but doing so takes away from the rest of the anime. He is super-strong, so the rest of the cast is unneeded and thus is not shown. He is super-smart, so going into detail about the world and the magic is pointless for him. He is super-awesome, so diverting attention to other plot lines that do not involve his esteemed abilities would ruin the magic. Paradoxically, the anime\u2019s biggest strength is also its biggest weakness.\\n\\n\r\nWeakness continues in Overlord\u2019s shoddy attempt at creating a theme. Throughout the season, there are distinct moments of reminiscing. Ainz Ooal Gown has recollections of the past, he feels longing when trekking with the random group of adventurers, and near the end he clearly wishes for his old comrades to still be with him now. The show is trying to get at the notion that nothing lasts forever. Life eventually moves forward, people come and go, no matter how much one wants it otherwise. The problem, though, is that he is still there, he is still lasting. He is performing the same role \u2013 leader of a guild \u2013 as he has always done. In essence, he wants the old days back. But when so little is given about his past escapades let alone his past comrades, this theme, of cherishing what once was yet looking forward at what is to come, loses value.\\n\\n\r\nA potential argument in favor of this theme is that foregoing the past is difficult. It is not easy letting go when those days gone by were so memorable. However the anime never makes this type of thinking clear. For example, there is a what-should-be tender moment where his lackeys invite him to berate Shalltear, the purpose being to get him standing and moving forward. But the reversal of authority in that scene \u2013 where his followers, especially Albedo, \u201chelp\u201d him \u2013 is too contrasting with the entire rest of the season\u2019s \u201cAinz Ooal Gown is the greatest\u201d motif. Another example is his reaction to the death of the random adventurers. Initially he is more annoyed than caring since they were tools to further his reputation. But his offhand comment calling himself a \u201chypocrite\u201d makes it confusing since forward movement is seemingly made but then immediately taken back. Beyond these moments, and perhaps more of a problem, is that the show rarely explores this theme to begin with. Again, since the anime is determined to push the overarching, overpowered idea to the front, it never places aside adequate time to talk about or investigate this theme. Thus, what is given are these minor moments that, when compared to the rest of the anime, make up a very small and therefore inconsequential portion.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does make up the \u201crest of the anime\u201d? Overlord includes a nice amount of action sequences in the form of dragon battles, zombie knights, and vampire warriors. Other scenes focus on \u201cecchi\u201d and comedy, sometimes both. For instance, Albedo straddling a body pillow that has Ainz Ooal Gowns\u2019 face on it is both sexy and hilarious. These sequences would seem to get repetitive considering that these and the previously investigated events surrounding them have little substance. But because the outcome is already known \u2013 that Ainz Ooal Gown will decimate whosoever stands before him or will effortlessly command them \u2013 that the anime gains an alluring quality. The anime becomes less about seeing where it ends up and more about how it gets there. The awe of the passersby, the utter annihilation of foes, and the complete servitude of minions is something that is easy to revel in, and since the show achieves these effects through its regular happenings, the anime likewise engrosses the audience on a regular basis.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, Overlord is not a complete tale, meaning it is unfair for the audience to expect the narrative to be wholly fulfilling. Still, the anime\u2019s need to lean on the same, overpowered trope hurts where it should help.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOverlord\u2019s art is similarly lacking in appeal. This is mostly due to the bland backgrounds that the show incorporates for most of its scenes. To be fair, the show is dark in tone so the artistic direction likewise follows this pattern. Gloomy woods, haunting caverns, and gothic interiors are common but quickly become repetitive. Especially so when the lighting is constantly dreary, making each location the same as the next. The anime can switch it up now and again \u2013 a sandy plain, a weathered road, a view from way up high, and so on \u2013 but these moments are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime can pick up its artistic direction when it chooses. Camera shots, like a decapitated head seeing its own body as it floats through the air or viewing the world through Shalltear\u2019s eyes while she is in her ravenous state demonstrate the show\u2019s ability for flair. Other moments, like a black hole evaporating an archangel or Nabel squaring off against some skeletal dragons push the boundaries of the anime\u2019s lighting, action, and detail. Furthermore, the CG elements \u2013 like the death knight near the beginning and the ogres near the middle \u2013 are not overly obtrusive in their presentation, meaning they do not distract the audience when they do appear on-screen, keeping attention on the aforementioned pizzazz.\\n\\n\r\nPizzazz of the fight choreography, however, is often subpar. The reason, per usual, is the overpowered nature of the characters involved. Nearly everything takes one hit. To put it differently, these are not so much skirmishes as they are one-sided romps. Little time for extensive or prolonged fights is had, and the only one that can call itself thus \u2013 the fight between Ainz Ooal Gown and Shalltear \u2013 is mostly magical, meaning the two of them stand around for roughly the majority of the duel.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation remains about average throughout the experience. Ainz Ooal Gown in particular barely moves. He is a skeleton, so his skull, jaw, and other body parts rarely jostle. When he does move, his actions are often choppy, lessening his overall impact. Once again, there are exceptions: many of the fights feature explosions, ruffling robes, and sword dances that elevate the animation considerably. Yet these, like the art, are not frequent, with the majority of the show resting rather than moving. Facial expressions sporadically increase in quality from time to time, with incredulity, scorn, and anger plastered across faces for the given situation. However hair swaying and other minute details are generally missing, a trade-off for the higher detail placed on the characters and their designs.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not an understatement: the character designs are quite detailed. Ainz Ooal Gown (he is always the odd-man-out) sees the most, his black, yellow, and purple robe, his myriad of rings, and his immaculate, golden wizard\u2019s staff portray him as the king that he is. The contours on his skull, as well as his black-and-red eyes, maintain his demonic disposition. The rest of the cast, while not as detailed, are still very imaginative. Albedo\u2019s normal attire \u2013 a pure white dress, devil horns, and black angel wings on the small of her back \u2013 contrasts with her dark brown and concealing battle armor. Cocytus\u2019s teal carapace matches his bug-like form. And Shalltear\u2019s gothic gown, umbrella, and ribbons, each mired in purple and red, highlight her pale skin well. Unfortunately, while the designs are elaborate, they do not have much value in terms of symbolism or representation. In other words, they are more for show rather than for expounding further on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nArguably Overlord\u2019s weakest aspect are the characters that inhabit Nazarick and the surrounding area.\\n\\n\r\nIt is very difficult to talk about Overlord\u2019s characters. They all worship Ainz Ooal Gown. They all hate humans. They all hold strength of immeasurable magnitude. Therefore, at a surface level, they are identical to one another. Digging deeper, the cast does have character traits that separate them. Albedo would literally do anything for her master, her love for him unable to be matched by anyone ever. Cocytus has dreams of being an \u201cUncle.\u201d Shalltear is a vampire who pads her bra to give her a larger bust. This list of characterizations goes on. The problem, though, is that many of characters go unused. Yes, Albedo\u2019s unfathomable love for Ainz Ooal Gown reoccurs indefinitely, as do some of the other known traits of the servants. But since the anime spends so much time away from the main group, the consequence is that nothing else is known about them. A huge issue, to say the least, because the characters turn from being people into being slots to fill. This speaks nothing of the development of the Albedo and the rest which, understandably, is nonexistent. Understandable since, if the bare minimum of characterizations were provided, then development of any kind will not occur. Devil\u2019s advocates would argue that, as it was with the story, the incompleteness of the overall tale obviously infers that the cast would not undergo extensive development at this point. However, unlike the story, where attempts at constructing a coherent adventure are apparent, the anime never does the same for its characters.\\n\\n\r\nLess important side characters exist, such as Enri (the village girl), Ninya (the girl posing as a boy in the random adventurers\u2019 group), and Clementine (the assassin who is hugged to death). But, once again, very little is given or known about them outside of the offhand comments they or those around them make. Enri has a younger sister and is loved by Nfirea, and that is it. Ninya seems to have lost her older sister and fights to protect the land, and that is it. Clementine is demented and cocky, and that is it. Hyperboles, but so little is given outside of these facts and so little time is spent on these characters that these types of generalizations are warranted. Here, the argument is that these people are so inconsequential that they are practically pointless compared not just to the rest of the cast but to the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThis is true; Enri\u2019s romance, Ninya\u2019s backstory, and Clementine\u2019s psychotic behavior are utilized at most once or twice, constituting \u201cenough\u201d for each person relative to their importance. But because they are unimportant, the purpose of their characters has no meaning besides adding superficial feelings that barely affect the viewer. A case for Ninya and her group is possible, how they mirrored (to an extent) Ainz Ooal Gown\u2019s own, original friends, but this quickly crumbles since, due to their inconsequential status, they are neither referenced after their arc concludes nor are they used to further him or any of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo it stands to reason that Ainz Ooal Gown, the almighty ruler and destroyer of men, requires adequate attention since everyone else around him received none. This is the final nail in the figurative coffin: he as well is a markedly weak character. Part of the problem stems from the recurring overpowered motif; Ainz Ooal Gown is so perfect that there is nothing to fix. His character has no flaws which, from a literary standpoint, is automatically an issue since without conflict he is unable to grow or change throughout the season. Taking into account that this is the whole point of his character \u2013 simply being overpowered at everything, from fighting to strategizing \u2013 the anime does try to convey the change in his personality. Before, as a human playing a video game, killing people was not real, meaning he was not attached mentally to his actions. After, having become a skeletal warlord of another world, this disconnect is still present but has manifested as a part of his personality rather than him consciously making the decision to not care. So, in the very beginning, he changes, but at no point afterward do the events affect him. He does have a split persona, one for his internal monologues and one for his external portrayal. But the former exists purely to understand what he is truly thinking and the latter is how he had always acted, meaning neither side sees noteworthy development, thereby stagnating his character from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nStill, no matter if it is Ainz Ooal Gown\u2019s inner or outer self, the remembrance of the past is a theme that persists. Despite having complete loyalty of everyone, despite having the capability of crushing anything in his path, he still feels alone, wanting the past to come back in one form or another. His servants are on the opposite end. They know of their personal creators and they know where they came from, but they do not dwell on the past. Instead, they devote themselves to Ainz Ooal Gown. For them, what happened before should be celebrated, but still they understand that then is not now. This is interesting because of the dichotomy: the master is worried about this trivial matter while his servants are not. But once again, Ainz Ooal Gown and the rest of the cast is not expounded on enough to support this theme between the characters. Albedo and the others are rarely shown interacting with their previous masters, Shalltear having just about the only scene where this happens. As for the ultimate ruler, he likewise is barely shown interacting with this old buddies, making it hard to empathize with his feelings. The combined result is a broken link within the dichotomy, fragmenting the theme instead of unifying it. Worst still, Albedo and the others are the result of code. Therefore, their loyalty and outlook is not by choice but by circumstance, meaning their relationships are fake which in turn reduces their thematic presence.\\n\\n\r\nSo while the cast of Nazarick might be unbelievably strong in a physical sense, they are unbelievably weak in a writing sense.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nOverlord\u2019s strongest area is easily the sound it uses throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is hard rock, but takes on a semi-spooky vibe to coincide with Ainz Ooal Gown and the tone of the anime. The rising and falling lyrics, the catchy beat, and the rapid drums work together to create an arrangement that is simply cool. The random English bits are somewhat jarring and do not mesh all too well with the song, but the piece hypes the viewer for the inevitable awesomeness that awaits.\\n\\n\r\nAwesomeness such as the ending theme, which is downright wonderful. The ED, like the OP, adopts a rock or metal vibe to make the piece more aligned with the gritty and cool aura that the show gives off. However the ED, unlike the OP, has English bits whose emotion and meaning fit the Albedo-centric track well. The breathing part in the middle is weird but oddly satisfying, since it stops the song and builds it up for the final half of the piece. Alongside the strong vocalist, the background whispering, and the catchy beat, the track comes together, being filled with nothing short of \u201clove and passion.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhile the rest of the soundtrack is not filled with as much love, it still manages to encompass the same feeling of MMORPGs and overpowered-ness that the anime thrives on. A fluty tune for the downtimes that relaxes both body and mind like a famous inn. Choirs and hard drums fill other tracks, maximizing the splendor of Ainz Ooal Gown and his battle prowess. Violins and pianos to follow the gothic feelings. Many of the tracks are steeped in gloomy sounds that heighten the dark mood while also keeping the events cloaked in a veil of mystery that improves the darkness further. Despite how atmospheric the pieces tend to be, none are particularly memorable, serving as appropriate background music and not much more.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, however, is superb, with the majority of the cast providing stellar performances. Yumi Hara as Albedo uses a sultry voice that amplifies Albedo\u2019s sexiness and thus her attractiveness. Satoshi Hino as Ainz Ooal Gown uses two voices, the first higher pitched and younger to match his normal self and the second lower pitched and older to match his overlord self, demonstrating his large vocal range. And a special shout-out is deserved for Aoi Yuuki as Clementine for nailing the psychotic inflection and way of speaking, making Clementine creepier in the process. Altogether, the voice actors and actresses performing so well immerses the audience, a much-needed outcome given the immersive undertones of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile I find the story and the characters to be severely lacking in meaningfulness, there is one reason why I like this one so much: Albedo. She is amazing. Her sacrificial servitude, her sexual spark, and her sensual self won me over immediately. Watching her get extremely mad whenever Shalltear tried to do anything with Ainz Ooal Gown, hearing her go on and on about the clothes she made (up to five years old) for their future child together, and seeing her almost completely lose it after the enemy merely scratched her beloved was hilarious, ridiculous, and endearing. Other moments, like her screaming at the top of her lungs for receiving a ring from Ainz Ooal Gown and her \u201cso freaking cool\u201d line followed by her goofy grin made me love her that much more. She may not be a well-written character in the slightest, but I do not care. She makes me swoon regardless.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast was also fun. Cocytus\u2019s singular moment where he gets lost in his Uncle fantasy, Nabel constantly calling the humans some variation of insect, and Shalltear believing that Ainz Ooal Gown was going to have his way with her in the middle of the throne room were all scenes that made me smile and laugh. I was therefore disappointed that they \u2013 and Albedo, of course \u2013 were not around as much as they could (and should) have been. They are an interesting bunch of characters, so not including them as much as possible made the moments when they were not nearby less exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the events are actually entertaining despite them not having much substance whatsoever. It was a lot of fun watching the enemy cower in fear, unable to grasp how powerful Ainz Ooal Gown was. The death knight stabbing the captain guard over and over was gruesome but funny. Albedo deflecting the pebble back at the mage and literally exploding his head made me love Albedo even more. And Shalltear going berserk in her vampire form was chilling, gross, and crazy all at once. The anime definitely understands how to create scenes filled with entertainment, proving at the minimum that the show could do well when it wanted.\\n\\n\r\nOverlord has prevalent problems in both its narrative and especially its characters. The art and the animation also has issues, though they are not as glaring as the first two. Still, strong music and enjoyable scenarios stop this one from immediately being put up for auction at the Stormwind Auction House.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, disjointed plot, individual arcs lack purpose, overarching theme is improperly explored, with the overpowered trope simultaneously harming and helping the narrative\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, a mix of boring and interesting artistic decisions, subpar fight choreography, about average actual animation, and detailed yet meaningless character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, the side cast is barely investigated, the minor characters are inconsequential, Ainz Ooal Gown stagnates very early, and the dichotomy between him and his servants has no foundation\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, great ED, okay OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, Albedo is amazing, the rest of the cast is fun though not around enough, and the overpowered action was really entertaining\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

People just over exaggerate because of all the bad things it manages to avoid doing \r\nYou have this guy who allegedly gets stuck in an MMORPG and has no way to get back to the real world so he gathers information about his new world and (for some reason) tries to findif anyone else is stuck in the game also. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Fair\\n\r\nThe art was fair, it was not amazing or bad. there was a few fight scenes here and there and they were animated decently. \\n\r\nThey also use CG in a few scenes but it actually looked okay\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI honestly dont remember much of it and i just finished watching it. I skipped most of the opening and ending but i do remember that the opening was kind of good but in the end skippable because it was just okay\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Poor\\n\r\nThroughout the 13 episodes of season 1 (plus the first 2 episodes of season 2) we never find out much about this Momonga who is allegedly stuck in the game, and they never show the real world for contrast or show any reason or desire for him to go back to it. \\n\r\nOn top of that he is surrounded by NPCs come to life and they have no backstory or relateable motivations. they were programmed to love and worship the MC and that is what they do\\n\\n\r\nBasically its like these are the characters and these are their traits. I felt no attachment to them. Infact if some of them died it would not be a big deal and I think even Momonga wouldnt mind\\n\r\nThey are just tools for the story and they are just tools he uses\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters are not that memorable as characters. you can remember Albedo who was kinda erotic and remember the demon in a suit coz he looked cool but it would be the same if you just saw a poster of them\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fair\\n\r\nThe story was kind of interesting as like many stuck in game stories are. \\n\r\nFirst 2 episodes were kind of just introducing the characters and alleged premise so they are really boring. i actually dropped it for a long time after the uninteresting first 2... but dont stop watching there because things start moving in episode 3\\n\r\nI really feel like overlord would make a great game but as an anime it was lacking something. (i dont want to say passion, emotion or mystery because those sound cliche)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good\\n\r\nOverlord is actually really enjoyable like the equivalent of watching someone play a video game\\n\\n\r\nOverral: Fair \\n\r\nOverlord season 1 feels like a simple prologue and it has the capacity to grow into something nice (or maybe its just an advertisement to go buy the light novel)\\n\r\nseason 1 is not bad but its not great either. I definitely recommend people to watch it if they have free time or really want a stuck in game anime\\n",

            "content": "Otaku power fantasy #doesitreallymatter - overlord\r\nOverlord is the anime that was adapted from a LN which is adapted from a WN (web novel), and frankly it suffers from almost all of the problem of a WN or LN power fantasy. So your enjoyment lies entirely on whether you are the type to like a PF or the type that hates it. And I hate PF from the bottom of my heart, so this review would mostly focus on how bad a PF is.\r\nA bit of background first, Japanese WN adapted LN usually have the problem of being a power fantasy, famous (or infamous) examples includeSAO (though Kawahara said he would fix some of it) and Mahouka (which the author would throw a tantrum like a 5 year old every time someone says something remotely bad about his work). This trend originate from the harshness of Japanese society, due to the strict system and poor economy, so people wish to escape from the suppressive feeling of their daily life. Understandable, but it makes for poor entertainment for the rest of the globe who watch their works.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3\\n\\n\r\nFirst good point, the premise, a man becomes a skeleton overlord ruling over a lair of evil servants and try to take over the world. Man that premise seems so refreshing in a sea of mediocre works, it would be dark, exciting, awesome and etc. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then you get trolled...\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is not a complete lie, but it is a lot boring than you imagined it to be. First thing that should tip you off this is a very bad PF is the fact none of the enemy poses a remote threat to Ainz and his OP servants, that right, NONE! It took the author, 4 to 5 books to introduce a character that can maybe beat one of his servants if his servant doesn't wear any armor and only throw super weak spells while this character suit up in full gear and unleashe her full might. (Man I wonder who will win....) This is the beginning, later on we would get entire arcs just so at the end of it all we could, suck Ainz's non-existent penis and see how \"awesome\" he is (or his servants is, but they are all his yes-man so it's the same)\\n\\n\r\nThis is like watching fully armed soldiers killing kindergarten students and telling you to cheer since it is an awesome fight. And it is as boring as it goes. It is conflict and competition that make a story, and since Ainz don't have a rival I guess there is no story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\\n\r\nMeet Ainz and his group of yes-man that have little in life beyond kissing his ass. There is the pretty vampire (who is totally into him), the succubus (who is totally into him), the dragon butler, the demon butler, the cute mascot twin night elves, the big bug thing, a group of maids, and a bunch of other minions who are not important enough to get a lot of screen time. And all of them are loyal to the core (with little other purpose in life), which fixes the problem of possible betrayal that every other dark lord need to face. Yep life is sweet for Ainz beyond the fact he doesn't have a penis.\\n\\n\r\nAinz for all of his amazing Powers and other things, is a beta pussy harem protagonist with the new \"how to be a emotionless robot\" input that came from Tatsuya and the MC of AZ (the egg guy). Two wrong doesn't make a right, and beyond his appearance, Ainz have little separating him from the pool of mediocre MCs. \\n\\n\r\nThe guardians of the floor and by extension all the other servants serve only as his yes-man, with little personality beyond that. Every time they show some individuality, it goes \"nope I should be a slave, fuck personality, lol\". Ainz is this thing that is completely blocking their development, which is a shame, cause they would make much more entertaining MC than he would. And before you ask, NO, quirks are not personality, they are quirky, but still 2 or 1-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters serve as jobbers and ants to die or gaze in awe at Ainz, with little influence on the plot if any at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt, sound- 9, 7\\n\r\nDon't really care but it is madhouse, so good job for them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3\\n\r\nI did a review for the novel as well, and I hold my view from back then, it is a decent PF, I just hate PF and think it is cancer of novels. It's like a blowjob, empty pleasure, and that is all it ever will be.",

A hardcore gamer who spent his time playing a video game is sad that its shutting down and friends aren't there to be with him on its final moments He is the leader of a top guild and only people can who can join are those who have a job outside the game. Seriously a top guild whose requirements are have a job in reality.(yeah wish fulfillment) So the gamer gets trapped in in game and Doesn't even try to figure out why heis stuck.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 0\\n\r\nThe characters in Overlord are Momonga your typical Gary Stu he is very powerful, his friends adore him. The females Deuteragonist are in love with him and his enemies fear him. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are your token loli shailtear bloodfallen who loves Momonga and is a vampire. \\n\\n\r\nAlbedo a succubus who is in love and obsessed with momonga \\n\\n\r\nThose were the only two worth mentioning because the rest are easily forgetful and most of the time  story focuses on these three.\\n\\n\r\nSound:0\\n\r\nWhat sound? Most of the time I was watching this anime I didn't notice any music score so there is no noteworthy music in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nThe art is sup par The background was awful and only good art was on certain characters and episode 1 was the only episode with decent art I guess  budget for art just went to that episode\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:0 \\n\r\nI guess we can never get a game anime that has actual good characters with character development  instead of the fan fiction that is overlord.  I never enjoy gary stus because there is no story just the author pandering to himself and wishing how his ideal self should be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 0\\n\r\nThe target for anime like this are otakus that play mmo or have no girlfriend because they can  project themselves as momonga and having a harem. being very powerful and your comrades respect you and lastly enemies fearing you.  I would recommend this to those who like sword art online and  mahouka koukou no rettousei because they are both fan fiction and wish fulfillment.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What do you get with Overlord? A good, enjoyable anime which is one of the seasons best (not really hard this time) also if you long for some good ol' overpowered main character fighting - this show is for you.\r\nThe story centers around a guy (do we know his name?) who is the last remaining player (?) in the online game YGGDRASIL. His alter ego is Momonga, later Ainz Ooal Gown, a powerful undead Necromancer and also the guildmaster of the  successful guild Great Tomb of Nazarick. The other members have already left the game long ago, but left him with their belongings andalso the personal created NPCs, which serve as guardians of the Tomb (guild hall).\\n\\n\r\nLike other people already wrote the story takes some time to get going, probably even another season, nevertheless is interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIt starts like this: On the day the game is supposed to shut down, Momonga can't log off - he is trapped (how original). Now everything centers around managing the guild and helping NPCs while finding out why he's trapped and if there are others like him.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally i think the characters are the shows weakest point owed to the 13-episode size. We have the player, the vampire gothic loli Shalltear (who the fuck designed her vampire form?!) and the submassiv loving demon girl Albedo - the rest isn't worth mentioning in fact apart from the battle maid Narberal you won't see much of them. Character development ? Nope.\\n\\n\r\nThe show ends with this typical \"pressed content preview\", you know that one were they lay the rootes for a 2nd season without promising anything. If it doesn't get one i probably wouldn't watch it again - let's hope it sells well\\n",

Pure bliss from the opening to the end of every episode (and what a great opening it is, by the way).\r\nThe protagonist finds himself in a new world - and a new, undead body. He brings with himself his sensibilities from his own life, but finds he no longer actually feels the moral compulsions of his previous humanself, making his character an interesting mix of ruthless and mindful. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a strong focus on exploring a new and hostile world, and finding the differences between the world's \"systems\" and what the protagonist is used to. On the other hand, he doesn't start off weak and have to level/power up to, but instead arrives as a supreme being defying the laws of the world. That's a unique angle I don't remember seeing before in this kind of series.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that'll improve this series is a second season.",

            "content": "Firstly, let me tell you my main problem with Overlord : its the setting. The thing with this kind of world is, you can never take it seriously, its just a game. I was tired of hearing stuff like \"You used a shop item?\" in the middle of a fight. I am not saying there is anything wrong with an anime's story based around a game, but when that game means next to nothing of significance and there you know that even if someone from the protagonist's side die, they are gonna be revived, its simply not as much fun. That's why I liked thefirst 14 episodes of SAO to an extent and literally despised the second half. Overlord, in my opinion, suffers from a similar problem.\\n\\n\r\nThere have been an abundance of anime releasing these days whose story is completely based on an MMORPG world created by the author. Sword Art Online, Log Horizon, NGNL you name it. This genre has become one of the most popular in recent years but... let me ask you one thing : have any of these MMORPG anime been done really well?\\n\\n\\n\r\nDifferent people would have different answer to the question I just asked and that's to be expected. Different anime watchers will have different tastes and will like different genres. \\n\r\nBut if I was to answer that question, my answer would be \"NO\". None of such anime could be called amazing. They have gained tremendous popularity but as far as story, character development and other major things go, anime of this genre have been somewhat disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nOverlord is another addition to that fast growing bundle of anime and like most of those other, Overlord is good at best; it has never had that awe factor that we search for in anime. It's been interesting, no doubt, but that's all it's been. It will most probably keep you interested, believe me. This is the only summer anime that I watched EVERY WEEK without any delays till the last episode. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nI don't think I need to go into the details of the synopsis since you already know about it, but if I were to rate Overlord's story, it's nothing new. It's just that cliche story of our protagonist being stuck in an imaginary gaming world. If there is one thing different about Overlord's story, it's that the protagonist is already at the top of the game and he is suddenly moved to another world. It's nothing complex really, not that a good story necessarily needs to be complex.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nThe art of Overlord is good. I don't know what more to say about it. The character designs are distinct and the setting has been described pretty well with the art. As for the animation, it's been good too, mostly remaining consistent. I won't go as far as to say that the animation was amazing but it was pretty decent, nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8.5/10\\n\r\nNow, this could be the best part about Overlord. When you think about Overlord, the first thing that'll pop in your mind is the opening; it's amazing. It won't be a stretch to say that Overlord has the best opening of all summer anime of 2015. I guess you could say that none of the Summer 2015 anime even come close to it's opening. The ending was meh. It never caught my attention. \\n\r\nThe OST has been good too but nothing to make a particular fuss about, considering many of the recent anime do have really good soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nLet's start with the protagonist, Lord Momonga. I dont know how to describe him. He has kind of a split personality. He is your normal teenage boy at times while he is thinking(Thus far, his appearance hasnt been revealed in the anime) sometimes and when he is in public, he becomes a considerate yet somewhat cold personality who is the ruler of Yggdrasil.\\n\r\nAlbedo and Shalltear fight for Momonga's love all the time and its sometimes interesting. The other supporting cast is also quite interesting and entertaining.\\n\r\nBut, there has been no real character development and that's the reason the score for the characters is 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nIt was an odd ride. It's never gotten boring for me in although, I wasn't awed by it many times, except a couple. The MC is overly overpowered since he's the Supreme Ruler and all. It's entertaining and I would definitely watch a second season if there is one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nThere are lots of anime I give a score of 7. They are such anime who are good but have potential to have been much better which hasnt been reached. I didn't expect Overlord to be an anime which would give me the feels and it didn't end up being one. If you have spare time on your hands, you could give this anime a try. Who knows, you might find it to be a good watch.",

            "content": "Even uttering the words \"MMO anime\" triggers a lot of violent and ambivalent thoughts among the community in 2015. After a slew of shows of dubious merit based on playing a video game, or being trapped inside of it- it's understandable that the community is a bit gunshy on the concept.\r\nRest assured though, that anime with the Madhouse tag on it are in good hands, as it's more often than not a high quality and faithful production. \r\nOverlord is not your nouveau Sword Art Online. Overlord is not your No Game No Life, and it's most certainly not .Hack://Sign. \r\nArtwork and Animation: 8\r\nAgain, Madhouse producedanime are almost always synonymous with quality. Great consistency in character detail and motions, and some very pretty 3D spellcasting that looks a lot like it was pulled from Death Parade. The character designs are great, their movements fluid, and even a 3D CGI dragon can't put this one down in the dirt! \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7\\n\\n\r\nSatoshi Hino, despite all of the roles I haven't seen him in, really kills the Momonga/Ainz character. A dual commanding and menacing, and 'normal' inner monologue voice sells the real live and in-game versions of Momonga well. He's backed up by a plethora of talent in Yumi Hara as Albedo, Sumire Uesaka portraying Shalltear, and Manami Numakura as the cold Narberal. \\n\\n\r\nOn a musical note: typical fantasy game stylings, with a healthy mix of EDM, especially the groovy ending song. Nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 \\n\\n\r\nMomonga/Ainz is our main, in the real world a no life salaryman, but ingame, a maxed out, god-class skeletal mage with powers noobs can only dream of. A fearsome combatant in any arena, guild leader, and general badass, he's seen and done everything that the MMO Yggdrasil has to offer.  Apprehensive about his new surroundings and the unknown dangers it may hold, Ainz takes a cautious approach to this new scape and acts logically when presented with dangers: buffing the crap out of himself and out thinking the goons after him. But he's not above trolling them a little. He's rather catlike- playing with his food before he eats it. \\n\\n\r\nNext up is the fan favorite Albedo: the NPC turned sentient, slavishly devoted guardian of Ainz. As the boss of the other NPCs of the guild castle \"Nazarick\", Albedo holds considerable sway over the other characters, including Ainz- partly because of her obsequious treatment of her unrequited lover (due to a mix-up in her NPC coding caused by Old Gregg). She's fiercely protective of him, and thinks any attention paid to him by a female character other than herself is a dire insult to her affections- to which she will fight to the death to protect.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, we have the ice queen Pleiades Battle Maid Narberal. She serves as Ainz's escort while adventuring, and absolutely despises humans, seen by the undead who populate Nazarick as less than contemptible slime. Kind of like Zubat. Humans are a lot like Zubat to the denizens of Nazarick. \\n\\n\r\nRounding out our important ladies is Shalltear Bloodfallen, an extremely pretentiously named pint sized vampress. As childish as her body indicates, Shalltear also has an inexplicable crush on Ainz's lifeless bony body, and is even more bloodthirsty than Albedo. She also happens to be the most capable fighter in the castle, and the most dangerous. \\n\\n\r\nOverlord does have quite a few characters introduced at the beginning, though it's quickly apparent which ones will actually matter throughout the course of the show. Most of them are either common fantasy monsters, strange fantasies of players, and other \"lol, MMO\" types. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe story is broken up into several distinct arcs- the first among them introducing the character of Momonga/Ainz and his place in the new world, after being transported in from Yggdrasil. It starts on a small scope and scale, and gradually gets more complex and larger as Ainz gains new knowledge about the world, and his influence spreads throughout. \\n\\n\r\nAs it progresses, what we see through Ainz's eyes thickens alongside the plot. This show isn't about trying to escape from a death game, or even about playing a game really. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, and this is true for Overlord. If one was not directly told that Momonga was an MMO player and a near constant usage of gaming terms spewing forth from his lifeless lips, this would come off as just a fantasy series- which works in its favor. The \"gameplay\" is not important, as the story takes the forefront. \\n\\n\r\nAfter probably three episodes, I wasn't even thinking about a player playing the game, but rather what kind of adventures that this character would get into, and thankfully that's what Overlord delivered. There are quite a few laughs in here, some serious moments, and some well choreographed fights, all with that delicious Madhouse taste. Props to the original material though, for being engaging enough in humor, action, and story to keep it interesting. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI liked that instead of lording his way around from day one that Ainz was rightfully cautious about exploring and testing his magic, compatriots, and abilities in the new world. He played as a real person would- instead of rushing into unknown circumstances and possible game ending death, he sits back and tests things on a small scale, questions others about how the world works, what's effective, and what's not, and then chooses to strategically act upon said information gathering. Unlike many Gary Stu style protagonists who start from nothing and work their way up without tension, we know from the very beginning that Ainz is a maxed out character with untold powers. The tension comes not from Ainz's lack of ability or fear for his life, but instead ignorance of the world at large, and treachery from his own ranks - beings that were, in Yggdrasil, powerful enough to bring down even max ranked players like himself. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nMy pick for anime of the season. This was by far the least disappointing show, and definitely exceeded expectations and proved me wrong of being \"Madhouse's SAO\". \\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a gamer-feel for an anime without stupid plot contrivances and utter failures in writing as in other shows of the MMO persuasion, this is worth a try. As a pure power fantasy series, it's excellent.",

            "content": "Obligatory spoiler warning because Overlord is a masterpiece that must be experienced first-hand. So apparently what Sword Art Online needed was for Kirito to be a skeleton wizard and Asuna to be Mahouka's Miyuki. The concept of this series is the same as what most people are already familiar with; A guy is playing a game, and then he's suddenly trapped in it because of some unexplained reason. Overlord does absolutely nothing original aside from having a few aesthetic and irrelevant differences from the rest, and people seem to consider it as a brilliant masterpiece because it apparently managed to appeal to those who wantedto play as the bad guy in a roleplaying forum. \\n\\n\r\nThe original LN has some pretty nice art and cool character designs. That's about the only good thing about the series as a whole- Everything else, including the writing, ranges from mediocre to genuinely awful. Apparently when Madhouse realized that they were going to be animating One Punch Man, they saw Overlord's amazing budget saving potential- Most notably, zooming in the unmoving skeleton man's face so they don't have to animate anything at all while he's talking. The animation is really subpar, and there's a lot of terrible looking CGI in the show while it's not focusing on Momonga's face. It only truly picks up in quality at the very end of the series, and even then, it doesn't manage to be very impressive. The OST is very forgettable to the point that I might even consider it one of the worst in the shows I've seen- Basically take whatever Yasuharu Takanashi does and make it even more generic than some of his worst works. That about describes it. Visually and aurally, it's definitely below average.\\n\\n\r\nBut surely despite all that mediocrity, the writing must be amazing. After all, the main character is a skeleton wizard and leads an army of Saturday morning cartoon villains. Despite the series attempting to present the protagonist and his group as evil, the best it does is having them kill completely unlikable characters that barely get more than a minute of screen time. That's some evil right there.\\n\\n\r\nMomonga is an incredibly boring character. Aside from providing exposition after exposition through his internal monologues from his experience with the MMO when describing what's happening on the screen, he really does not have much personality. His entire character motivation is to find out about the world he's trapped in, just like the viewers- Basically, it can be summed up that his motivation pretty much does not exist because it simply exists as a parallel to the plot itself. Furthermore, he's very powerful- Apparently overpowered MCs are acceptable as long as they're not designed like teenage boys, which makes it admitedly harder for neckbeards to relate to. But Momonga's degree of power exceeds even that- He's powerful to the point that nearly nothing poses a serious threat to him. This is a problem in storytelling because no conflict is ever relevant- Momonga's powerful enough to just solve it easily without any effort. One could say that it was the writer's intent to make Momonga seem powerful and impressive, but it doesn't even do that correctly. Power is relative, so when Momonga just one-shots random fodders that spend more time boasting about themselves than actually showing what they're capable of, it's not impressive in the slightest. A key example of this happens in the fourth episode, where the bad guy summons what is supposedly a super-powerful monster, and when Momonga kills it, it's supposed to look impressive. But the audience doesn't know what this monster was even capable of, outside of the bad guy boasting about its supposed strength, so it just feels completely flat. \\n\\n\r\nWhile he makes all these unnecessary convoluted plans about how he would spread his name around the world to catch the attention of those who might have been trapped in the world like him, he essentially just solves all his problems through his raw power. His problems are more self-imposed than anything due to his tendency to be incredibly paranoid due to his fear of something that \u201cmight\u201d be more powerful than him. And to make it worse, he just outright contradicts himself near the end of the show by risking his life in an unnecessary one-on-one combat due to his ego. Brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to make it more brilliant, there really was no reason for the MMO backdrop at all- It's a completely unnecessary addition. The series could have worked just as well with Momonga being a genuine evil skeleton lich in a genuine fantasy world instead of \u201csome guy trapped in a MMO world that became REAL.\u201d All this does, essentially, is to give an excuse for some parts of poor storytelling to exist, such as exposition dumps from Momonga based on his experience with the MMO, and floor guardians being completely, unquestionably loyal to him for no reason. The series never references back to the real world, so it might as well not exist- And since the audience has no idea about the said MMO, it only emphasizes the point about this just being a pointless hook, and a justification for awful storytelling that relies on the backwards idea of \u201cTell, don't show.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAll the floor guardians and Momonga's lackies are uninteresting and flat- They have some interesting designs, especially the maids, but all their personality is about as interesting as a rock. First few episodes make it clear that they absolutely adore Momonga, and they spend their entire screen time thinking and/or talking about how great Momonga is. One of the worst examples is Albedo, who spends every moment of her screen time doing just all that. She never does anything outside of praising Momonga, whether he's in the same scene as her or not- Comparing this to Mahouka, she's basically this series' equivalent of Miyuki if Miyuki did absolutely nothing outside of praising Tatsuya, which makes Albedo far, far more annoying. Remember how people absolutely despised Miyuki because she wouldn't shut up about her onii-sama? There's an exact same character here, if arguably worse, but Albedo gets a free pass because her target of affection looks like a skeleton wizard and has a fanservice design. \\n\r\nThere's also nothing interesting about floor guardians' interaction with one another, as all they talk about is how great Momonga is and how they should do their job and serve him. I guess the assumption the author made was that his target audience was so stupid that they needed to be reminded of the obvious every scene, every line. \\n\\n\r\nAnother awful aspect of this series is the pacing- It's always painfully slow. A lot of people seem to defend slow pacing by claiming that it's character development, but there's no development. I'm not sure where people got the idea that character interaction equate to character development, but I guess just listening to pointless filler dialogue gives some people a false impression that something must be going on even though nothing is really going on. This is especially noticeable in the episodes where Momonga teams up with a lower class group of adventurers to complete a quest- The show spends several episodes attempting to develop this group of nobodies by giving them cardboard personalities, but in the end it's completely pointless. They're not likable because they haven't really done anything, their interaction with Momonga is pretty bland, and the series makes it clear that they're not important to begin with. And surprise, it turns out they were completely irrelevant. Amazing character development for characters that never mattered with pointless, drawn-out character interaction that did nothing for everyone in the cast. \\n\\n\r\nIf all that wasn't enough, the series doesn't even tie itself up properly- The last part of the show involves one of Momonga's minions, who is just as powerful as he is, suddenly being brainwashed through the power of plot convenience because the author thought an actually threatening conflict was needed around this time in the series. Despite taking all the safety precautions with all his power previously, Momonga decides that he needs to make a point about how he's the leader, even though there was absolutely no need for him to do so when all the floor guardians already adore him unquestionably. Basically, Momonga is not very intelligent- Everything goes as he plans because of his raw power and having so many tools to work with- Not because he's actually skilled at strategizing. It also should be noted that this last part of the show was incredibly grating, because the brainwashed minion still sucks up to Momonga while still opposing him. Really, Overlord?\\n\\n\r\nSo to summarize what happened in this entire cour: First quarter spends its time on just introductions on characters that have no personality whatsoever outside of all sucking up to Momonga in perfect unison. Second quarter is about Momonga effortlessly beating an army of literal nobodies that won't matter for the rest of the season. Third quarter is about Momonga effortlessly beating an army of zombies and two bad guys that won't matter for the rest of the season. And finally, the last quarter is about Momonga beating a brainwashed minion only because he handicapped himself even though it would've been just as effortless because he's a poorly written character. I can't even really claim that this is a pacing issue with the show itself- This is more like a pacing issue of the novels because the show covers fair amount of the novels. Remember that statement about how MMO setting is used as nothing more than an exposition tool? Yeah, it's apparently being used as a filler as well in the novels, explaining things that nobody gives a shit about to pad out the content. \\n\\n\r\nI really don't understand the praise for this series- Aside from simple aesthetic differences, this series has all the flaws that all generic light novels have. The MC is just yet another generic Stu protagonist that has next to no character motivation, the side characters are cardboard cutouts that constantly suck up to Momonga only because they were quite literally made to do so, and the storytelling is a complete mess where the MMO backdrop is only used as a convenient excuse to make way for exposition through Momonga's inner monologues. Instead of being from a perspective of a genuine evil villain, it's from a perspective of a generic MC that only looks like a villain with underlings who are about as laughably as evil as Akame ga Kill's antagonists. As an adaptation, it fails- And as for the series as a whole, it's just another generic fantasy novel with a gimmick element as a hook. There's literally nothing positive about the series, aside from the LN's art and character designs, which all just seem like a waste of talent and effort. Both of which are not present in the adaptation or the writer. \\n\\n\r\nThe spin-off series, Ple Ple Pleiades is actually far more entertaining. Go watch that instead.",

            "content": "Overlord, as the rank itself was an outstanding rank to symbolize the tremendous power of the user. Unfortunately the rank failed to save Momonga from trapped in a world of fantasy game, thus there is only one thing that you can do. Time for some real action. He himself will pass the judgments upon Yggdrasil. Which future will Momonga bring? A bright future filled with joy or a living hell full with horrors, pain, anguish, and punishment. Regarded as the highest of the Almighty 41 Supreme Beings of the Great Tomb of Nazarick. This is the right time to conquer Yggdrasil, a world of fantasygame. Anyone who tried to resist or oppose him shall face the ultimate humiliation and loss, to suffer for eternally. \\n\\n\r\nReview \\n\r\nThe series has been adapted out of Overlord manga written by Maruyama Kugane which is not yet finished and still ongoing. This manga received a very well welcome when it was published for the first time. By no time, Overlord manga has already successful hooked a lot of fans. However, the series is still far from succeeding. The glory will be decided upon when the author ensures not to rush the storyline and naturally follow its own pace. The sole purpose is to justify the right of Manga and the Novel. Do not misunderstand me, this series has a really great potential. It is a fact that you must know. Anyways, this series is already exceeding my expectations by proven that it one of the best anime in summer seasons. You might miss a few of the deeper plot elements, but it is still an enjoyable and often times the story is rather buffoonery. Nonetheless, this series is standing victorious over the field.\\n\\n\r\nThe series fight scene is rather excessive in violence, bloody, and such a bloody rain in term of gore. To put it clearly, it\u2019s rather a brutal way to been presented. I did not expect this since I\u2019ve been put my mind that this series probably will be censored the scene. Regretful, it does not apply. For people who kind of new to anime series, and anime fans who can\u2019t stand a pure bloody gore, you probably will not like this one aspect. The rating for this series is R - 17+ (violence & profanity). Keep this on your mind. Gore fans, this is a birthday gift for you. Recommended audience for this series is adult and teenagers who are mature enough to evaluate. Anyway, if some parents trying to consider watching this series with your kids or putting it simply kid underage, please never do.  Kid underage tend to imitate what they have see in the program show even though it just animation. Kids are basically pure. They still do not know anything about adult world. Worse case, they may have trauma, laugh if you want but people should take this matter more seriously for their own goodness. In the end, undeniably Overlord is still a good series to watch. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nMomonga perfectly define the best figure for main villain and undeniably brilliant to be disliked, much less hated. He's such a manly man although his humanity is slowly fading away. His skills are a significant to assess the abilities each of his comrade to the fullest. To some extent though, Momonga does not really mind being insulted by the enemy purely because want to see for him selves, how superior it is the enemy powers and abilities. Momonga also is able to intelligently manipulate people without even shows his powerful demonic aura. With Momonga abilities, knowledge and experience he had go through, the series allows one's imagination to run wild thinking how superior Momonga existence itself.  That\u2019s one of the beauties from Overlord. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\r\nThe animation for this series is very good and flawless. The artwork is colorful and each of the character designs is very well done. Concept of creating a non human for the main lead is also fresh scene once in a while. The Great Tomb of Nazarick also carefully designed and each floor has a different design as well as the keepers. Bluntly, I seriously like Momonga. The way He cast a simple magic trick or a powerful magic attack make it as realistic as it was definitely real. In other words, with a short brief of how his power works, we can accept it easily without too much thinking. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening series is very catchy with a rather interesting lyric. While the Eds has symbolize the purity of Albedo.  These two Op and Eds is actually quite a good song. The sound is slowly embracing us gently and I quite impressed by the incredible sound effects in this series. Indeed such an incredible effort by the voice actors, Op and Eds vocalist to keep up the best performance to date. The series music section deems another one extra point. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\r\nBut what makes it so great is the story of the game itself. Little biased with a previous concept such as Sword Art Online (SAO) and Log Horizon (LH) but amazingly arise and ascend amongst them. In my own opinion, the story, the sound and adding with art animation together were creating such a masterpiece. The only problem is our hero does not have skin, blood or any human organs. He is totally undead beings. The skeleton body is kind of cool, but highly no fan girls will attracted to our main lead. Fortunately, our main lead shines bright through the ugliness. No need to worry about romance; he still has Albeldo who's totally love him deeply and the other girls to be with him at times of thick and thin. I'm not quite sure why but he was the only person I doesn\u2019t mind getting harem. Magically, I'm supporting him. For my second problems with this show is the number of episodes. The episode in the series is way too short. I do not mean the episode length, rather why this series only has 13 episodes per series that make it such a huge disappointment. Anyways, I still recommended this series as it was highly entertaining and give you quite a ride up to the finish line.\\n\\n",

The show quickly sets itself apart from its contemporaries by giving us a protagonist who plays the role of an antagonist and loves it. \r\nAfter a brief period of confusion, the easewith which Ainz/Momon takes charge of his servants and powers is refreshing to see. Every move he makes defines his character as a person who is a veteran of MMORPG games. And while he uses his tactics as he would in a game, he knows the consequences of his actions and accepts them without hesitation. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Music of the show compliment each other brilliantly, and the characters are a good mix of perverse, lovable and obedient. If you've ever had a dream of ruling your own world, then this show will make an excellent guide.",

            "content": "Anime adaptation revolving around RPG and MMORPG themed worlds can usually be a hit or miss. As a fan of MMORPG games in real life, there should be expectations with the world fiction such as the monsters, mechanics, story, setting, and overall execution. Where does that put Overlord? A bit overboard? Underwhelming? It\u2019s not really like that but Overlord is the type of show that can be hard to judge.\r\nThe series is based on a light novel that originated from a Japanese web novel. The original source has about 9 volumes although the adaptation by Madhouse studio consists of only a single cour. (13 episodes)That usually sets off a red flag with the story pacing. And it isn\u2019t wrong either as the first two or so episodes carries a weak weight on itself. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in the online world of Yggdrasil, we meet Momonga, a salary-man who apparently tried to log out at the very last minute. Things go a bit wary and he gets stuck in-game as an online avatar in the form of a \u2018skeletal lich\u2019. It also just happens so that the avatar is also a very powerful wizard. What\u2019s more is that the NPC around him also exhibit their own personalities as if they are alive and have minds of their own. Essentially, the story marks its territory at the Tomb of Nazarick. The first two episodes establishes Momonga (or going by his in-game name Ainz Ooal Gown) as someone with immense powers. Now, I have a problem with overrated characters and Ainz is no exception to this. The show demonstrates his invulnerability to poison along with elite fighting skills, weapon set, and even an intellectual mind as the story progresses. However, the series also takes a few different turns. Monomga still display his human traits as he interacts with the NPCs he encounters. Apparently, they serve him like he is their God so it takes time for him to adapt. Momonga\u2019s personality also becomes suppressed and he displays cunning behavior throughout the show. However, I would not say that he is an arrogant character as he is quite loyal, honest, and respects his servants. As the story progresses, there is a lack of feeling he develops towards death. (Given the irony that he himself is a skeleton, a personification of death)\\n\\n\r\nThe show can be taken to light from different perspectives. From the perspective of a light novel reader and adaptation, it\u2019s easy to say that the series focuses quite a bit on Momonga. Almost every episode highlights his role, personality, or overall character. The relationship building and associations he establishes with other characters are also played out in a variety of ways. This can be seen with the seductive Albedo who is utterly in love with him. Even among the Floor Guardians of Momonga\u2019s guild, she is one of the most loyal and obsessive towards Momonga. It doesn\u2019t help that the show also introduces rivals such as Shalltear who shows sexual tendencies. The show\u2019s initial impressions sets off this red flag as it almost makes fun of itself. It also introduces other characters that each get a little bit of his or her screen time such as the Mare and Aura twins, butler Sebas, Cocytus, and intelligent demon Demiurge. In relation to Momonga, they all seemingly show an undying love and respect for him; just expressed definitely from one way or another. As a bit of character driven story, this is really a miss as the characters are unappealing from first impressions. Only Momonga can be legitimately interesting as we want to find out his potential as a guild master and person in real life. It makes us wonder what he is capable of with his new role and how these new changes can apply to his character.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder course of the show opens up realms of possibilities. Like most MMORPG worlds, Yggdrasil seems to be resourceful with landscapes, guilds, and monsters. The story mechanics of the series is explained such as weaponry, skills, and monsters that exhibit its world. It\u2019s nothing original when compared to some other MMORPG style shows. In the past, series such as Sword Art Online and Log Horizon also has fantasy game mechanics; albeit in different fashion. For Overlord, it slowly does this while unraveling the main course of the story. There\u2019s also some common monsters you\u2019ll usually find in fantasy worlds such as goblins, undead beings, and even angels. What makes Overlord stands out a little bit more is that the show is more than just about conquering and survival. I think the key word is the title itself, \u201cOverlord\u201d. This is because Momonga/Ainz is actually trying to take over the world as the new ruler. So in a way, he wants to be an overlord despite his lack of inexperience. This is clearly shown throughout the show with his intentions.\\n\\n\r\nAs both a character and story driven series, it will definitely takes patience and adapting to get used to the show. I actually recommend re-watching some scenes to get a better understanding of the series\u2019 intentions at few cases. Examples such as Momonga\u2019s lack of remorse towards death, Albedo\u2019s distasteful view on humans, and other ideals makes the show appealing. It makes the NPCs feel real. In addition, the game mechanics such as spells, weaponry, magical items, and potion making really brings out its fantasy realm to life. There\u2019s some good amount of action as well although fairly predictable with Momonga\u2019s newfound skills. In addition, the story also makes it clear that he isn\u2019t the only character that matters. Others he encounters and associates with such as the Sword of Darkness and his own battle maids get their additional spotlight too. The story also introduces antagonists with their own independent malevolent intentions. It shouldn\u2019t take too long for viewers to realize that Overlord isn\u2019t just Momonga\u2019s personal show. \\n\\n\r\nBut for all its creativity, the series suffers much from the over emphasis of Momonga. It focuses far too much on his character while adding the ridiculousness of his servants\u2019 love for him. The first two episodes will likely be a make or break for most viewers as the feeling of an MMORPG game feels isolated. There\u2019s also die-hard comedy with character rivalries, expressions, and overall tone of their generalization. I will say the show has a diverse cast of the characters though. And given the set up for the world, it introduces plenty of important ones to bring the best of Momonga. However, be very aware of the pacing of this story. The first half really tests the patience of the viewers despite foreshadowing some future events and making small promises of improvement. While it\u2019s doing all of this, the comedy is also a hit or miss with its controversially timed scenarios. And lastly, it seems like the adaptation itself is more of a tease for viewers to \u201cread the novels\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse puts their work into this show\u2019s animation style. Taking place in such a fantasy world, the colors are focused on the characters rather than the background. Characters are diverse and decorated distinctively that makes them look unique. Momonga/Ainz is obviously the one that stands out the most with his skeletal avatar. When on the road, he takes the form of a dark warrior encased in an armor that makes him look like a badass hero. And that\u2019s really an underrated word. Among Momonga\u2019s followers, the term \u2018badass\u2019 can be applied to several characters with their designs such as Albedo, Shelltear, and the battle maid Nabe. There\u2019s also the monsters introduced that is classic to most MMORPG worlds. Human characters are created to look human and most of them gives the impressions of themselves as adventurers. As a fantasy adventure, the show is also no stranger to action and violence. In essence, the action is decent in terms of fantasy standards. It\u2019s the type of stuff you\u2019ll see often in MMORPG related games. On the other hand, the violence creates a grimmer tone. There\u2019s no censorship with the blood and even gore-like scenes during battle sequences. Fan service also exists with Albedo\u2019s role in the story. But what really brings out their characters is the expressions. It has the experimental feel when you see how they react as NPCs while displaying human traits.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want stereo music, then you got stereo music. Namely, the OP theme song is an intense beat to the ears while the ED theme always decorates itself with unorthodox imagery. The OST displays a familiar fantasy feel in terms of content. And for all that\u2019s worth, character voice mannerism plays some key roles to make their characters into life. Momonga is actually one of the less noticeable characters for his voice because he sounds similarly like a human. On the other hand, the NPCs has a distinctive voice with their character roles. These voice diversity ranges from Albedo\u2019s seductiveness, Sheltear\u2019s aggressiveness, Sebas\u2019 sophisticated personality, or Nabes\u2019 loyalty. Clementine also gives off a presence of violence thanks to her sinister voice tone that persuades viewers to see how far she will go with her plans. Despite the large cast of characters, a strength of the show does come from the voices.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Overlord is more or less a refreshingly adventurous tale about a dude stuck in a skeletal avatar. It has functioning creative imagination with a colorful cast of characters. But when it comes to story, Overlord smells like a show with money in mind. In other words, it seems like an advertisement to the main novel. Director Naoyuki Itou puts his experience with other fantasy series at work and is a bit of a mixed bag. The adaptation isn\u2019t unique in either pacing or leaves strong first impressions. The fantasy world itself does generate a decent amount of interest when it comes to its core mechanics. But for a show like Overlord, it needed to hold together and makes sense. Sometimes it accomplishes that, other times it doesn\u2019t. Overlord is a show that needs improvement so pick your poison.\\n",

            "content": "[NO SPOILER REVIEW]\r\nLet me start this review by stating the reason I started watching Overlord; it had an 8.14 on MAL. I figured it must be pretty damn good, considering it was the second highest rated new anime of the Summer 2015 season. Wow was I wrong to assume that.\r\nStory: 3 - Poor\r\n      So this anime starts off with a really generic crappy MMO story, nothing amazing about it, nothing that hooks the viewer. However, you can't always judge an anime by its first few episodes. Gurren Lagann had a pretty slow beginning; as did Rokka no Yuusha and numerousother shows, so it's nothing to be ashamed about.\\n\\n\r\n   About 4 episodes in, I found myself thinking, \"Oh Boy, I bet something cool's gonna happen and this show is gonna become amazing to overcome it's lackluster start!\". But the story just never hooked me. Ever.\\n\\n\r\n Was there a story? \\n\r\nIt's been 10 minutes since I finished watching and already I'm beginning to wonder if there was any semblance of plot in that giant pile of garbage. But you know what? Story isn't everything. K-On!, WataMote, Gintama, all lack a straightforward and cohesive story, yet they are some of my favorite animes of all-time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 1 - Pathetic\\n\r\n   So in terms of artistic design, it's probably the worst anime I've ever seen. I am taking into account that it's 2015, and this anime looks like a garbage-tier animation product from 2001. Seriously the original Yu-Gi-Oh looks nicer than this. The CGI is actually great 100% of the time, 10% of the time. So I guess it has that going for it, which is nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3 - Poor\\n\r\n Was there an OST? I can't recall. I know the Opening was pretty good, and the Ending was so bad that I skipped it half the time. So all in all, sound is one of this anime's better aspects, because it makes itself scarce. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4 - Decent\\n\r\n  I feel like if I had read the manga, the characters might have been okay. But I didn't. I watched this anime. \\n\\n\r\nYou know how there are a plethora of extremely generic anime male leads with the same look and personality? Brown short-medium hair, with a plain looking face, and a very bland personality, with no real character at all? Well this anime tries to cover up its extremely generic male lead by putting him in this \"cool\" looking MMO Undead Lich skin. But it doesn't work. He's still generic. He's still uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters all have okay aesthetic designs (besides Shalltear, who is just stupid amounts of cliche), but we don't get to know any of them on a personal level, so the design is mostly wasted. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are interested in the really bad acting that pornstars do in the beginning of their videos (like pretending to be a pizza guy, a mailman, a nurse, an innocent virgin schoolgirl) then you will be pleased to know that 2 of the 3 \"main\" female side characters emulate this form of acting every time they're on the screen. Unfortunately, this kind of thing is not quite my cup of tea, so I'm only adding 5 points to this category's rating for it. \\n\\n\r\n  In terms of character development, there is none. I'm trying incredibly hard to think of one example where a character is different from how they were when they were introduced; but there is no example. I'm reaching for stars that don't exist. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2 - Dreadful\\n\r\n   I think watching this anime was the first time I seriously considered gouging my own eyeballs out. I might need some sort of third party confirmation on this; but was this show supposed to be funny? I felt like it was missing a laugh track. I didn't smile a single time during the course of the show, but I feel like it might have attempted to be funny a few times during each episode. \\n\\n\r\nAgain if somebody could PM me to confirm my suspicions that'd be great; because I honestly couldn't tell. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3 - Poor\\n\r\n   I have years of MMO experience. I regularly watch shows of the same genre. I am a straight male. I am this show's target demographic. I feel like my words have to carry some amount of weight here. And so this is my final verdict:\\n\\n\r\n  This show is a work of \"Art\"; if you consider \"Art\" smearing your own feces all over a wall and then furiously licking it up whilst listening to the the Barney Theme Song on loop for 5 to 6 hours.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS \r\nI, for the life of me, cannot understand how this show garners universal praise.  Simply put, this show was a total dumpster fire.  While I have many criticisms in the following incoherent rant I've prepared, I think it best to start with Momonga.  \r\nMomonga is one of the most egregious power fantasies I\u2019ve ever seen.  I say that as someone who doesn't hate power fantasies.  Indiana Jones and James bond are some of my favorite movie series, and they are both clear power fantasies.  The problem is Momonga's image as an infallible deity took precedenceover every other element of story telling.  Indy and Bond can lose battles and still win the war.  Obviously, they will beat the bad guy in the end, but there is tension in each skirmish.  They can be betrayed at any moment by one of their allies or captured and imprisoned by the antagonist with his superior forces and resources;  All leading up to the cathartic climax where the protagonist wins out with their superior wit and cunning, leaving the villain powerless against them.  Momonga can't do any of that.  He must be objectively more powerful than every other entity.  He must win every fight in a convincing fashion.  He cannot be betrayed.  The result is a bland, tension-less, meaningless mess.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s what I mean:  \\n\\n\r\nMomonga was just thrust into a new world where he understands almost none of the mechanics of combat.  Albeit lazy isekai writing, this creates a perfect opportunity for our MC to fulfill his boundless potential as he learns the mechanics of combat.  This would be great for satisfying, fast-paced yet believable progression.  We could have the satisfaction of an OP MC, and the satisfaction of seeing his power rapidly increase over time.  The creator squanders these opportunities entirely, as any perceived weakness in Momonga could interrupt the power fantasy.  Momonga easily beats any enemy that stands before him starting day 1.  He typically needlessly draws fights out on the flimsy excuse he\u2019s learning from them.  This usually amounts to him standing in front of his opponent for a while as their fear slowly grows and I slowly nod off.  Eventually, he effortlessly blows them away with a spell more powerful and complex than anything his opponents use in the fight.  What is there to learn when you know magic more powerful than any human in the entire world?  The writing fails miserably right at the outset.\\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019re off to a rough start, but things are still salvageable, right?  Even if no human can challenge him, we still have the floor guardians.  Momonga will have to use careful planning and wit to appease all these extremely powerful beings and prevent any treachery or betray\u2026 oh, never mind.  The floor guardians are nothing but his mindless servants.  In an rpg, it's almost a requirement to create a slave-master relationship between The MC and their party members.  If characters were able to act on their own agendas, you couldn't tailor your party as you see fit; hence party members tend to become empty pawns with which you can do as you please.  This isn't too egregious in rpgs purely for its convenience, but it's an awful device to use in un-interactive media.  The \"excellent cast and character relationships\" in Overlord are nothing more than an array of master-slave relationships with cosmetic personalities to hide a universal lack of agency.  The floor guardians are boring because of this.  There\u2019s no thoughtfulness required in their writing or weight to the conflicts between them, as Momonga can simply tell them to stop bickering with each other and they gladly and immediately comply.  This makes all character relationships in Nazarick superficial, regardless of how much effort is put into developing them.        \\n\\n\r\nIntelligence and situational awareness are two of the best characteristics in a power fantasy, that\u2019s why Indy is so keen at spotting traps and solving ancient puzzles.  That\u2019s why Bond\u2019s charisma and wit can weasel him out of any situation.  Overlord tries to make us think that Momonga is an intricate web weaver with these traits, but it uses dull scouting and intelligence missions instead of situations that require tactful writing and hold significance to the plot.  Appeasing these powerful and dangerous floor guardians was a great opportunity to put these traits to use in a worthwhile way.  Yet again, this great opportunity is immediately squandered in lieu of easy writing for an absolute power fantasy.   \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the Overlord gimmick.  This portion, apparently, makes the show interesting and unique.  I disagree.  Momonga\u2019s evil overlord gimmick is hardly even that.  I\u2019d call it an evil overlord aesthetic.  All he does throughout the show is help humans and tell his minions not to kill his human friends (they all gladly comply with no further thought or fuss, despite this notion being directly antithetical to all his servants\u2019 beliefs.  To reiterate:  Cosmetic personality, zero agency.).  All but one of the people he kills are plainly evil, and the one that\u2019s not evil isn\u2019t likable.  The only things that make him the \"villain\" are his largely unexplored world conquest goals and his lich body.    \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve ragged on momonga enough for now.  Let\u2019s talk about the plot:\\n\\n\r\n A decent amount of effort was put into crafting an interesting world by the author.  I can see why, if this is really what a person is in to, one could enjoy this anime.  It\u2019s a real shame a majority of worldbuilding in this show is done through monologues over still-frames.  Momonga is new to this world and needs to learn almost everything about it, but a believable excuse doesn't make the simplistic delivery any more enjoyable.  Monologue explanations should be a crutch used only when absolutely necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe almost praiseworthy worldbuilding falls flat on its face once we get to combat mechanics.  Overlord uses your typical MMO Isekai combat tropes.  Momonga has a high physical resistance so low-level melee monsters can\u2019t possibly hurt him.  How can our protagonist beat a monster with protection from up to 6th tier magic spells?  With a 7th tier magic spell, of course.  There\u2019s nothing lazier than a combat system that makes lower level characters powerless against higher level characters.  The obvious MMO combat mechanics contrasted heavily with the pure fantasy world the author created, and I never managed to be immersed in either.  \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of combat:  All the fights in this show are extremely boring.  Momonga typically does not move while fighting as a mage, and rarely moves as a warrior.  Ex:  His fight with clementine amounts to her hitting him for 10 minutes until he decides to just hug her to death.  Gripping stuff.  No tactics, no interesting strategies.  The only tension in that fight was acting on the walls of Clementine's arteries as she was unceremoniously squeezed to death.  Every fight in this season took place in an open field.  Environment never played an interesting role in strategy or actual combat.  Momonga\u2019s encounter with the Slain knights was in a clearing in the forest.  The Death Knight fought the Slain Theocracy in a convenient clearing in the middle of town.  Momonga\u2019s encounter with the Slain mage was in a field outside the town, etc.   Not only were the environments inconsequential, but Overlord\u2019s fights were barely even animated at all.  Compared to other Madhouse shows around this time, the fights in overlord were nothing short of abhorrent.   \\n\\n\r\nThe addition of a revival system is nice.  I was almost concerned that our immortal Gary Stu couldn\u2019t save his friends from death.  Glad that was cleared up.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really talk much about the actual overarching plot in this section, and that\u2019s because there is none.  I don\u2019t even know what the main plot is, Momonga\u2019s world conquest?  Momonga\u2019s exploratory adventures?  It\u2019s impossible to analyze the progress of the overarching plot if the overarching plot isn\u2019t even defined.  At least shows like Konosuba had a goal.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  \\n\\n\r\nMadhouse, why?  This is some of the most atrocious animation I\u2019ve seen from the modern era, and its from madhouse, no less.  The Drawn characters and CG monsters don\u2019t feel at all like they belong in the same world.  Almost all Momonga\u2019s dialogue is delivered either while he is entirely inanimate or with about 4 animated frames of head turn.  There\u2019s absolutely no expression whatsoever for an anime so heavily praised for its characters.  The Guardians have some cool character designs and are decently expressive, but Momonga does not translate well into an anime format.  The side characters, humans especially, have bland character designs.  Background art is typical isekai fare.  Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a hair below average for anime, but unacceptable for madhouse in 2015.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s alright.  Music was used well enough.  OP is forgettable.  Sound can complement a good piece of media, it can\u2019t save a bad one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  \\n\\n\r\nI got more enjoyment out of dissecting every element I hate about the show than I did watching it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts:  \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t see the value in this show (and neither did madhouse, judging by the animation).  The creator\u2019s masturbatory power fantasy writing overshadowed all other aspects of the show.  There was never any tension in the conflicts, the character relationships were inconsequential because of momonga\u2019s total control over their actions, and the fights were boring to watch because of the total afterthought combat mechanics, boring settings, OP MC, and dismal animation quality.  It baffles me that this anime receives almost universal praise and is one of the most popular shows out today.  \\n\\n\r\nFeel free to guess whether or not I recommend this anime.  You get 3 chances.       \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nHanging out in the front of Ironforge. Karazhan runs. The snowy hills of Northrend. World of Warcraft is not just a game, it is its own, complete world. Beasts to slay, treasure to find, and quests to complete. Dailies for gold. Instances for gear. Fishing for fun. There is so much to do that it more or less became my second life for a sizeable chunk of my teenage years. After going to school, chatting with friends, and taking care of what needed to be done in the real world, I would hop onto the computerand become someone that was not technically me but might as well have been.\\n\\n\r\nThat sounds bonkers, but it is the truth. The amount of time, the resources, and the effort I sunk into that game were enough to make my avatar a natural extension of myself. Of course, I did not don armor, I did not ride an undead horse, and I did not have a gray beard, but I shaped my character into the kind of person I saw myself to be.\\n\\n\r\nI was always big on questing. I loved going to the different countries like Stranglethorn Vale and Tanaris, searching high and low for those distinctive yellow exclamation marks above Hemet Nesingwary or the Goblins of the desert. I will never forget, for as long as I live, how I was one of the earliest players (within the first year or so) to earn the \u201cInsane in the Membrane\u201d achievement before it was nerfed. The requirements were being near or at \u201cExalted\u201d reputation for some of the most obscure factions. Ones like Darkmoon Faire, which needed thousands of gold and cards, and Ravenholdt, which needed me to make a brand new \u201cRogue\u201d class character specifically tooled to steal over 2000 junkboxes from enemies. Getting the \u201cFeat of Strength\u201d took months, but it was worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThe tedious work earned me a sweet new title of \u201cthe Insane\u201d next to my character\u2019s name. But that was not what ultimately made the game worthwhile. What made World of Warcraft worthwhile were the people around me. The guild I was a part of, my brother going with me to get some levels, and the various friends I made throughout my time in the Eastern Kingdoms is something that I will always hold dear. The game is way too addictive and way too much of a time-sink. And the game was not always smiles. But the memories I have of the game and the people I played alongside are and will only ever be positive.\\n\\n\r\nOverlord gets at the same notion, how the past, while no longer with us, never truly leaves. However, unlike my time in World of Warcraft, Overlord is not all positivity.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Overlord, its narrative is somewhat sloppy in its execution. Plot lines are unresolved, entire areas are ignored, and its overall purpose is lacking. Often relying on the same trope \u2013 that Ainz Ooal Gown is impossibly strong \u2013 the show stops itself from doing much of anything else, severely hampering the experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has essentially three arcs: the opening arc, the undead arc, and the Shalltear arc. The beginning arc is mostly setup. Characters are introduced, parts of the world are explained, and Ainz Ooal Gown\u2019s absolutely overpowered self is made known. Nothing wrong exists at this point since the anime is simply gearing itself for the rest of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems start with the second arc. First, the anime moves away from the literal home base of Nazarick. This would be fine but the show introduces and works with another new character (Nabel) rather than using the already-established and yet-to-be used rest of the cast like Albedo, Cocytus, and Demiurge. Second, the anime then continues to introduce more people, like a bunch of random adventurers and the protector of the forest, that further detract from what the anime provided earlier. Third, and worse still, these adventurers are killed and the protector of the forest is hardly referenced again, meaning their inclusion means little in the grand scheme of things. Fourth and furthermore, simple tactics like explaining more of the world \u2013 how the magic works, the various factions, and so on \u2013 and not fully showing specific moments \u2013 the assassin attacking the adventurers, what happened immediately after saving the alchemist\u2019s grandson, and so on \u2013 create holes in the narrative that stop the narrative from staying afloat. The point of this arc is to extend Ainz Ooal Gown\u2019s reputation further, in order to attract attention and gain fame. But because the following, final arc does not build off of what happened in the second arc, the plot comes off as directionless. Having this problem already occur between the first and the second, and then having it occur again between the second and the third, disjoints the narrative, thereby ruining the tale Overlord is telling.\\n\\n\r\nThis third arc, featuring Shalltear\u2019s \u201cbetrayal,\u201d does not stop Overlord\u2019s downward trend. Disregarding the shift from spreading reputation to saving Shalltear, the plot introduces another new character (that is used only once), the background forces-at-work are very briefly alluded to (while still making next to no sense), and the outcome effectively returned everything to how it was before the debacle (meaning it was a diversion that minimally affected the narrative). All the while, the rest of the cast is still underutilized, the world is still unmapped, and the previous plot points \u2013 like the original general he helped and the need for more reputation \u2013 are forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThe cause for these dilemmas: Ainz Ooal Gown. More specifically, it is his elite status that causes the narrative to tumble over itself. Interestingly, the point of the show is the overpowered-ness. Watching him wreck a group\u2019s trump card with just his finger. Seeing him literally hug a woman until her insides explode. Witnessing him going through legendary weapon after legendary weapon. The anime always has to showcase him in his ridiculously unfair state but doing so takes away from the rest of the anime. He is super-strong, so the rest of the cast is unneeded and thus is not shown. He is super-smart, so going into detail about the world and the magic is pointless for him. He is super-awesome, so diverting attention to other plot lines that do not involve his esteemed abilities would ruin the magic. Paradoxically, the anime\u2019s biggest strength is also its biggest weakness.\\n\\n\r\nWeakness continues in Overlord\u2019s shoddy attempt at creating a theme. Throughout the season, there are distinct moments of reminiscing. Ainz Ooal Gown has recollections of the past, he feels longing when trekking with the random group of adventurers, and near the end he clearly wishes for his old comrades to still be with him now. The show is trying to get at the notion that nothing lasts forever. Life eventually moves forward, people come and go, no matter how much one wants it otherwise. The problem, though, is that he is still there, he is still lasting. He is performing the same role \u2013 leader of a guild \u2013 as he has always done. In essence, he wants the old days back. But when so little is given about his past escapades let alone his past comrades, this theme, of cherishing what once was yet looking forward at what is to come, loses value.\\n\\n\r\nA potential argument in favor of this theme is that foregoing the past is difficult. It is not easy letting go when those days gone by were so memorable. However the anime never makes this type of thinking clear. For example, there is a what-should-be tender moment where his lackeys invite him to berate Shalltear, the purpose being to get him standing and moving forward. But the reversal of authority in that scene \u2013 where his followers, especially Albedo, \u201chelp\u201d him \u2013 is too contrasting with the entire rest of the season\u2019s \u201cAinz Ooal Gown is the greatest\u201d motif. Another example is his reaction to the death of the random adventurers. Initially he is more annoyed than caring since they were tools to further his reputation. But his offhand comment calling himself a \u201chypocrite\u201d makes it confusing since forward movement is seemingly made but then immediately taken back. Beyond these moments, and perhaps more of a problem, is that the show rarely explores this theme to begin with. Again, since the anime is determined to push the overarching, overpowered idea to the front, it never places aside adequate time to talk about or investigate this theme. Thus, what is given are these minor moments that, when compared to the rest of the anime, make up a very small and therefore inconsequential portion.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does make up the \u201crest of the anime\u201d? Overlord includes a nice amount of action sequences in the form of dragon battles, zombie knights, and vampire warriors. Other scenes focus on \u201cecchi\u201d and comedy, sometimes both. For instance, Albedo straddling a body pillow that has Ainz Ooal Gowns\u2019 face on it is both sexy and hilarious. These sequences would seem to get repetitive considering that these and the previously investigated events surrounding them have little substance. But because the outcome is already known \u2013 that Ainz Ooal Gown will decimate whosoever stands before him or will effortlessly command them \u2013 that the anime gains an alluring quality. The anime becomes less about seeing where it ends up and more about how it gets there. The awe of the passersby, the utter annihilation of foes, and the complete servitude of minions is something that is easy to revel in, and since the show achieves these effects through its regular happenings, the anime likewise engrosses the audience on a regular basis.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, Overlord is not a complete tale, meaning it is unfair for the audience to expect the narrative to be wholly fulfilling. Still, the anime\u2019s need to lean on the same, overpowered trope hurts where it should help.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOverlord\u2019s art is similarly lacking in appeal. This is mostly due to the bland backgrounds that the show incorporates for most of its scenes. To be fair, the show is dark in tone so the artistic direction likewise follows this pattern. Gloomy woods, haunting caverns, and gothic interiors are common but quickly become repetitive. Especially so when the lighting is constantly dreary, making each location the same as the next. The anime can switch it up now and again \u2013 a sandy plain, a weathered road, a view from way up high, and so on \u2013 but these moments are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime can pick up its artistic direction when it chooses. Camera shots, like a decapitated head seeing its own body as it floats through the air or viewing the world through Shalltear\u2019s eyes while she is in her ravenous state demonstrate the show\u2019s ability for flair. Other moments, like a black hole evaporating an archangel or Nabel squaring off against some skeletal dragons push the boundaries of the anime\u2019s lighting, action, and detail. Furthermore, the CG elements \u2013 like the death knight near the beginning and the ogres near the middle \u2013 are not overly obtrusive in their presentation, meaning they do not distract the audience when they do appear on-screen, keeping attention on the aforementioned pizzazz.\\n\\n\r\nPizzazz of the fight choreography, however, is often subpar. The reason, per usual, is the overpowered nature of the characters involved. Nearly everything takes one hit. To put it differently, these are not so much skirmishes as they are one-sided romps. Little time for extensive or prolonged fights is had, and the only one that can call itself thus \u2013 the fight between Ainz Ooal Gown and Shalltear \u2013 is mostly magical, meaning the two of them stand around for roughly the majority of the duel.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation remains about average throughout the experience. Ainz Ooal Gown in particular barely moves. He is a skeleton, so his skull, jaw, and other body parts rarely jostle. When he does move, his actions are often choppy, lessening his overall impact. Once again, there are exceptions: many of the fights feature explosions, ruffling robes, and sword dances that elevate the animation considerably. Yet these, like the art, are not frequent, with the majority of the show resting rather than moving. Facial expressions sporadically increase in quality from time to time, with incredulity, scorn, and anger plastered across faces for the given situation. However hair swaying and other minute details are generally missing, a trade-off for the higher detail placed on the characters and their designs.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not an understatement: the character designs are quite detailed. Ainz Ooal Gown (he is always the odd-man-out) sees the most, his black, yellow, and purple robe, his myriad of rings, and his immaculate, golden wizard\u2019s staff portray him as the king that he is. The contours on his skull, as well as his black-and-red eyes, maintain his demonic disposition. The rest of the cast, while not as detailed, are still very imaginative. Albedo\u2019s normal attire \u2013 a pure white dress, devil horns, and black angel wings on the small of her back \u2013 contrasts with her dark brown and concealing battle armor. Cocytus\u2019s teal carapace matches his bug-like form. And Shalltear\u2019s gothic gown, umbrella, and ribbons, each mired in purple and red, highlight her pale skin well. Unfortunately, while the designs are elaborate, they do not have much value in terms of symbolism or representation. In other words, they are more for show rather than for expounding further on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nArguably Overlord\u2019s weakest aspect are the characters that inhabit Nazarick and the surrounding area.\\n\\n\r\nIt is very difficult to talk about Overlord\u2019s characters. They all worship Ainz Ooal Gown. They all hate humans. They all hold strength of immeasurable magnitude. Therefore, at a surface level, they are identical to one another. Digging deeper, the cast does have character traits that separate them. Albedo would literally do anything for her master, her love for him unable to be matched by anyone ever. Cocytus has dreams of being an \u201cUncle.\u201d Shalltear is a vampire who pads her bra to give her a larger bust. This list of characterizations goes on. The problem, though, is that many of characters go unused. Yes, Albedo\u2019s unfathomable love for Ainz Ooal Gown reoccurs indefinitely, as do some of the other known traits of the servants. But since the anime spends so much time away from the main group, the consequence is that nothing else is known about them. A huge issue, to say the least, because the characters turn from being people into being slots to fill. This speaks nothing of the development of the Albedo and the rest which, understandably, is nonexistent. Understandable since, if the bare minimum of characterizations were provided, then development of any kind will not occur. Devil\u2019s advocates would argue that, as it was with the story, the incompleteness of the overall tale obviously infers that the cast would not undergo extensive development at this point. However, unlike the story, where attempts at constructing a coherent adventure are apparent, the anime never does the same for its characters.\\n\\n\r\nLess important side characters exist, such as Enri (the village girl), Ninya (the girl posing as a boy in the random adventurers\u2019 group), and Clementine (the assassin who is hugged to death). But, once again, very little is given or known about them outside of the offhand comments they or those around them make. Enri has a younger sister and is loved by Nfirea, and that is it. Ninya seems to have lost her older sister and fights to protect the land, and that is it. Clementine is demented and cocky, and that is it. Hyperboles, but so little is given outside of these facts and so little time is spent on these characters that these types of generalizations are warranted. Here, the argument is that these people are so inconsequential that they are practically pointless compared not just to the rest of the cast but to the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThis is true; Enri\u2019s romance, Ninya\u2019s backstory, and Clementine\u2019s psychotic behavior are utilized at most once or twice, constituting \u201cenough\u201d for each person relative to their importance. But because they are unimportant, the purpose of their characters has no meaning besides adding superficial feelings that barely affect the viewer. A case for Ninya and her group is possible, how they mirrored (to an extent) Ainz Ooal Gown\u2019s own, original friends, but this quickly crumbles since, due to their inconsequential status, they are neither referenced after their arc concludes nor are they used to further him or any of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo it stands to reason that Ainz Ooal Gown, the almighty ruler and destroyer of men, requires adequate attention since everyone else around him received none. This is the final nail in the figurative coffin: he as well is a markedly weak character. Part of the problem stems from the recurring overpowered motif; Ainz Ooal Gown is so perfect that there is nothing to fix. His character has no flaws which, from a literary standpoint, is automatically an issue since without conflict he is unable to grow or change throughout the season. Taking into account that this is the whole point of his character \u2013 simply being overpowered at everything, from fighting to strategizing \u2013 the anime does try to convey the change in his personality. Before, as a human playing a video game, killing people was not real, meaning he was not attached mentally to his actions. After, having become a skeletal warlord of another world, this disconnect is still present but has manifested as a part of his personality rather than him consciously making the decision to not care. So, in the very beginning, he changes, but at no point afterward do the events affect him. He does have a split persona, one for his internal monologues and one for his external portrayal. But the former exists purely to understand what he is truly thinking and the latter is how he had always acted, meaning neither side sees noteworthy development, thereby stagnating his character from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nStill, no matter if it is Ainz Ooal Gown\u2019s inner or outer self, the remembrance of the past is a theme that persists. Despite having complete loyalty of everyone, despite having the capability of crushing anything in his path, he still feels alone, wanting the past to come back in one form or another. His servants are on the opposite end. They know of their personal creators and they know where they came from, but they do not dwell on the past. Instead, they devote themselves to Ainz Ooal Gown. For them, what happened before should be celebrated, but still they understand that then is not now. This is interesting because of the dichotomy: the master is worried about this trivial matter while his servants are not. But once again, Ainz Ooal Gown and the rest of the cast is not expounded on enough to support this theme between the characters. Albedo and the others are rarely shown interacting with their previous masters, Shalltear having just about the only scene where this happens. As for the ultimate ruler, he likewise is barely shown interacting with this old buddies, making it hard to empathize with his feelings. The combined result is a broken link within the dichotomy, fragmenting the theme instead of unifying it. Worst still, Albedo and the others are the result of code. Therefore, their loyalty and outlook is not by choice but by circumstance, meaning their relationships are fake which in turn reduces their thematic presence.\\n\\n\r\nSo while the cast of Nazarick might be unbelievably strong in a physical sense, they are unbelievably weak in a writing sense.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nOverlord\u2019s strongest area is easily the sound it uses throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is hard rock, but takes on a semi-spooky vibe to coincide with Ainz Ooal Gown and the tone of the anime. The rising and falling lyrics, the catchy beat, and the rapid drums work together to create an arrangement that is simply cool. The random English bits are somewhat jarring and do not mesh all too well with the song, but the piece hypes the viewer for the inevitable awesomeness that awaits.\\n\\n\r\nAwesomeness such as the ending theme, which is downright wonderful. The ED, like the OP, adopts a rock or metal vibe to make the piece more aligned with the gritty and cool aura that the show gives off. However the ED, unlike the OP, has English bits whose emotion and meaning fit the Albedo-centric track well. The breathing part in the middle is weird but oddly satisfying, since it stops the song and builds it up for the final half of the piece. Alongside the strong vocalist, the background whispering, and the catchy beat, the track comes together, being filled with nothing short of \u201clove and passion.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhile the rest of the soundtrack is not filled with as much love, it still manages to encompass the same feeling of MMORPGs and overpowered-ness that the anime thrives on. A fluty tune for the downtimes that relaxes both body and mind like a famous inn. Choirs and hard drums fill other tracks, maximizing the splendor of Ainz Ooal Gown and his battle prowess. Violins and pianos to follow the gothic feelings. Many of the tracks are steeped in gloomy sounds that heighten the dark mood while also keeping the events cloaked in a veil of mystery that improves the darkness further. Despite how atmospheric the pieces tend to be, none are particularly memorable, serving as appropriate background music and not much more.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, however, is superb, with the majority of the cast providing stellar performances. Yumi Hara as Albedo uses a sultry voice that amplifies Albedo\u2019s sexiness and thus her attractiveness. Satoshi Hino as Ainz Ooal Gown uses two voices, the first higher pitched and younger to match his normal self and the second lower pitched and older to match his overlord self, demonstrating his large vocal range. And a special shout-out is deserved for Aoi Yuuki as Clementine for nailing the psychotic inflection and way of speaking, making Clementine creepier in the process. Altogether, the voice actors and actresses performing so well immerses the audience, a much-needed outcome given the immersive undertones of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile I find the story and the characters to be severely lacking in meaningfulness, there is one reason why I like this one so much: Albedo. She is amazing. Her sacrificial servitude, her sexual spark, and her sensual self won me over immediately. Watching her get extremely mad whenever Shalltear tried to do anything with Ainz Ooal Gown, hearing her go on and on about the clothes she made (up to five years old) for their future child together, and seeing her almost completely lose it after the enemy merely scratched her beloved was hilarious, ridiculous, and endearing. Other moments, like her screaming at the top of her lungs for receiving a ring from Ainz Ooal Gown and her \u201cso freaking cool\u201d line followed by her goofy grin made me love her that much more. She may not be a well-written character in the slightest, but I do not care. She makes me swoon regardless.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast was also fun. Cocytus\u2019s singular moment where he gets lost in his Uncle fantasy, Nabel constantly calling the humans some variation of insect, and Shalltear believing that Ainz Ooal Gown was going to have his way with her in the middle of the throne room were all scenes that made me smile and laugh. I was therefore disappointed that they \u2013 and Albedo, of course \u2013 were not around as much as they could (and should) have been. They are an interesting bunch of characters, so not including them as much as possible made the moments when they were not nearby less exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the events are actually entertaining despite them not having much substance whatsoever. It was a lot of fun watching the enemy cower in fear, unable to grasp how powerful Ainz Ooal Gown was. The death knight stabbing the captain guard over and over was gruesome but funny. Albedo deflecting the pebble back at the mage and literally exploding his head made me love Albedo even more. And Shalltear going berserk in her vampire form was chilling, gross, and crazy all at once. The anime definitely understands how to create scenes filled with entertainment, proving at the minimum that the show could do well when it wanted.\\n\\n\r\nOverlord has prevalent problems in both its narrative and especially its characters. The art and the animation also has issues, though they are not as glaring as the first two. Still, strong music and enjoyable scenarios stop this one from immediately being put up for auction at the Stormwind Auction House.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, disjointed plot, individual arcs lack purpose, overarching theme is improperly explored, with the overpowered trope simultaneously harming and helping the narrative\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, a mix of boring and interesting artistic decisions, subpar fight choreography, about average actual animation, and detailed yet meaningless character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, the side cast is barely investigated, the minor characters are inconsequential, Ainz Ooal Gown stagnates very early, and the dichotomy between him and his servants has no foundation\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, great ED, okay OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, Albedo is amazing, the rest of the cast is fun though not around enough, and the overpowered action was really entertaining\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "Overlord is just okay\r\nI feel like people over praise Overlord because its similar to SAO with traits of overpowered MC gets stuck in game but different because it doesnt focus on romance then introduce harem or have almost rape or almost incest\r\nbut honestly if you look at it independently Overlord isnt that amazing. People just over exaggerate because of all the bad things it manages to avoid doing \r\nYou have this guy who allegedly gets stuck in an MMORPG and has no way to get back to the real world so he gathers information about his new world and (for some reason) tries to findif anyone else is stuck in the game also. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Fair\\n\r\nThe art was fair, it was not amazing or bad. there was a few fight scenes here and there and they were animated decently. \\n\r\nThey also use CG in a few scenes but it actually looked okay\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI honestly dont remember much of it and i just finished watching it. I skipped most of the opening and ending but i do remember that the opening was kind of good but in the end skippable because it was just okay\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Poor\\n\r\nThroughout the 13 episodes of season 1 (plus the first 2 episodes of season 2) we never find out much about this Momonga who is allegedly stuck in the game, and they never show the real world for contrast or show any reason or desire for him to go back to it. \\n\r\nOn top of that he is surrounded by NPCs come to life and they have no backstory or relateable motivations. they were programmed to love and worship the MC and that is what they do\\n\\n\r\nBasically its like these are the characters and these are their traits. I felt no attachment to them. Infact if some of them died it would not be a big deal and I think even Momonga wouldnt mind\\n\r\nThey are just tools for the story and they are just tools he uses\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters are not that memorable as characters. you can remember Albedo who was kinda erotic and remember the demon in a suit coz he looked cool but it would be the same if you just saw a poster of them\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fair\\n\r\nThe story was kind of interesting as like many stuck in game stories are. \\n\r\nFirst 2 episodes were kind of just introducing the characters and alleged premise so they are really boring. i actually dropped it for a long time after the uninteresting first 2... but dont stop watching there because things start moving in episode 3\\n\r\nI really feel like overlord would make a great game but as an anime it was lacking something. (i dont want to say passion, emotion or mystery because those sound cliche)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good\\n\r\nOverlord is actually really enjoyable like the equivalent of watching someone play a video game\\n\\n\r\nOverral: Fair \\n\r\nOverlord season 1 feels like a simple prologue and it has the capacity to grow into something nice (or maybe its just an advertisement to go buy the light novel)\\n\r\nseason 1 is not bad but its not great either. I definitely recommend people to watch it if they have free time or really want a stuck in game anime\\n",

Most of the episodes seem to be about sucking up to the MC.\r\nI dropped this somewhere in season 2, the first season is tolerable. The second is just crap.

            "content": "Otaku power fantasy #doesitreallymatter - overlord\r\nOverlord is the anime that was adapted from a LN which is adapted from a WN (web novel), and frankly it suffers from almost all of the problem of a WN or LN power fantasy. So your enjoyment lies entirely on whether you are the type to like a PF or the type that hates it. And I hate PF from the bottom of my heart, so this review would mostly focus on how bad a PF is.\r\nA bit of background first, Japanese WN adapted LN usually have the problem of being a power fantasy, famous (or infamous) examples includeSAO (though Kawahara said he would fix some of it) and Mahouka (which the author would throw a tantrum like a 5 year old every time someone says something remotely bad about his work). This trend originate from the harshness of Japanese society, due to the strict system and poor economy, so people wish to escape from the suppressive feeling of their daily life. Understandable, but it makes for poor entertainment for the rest of the globe who watch their works.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3\\n\\n\r\nFirst good point, the premise, a man becomes a skeleton overlord ruling over a lair of evil servants and try to take over the world. Man that premise seems so refreshing in a sea of mediocre works, it would be dark, exciting, awesome and etc. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then you get trolled...\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is not a complete lie, but it is a lot boring than you imagined it to be. First thing that should tip you off this is a very bad PF is the fact none of the enemy poses a remote threat to Ainz and his OP servants, that right, NONE! It took the author, 4 to 5 books to introduce a character that can maybe beat one of his servants if his servant doesn't wear any armor and only throw super weak spells while this character suit up in full gear and unleashe her full might. (Man I wonder who will win....) This is the beginning, later on we would get entire arcs just so at the end of it all we could, suck Ainz's non-existent penis and see how \"awesome\" he is (or his servants is, but they are all his yes-man so it's the same)\\n\\n\r\nThis is like watching fully armed soldiers killing kindergarten students and telling you to cheer since it is an awesome fight. And it is as boring as it goes. It is conflict and competition that make a story, and since Ainz don't have a rival I guess there is no story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\\n\r\nMeet Ainz and his group of yes-man that have little in life beyond kissing his ass. There is the pretty vampire (who is totally into him), the succubus (who is totally into him), the dragon butler, the demon butler, the cute mascot twin night elves, the big bug thing, a group of maids, and a bunch of other minions who are not important enough to get a lot of screen time. And all of them are loyal to the core (with little other purpose in life), which fixes the problem of possible betrayal that every other dark lord need to face. Yep life is sweet for Ainz beyond the fact he doesn't have a penis.\\n\\n\r\nAinz for all of his amazing Powers and other things, is a beta pussy harem protagonist with the new \"how to be a emotionless robot\" input that came from Tatsuya and the MC of AZ (the egg guy). Two wrong doesn't make a right, and beyond his appearance, Ainz have little separating him from the pool of mediocre MCs. \\n\\n\r\nThe guardians of the floor and by extension all the other servants serve only as his yes-man, with little personality beyond that. Every time they show some individuality, it goes \"nope I should be a slave, fuck personality, lol\". Ainz is this thing that is completely blocking their development, which is a shame, cause they would make much more entertaining MC than he would. And before you ask, NO, quirks are not personality, they are quirky, but still 2 or 1-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters serve as jobbers and ants to die or gaze in awe at Ainz, with little influence on the plot if any at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt, sound- 9, 7\\n\r\nDon't really care but it is madhouse, so good job for them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3\\n\r\nI did a review for the novel as well, and I hold my view from back then, it is a decent PF, I just hate PF and think it is cancer of novels. It's like a blowjob, empty pleasure, and that is all it ever will be.",

A hardcore gamer who spent his time playing a video game is sad that its shutting down and friends aren't there to be with him on its final moments He is the leader of a top guild and only people can who can join are those who have a job outside the game. Seriously a top guild whose requirements are have a job in reality.(yeah wish fulfillment) So the gamer gets trapped in in game and Doesn't even try to figure out why heis stuck.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 0\\n\r\nThe characters in Overlord are Momonga your typical Gary Stu he is very powerful, his friends adore him. The females Deuteragonist are in love with him and his enemies fear him. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are your token loli shailtear bloodfallen who loves Momonga and is a vampire. \\n\\n\r\nAlbedo a succubus who is in love and obsessed with momonga \\n\\n\r\nThose were the only two worth mentioning because the rest are easily forgetful and most of the time  story focuses on these three.\\n\\n\r\nSound:0\\n\r\nWhat sound? Most of the time I was watching this anime I didn't notice any music score so there is no noteworthy music in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nThe art is sup par The background was awful and only good art was on certain characters and episode 1 was the only episode with decent art I guess  budget for art just went to that episode\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:0 \\n\r\nI guess we can never get a game anime that has actual good characters with character development  instead of the fan fiction that is overlord.  I never enjoy gary stus because there is no story just the author pandering to himself and wishing how his ideal self should be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 0\\n\r\nThe target for anime like this are otakus that play mmo or have no girlfriend because they can  project themselves as momonga and having a harem. being very powerful and your comrades respect you and lastly enemies fearing you.  I would recommend this to those who like sword art online and  mahouka koukou no rettousei because they are both fan fiction and wish fulfillment.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What do you get with Overlord? A good, enjoyable anime which is one of the seasons best (not really hard this time) also if you long for some good ol' overpowered main character fighting - this show is for you.\r\nThe story centers around a guy (do we know his name?) who is the last remaining player (?) in the online game YGGDRASIL. His alter ego is Momonga, later Ainz Ooal Gown, a powerful undead Necromancer and also the guildmaster of the  successful guild Great Tomb of Nazarick. The other members have already left the game long ago, but left him with their belongings andalso the personal created NPCs, which serve as guardians of the Tomb (guild hall).\\n\\n\r\nLike other people already wrote the story takes some time to get going, probably even another season, nevertheless is interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIt starts like this: On the day the game is supposed to shut down, Momonga can't log off - he is trapped (how original). Now everything centers around managing the guild and helping NPCs while finding out why he's trapped and if there are others like him.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally i think the characters are the shows weakest point owed to the 13-episode size. We have the player, the vampire gothic loli Shalltear (who the fuck designed her vampire form?!) and the submassiv loving demon girl Albedo - the rest isn't worth mentioning in fact apart from the battle maid Narberal you won't see much of them. Character development ? Nope.\\n\\n\r\nThe show ends with this typical \"pressed content preview\", you know that one were they lay the rootes for a 2nd season without promising anything. If it doesn't get one i probably wouldn't watch it again - let's hope it sells well\\n",

Pure bliss from the opening to the end of every episode (and what a great opening it is, by the way).\r\nThe protagonist finds himself in a new world - and a new, undead body. He brings with himself his sensibilities from his own life, but finds he no longer actually feels the moral compulsions of his previous humanself, making his character an interesting mix of ruthless and mindful. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a strong focus on exploring a new and hostile world, and finding the differences between the world's \"systems\" and what the protagonist is used to. On the other hand, he doesn't start off weak and have to level/power up to, but instead arrives as a supreme being defying the laws of the world. That's a unique angle I don't remember seeing before in this kind of series.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that'll improve this series is a second season.",

            "content": "Firstly, let me tell you my main problem with Overlord : its the setting. The thing with this kind of world is, you can never take it seriously, its just a game. I was tired of hearing stuff like \"You used a shop item?\" in the middle of a fight. I am not saying there is anything wrong with an anime's story based around a game, but when that game means next to nothing of significance and there you know that even if someone from the protagonist's side die, they are gonna be revived, its simply not as much fun. That's why I liked thefirst 14 episodes of SAO to an extent and literally despised the second half. Overlord, in my opinion, suffers from a similar problem.\\n\\n\r\nThere have been an abundance of anime releasing these days whose story is completely based on an MMORPG world created by the author. Sword Art Online, Log Horizon, NGNL you name it. This genre has become one of the most popular in recent years but... let me ask you one thing : have any of these MMORPG anime been done really well?\\n\\n\\n\r\nDifferent people would have different answer to the question I just asked and that's to be expected. Different anime watchers will have different tastes and will like different genres. \\n\r\nBut if I was to answer that question, my answer would be \"NO\". None of such anime could be called amazing. They have gained tremendous popularity but as far as story, character development and other major things go, anime of this genre have been somewhat disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nOverlord is another addition to that fast growing bundle of anime and like most of those other, Overlord is good at best; it has never had that awe factor that we search for in anime. It's been interesting, no doubt, but that's all it's been. It will most probably keep you interested, believe me. This is the only summer anime that I watched EVERY WEEK without any delays till the last episode. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nI don't think I need to go into the details of the synopsis since you already know about it, but if I were to rate Overlord's story, it's nothing new. It's just that cliche story of our protagonist being stuck in an imaginary gaming world. If there is one thing different about Overlord's story, it's that the protagonist is already at the top of the game and he is suddenly moved to another world. It's nothing complex really, not that a good story necessarily needs to be complex.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nThe art of Overlord is good. I don't know what more to say about it. The character designs are distinct and the setting has been described pretty well with the art. As for the animation, it's been good too, mostly remaining consistent. I won't go as far as to say that the animation was amazing but it was pretty decent, nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8.5/10\\n\r\nNow, this could be the best part about Overlord. When you think about Overlord, the first thing that'll pop in your mind is the opening; it's amazing. It won't be a stretch to say that Overlord has the best opening of all summer anime of 2015. I guess you could say that none of the Summer 2015 anime even come close to it's opening. The ending was meh. It never caught my attention. \\n\r\nThe OST has been good too but nothing to make a particular fuss about, considering many of the recent anime do have really good soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nLet's start with the protagonist, Lord Momonga. I dont know how to describe him. He has kind of a split personality. He is your normal teenage boy at times while he is thinking(Thus far, his appearance hasnt been revealed in the anime) sometimes and when he is in public, he becomes a considerate yet somewhat cold personality who is the ruler of Yggdrasil.\\n\r\nAlbedo and Shalltear fight for Momonga's love all the time and its sometimes interesting. The other supporting cast is also quite interesting and entertaining.\\n\r\nBut, there has been no real character development and that's the reason the score for the characters is 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nIt was an odd ride. It's never gotten boring for me in although, I wasn't awed by it many times, except a couple. The MC is overly overpowered since he's the Supreme Ruler and all. It's entertaining and I would definitely watch a second season if there is one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nThere are lots of anime I give a score of 7. They are such anime who are good but have potential to have been much better which hasnt been reached. I didn't expect Overlord to be an anime which would give me the feels and it didn't end up being one. If you have spare time on your hands, you could give this anime a try. Who knows, you might find it to be a good watch.",

            "content": "Even uttering the words \"MMO anime\" triggers a lot of violent and ambivalent thoughts among the community in 2015. After a slew of shows of dubious merit based on playing a video game, or being trapped inside of it- it's understandable that the community is a bit gunshy on the concept.\r\nRest assured though, that anime with the Madhouse tag on it are in good hands, as it's more often than not a high quality and faithful production. \r\nOverlord is not your nouveau Sword Art Online. Overlord is not your No Game No Life, and it's most certainly not .Hack://Sign. \r\nArtwork and Animation: 8\r\nAgain, Madhouse producedanime are almost always synonymous with quality. Great consistency in character detail and motions, and some very pretty 3D spellcasting that looks a lot like it was pulled from Death Parade. The character designs are great, their movements fluid, and even a 3D CGI dragon can't put this one down in the dirt! \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7\\n\\n\r\nSatoshi Hino, despite all of the roles I haven't seen him in, really kills the Momonga/Ainz character. A dual commanding and menacing, and 'normal' inner monologue voice sells the real live and in-game versions of Momonga well. He's backed up by a plethora of talent in Yumi Hara as Albedo, Sumire Uesaka portraying Shalltear, and Manami Numakura as the cold Narberal. \\n\\n\r\nOn a musical note: typical fantasy game stylings, with a healthy mix of EDM, especially the groovy ending song. Nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 \\n\\n\r\nMomonga/Ainz is our main, in the real world a no life salaryman, but ingame, a maxed out, god-class skeletal mage with powers noobs can only dream of. A fearsome combatant in any arena, guild leader, and general badass, he's seen and done everything that the MMO Yggdrasil has to offer.  Apprehensive about his new surroundings and the unknown dangers it may hold, Ainz takes a cautious approach to this new scape and acts logically when presented with dangers: buffing the crap out of himself and out thinking the goons after him. But he's not above trolling them a little. He's rather catlike- playing with his food before he eats it. \\n\\n\r\nNext up is the fan favorite Albedo: the NPC turned sentient, slavishly devoted guardian of Ainz. As the boss of the other NPCs of the guild castle \"Nazarick\", Albedo holds considerable sway over the other characters, including Ainz- partly because of her obsequious treatment of her unrequited lover (due to a mix-up in her NPC coding caused by Old Gregg). She's fiercely protective of him, and thinks any attention paid to him by a female character other than herself is a dire insult to her affections- to which she will fight to the death to protect.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, we have the ice queen Pleiades Battle Maid Narberal. She serves as Ainz's escort while adventuring, and absolutely despises humans, seen by the undead who populate Nazarick as less than contemptible slime. Kind of like Zubat. Humans are a lot like Zubat to the denizens of Nazarick. \\n\\n\r\nRounding out our important ladies is Shalltear Bloodfallen, an extremely pretentiously named pint sized vampress. As childish as her body indicates, Shalltear also has an inexplicable crush on Ainz's lifeless bony body, and is even more bloodthirsty than Albedo. She also happens to be the most capable fighter in the castle, and the most dangerous. \\n\\n\r\nOverlord does have quite a few characters introduced at the beginning, though it's quickly apparent which ones will actually matter throughout the course of the show. Most of them are either common fantasy monsters, strange fantasies of players, and other \"lol, MMO\" types. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe story is broken up into several distinct arcs- the first among them introducing the character of Momonga/Ainz and his place in the new world, after being transported in from Yggdrasil. It starts on a small scope and scale, and gradually gets more complex and larger as Ainz gains new knowledge about the world, and his influence spreads throughout. \\n\\n\r\nAs it progresses, what we see through Ainz's eyes thickens alongside the plot. This show isn't about trying to escape from a death game, or even about playing a game really. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, and this is true for Overlord. If one was not directly told that Momonga was an MMO player and a near constant usage of gaming terms spewing forth from his lifeless lips, this would come off as just a fantasy series- which works in its favor. The \"gameplay\" is not important, as the story takes the forefront. \\n\\n\r\nAfter probably three episodes, I wasn't even thinking about a player playing the game, but rather what kind of adventures that this character would get into, and thankfully that's what Overlord delivered. There are quite a few laughs in here, some serious moments, and some well choreographed fights, all with that delicious Madhouse taste. Props to the original material though, for being engaging enough in humor, action, and story to keep it interesting. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI liked that instead of lording his way around from day one that Ainz was rightfully cautious about exploring and testing his magic, compatriots, and abilities in the new world. He played as a real person would- instead of rushing into unknown circumstances and possible game ending death, he sits back and tests things on a small scale, questions others about how the world works, what's effective, and what's not, and then chooses to strategically act upon said information gathering. Unlike many Gary Stu style protagonists who start from nothing and work their way up without tension, we know from the very beginning that Ainz is a maxed out character with untold powers. The tension comes not from Ainz's lack of ability or fear for his life, but instead ignorance of the world at large, and treachery from his own ranks - beings that were, in Yggdrasil, powerful enough to bring down even max ranked players like himself. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nMy pick for anime of the season. This was by far the least disappointing show, and definitely exceeded expectations and proved me wrong of being \"Madhouse's SAO\". \\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a gamer-feel for an anime without stupid plot contrivances and utter failures in writing as in other shows of the MMO persuasion, this is worth a try. As a pure power fantasy series, it's excellent.",

The fact that there are conflicts between them makes the spectacle almost perfect. Ainz Ooal Gown resp. Momonga is very refreshing between the different fantasy characters. And for sure, I rly love Albedo. Such an main character of ecchi fantasys! realy lovely!\r\nThe one negative point I see at Season 2, for someone who isnt familiar with this Anime, its lil bit hard to understand how the anime works at the beginning.\r\nThank you for taking the timeto read this.

            "content": "(Some Spoilers)\r\nMight I say, just how surprised I am? Like I am legitimately, unimaginably surprised. I've been on an anime Binge recently specifically for shows I had been on hold for a very long time. I did watch the first 2 episodes of Overlord back when it first aired, and I did think it was pretty good, came back, it was still very good. At first, a Solid 8. But then....as I watched on..something...did not sit right...something...was wrong.....by the end of my viewing, I would give this series, a Solid 2. So what happened?\r\nJust about everything I don't like about this series so far comesback to one singular thing. The fact that Ainz is being Evil AND EVIL IS BAD- No No No, I'm kidding. I'm not going down that route like others have. I have no problem if the protagonists are evil. Anyways, its Conflict. I either found every \"Conflict\" very boring, or very unnecessary and not worth even being a conflict. I found no tension, nothing to really keep me going \"Ooooo How is he going to get himself out of this?\" Obvious this is due to our casts Overpowered nature. Its clear they are all overpowered so there is no reason to even think that they could possibly lose, let alone even struggle. One of the most frustrating moments I found was in the middle of the season when Ainz and Nabe were up against those uh....whatever the old necromancer guy and the edgelord woman's names were. (Goddamned she was such an Edgelord....) I was not mad at all as Ainz was up against the Edgelord and he just crushed her. That was satisfying. It was Nabe vs. the Old guy that got me going, because for a bit, when she was up against those skeletal dragons, and we actually saw it looked like how she was struggling, for the first moment in the series, I felt tension. I felt ENTERTAINED. Finally a fight that doesn't just end in complete Overpowered Annihilatio- Oh wait nvm she was also holding back the whole time and it was just because Ainz had to give her the command to do so, then BOOP, GUY IS A PILE OF ASH! This outcome just feels....disappointing, much more disappointing than if she had just been using her Overpowered Powers from the Start of the fight. I was speechless.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also the conflict at the end of the season, definitely not as bad as the rest of the season by a long-shot. Might be going off topic here but, but might I say how bizarre I find it that they just spoiled Shalltear fighting Ainz in the opening? And I can easily come up with a way so that it wouldn't have spoiled something so crucial, or at least what I thought would be crucial to the series. So we see how Shalltear is wearing this epic armor during this fight, probably wouldn't be able to tell it was her if it weren't for her face just being out in the open there. Cover it up, put a mask or something there. Not only would this have not given away that for whatever reason Shalltear would fight Ainz, but it would have enhanced the lead up to when it looks like Ainz is actually putting some sort of effort into an actual fight. After all leading up to it, Ainz has had to use little to no effort in a fight. But thats all just being nitpicky I guess. I did find Shalltear and Ainz fighting to be interesting, and I was wondering, \"Ooo what happens, Shalltear betrays Ainz and the others? They have a falling out? What reason could it possibly be-\" Its mind control....ok got it....And even as she is mind controlled Shalltear will still praise Ainz as she tries to kill him. Thats...cool I guess?\\n\\n\r\nNow on the topic of them being too overpowered. I do like my overpowered characters. One Punch Man being a great example, the series itself is about just how broken the Main Character is, I would probably say the same about Overlord, yet I still find that aspect about Overlord being the reason I despise it so much. I think it could be due to One Punch Man's Overpowered aspect being used in a more comedic sense than Overlord. However I have seen people argue that Overlord is actually a Black Comedy, yet I never found any of it entertaining or comedic, even though, I also like my fair share of black comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOk so maybe its because its an Isekai MMO type of anime? Well, no again, because I also love Isekai, and even if they aren't good, I could usually find something that always entertained me throughout them, whether it be something stupid or.....stupid.\\n\\n\r\nI also find the lack of Character and Motivation incredibly dull. Ainz is the only one who has any motivation I can really decipher. He wants to gather information on the world, and spread his name in order to catch the attention of possible other players who got trapped just like him. Side note I'd like to point out something I found confusing with this motivation in mind, back when he first joined the guild and was discussing their money situation with Nabe, he talked about how they couldn't use the currency they had from the MMO world, because for one its not their world's currency, which is fine, but also it would \"Give away that they are from [Insert the Name of the MMO world that I can't spell] to any possible players\" I find this strange because, well, I thought thats what he wanted to do, so either I am incredibly mistaken on what he meant, or even Ainz has no clue what his actual motivations are. Does he want to find other players or not? Is he afraid or other players because they might be just if not as strong as him? IDK anymore. Why does he fight Shalltear towards the end even though they could easily defeat her with all of them in sheer numbers and power, seeing how they will revive her either way? Idk can't be to prove himself able to rule them because by default they're characters were literally written by him and his Guild buddies to always be loyal to them. I could be wrong but thats how they all make it seem.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, mainly Ainz's subordinates, during the beginning, I really did love their characters. Hell I love their designs, I'll give credit where its due. But then I realized something, all they ever do is either a quip or something funny, very rarely of the time which I liked...orrrrr just sucking up to Ainz as usual, 90% of the time. This does make sense, Ainz is their lord/god after all, one of many of their \"creators\" from the Guild. However, it gets repetitive and annoying at times, seeing them stroke that bone...heh... Anyways I also found it disappointing that not once did I find any of them actually have their characters develop. This could be due because maybe the descriptions their creators gave them are just their entire characters set in stone until the end of time? I hope I'm wrong.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know I'm gonna sound crazy, even insane, but I could legitimately think of reasons why SAO! SWORD ART FUCKING ONLINE, does what I hate about Overlord better. For one, Kirito does struggle, he has had his hard times, and his motivation, pretty obvious and standard, to get out of this game, and later to save his Waifu Pillow, (I call Asuna that because her \"Character\" is basically the equivalent of being a pillow). And overall, I am entertained by SAO more than Overlord.\\n\\n\r\nAlright thats all I'm going to actually Praise SAO, I'll wash my mouth out with soap later. But just those few things, are done better in SAO than Overlord from what I can tell. It just boggled my mind how much I dislike, no DESPISE Overlord. I don't even think its just because of all the reasons I've given, it just...makes me want to hate it? I have no clue. This has never happened to me with a series before. Not even the series I would go so far as to say a one have made me feel this way, and remember I give Overlord a 2. Maybe my score will change as I reevaluate things if I do, I could see my self giving it a 4 tops. But either way, I just don't like it. Now all that aside, I do plan to watch both Season 2 and 3...I really do. Because I want to like this series, I want to understand it, why people like it, I really do, I have read on countless people's own takes on why they love it, and I have heard things about season 2 and 3, that may counteract any points I gave about this post on Season 1. So heres to hoping my experience with season 2 and 3 in the future, is better than season 1. Even if the series is just not for me and I do not enjoy it at all, well.....whatever.\\n\\n\r\nTheres your two-cents from a guy who apparently not only just didn't like Overlord, but downright despised it and would give SAO a higher score than a 2. I will accept all forms of insults and threats regarding my \"bad taste\" to the following P.O. Box: [Insert Nonexistent P.O. Box]\\n\\n\r\nThank you and have a beautiful day.",

If you're sick of watching NTRs and all that jazz, check out this anime.\r\nIf you like fantasy, otaku-pandering, and tons of fun in a virtual world that rocks the boat, then you'll love Overlord. Where SAO had uninspiring character designs, Overlord has a cast that is actually memorable and dynamic. Where Log Horizon struggles with pacing, Overlord keeps you on the edge of your seat. Where NGNLwas too mainstream for your hipster-weeb-ways, Overlord is here.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't deep. This is fun. The story is simple and hilarious. It ignores the real world and sticks to the new one, all the while taking you on a ride that is anything but boring. Art is regular. Sound is regular. Characters are above average and make for an enjoyable harem of henchmen. \\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment. That's why you watch Overlord. It is full of action scenes mixed with light hearted comedy. Anyone with desires of grand power or ambition will enjoy this! You don't watch it for deep political soliloquy or some kind of wonderful plot that leaves you questioning your life's meaning. You watch this because it's fun. Now stop reading reviews and have some fun.",

            "content": "Ever since the huge popularity of Sword Art Online, more and more studios are trying to create a \"player stuck in the game\" VRMMORPG anime that could garner the same amount of popularity as SAO. Except none have even come close to reaching that amount of fanbase. Now, Madhouse is also stepping in the game with \"Overlord\" (No pun intended). \r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (7/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nWhile Momonga, the protagonist of the series, was spending his last few seconds in \"Yggdrasil\", which was about to quietly shut down, unknowingly got trapped inside the game. The world around him changed and the NPC's (Non-playablecharacters) began to talk and feel emotion. Having no parents, friends, or place in society, this ordinary young man then strives to take over the new world the game has become. \\n\\n\r\nI've been a gamer ever since I was a kid so when I became an anime fan, I was always and still am on the constant lookout for anime shows tagged with a \"game\" genre.  Now, I have found another anime with a premise that's pretty close to SAO and Log Horizon. Is it a good series though? For the most part, yes but I do have several issues with the show and I'll talk about those issues later. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is really not that complicated. The popular online game \"Yggdrasil\"  is going to end its services and if you're an online gamer, you would know how it feels to have your favourite online game shut its server down. Anyways, the server shuts down and Momonga is still somehow in the game. He later finds out that he's trapped, the world around him felt like a reality and the NPCs began to talk. I was surprised at the latter as much as he is.\\n\\n\r\nSo what story did \"Overlord\" offer after being introduced to the world, the characters and etc? Basically, he now wants to conquer the world but he's not doing it like an evil person. He's an overpowered guy and he's actually using his OP skills and magic to help others. The first arc is, to put it simply, spread Ainz Ooal Gowns' reputation. He uses his ridiculously OP skills and magic to save a village, help the adventurers, and etc. The second and final arc is Shalltear's, one of Ainz Ooal Gowns' minions, \"betrayal\". They honestly should have expanded the first arc into 12 episodes. It felt way too short and left some plot points unexplained. The 2nd arc felt like it went nowhere and it just wanted to show how strong and somewhat strategically smart Ainz Ooal Gowns is by having one of his minions \"betray\" him.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of the issues that the show has is the direction they're trying to go. Like I said above, the 2nd arc felt like it went nowhere. Isn't the purpose of the show is to spread Ainz Ooal Gowns' reputation? That's what happened in the first arc and that's the whole reason why I love the first arc but in the second arc, it just abandoned that idea and the plot just switched directions. If the show had 24/25 episodes or if it's going to have a second season then I'll forgive the 2nd arc but for now, I won't. After the 2nd arc, it was mentioned that they are still going to conquer the world. That's why I said I'm willing to forgive the 2nd arc if the second season were to occur and were to have the same direction as the 1st arc. Speaking of second season, another issue that I had with the show is its inconclusive ending. Ainz Ooal Gowns conquering the world didn't really happen in this show. We just saw the process of how exactly he's going to do it. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about Overlord is its use of MMORPG elements and I also love how the show feels like your watching a player play a video game and at the same time, having that fantasy world feeling. Like how this is not a game anymore. They use MMORPG terms like skills, abilities, and magic and they even determine how strong a magic is by tier system. The tier system is basically the same as magics that you can upgrade by leveling up or by doing side quests, like Fire (Lv. 1), Fira (Lv. 2), Firaga (Lv. 3) and etc. They really hit the spot by showing one of the Lord's name which is Lord \"Touch Me\". The Lords here are basically players but the minions (NPCs) call them Lord. Not only is it hilarious but it's also pretty accurate. There's always that one guy in an online gaming world who's going to name his/her character with a ridiculous name like \"Touch Me\". I'm actually surprised that Momonga didn't even laugh or even giggle when one of the minions mentioned the Lord's name. I laughed at that scene. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also the comedy which I LOVE, by the way. The comedy mostly comes from Albedo. For example, Albedo getting jealous when Shallter gets all clingy towards Momonga or when she was messing around with a Momonga body pillow. Those are just a couple of examples and she's just hilarious.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nMadhouse doesn't really have the best animation in the industry and Overlord is a prime example of that. The character designs are pretty decent and the background looks good but not the greatest. However, I did love the show's smooth and consistent animation. I loved watching the fight scenes because of how smooth it is and there's that one particular scene which felt great to watch. If only I could post a gif image here. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (6/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack that used throughout the show was pretty great. However, I completely abhore the OP and ED theme songs. This is actually the first time I hated both OP and ED theme songs. Now, the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Clattanoia\" by O\u00d7T (Masayoshi Oishi \u00d7 Tom-H@ck) and the ED theme song is \"L.L.L.\" by MYTH&ROID. Like I said above, I hated both the OP and ED theme songs. The OP theme song was annoying, especially the part where he goes \"Yeeeeeehhh eeeee yeeeee!!\". The ED theme song's use of Engrish is annoying and the song didn't fit my taste at all. I'm just not a fan of rock genre so that should explain why I hate the OP and ED theme songs. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThis is one of those shows where the characters are way more entertaining than the story itself. This is the reason why I rated the series with a score of 8 instead of a 7. Granted, if the first arc was expanded then the characters and the story would have been the reason why I rated this show with an 8...or maybe 9. Anyways... \\n\\n\r\nThe first character that we have is the main protagoist Momonga or \"Ains Ooal Gowns\". A player that somehow got stuck and is now in a fantasy world. He's a skeletal being and due to the amount of time he invested in the game, he's now the most powerful being in this fantasy world. You could say that's he's a level 1000 fighting other beings that are probably lv. 100. It's even shown that even the enemies' most powerful magic can barely scratch Momonga's armour. In other words, he's an extremely OverPowered character. I know what you're going to say. \"Oh god, another Kirito\". Ehh, I don't think so. The anime started with Momonga already being powerful. It wasn't like SAO where Kirito was Level 1 then a couple of episodes, he's suddenly Lv. 75 with god-like \"Jesus-kun\" powers and a deus-ex machina. Momonga's human side is what kept him interesting throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Albedo, Momonga's yandere minion. Before Momonga switched her personality, she's supposed to be a bitchy slut but now, she's an obsessive yandere. I wonder how she would have turn out if she was a slut. I don't even want to know because Albedo's yandere personality is absolutely amazing and this is coming from a guy who hates yandere girls. She's just so sex-obsessed and because of that, I find her interesting and pretty funny \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the rest of the side characters. Most of them are just as interesting as the main characters. For example, Shalltear is also in-love with Momonga and seeing Albedo and Shalltear fight over Momonga is just hilarious. Another example is Nabe, a girl who gets introduced in the first arc. She's pretty bland at first but as the arc progressed, she turned into a likable tsundere character. \\n\\n\r\nNow time to point out the issue in the Characters section. After the introduction, we don't get to see the rest of the minions that much and we don't get to see most of them fight with Momonga which I would have preferred. In the first arc, it's just Momonga and one or two or three of his minions fighting side by side. In short, the minions should have gotten more screentime. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nIf you're a gamer just like me then you'd understand why I still enjoyed the series even though the latter half of the plot doesn't seem to know where it's going. The constant use of MMORPG terms and the interesting characters is what made me enjoy this show from the first episode until the final episode. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Overlord\" is not the greatest \"player stuck in the game\" subgenre anime that I have seen but it's definitely a great anime series to watch. Is it better than SAO? I'll leave that up to you because I don't want to start a war. What I love about the series is that it feels like you're watching a player play a MMORPG game and it really feels like a game with its constant use of MMORPG terms. Overlord should have probably expanded the first arc because after the first arc ended, it felt like the show didn't know what direction to go. I did like the characters of the series, especially Momonga and Albedo and their character interactions. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7.7/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great first arc\\n\r\n+Constant use of MMORPG terms\\n\r\n+The show feels like a game\\n\r\n+Consistent and smooth animation\\n\r\n+Great and interesting characters\\n\r\n+Momonga is OP but his human side is what kept him an interesting character\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Poor 2nd arc\\n\r\n-Directionless plot after the 1st arc\\n\r\n-Not enough screentime for most of Momonga's minions\\n\r\n-Mediocre OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\r\n-Inconclusive Ending",

            "content": "I wrote this review after watching the episode 13 and also finished reading all the volumes of overlord that had been released so far, which is till volume 9. So I have at least quite an understanding of the story so far. But I would not put any spoilers in the review and just general info that people can see from the anime's synopsis description or at most first episode. \r\nBut before I write my review, there is this one glaring point of the anime's story setting that a lot of people seemed to be confused about lately that I have to point out. \r\nManypeople tend to be confused that the main character has been stuck in the game world he is playing in but the truth is that it is Experimented and Proven many times that he is instead Transported into a new fantasy Reality world where Yggdrasil players either don't exist or uncommon to the point of being called legends that only exist hundred of years ago. The only thing he is \"stuck\" in is his skeleton game body when he was transported from his game virtual world to another fantasy reality world. Also another thing, he is not a kid or a teenager, but instead is a blue collar salesman. \\n\\n\r\nSo after clearing that up, let's start my review of the anime. I advise people to rate my review fairly with open mindedness and after proper understanding of the anime and not base on personal reasons, rashness or eccentric personal bias which seems to be quite common lately...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe anime's story followed the novel's story tightly so far, skipping only the unnecessary dialogues. Some people who lacked the attention span, patience or the interest in the story and wanted more actions and excitements immediately may find this anime's start to be boring. But people who actually wanted to enjoy the story's world and development would find that this anime's story is quite interesting, attention to details and descriptive with points of the story from different perspective. \\n\\n\r\nMany people who started reading and enjoyed the novel are there for the literature story in the first place. Sadly, the anime can't be too descriptive about the story But the producers did not sacrifice it to lower the story's quality, just to satisfy certain viewers. Which is a plus for an anime with good story and action. Some people may find it slow at times due the story development but the anime managed to at least squeezed in all the important plot points in the anime without skipping it, which might have otherwise caused confusions to the viewers if some info points was lacking and skipped just to make the anime faster.\\n\r\nWhich Madhouse actually learnt their lesson after being bashed by people about their rushed production on Mahou Sensou and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. \\n\r\nAlso, a lot of the minor details in the anime's story was left out so it may not be as detailed as the novel. But, since the anime was made to advertise the novel in the first place, therefore if the people want more details about it, they have to read it from the novel.\\n\r\nIf the anime is just as detailed as the novel, that will defeat the purpose of making it in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art quality is very good, though as many people had said before that the novel's art may have been better but this is something left for people's personal taste and interests... But speaking it in general, the art is very detailed, beautiful and did not get ruined by censors for now, it may follow similar art styles to the manga at times. But all in all, it is something that is well done. Also, there won't be too much awkward fan service either given that the main protagonist is an undead skeleton. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: 8\\n\r\nThe opening song is epic, the background musics were fitting for many situations in the anime, especially the action scene musics that fits and adds to the mood and atmosphere greatly. The only thing I wished more of, was for producers to make better use of the ending credit song instead of focusing the good song on just Albedo...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nOne of the main protagonist that you will never expect to see in anime till now. A skeleton as a main character with a blue collar working salesman's mentality behind it. The person is very logical, emotionless but interestingly funny at times, who does the most realistic and logical reactions and actions people should expect if they are transported into another world. Keeping up his act as an overlord outside but whining and shouting inside about tiring things and situations. He also never consider his powers to be overpowered since the his skills are known in games and always think that there is someone such as players stronger than him out there. \\n\r\nThe introductions of the many other side characters were also very unique and interesting too. They all have their own detailed designs, personalities, settings and developments. \\n\r\nSadly the only thing lacking in this anime and even the novel, is a strong enemy character that the main characters have to face and overcome... But it is actually fine, since story wise, the story is actually still interesting and mainly draws the viewers to be more interested on how the process the MC used took over the places or even the world, the perspective and reactions of different people in the story which you normally won't see in other stories at times, and also main point of the story that is expected of how the strong overlord crush the enemy in the end after the intended development for it along with the expectations and despair which all together makes it something even more interesting and refreshing to see too, just like picking the fruits after it is ripe for the taking. \\n\r\nAlso it seems there are people rating down the series due to the mc not having an usable underpart? Well, he can actually do it if he wants to and afterall, it's also better for the mc to think logically than thinking using his lower body like some other pervert mcs which are annoying. Besides, it seems pointless for some people to even point this out to talk down a good series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nWell the anime may not be a master piece for some people. But the story's novel is a master piece literature that is the most descriptive, well developed, highly rated and one of the higher quality light novel out there that is highly encouraged by many people to read it to understand their world even more. That is the novel's purpose, as there are many people who enjoyed the novel are there for the literature story in the first place, so it is something that people would be expecting from the anime too but the anime would Not be as detailed to put some points in one episode. Just saying it. \\n\r\nBut here's the point, the anime is popular not because it is a master piece but because there are many other reasons for it. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, unlike the typical hero fantasy animes that are a dime of dozen out there already with almost Similar and Familiar stories and settings. Of course an anime from a villain's perspective would perk people's interest than the typical power from friendship troupes, where you always would expect a certain people to survive in the end or just simply no one dying at all. With many things that are being quite common these days, this actually make this anime more unique and stands out.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, in this world where pretty much everything was cliche, a different, darker virtual gaming world to another world story is actually more new and interesting to people comparing to the typical virtual game or reality to fantasy animes that are quite common out there like no game no life, log horizon, SAO, problem children, etc with similar familiar overlapping fantasy settings or even other different typical animes with a shiny hero or a dense innocent kind mcs, instead a setting different from the typical familiar ones would be fresher one to see. \\n\\n\r\nThirdly, It is one of the animes that do not fill the screen with censors which is very unpopular these days and certainly some parts of the anime's story and action may be rated to be more exciting than some long going animes out there. (not my opinion though) \\n\\n\r\nFinally, if people Do want to immense themselves in settings, atmosphere, plots and details of the story other than just immediate mindless action animes that are dozens out there, they would definitely welcome this anime or even the novel. Given how much of a potential this anime's story have, even till the latest volume I had read so far. I actually personally think that the pacing of the anime is normal or even quite fast looking at the anime's situation itself. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nOverall, as long as the anime is kept to the story without changing from now on which the producers are still doing without rushing or skipping important parts, it will still easily continued to be rated 9 by me.",

            "content": "*SPOILER WARNING* i might have to put some spoilers here and there for this review. I don't think those spoilers are all that relevant, but you have been warned.\r\n-----------------------------\r\nOverlord is truly a mystery to me, in that i feel like i just can't understand its appeal. For some reason a lot of people here have given it a really good score and its average is 8.04 as of now, and I just can't understand what this success comes from. I don't like saying that, but when I watched the show, the two main emotions i felt while watching were boredom from how bad it wasto me and frustration from all the potential it wasted. Why did i feel like that about our savior Ainz Ooal Gown's tale? Let's find out in this review:\\n\\n\r\nThe first problem I have with this show is its visuals. Don't get me wrong, the art is decent, the characters are almost always on model when they're not in CG and some character designs are legitimately good. The issue is that the animation itself does not really move that much, and seeing almost still shots of characters talking about things i don't really care about for at least five minutes per episode without clever directing, storyboarding or art direction to back it up makes me sleepy. Most of the action scenes aren't that visually entertaining either. The action scenes in this show either lack impact or are made with jarring CGI. When i say that the action scenes lack impact, i mean that the directing can make a huge explosion look like it wasn't really strong, even though it just blew an enemy right to the shadow realm. At the beginning of the fight against a certain vampire lady in the last couple of episodes, there's literally minutes and minutes of build-up where momonga is basically buffing himself to be the most overpowered he could be, and then the payoff is an enormous laser thingy falling from the sky... that destroyed trees i guess but didn't feel like the massively destructive blast it should have been. Though i have to give credit to the final fight scene for having somewhat good animation, they almost delivered correctly on that.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that frustrates me in Overlord is the under-exploitation of almost everything the show sets up. In the first episodes, there's a couple of plot points and themes that are set up, just to remain unexploited in the rest of the series, which is a shame because if it expanded on them (and had 24 episodes to do so) the series could have been excellent. Here are a few examples of those unexploited gold mines the show had:\\n\r\n1. The loss of Momonga's humanity: after getting trapped in this fantasy world, momonga changes a bit. If i remember correctly, he doesn't need to eat anymore, and he feels less emotions, especially when it comes to killing people. Now if the changes in his mental state were pushed to the point where he or his servants (i'll come back to them later) would start questioning his actions, that would have been super interesting to me. \\n\r\n2. Momonga's servants: from my understanding, Overlord almost did the same thing as log horizon, where the game's NPCs gained a personality and a backstory. Some of those NPCs are what is, for my money, the most underexploited element of the whole show: the servants. A lot of them seem like they would be awesome if they were to fight, and they seriously need some character development. Most of their designs are at least really good and seeing characters like cocytus, sebas or demiurge get a good fight scene would give me the hardest of all boners (especially cocytus, i wanted to love that guy but he has little to no screen time). Even Albedo could have been made into a likeable character if she had her own character arc. This wouldn't have been as much of a problem if Momonga was a more interesting character and if the show had other qualities to make up for it but it doesn't.\\n\r\n3. Discovering the world of yggdrasil: one of the things momonga sets out to do when he gets trapped is to explore the huge world he is in to find out if there are other trapped players like him. Unfortunately, this is once again something the show fails to exploit as much as it could. The environments aren't all that interesting to look at, and while some game mechanics are rather interesting, the world building is criminally underdone.\\n\r\nThose are not the only frustrating underdone parts of the show, but i feel like they are some of the most important ones.\\n\\n\r\nMy third issue with Overlord is the protagonist himself, the one and only Ainz Ooal Gown aka Momonga-sama (or just Momonga if he doesn't want to attract too much attention)\\n\r\nThe main problem i have with him is that i just don't understand what kind of character he's supposed to be. He is supposedly the most powerful character in the story, yet one of his servants evaluates his chances of survival for the final fight to only 30% or less. \\n\r\nFrom what i've heard that one of the main points of Momonga's character is that he acts like a villain, yet none of the things he does are that cruel. He killed Clementine whom is a lot of people's waifu and that's slightly evil i guess but that doesn't make him that much of a villain. I mean he even legitimately cares a lot about his servants and saves some people who were getting killed by random evil knights in a village.\\n\r\nHe's supposed to have lost some of his humanity or something and then we see him getting embarrassed from times to times, mostly from albedo's sexual needs but also when he literally facepalms about the personality he gave to pandora's actor (the most entertaining character in the show to me)\\n\r\nWhat is so problematic about Momonga being a boring character is that he's one of the only, if not the only relevant appeal of the whole series\\n\\n\r\nAnother annoying thing is that the series kind of fails at making me care about it. Nothing about the world or characters feels like it's going to be so interesting. Yggdrasil seems at first like a stereotypical MMORPG, and unfortunately it stays that way. As soon as Momonga tells his servants to guard the different levels of his huge dungeon thing where he lives i immediately thought \"oh no those cool looking characters are going to be completely irrelevant, what a shame.\"\\n\r\nThe slow pacing doesn't help any of the aforementioned problems.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Overlord mostly suffers from its wasted potential. Is it a bad show? Judging from the number of people who seem to like or even love it, it's up to you. Do i recommend it? Certainly not, everything it does has been done better in a lot of shows.\\n\\n\r\nPlease note that this is my first review, so my writing probably isn't very good. If you disagree with this review (which is most likely the case, i may have missed a few things in the show since i didn't pay that much attention due to how boring it was), i invite you to respectfully comment on my profile about that.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for bearing my terrible writing all the way to the end of this painful review, and have a nice day, whether you believe in the almighty Ainz Ooal Gown or not.\\n\\n",

            "content": "How does this happen?\r\nHow can a series with so much potential just roll over and die, failing to achieve even the basic level of its premise?\r\nWelcome to Overlord, the master at poor writing, completely soulless characters , gratuitous CG and lacking sound. \r\nWhere does Overlord fail? Does it have any redeeming qualities? Let's find out!\r\nStory: Overlord sells itself as a story about a evil mastermind trying to cement his legacy. The lead character, Momonga, is a computer-gamer turned trapped dictator who wants to \"learn\" about the world around him and how its different from the game he used to know. The story is made upof small little arcs that have little to do with each other and feel more like side quests than anything. However, unlike other episodic series, Overlord shows you none of the culture of the world, none of its vivacity, and instead gives you a tour of a hollow, pre-made shell of a fantasy world. Along the way, viewers get complementary exposition dumps, random game terms and long strings of dialogue that succeed at only taking up precious air-time, all free of charge!\\n\\n\r\nThere is no meaningful conclusion, no real progress in the story. Furthermore, due to the sheer difference of power between Momonga's team and their foes, there isn't even any tension in the battle scenes. They (Momonga's band and their foes) just whip magic/skills at each other until one side gives up in the face of the undead might of Momonga's team. \\n\\n\r\nWhat the show does succeed at (barely) is portraying a feeling a loneliness within Momonga. Being trapped in a game all by one's self should be a harrowing experience and the very few moments I believe Overlord got it right was when I saw the cracks in Momonga's ice-cold exterior and saw the human underneath...of course, the show never does anything meaningful with that and that possible character development is just conveniently forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nArt: CG has always had a bad rap when it comes to anime and Overlord is a prime example of CG done...well, decently. The CG skeleton guards and dragons were not actually that bad, but the CG soldiers, on the other hand, are jarring against the drawn landscapes, which, by the way, don't show much variety. Iconic set pieces are extinct in the world of Overlord. Prepare for forests, forests and more forests. Oh wait, you like graveyards? We got you covered! How about castles? Castles IN your Graveyards? Graveyards IN your Castles? Whew. So many choices! \\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, the only aesthetically good part of the series are the character designs for Albedo and Momonga. Everything else is...well, empty. The animation is sub-par to downright ugly at times, even. \\n\\n\r\nSound: OP? Unremarkable. ED? Meh. BGM? What BGM? I literally took no notice of it. I actually tried to listen for it a few times near the end, but between all the dialogue, it got kind of drowned out. The voice acting was okay, but with subs, that shouldn't be a problem in the first place. The only character who I thought had an exceptional VA was Clementine, a minor villain. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There is a massive cast although the majority of Momonga's grunts hardly get screen time for the important bits. Oh, you get Albedo. Tons of Albedo. Her and her obsession with the big bony MC himself...and that's all you really get from her. Oh, and everyone on his team hates humans. Why? Because they were made that way. Not exactly a compelling reason, is it? What do you really know about Nabe? Cocytous? Shaltear? Probably not much more other than their first, generic impressions, huh? \\n\\n\r\nBehind the clunky, forced interactions of the various characters, unexplained backstories and other holes is one of the most empty cast of characters you'll ever see in an anime. You know they're loyal? And? What are their roles? What do they do? Some of them are on screen enough that one would think they'd development some how, but nope. It's like they're on a loop. \"I love you, Momonga-sama!\" \"I hate humans!\" \"Momonga-sama is so powerful!\" Seriously? Is that ALL they can say? They can't even pull of their generic roles with finesse. The filler girls from SAO had more characterization than that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Looking back, other than for a decent first episode, it's hard to recommend this series to anyone. The characters are completely hollow, the story is an clustered mess of generic spirit, the art and sound are barely decent and the premise itself does not come to fruition. \\n\\n\r\nInferno Cop was one thing, but Jesus Christ, how did this show even get the green light for production? That's about 6 hours of my life I will never get back. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot, in good confidence, give this anime anything higher than a 3/10. It is a borderline failure as both an original work and even as a clone of SAO, which looks like ambrosia compared to this seething pile of sewage. Thank goodness it at least looks and sounds passable or I'd give it a 2. \\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is this: If you're looking for an evil mastermind, look no further than the staff behind this show. They're out to waste precious minutes of your life, one pathetic episode at time.",

That being said, this anime took an interesting turn to making a story involving an op character more enjoyable with development.  Even though the story was dull at times, it was mostly enjoyable 8/10\r\nArt: Art style was pretty unique to me since they incorporated 2d images with 3d. Since the anime was mostly 2d, the 3d parts were still really well executed without it being feeling laggy. It's not the most beautiful artworkor most exciting, but I'm giving it a 10/10 b/c it just fits the story really well imo\\n\\n\r\nSound: honestly I dont really know how to grade this, but since I didn't have a problem with the sound im giving it a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters were honestly pretty dull, they could have provided more variety but most of them were just one dimensional and sometimes annoying. There were some interesting minor characters, so I think if they ever have a 2nd season I know that the developers will improve in creating more diverse characters.  6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I had a very fun time watching this, it mostly seems like people anticipated too much from this. I went into watching this show just hearing that it had pretty good fights and didn't have that much anticipation, so I think that's why I could appreciate this anime. I would recommend this if you enjoy watching an op character/ fight scenes/ and some humor. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 Recommend",

Everything only felt like it was ready to fully dive into the world at large by the end of the entire thing. They set up all the plot devices, show where things could go, begin taking actions...and that's it. Nothing wraps up. As a standalone experience, this anime is lacking.\r\nThere is almost no story to speak of. I say this, somewhat, tentatively as there is clearly a lot that is alluded to. But, forwhat we actually get, you just kinda take the general idea of Log Horizon and limit it to one character, but this character is quick to point out that they really don't like the real world anyway. So, they make due and start their new life trying to figure out the world out as they go!\\n\r\nEnd Plot.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art, it's on the upper end of things, character designs are interesting and the general world looks good. Note that that is art, not animation. As for the animation, the take a pretty lazy way out and appear fond of close ups on the main character's face when he's talking; which involves a lot of you staring at a close up of a still shot of a skull.\\n\\n\r\nSounds are fine, nothing stands out, but nothing to make you cringe.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters ended up being the primary reason I watched through the 13 episodes. They appear to be very well fleshed out with varying personalities and histories that are never fully realized, which is an utter shame, but it's worth note that the main character actually ended up being the one I was the least interested in.\\n\\n\r\nI guess you could compare this anime to a really big, expensive, cream puff. It's light, tasty, and enjoyable while it lasts, but it leaves you wanting and realizing you spent a lot of money(time) on something that doesn't really satisfy. Now, you're hungry and have less money to get something of substance.\\n\r\nIn simple terms it's a waste of time.",

            "content": "Overlord is an anime that revolves around MMORPG themed world. Now, I have already watched similar anime shows like Sword Art Online and Log Horizon; but Overlord has succeeded in telling a story that is based on RPG in a different way. \r\nFirst of all, the story takes place in the online world of Yggdrasil where the main character is Momonga, a man who tried to log out of the game but he couldn't. Suddenly, Momonga sees that the AI characters started to act like normal people and they each exhibit a certain personality. He realizes that he is stuck in the game as apowerful wizard. \\n\\n\r\nMomonga starts to explore more about the world that he is stuck in. While he is exploring, he seeks his fellow friends who used to play the game with him. In this journey, he encounters some problems and learns more about the world that he is living in.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Sword Art Online, the main goal of the story is not to get out of the game, but it's to discover the world and to seek some people. Overlord's story is nothing special over Log Horizon or Sword Art Online. However, like all the anime shows, Overlord has its positives and negatives. If I want to point out some of these points, I would say that showing a cliche story from a different angle was somewhat a success but not a full success, as it lacks many things. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were not that interesting, but they were OK. The show doesn't show much of the characters background which is not good. furthermore, most of the characters cannot be seen in action.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't know what I can say about the art. I cannot say much, the art and animation were good, but I will not say that they were amazing, they were just decent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime gives you a different experience from Sword Art Online and Log Horizon, but I cannot say that it could be a better one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall rate: 8/10",

            "content": "** Will contain spoiler for the overall \u201estoryline\u201c and major spoiler for the ending**\r\nTake about 6-7 different storylines, mash them together and you get Overlord. What started out really cool, ended in a disaster. Even now I couldn't tell you what the main storyline was.\r\nAt first you think it is about finding some artifact and getting to know the world around the castle the main char lives in. But then you get a completely different storyline about joining somekind of mercenary guild to get information, which leads to another storyline with some weird psychos and suddenly you get the final storyline being the mindcontrolled Shalltear,while none of the storylines before get really solved. You have to guess how they tie in into the \u201emain-story\u201c if you can decide what the main story is.\\n\r\nThe plot is all over the place, with a couple of holes in the story that get infodumped on you in some other scene. The infodumping is a problem in itself. There a lot of moments where something just gets explained, which wouldn't be bad, if it wasn't so often. Sometimes you get scenes where something is explained, then shown and then explained again, which is a bit tiring in the end. Also it slows the pacing really down, which is something that can kill this kind of anime.\\n\r\nAll of the fight scenes follow the same scheme, which is really sad, because they could've been really good. There were a lot of potential in the fight scenes, but they couldn't live up to it, a main reason for that was the recurrent explanation of the spells the characters were using. Especially the last fight against Shalltear was so anticlimatic, that it wasn't even fun anymore to watch. Also you always get the same formula: Momon waits until the enemy is exhausted, just to get his trump card out and tell the enemy that that was, what he was planning all along. It just gets boring when every fight is nearly the same.\\n\\n\r\nYou get a lot of cool characters, but none of them are shown in depth, instead you get even more characters, more names and more confusing storylines and rules. Some of the characters seem to be important for the main plot, but never really show up again or it isn't explained what happened to them. This is were a lot of the storyholes get really unnerving.\\n\r\nThe main character Momon/Ainz Ooal Gown is really shallow and kinda boring. In the beginning I didn't mind how OP he was, but in the end it just gets kinda lame, because they try to trump him over and over again. He was also very inconsistent with the use of his weapons. That is one of the things that doesn't get explained really well, because it fell in one of the random storyholes you get throughout the episodes. \\n\r\nLike in the fight scenes there was a lot of potential in the characters, which just didn't come close to what it could've been. Instead you feel like they are some kind of ensemble, only used when needed.\\n\r\nThere were also a lot of conflicts that could've been cool, but they were never really touched again, after introducing them (like Albedo vs. Shalltear etc.). Also the story with Sebas doesn't really get a lot of explanation. The last five to six episodes you see him traveling through the country and in the end he is sitting in a castle looking out of the window into a storm.\\n\r\nThe subplots are just really all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nThe last two episodes were so hilarious I couldn't even take it serious anymore. He summoned a sharknado, that should tell you enough. The ending is a massive cliffhanger setting up a second season, but when you finish the first one, you don't want another. The ending is so disappointing and open. You don't even know what to think.\\n\r\nWhile you get the feeling that you should be happy, that the group is together again and making jokes, you just get a lot of question marks for the rest of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this, because thanks to the massive infodumping, non-existing mainplot, bad fight scenes and seemingly unimportant characters that have a lot of potential, you simply don't get enough out of it to justify watching thirteen episodes of this anime. The best thing was the giant hamster <3",

            "content": "So you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cok this anime is a little weird\u2026\u201d Correct. It is a little, but weird is by no means bad. Overlord is often likened to Log Horizon or the ever controversial Sword Art Online due to its \u201cstuck-in-a-game\u201d roots. But unlike the aforementioned where one is simply stuck in a game, Overlord places you in a new world. It\u2019s not quite the reality you\u2019re used to, but there\u2019s a few more dimensions than the game itself had. In this sense this anime is more like an exploration of a new world with gaming elements rather than purely a pre-existing game world.\r\nFascinated? Wellyou should be! While only a 13 episode series this anime covers some pretty cool content. There\u2019s a lot to take in, but it makes the discovery of this new world fun by not giving you all the answers right away. In fact, no one seems to have all the answers in this new world. And with no wikipedia page to turn to you\u2019re left to discover it with the main characters. It may sound a little frustrating, but think of it from the perspective of Dora the Explorer and you\u2019ll realise it\u2019s the most exciting thing since cotton candy.\\n\r\nA heavy focus is placed on Ains Ooal Gown, or Momonga, to reference his auxiliary name. And while we get some great insights into his personality, perspective and goals, we also realise he should never have children, because god forbid what he will name them. No but seriously, the focus on him is so heavy that the other characters seem to lack development and differentiating qualities outside of Albedo\u2019s intensely awkward over obsession and Mare\u2019s adorable shyness.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one final problem with this anime. This is that with Momonga being made so impeccably strong complications barely feel like complications. You know everything will be fine and it slightly detracts from what could otherwise be suspenseful moments.\\n\\n\r\nYet as this isn\u2019t the end of the storyline these harsh comments must be taken with a grain of salt\u2026or a shot of vodka, whichever puts you more at ease. While one can\u2019t say for sure, there\u2019s every possibility if a second season is made it will fill in the blanks of the first. The animation and sound is also done really well with some strong fight scenes to keep you enthralled and appealing colours to keep your eyes smiling.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line? This is an entertaining fantasy anime, yet it has the potential to be so much better by fixing its few flaws. My fingers are crossed for a second season",

            "content": "Overlord offers an unoriginal storyline - the usual lines of a player being stuck in a virtual MMO world, which is rather unnecessary as a setting. The main character Momonga seems to have little or no motivation in returning to his homeworld whatsoever. The entire story seems centered around his immense power, and spreading his name throughout the world his guild of NPCs were transported to, littering every few minutes of the show with his declaration of the might of \"Ains Ooal Gown\" either by himself or by his minions. It may appeal a little at first, but it just gets repetitive over time. \r\nStory:There were some attempts at light humour, sometimes sexual in nature. Overall, the storyline was rather bland, although the MMO setting was interesting (with the magic items and talents and all), but the story, at least within the confines of the anime, fails to develop sufficient intrigue with regards to the plot. I found myself forcing myself to complete the show for no purpose in particular, nothing compelled me to want to continue watching, i just wanted to get it done with.\\n\r\nPerhaps the lack of a challenge was the main problem, think of the show as a combination of One-Punch Man's overpoweredness and Mahouka's mental fapping \"Onii-sama\", except that it now extends to an entire dungeon full of NPCs worshipping the \"Supreme Being\", not just one imoutou. Momonga literally wiped the floor with just about everyone, Aizen-sama fashion, with even some \"all according to plan\" reference.\\n\\n\r\nArt was okay, never had much requirements to begin with, although perhaps the use of a skeleton face/helmet was to save animation costs. Sound wise, the OP was alright, didnt bother listening to the full ED. Characters are bland and single-dimensioned. Overall it was an average show at best, lousy if you wanted to be really critical. Would not really recommend this unless you have plenty of time to burn.",

            "content": "When you are trapped in a virtual reality game, the natural thing to do is to find a way out. But when your VR persona is that of the most powerful demon sorcerer ever, that\u2019s when things get interesting. \r\nThe whole show is carried on the shoulders of the title character, the Overlord. Satoshi Hino gives a terrific dual performance as the mage demon master Ainz Ooal Gown and as the human player Momonga providing a monologue and narrative. Ainz serves as the anti-heroic character who strives to conquer the world for his own desire, and Momonga is the simple player who only wishes tolocate other gamesters like himself in the new world. It\u2019s a fascinating character and Hino does him great credit with his voice. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond the Overlord himself, the rest of the cast are not as developed, but they get enough time and character to stand out; Yumi Hara in particular makes a lasting impression as a passionate demon who gets emotionally carried away frequently. The animation and music is also above average and complements the story well. \\n\\n\r\nThe show, however, is far too brief to tell its story adequately, and so is confined to introducing its characters and the world and only a brief space to show them off, and then ends on a cliffhanger. This is an incredible story that deserves more than 13 episodes, and its being cut off so early makes the whole fantasy tragically disappointing. Thankfully, the story is carried on in the manga that runs in parallel to the show, so if you want more you should check out that comic. \\n\\n\r\nAs brief as it is, the show is still a fantastic saga that deserves a lot of love and makes for a great watch. \\n",

            "content": "OBLIGATORY SPOILER WARNING\r\n-So Overlord is one of those animes that should be great, a kids wet dream. Who doesnt want to be the Lich King from WOW or as op as One Punch Man? Its a very unique idea to play as the final boss of a game rather than the ones trying to get to the final boss (like Sword Art Online).\r\n-The problem with this anime is its poor execution in every way.\r\nThere is 0 character development. Some reviewers have mentioned that the main characters humanity seems to be slowly slipping away by the end of the show but that would mean that hehad an emotional range to begin with. He is bland and hypocritical throughout. At one point even referring to the fact that this is so. This doesnt make it any less frustrating. At one point our main character is masquerading as a common adventurer and joins an up and coming guild while hiding his true power (just like Sword Art Online) and then 3 episodes later after hearing countless minues of these characters interact they are all slaughtered and the main character does not even care. Passively mentioning that he had just met them. It makes the 3 episodes of their development completely pointless and makes the \"Overlord\" far less sympathetic.\\n\\n\r\n-There is a long list of supporting characters and their designs are mostly interesting such as lolita vampires, tsundere succubus, A nazi changeling who cracks jokes, etc. But the characters are all one dimensional-they spend all of the show praising the main character, even at the end when one of them betrays the group she still praises the main characters power during the battle. It is incredibly dull and does nothing to diversify their interests or motivations. If you have a thing for large breasted characters though the head guardian will certainly please, constantly trying to get a skeleton mind you, to have sex with her.\\n\\n\r\n-The story is nonexistent. The main character was the head of large guild in an MMO and then gets stuck in it after shutdown for reasons that are never explained. What happened to his body? Who knows? who cares apparently. There are at least 5 instances where the main character talks about putting the castle that he lords over on high alert or concealing it from enemies which sounds good on paper but during the course of the show there is never an enemy introduced who could defeat his subordinates let alone penetrate his castle. By the end of the show we still havent met any additional human characters stuck in the game, he has not conquered any portion of the world, and has not learned any meaningful new power or ability. In short nothing actually happens except they get a giant hamster, walk around a village stopping small fry, and fight amongst each other (the 2 episode end fight) for reasons that are never clearly explained. \\n\\n\r\n-I wanted to like this show so much and maybe a season 2 would speed things up for me and make it more interesting but as of season 1 i can not recommend this show to anyone except those who are fans of fanservice and the general idea of people getting stuck in video games.\\n\\n\r\n-The biggest problem with this show that I simply cant get around is it is so dull. There are 4 \"real\" fights in this 13 episode show and during these fights the characters spend as much time talking about how great and unstoppable they are rather than doing anything interesting. There is no suspense when you know that our protagonist can obliterate everyone on a whim if he so chooses-which he often does not. Instead it takes 15 minutes for the use of one or two spells that would have ended the fight in mere seconds. For a show called Overlord you would think there would be more lording and less walking around and talking which is simply not the case.",

            "content": "I'm gonna be totally honest here and put it all on the table right now before I start this review: this show was basically garbage. I do not, and probably will not ever understand the hype and critical success that this anime got. I can't even give it points for creativity since it's basically just a ripoff of SAO with a few minor changes to effectively dodge copyright. But if I'm honest, even SAO had less annoying and redundant characters than the disaster that was Overlord, and a plot that made even a smidgen more sense. I'm a huge fan of Madhouse and everything thatit does, but this show was legitimately hard to watch from even episode 1, with a dull and poorly-paced story, pathetic and bland characters, and a protagonist that made me wonder how this author thought he was a good idea to place in the reins of narration.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nLet's start off with a bang, rating the story at 3. It revolves around Momonga, the fictitious and other-worldly persona of our protagonist, who we scarcely are ever reminded of throughout the plot of this trainwreck. Momonga is caught inside of a game he played with some friends after it is unfortunately shut down. That is really the only explanation we get as to why he is stuck in the game, and even that makes no sense whatsoever. So right off the bat we have a huge plot hole that leaves a lot to be desired, but hey, not very many shows can accomplish it all. \\n\r\nMomonga longs to get out of the game and return to the real world, so he decides that if there are any other people like him left in the game, maybe getting his name out there will help them find a solution. He gets caught in a lot of side-quests along the way, which is pretty realistic to how MMORPGs can be sometimes, admittedly. But some time between episode 1 and episode 13, something goes horribly wrong. The story takes no real direction and gets no real antagonist or major plot arc. Any villain is easily outsmarted and out-strengthened by Momonga and his posse, making all the major battles feel so flat it's like they were just there to blow some time. We're introduced to villains that look like they could be strong and foreboding, but they never get any actual time to show their stuff before they're blown to pieces, so we never know exactly how strong Momonga or the villains are.\\n\r\nA lot of people compared this show to One Punch Man on the basis that they had very similar premises and plots. And this is true, but the difference of quality in the two shows is extremely noticeable, just by they way they are executed. OPM never takes itself too seriously, and our overpowered protagonist is actually bored with the power that he has. His goal is to find a real challenge, and when one potentially comes in its last major arc, it turns out he was just sympathizing with his enemy and really could punch him into the sun at any given time. In addition, Saitama just looks goofy, so the show is meant to immediately come across as almost parodic. This makes the emotional or awesome moments just that much more impressive. OPM's central conflict revolves around the fact that nobody notices the amazing stuff that Saitama does, which is jarringly different from the way everybody just kisses Momonga's ass the entire show. In contrast, Overlord takes itself far too seriously, considering Momonga suffers the exact same symptoms as OPM's Saitama. However, Momonga continually serves as internal exposition, and leaves little to the actual plot or other characters, or even the viewer's own intuition. Momonga doesn't give us time to think or breathe before he's doing something new (and usually extremely effective), and it makes you wonder how this guy was ever just a normal dude. He possesses crazy strategic advantages over his enemies, which is strange even for an avid RPG player.\\n\r\nI could get into all the little plot holes and issues that this show presented, but a lot of my issue lies within other areas as well, and saying everything here could cause potential spoilers.\\n\r\nIn addition to everything stated above wrong with the plot, Overlord uses the fact that it's an RPG as a scapegoat for a lot of the shit it pulls. If it weren't for a few details of the show and its exposition, it would be easy to forget that it's all a game. That is, without Momonga reminding the viewer of it in his head every 5 goddamn minutes. It uses its game-based setting to excuse its shitty background character designs, lazy character writing, and overall poor story structure throughout the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nNot gonna lie, Madhouse (very briefly) delivered a lot of beautiful visuals with Overlord. The character designs are all so unique and diverse, and the animation was pretty good for the first few episodes. The quality significantly drops over the course of the show, but it keeps its interesting color schemes and awesome designs all throughout. The background characters are all pretty boring-looking and flat, but I'll leave that to the fact that it is an RPG and most NPCs are just copy-pastes of all the other ones.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nThe OST for this show was pretty much dreadful, with a lot of jarring music that just did not fit the scenes and atmosphere I'm sure it intended. Besides that, the voice acting was overall pretty flat as well, while the OP and ED were good to a certain extent. The OP was extremely generic, full of bad CG skeletons and blocky transitions. In its defense, the song was pretty damn catchy. The ED was also horribly simplistic, with just a lot of blinding, creepy shots of Albedo (arguably the most annoying female character in anime) and, while the song in the ED was also pretty catchy, it just didn't fit the tone of the rest of the show, nor Albedo as a character. I'm sure they intended for her to be creepy and edgy, but everything she did in the end just turned out embarrassing and comically obnoxious. I was either facepalming or laughing at the stupidity of her writing. Overall, the only thing that brought this OST up from a 1 to a 4 was the fact that the OP and ED were catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nI would give this a 0 if I could. Easily some of the worst-written characters in anime came from Overlord. I could say so much, but let's start with the protagonist, Momonga.\\n\r\nMomonga is the flattest, least dynamic MC I have seen in any anime. And, yes, I did watch SAO. Kirito was better somehow. Momonga just seemed to know EVERYTHING and was able to do EVERYTHING and he was idolized to the point that it made me sick and bored as hell to keep watching. He left no room for competition or a proper fight, and for a guy that's supposed to be evil, he really only kills the bad guys or characters that are just so unlikeable you don't care if they kill him or if he kills them. His moral compass is all over the place, as he only seems to keep the peaceful NPCs around for information or for spreading his name. I get it, he wants to go home and these NPCs can help him. But he's also supposed to be a human, so you'd think he'd show a little more compassion or anger or SOMETHING besides just what you'd expect any fantasy overlord to be. He holds no value as a protagonist, or as a character in general that we want to follow for 13 episodes. He is basically any generic game-based, light novel adaptation anime protagonist except now he's a ~~skeleton~~ ooh.\\n\r\nHis posse consists of a bunch of people that are absolutely crazy for him. That's it. That's the extent of their characters. They are just so horribly hard to watch, and you'd think that they'd eventually gain their own personalities as time goes on and become more dynamic as they go on. Nah. Instead, we just get some weird brainwashing (for REASONS that are not explained) that is supposed to turn them into antagonists for Momonga to defeat and have remorse over fighting, but instead they still fall over their feet worshiping him. Albedo is the worst of it, as she is literally programmed to be horribly in love with him. She gets in his way and never listens to his orders, and is unlikeable as a character, love interest, or anything else she may have been intended to be. These characters never change in any direction and hardly have any personalities outside of, \"I love u momonga please let me lick the ground you walked on.\" This is another thing that the show tries to excuse with the fact that it's a game, but if I'm honest, that is no excuse for shitty writing. They could have at least made Momonga a bit more interesting, but nope, that takes too much effort and they just want to make some money selling off sexy Albedo body pillows to gross neckbeard otakus.\\n\r\nWhen the show introduces new characters/NPCs and gives them background and plot relevance, it kills them off just for the sake of doing so. However, the general atmosphere of this show and how it lays out its extremely one-dimensional and flat characters makes it hard to feel emotional when they die, even with the show constantly pushing it into your face and saying, \"HERE, BE SAD, IT WAS A SAD SCENE!\" The \"emotional\" music and colors it uses clash heavily with Momonga, who treats everyone he meets as either necessary for his plans or something to ignore or kill.\\n\r\nThe first major villain you ever meet has her own arc for a few episodes (rather late into the show, might I add) before she is discarded just like all the other minor villains. She doesn't seem to mean much to the plot or Momonga and in general just feels like a waste of time and money, even if her premise and design was pretty cool. The only other threat to Momonga would be when his subordinate gets brainwashed, but even that doesn't go very far since she still would die for him at any given moment even when she's supposed to be evil.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: 2-3\\n\r\nI pretty much only sat through all 13 episodes of this just so I could tell people how bad it was. Once I got around to the first major antagonist, I knew there was no way this show could redeem itself from its trainwreck of a beginning. Don't waste your time with this show, no matter how high it's rated or how many people say, \"well the art is pretty!\" There's a million other shows that have done this concept way better than Overlord could've ever hoped to do, so go and find those instead.",

            "content": "You may have been led to believe that Overlord is similar to Sword Art Online.Well,it isn't. At all. Calling them similar is like saying that a cat and a dog are similar because they are both pets.It's actually closer to One Punch Man than SAO. So now that we clarified this let's break it down in categories.\r\n-Story 7-\r\nThe idea of the anime is very good but the anime lacks closure.You get the feeling that the anime is ~52 episodes long but actually it's actually a quarter of that. It starts with the MC who's Magic Caster Skeleton in the once popular DMMORPG (Dive Massively MultiplayerOnline Role Playing Game) \"Yggdrasil\" (What's up with Japan and European Mythology?) admiring the Guild House of the greatest faction in the game, acting on his role of Guild Master until the servers will finally close. Surprisingly (not really) after the timer hit 00:00 the game interface disappeared and he was no longer able to bring up the console. Stuck in this world he now tries to make a name of himself in search for any old allies. It should be noted that his Guild House is no longer in the game but in a whole new world he has to learn about.\\n\\n\r\n-Art 9-\\n\r\nThe animation is outstanding with beautiful landscapes, the battles are great and all the characters are well defined...well all \"main\" characters. You can somewhat see what characters are important by looking at how distinguishable they are. This is why the Art can't get a perfect score.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound 7-\\n\r\nThe sound is nice, the voice actors are good and so on but there's nothing memorable. I binge watched all 13 episodes back to back but I can't remember the intro or the outro. They were pretty plain and uninteresting but good enough to be worth at least a 7.\\n\\n\r\n-Character 7- \\n\r\nI saw a lot of reviews and recommendations that state the MC is overpowered. Well he is not overpowered at all. The reason he is strong is simply stated in the first episode : He was max level and had God Level items. In addition the NPC's that guarded the guild (and are now alive) are pretty close to his strength. Anyway the one problem with the characters is the fact that there is little to no character development. All the characters are slapped in the viewer's face with almost no background story. The (now ex) NPCs were created by the MC ex-colleagues and act on the personality they were given. The rest of the characters have a slight trace of background story since they mention a few things about them.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 9-\\n\r\nI liked watching it since I like stories that are set in the middle ages and include magic and a lot of fighting. The problem is nothing major really happens and there were episodes where boredom was the defining word.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall 8-ish-\\n\r\nI believe it is a score fit for this anime since it manages to make you watch it then leave you deserted because there's no 14th episode even if anime like One Piece has millions of episodes without ever completing the fucking story either. If there's no season 2 , the producers deserve to burn in hell.",

            "content": "Overlord has a special place for me personally, while the overarching idea behind it is nothing  new (as anyone that's read a summary well knows) it approaches it in a rather new and interesting way. \r\nThe art, sound, and animation are all well done I'm not going to pine over them beyond that. \r\nIt's the characters that were strangely grabbing to me, while they all fill known archetypes I found something unique in each of them. I wouldn't really call what happens 'character development', but overlord has a way of giving you more and more insight into the characters without requiring the characters themselvesto actually develop. For fear of giving away too much I will remain a bit fuzzy on that.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say there will be no shonnen style power ups as all the main characters start out at the 'top of the food chain' so to speak. I don't feel saying that much is a spoiler as it's made rather obvious from the start. The only real question that persist is exactly how strong are they? \\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of this particular anime for me is that it kept me interested and held me even though it never gave me a sense of real tension. There was a certain something here I can't quite put my finger on that had me watch all 13 episodes 3 times over.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the basics though, there is plenty of action, the only sad part is what is available now is very much an incomplete story, and ends rather abruptly just as you are really starting to get involved. --and right as it's revealed there may actually be a real antagonist on the horizon. \\n\\n\r\nSadly because it is madhouse, in addition to the solid art and animation we get the downside, we may be forced to wait sometime for a second season. This show was well received and the serialization is also selling well though. The fact I am truly looking forward to more is the best endorsement I can give this show. \\n\\n\\n\r\n8/10 overall, mostly losing points for that sudden cutoff at the end and the iffy status of it continuing at this point in time.",

But don't fret, as it takes a different path than other anime of the same scenario. I say this because instead of following a protagonist trying to escape the virtual world, we get an \"antagonist\" trying to take it over.Or is he? Hes just a desk worker stuck in a Lichs body. I'd rather not go into deep detail about it and end up spoiling this amazing story, so ill end this portion with theonly reason it scored a 9 is because some small portions were cut out from the Light Novel, and the story is left unfinished. Season 2???\\n\\n\r\n**Quick Tip** If you're one of the 2 minutes and I quit watching people, I recommend waiting one full episode, you wont regret it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 \\n\\n\r\nNow of course Madhouse did this, so outstanding art is to be expected, but much credit should also go to so-bin, the illustrator for the Light Novel, and a truly amazing artist. Madhouse did a great job of bringing his characters to life.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nIn this section, id just like to point out that both the Opening titled Clattonia and the Ending \"L.L.L.\" are truly amazing, and on my iPod and throughout the whole season, i didn't skip either, which is quite rare. They both go along with the anime so well that its hard to believe they weren't made for the anime itself. The voice actors are also quite talented, and have been in many other anime besides Overlord. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\\n\r\nThis is the lowest scoring section because character development is rather hard to do for a 12 episode series, when the focus is on more than 4 people, and i have bias because I've read the LNs. Unfortunately, you dont get to see some characters expand past the original tropes, though, of course the MC is quite fleshed out and the other characters are quite fun as well. If you'd like to see more character depth, join my Overlord Season 2 Prayer Group, or pick up the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\\n\r\nThis would be a shoe in for anime of the year for me if One Punch Man wasn't currently airing. Overlord was the first anime I actually stayed up whilst constantly refreshing my page, to see if the new episode was uploaded. Its also the only anime which succeeded in making me read the light novels. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIf your on the fence about watching this anime, I beg you to watch it, its truly amazing, and to miss out on it due to a slightly over done premise would be a true shame.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any specific questions about the anime, or have any advice for reviews, please message me, as it would be much appreciated.\\n\\n",

The fight scenes amazing though mostly one sided and the character development is not rushed although the series only has 13 episodes though it only focuses on few of the characters. The main reason why the anime isnt given a higher score is becausethe story is too short as i mentioned before not all the characters are given the appropriate screen time and also the season end up when things are really getting intersting. The first season definitely left me wanting more i have high hopes for season two and look forward to see how they continue on from here",

            "content": "First off, a lot of people compare this show to SAO, just like every trapped-in-MMORPG show these days, which isn't necessarily a good thing. However, since we are on this page, I will explain where I think this show thrived where SAO failed in its setting. Yes, the main character is overpowered, but unlike SAO, the setup for how he became overpowered is something I find more believable. He didn't suddenly gain powers out of nowhere like OP Jesus-kun. Everyone around him suddenly became weaker. This show never pretends like he's unstoppable or infallible (evidence presented later on where he is only able to getby in one incident through openly cheating). Whereas Kirito from SAO presents himself to be genuinely cocky, it is made clear the main character's behavior is all an act, and he isn't actually confident in what he's doing at all. He is at worst a chuunibyou (heh).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like watching strategy games, this is essentially one of them. The name of the game is using deception to make people believe you are who you present yourself to be and further manipulate them to your advantage. In this way, people should be comparing the show more to Death Note. I still feel, however, that parts of the story may be a little convoluted or lacking in explanation. For this reason, I felt the story was overall very good instead of great.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI cannot tell people enough how much I adore the art style of this show. It almost feels like I'm back to the old days of watching all the spooky fun characters of Soul Eater, where it is practically Halloween every day. The two art styles are still very different, but the combination of fun, imaginative, dark, and sometimes cute greatly appeals to me. Although I would give a 10/10 for the art style, there were some problems in the CGI for the overall animation quality. For this reason, I will try to give the art a more critical score of only great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI feel Overlord's instrumentals and use of chorus in their soundtrack fits well with the show's fun and spooky conquest theme. Most of the instrumental music isn't exactly what I would call a masterpiece, but the whole reason for why I took notice to this show was MYTH&ROID's fantastic ending song \"L.L.L.\" It is a band that I greatly favor for its ability to create unique songs that still sound great, and after listening to it a few times, I felt I had to check this anime out. I also greatly enjoyed the opening theme. I'm an anime opening person, so I like that initial hype-up before the show. Between having a decent soundtrack and a masterful beginning and ending, I have given this a rating of very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI believe my first paragraph explains well how I feel about the main character not being a complete jerk, but what about the rest of the characters? While I enjoy the character designs of the main character and his servants, only some depth of character is explored for each servant. It does not go too far down into their depth of personalities from what I watched in this particular season. The main development focus is instead on the main character. (Particular servants are highlighted in the next season). Their enemies are also ill-defined at this point, and most that do show up are just copy-paste enemies from any generic show. With only one person having any real personal development, I have to rate character currently only good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you have been reading my review carefully up to now, it should start to become clear why I particularly enjoy this show. Strategy through deception, fun spooky conquest, the great music, emotional development of the main character. I do find the RPG fighting aspects to be a bit convoluted and wish there was more I could get out of the other characters of the story. That is why I cannot go higher than a great rating (rather than outstanding).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Overlord is another trapped-in-MMORPG copy with a slightly different rendition, but what ideas are not recycled these days? To me, it's not about being completely original but how you make it your own, and the creator of Overlord took on this challenge, presenting it at a new and somewhat fresh angle where instead of having the main character become overpowered over time, the relative strength of his enemies is completely changed up instead. Overlord is the first trapped-in-MMORPG story that I found genuine enjoyment in without falling flat later on, so I figure they did something right for somebody at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe one major problem I have with this anime is its lack of feeling of danger. While there have been times he has come close to losing, most things in their world do not pose a threat to the main character, at least not at this point of the story where his truly (hopefully) powerful enemies live in the shadows. Until he has real, tangible reason to worry for himself and his servants', the show can only be so good for me. I like a more chaotic theme to my stories, and a main character that remains completely in control does not pose anything interesting to me. For this and the other reasons explained above, I will rate the Overlord anime as very good, but it could get better, hopefully, one day. (I am not familiar with the source material.)",

But its more bout the comedy behind it too between the characters. The main character's profile was very honest and didn't seem fake which was amazing because you dont see that alot in these types of anime. The battle scene definitely gave me chills for example the gore was displayed beautiful. The characters were carefully profiled I really recommend you to give the first episode a try before judging it because I'm in love with this anime and I can't waitfor season 2. I think the only slight thing that bothered me is the main characters past or real identity isn't clear or portrayed at all in the show which upset me. But as long as it becomes clear in season 2 then it should be fine",

Oh look another SAO copycat because why not!\r\nThe reason why some people hate overlord is because they think SAO is the best original isekai show hands down in existence which is of course BULLSHIT.\r\nAt the point of time overlord was released, people did not want to accept Isekai as a new genre of anime. They would rather brand overlord as a copycat of SAO then accepting the fact that it is just anotheranime in the same genre. Such as School, mecha, fantasy, action.\\n\\n\r\nShould overlord be what SAO could have been? No. The idea people transported to a game world, trapped then dying in the game means dying in real life is actually a good concept imho.\\n\\n\r\nOverlord takes a more darker approach in the isekai genre. And even though the MC is kind of overpowered, AT LEAST there is some sort of strategy seen in the anime AND no feeling of plot armor.\\n\\n\\n",

(6/10)\r\nIf all the characters, or at least almost all of then be like Momonga, I think the anime would have better characters, for me, Albedo, Shalltear (etc) are bad characters, so a 6/10 is fair, at least for me.\r\nArt and Animation.

The animation (without CGI) is a 6/10 or 7/10 animation, but the CGI is basically... REALLY BAD.\\n\r\nStory. (3/10)\\n\r\nSorry Overlord fans... But Overlord is just one more \"Isekai\" with a generic and clich\u00e9 story, and a BAD story too...\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6,5/10)\\n\r\nAs i said in another of my reviews, i think the enjoyment is something more personal than critical, so MY enjoyment wasn't bad, I've liked some battles, the sound and one specific character (Momonga), so i think that i have a good or a \"fair\" enjoyment (I used \"fair\" because that this is the 6/10 score of the reviews).\\n\r\nOverall. (6/10)\\n\r\nAlmost of my scores are six, and I think that this anime isn't all bad, it has some good points, so a 6/10 is fair.\\n\\n\\n",

From Kadokawa the makers of many great anime titles such as: Heavens Lost Property, Spice and Wolf, Steins Gate, Deadman Wonderland, Ect. This anime is a great step forward from the typical anime concerning videogame life, Rather then showing the struggles of getting out of said game or trying to live a new life; The main character shows that he will be continuing the life style he has always had online. This Brings out the great concept of not just adapting or forcing tolive in a new worlds but shows how one would move on.\\n\r\n  The over all story and characters are good, however the art is not perfect. There is CG in some areas of the plot mainly during fight scenes, and the sounds and voices and sometimes get annoying but not overly. However the regular animation is something to be marveled, this improves the anime as a whole quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOver all I like the feel of this anime and i believe that the second season will be worth watching as well. i would give this an 8/10.",

He's not really the most socially intelligent guy, but he's got the gear and the game knowledge to accomplish his goals with his allies.\r\nThe story is a bit slow and the art isn't super original looking, but I think it captures a generic MMO environment sort of ok. If you haven't played MMOs long enough to have beenin the same situation as the main character you probably won't appreciate Overlord as much since he's kind of the redeeming factor in an otherwise average anime.",

With a small fortune, nigh-limitless ability and a devoted team of subordinates to do?\r\nOverlord spins the tail of a man trapped in the world of an MMORPG with a fantastic spin from the likes of other popular shows including sword art online. Thrust into the thick of the show, Momonga, distressed at first, wastes no time fondling a large breasted NPC, equipping the worlds best armor set and exploring the new world with God-Tierability.\\n\\n\r\nImagine having access to all end-game items in a popular MMORPG then the servers reset everyone to beginner levels except you. Momonga, as the plot demands, has no friends, family or electric bill as  he spends countless hours in the world he refers is similar to Yggdrasil. Other non-playable characters now have a pulse, distinct personalities and voice actors that put the previous game to shame -- they also have complete trust and faith that their lord Momonga is God and will throw down their lives as guardians to the success and glory of the power wizard.\\n\\n\r\nCompeting in the new game world as a magic caster with the ability to swap into world class items, armors and wield weapons outside of his class -- Yggdrasil or the new world Momonga resides in functions similar to FFXIV. With a swap of a few weapons, Momonga 'equips' the class but none of the classes passive abilities. Playing the game with the mindset of a magic caster, this causes some concerns as he lacks adequate skill as a martial-arts fighter or swordsman. \\n\\n\r\nMomonga is a fast-learner, attuning to the otherwise world shattering realization that everyone he knew -- now aspiring to become decent members of society are long gone and the terrifying fact that he is alone in this world yields not a single hesitation nor concern at all. Momonga passively meanders on, adopting the role as any good role-player of the benevolent ruler in his castle. \\n\\n\r\nOverlord gained popularity as a light-novel then manga series of similar length. I ran through 10 chapters, hungering for more when I noticed the entirety of the show was available. Now with the first 13 episodes highlighting the overall tone of the manga --- I find an irresistible desire to advance the show by any means. Where the manga shines in its adherence to Momonga slow evolution to the position of 'overlord', the anime is the cliff-notes to both written materials. \\n\\n\r\nIf any complaints to the story is the complete lack of weight to the actions. While Momonga is in fact 'alive' in the 'world' , the inclusion of Yggdrasil as the basis in all his understanding plays tribute to Sword Art Online. Unlike Sword Art Online, Overlord advances without a true urgency or sense of consequence that encourages the more scrutinizing fan to question all of the decisions Momonga makes throughout the show. On the other side -- many fans of anime are flocking to Overlord for the complete disregard of consequence that overshadowed Sword Art Online. With a man with nigh infinite ability and wealth, will we see the making of a final boss NPC integrated into a direct sequel of Momonga's favorite MMORPG? The first season is introductory and fans of the manga may remark at the lack of scene for scene adaption of the source material, but Overlord has good pacing and an addictive cast. \\n\\n\r\nHere is hoping the second season will come sooner rather than later.",

Going into this one, about all I know is the basic premise and that opinions are a bit divided on the series. So, let's take a look and I'll put in my pfennig.\r\nStory:\r\nIn the distant future, virtual reality gaming is a thing and it's given rise to a new breed of MMORPGs, which allow the users to immerse themselves in the game worlds. Our story takes place with a popular game, Yggdrasil, entering the end of its life-span and shutting downits servers.In spite of having strong tech to back it up it was published by EA so it was only a matter of time before terrible business practices did it in. That is my head canon explanation for that. Anyway, on the last day of the servers running, Momonga, a man with no life, is reflecting on all the good times he had with his guild mates before they quit playing. He watches the clock tick down but stays online, determined to enjoy the game until the last moment. The day finally rolls over and, much to his surprise, he's still in the game. Not only that, but the NPCs that he and his former comrades made are displaying personalities and Nazarick, his guild base, has been transported into unfamiliar territory that still seems to follow game logic.\\n\\n\r\nThis opens up a lot of interesting story possibilities about how this happened and what's happening with Momonga's body. Is this still a game that his brain has somehow become trapped in, has he just lost his mind and been lost in delusions of the only thing he cares about or is it some kind of other dimension, one that he unwittingly helped create, that he was able to cross into? There are so many possibilities. The series then proceeds to toss that little plot point to the wayside and not really bring it up. Well, that seems a waste. But it's fine, there's another compelling story angle they could go with here, since Momonga and his NPC comrades are all monsters of various kinds. Stories about antagonists and/or beastly groups can be really good. Except that they don't really do anything with that either. About the biggest impact it has is that they present themselves as humans and do some things that are semi-villainous. But that's fine too. The NPCs keep bringing up the way they were created by Momonga's comrades and that could be a really interesting angle from a philosophical standpoint & from a narrative, \u201chow exactly is this working?\u201d stand point. Except that they don't do anything with that either. How do you have elements that could lead to three different strong stories and not take advantage of any of them?\\n\\n\r\nThat may be the biggest flaw with the series. It doesn't properly take advantage of any of its potentially fascinating story ideas. The second biggest issue is a matter of tension. It's established early on that Momonga is absurdly powerful when compared to the people/NPCs of this world. Not only that, but it's established that he has ways to resurrect people who die. Which means that there's no reason for us, as the audience, to be concerned about him or the other major characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are some areas where I will give the series credit. The world building is quite good and, to be completely fair, they're clearly setting up for a sequel so it's entirely possible that the more compelling aspects of the story do get better built on in the later material. As such, I can't really fault the series for prioritising the world building in the early stuff. Of course, that's also assuming that they do give us more of the interesting aspects. I haven't read the light novels so, for all I know, they may still be unaddressed after nine volumes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty under-developed in this. On one hand, you can somewhat understand it since this series focuses on the world building. However, we really need strong characters in a series like this where the main protagonist is so over-powered. We need compelling characters to keep our interest and all this series gives us is characters who might become interesting at some point.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty strong with creative designs for a lot of Nazarick's guardians and action sequences that are really good. There are some designs that are quite typical, but it also makes sense given the context.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty passable but also standard. Hino Satoshi's performance as the lich, Momonga, is a bit odd and seems out of place. However, he's also a regular person in a video game skin. As such it works to have his voice be a bit out of place for the character. The music is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThe series doesn't really have any ho-yay.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nWhat Overlord ultimately gives us is potential. There's potential for a compelling narrative. There's the potential for interesting characters. As the first series in a longer franchise, it's not a bad introduction. That being said, the series also isn't good. Maybe if it gets renewed for a second series, that one will be. As is, it's pretty mundane. The main protagonist is too powerful for the series to have any real tension. The good ideas haven't been developed, nor have the characters and the voice acting is just standard. Overall, I give it a 5/10. Next week, I'll take a look at Kannazuki no Miko.",

            "content": "MMOs, SAO, power fantasies, Over-powered protagonist, RPGs/JRPGs. If you enjoy any of the previous items, then more likely than not you will enjoy Overlord. Bam, there you have it. Now you can go watch the show without having to finish my review. Now for those who are still here, I'll let you in on a secret. This show is neither good, nor bad; in fact this show is just about average. The story details the start of Momonga's (Ainz Ooal Gown) eventual development towards... wait a minute..... I actually don't know, seeing as how the show never really tells you what his final goal is.Anyway, that's fine, Momonga is the main character; a real person who has now been trapped in the game that he was once an avid fan of. Is this a dream come true, or is this a nightmare from which he will never awaken. Is this show truly as bad as people say it is? Is it as good as some say it is? Buckle up because it\u2019s going to be a long ride, now, allow me to answer all of your quandaries.\\n\\n\r\n==Spoilers Galore in this Review==\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 5\\n\r\nI look at the other reviews of this show and I see people who are either swayed too much by their enjoyment of the show (and there is nothing wrong with that, you enjoy a show and are more than right to share said opinion with others), and people who are overly critical of the show. This show is not bad. Let me just get that out there. Now allow me to continually bash this show for the next few paragraphs, this one especially.\\n\r\nThis show is like SAO in that they both have people trapped in a game, otherwise Overlord is like tacky knock off of the original (Now I am by no means saying that SAO is amazing, I will be reviewing that show tomorrow in order to provide a follow up to this review). This show is terrible when it comes to characters, this show manages to not have a single well fleshed out character, and little to no development among the characters or with themselves. Let's start with the main character, Momonga; initially we are introduced to a character who we know nothing about save for the fact that he is now trapped in Yggdrasil (the MMO world), now this would be fine if he were to have a character archetype that was built upon based off of the difficulties he faces in this new world. But there are no real physical challenges that he can be faced with seeing as how he is so overpowered. Then that only leaves us with the possibility of metaphysical character or emotional character development, the first never really happens seeing how he never seriously questions how he ended up in that world or anything along those lines; which leaves us with the final option, emotional development. Even emotional development doesn't really happen, there are only a few moments where he comes close to something similar, and the closest case was the whole fiasco with Shalltear Bloodfallen where he has to take on the heavy task of killing one of his own friends. However the sadness is only momentary as he proceeds to revive her moments later, taking away from any form of development he may have had do go through in order to cope with his actions. Moving on to the other characters they all face basically the same problems; Albedo is a plain character who was literally programmed to like the main character for no reason, making any sense of romance in the show seem meaningless (this also manages to make me not really care for the actual possible romance between Nfirea Bareare and Emmot). All of the character follow some sort of stereotype and bring nothing new to the table (Gothic loli, large breasted rival of loli, weirdo that no one likes, butler, cross-dressing twins, ...), and half of these characters seem as if they were pandering to some sort of fetishist, making me have even less respect for each individual character. All in all its just a massive cast of lack luster characters who are all forgettable, none of which undergo any form of interesting development which helps push forward the story. Easily the weakest point of this anime.\\n\r\nPlot: 6\\n\r\nPacing: 7\\n\r\nWhen it comes to plot, this show is once again kind of lacking, while it\u2019s not as bad as the previous section it still doesn\u2019t really redeem itself in this category. The story starts off and it doesn\u2019t really grab your attention, as you are greeted to not just one but several first episodes that are full of dialogue and monologue. While these speeches do serve to introduce us to the world and what is happening, it is done so slowly and poorly. Looking back now there is little to no action in the first few episodes, and that is where this show truly shines, its beautifully well done animation, its well-choreographed fighting scenes, and fun action sequences. Fortunately the show doesn\u2019t bore you at first, so once you manage to dredge your way through the beginning muck you finally get to the meat of the show. In my opinion the middle of the show is the only time that it really got my attention. It was around the introduction of Nfirea that the story took a turn and started to introduce more grim elements into the story, and while I feel that this anime could not evolve into a \u201cmature\u201d themed show, due to its own simplicity, I did enjoy some true feelings of despair being conveyed as opposed to the aloof sadness that Momonga displays regarding his being trapped in this world. The show starts out slower than most, but that can be overlooked as it does pick up after a little bit. It would have fared better if it had more episodes to work off of; that is assuming that they took advantage of said episodes and spread out the show more evenly, all the while explaining and developing characters more.\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nAnimation: 9\\n\r\nFinally I can write about an area of the show I very much so enjoyed, its music and animation, let\u2019s start with the music. If you\u2019ve heard both the ED and the OP, then you know what I\u2019m talking about, the Ed is a fun song, however the OP is an awesome head banging fun time. Not just the intro and outro song should be mentioned though as Gou Fumihiroki did an excellent job coordinating the music with the fights, and even the battle music matches the situations quite well. All that complimented by the animation, which while not striving to be different from most mainstream anime still does a nice job matching up well with the fantasy theme of the show. It is in my opinion that Madhouse\u2019s animation style is perfectly suited for the fantasy genre, with its well emphasized magic animations, and aesthetically pleasing bright color pallet, which in this show is often contrasted nicely with darker yet still fluorescent colors.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this show: meh. Will you enjoy this show: sure? Who knows until you watch and finish it; it is my belief that you cannot label a show a failure until you have finished it. Similarly to how you can\u2019t claim a show to be the best ever until you have seen a vast amount of not just anime, but literature, cinema, and other forms of media as well. This show did not impress me, and I may have had to push myself to continue it at first, however in the end my opinion of the show changed from a 6/10 to almost a 7/10 (Now it must be noted that 7/10 is average, so it\u2019s not a bad score, nor is it a good score) just because I managed to get through the crummy beginning.\\n\r\nI have been writing this review for over two hours now, and I am done, so I will stop here. I hope you enjoyed reading my work as it took a lot of time and thought to write. When all is said and done we\u2019re all good friends in the end and shouldn\u2019t fight vehemently over our differing opinions, instead we should provide feedback on what we disagree on and what we liked. Speaking of which, if you have any desire to do so, feel free to give me any advice regarding my writing style, any advice for improvements, comments, or questions. I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nFinal Verdict 68/100\\n",

His goal is to take spread his name and he's not afraid to dirty his hands to do it. While the theme of being stuck in a game has been done before this time he doesn't really seem to care. In fact he seems to spend about 2 minutes total considering how to leave then decides it's not so bad.\r\nPart of the reason i loved this anime was because sometimes you just wanta super overpowered mc that just pulls out skill after skill and seems super badass. And with overlord since he's sort of a bad guy too he can actually use skills that kill people not just knock them unconscious or something dumb like that.\\n\\n\r\nBut besides the fighting it's also interesting to see how they analyze the new world and come up with strategies and tactics and are able to exploit everything around them. It definately has a tton of action in it but at the same time they try to make the mc both super powerful and really adept at planning and tactics.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found this really enjoyable because I mean how often do you get a super badass overpowered bad guy main character stuck in a game mix up?",

            "content": "Ever wondered how the second Arc of Sword Art Online 1 would be without Asuna? No? Well bad luck, because here you go: Watch Momonga, an OP MC beeing trapped within an RPG-like world, with no actual goal and nothing that presents even the slightes challenge to him.\r\nAlso watch him contradict himself and unlike one would expect from the title: never beeing or even trying to be an actual Overlord.\r\nIf this would be an anime about an evil Lich trying to conquer the world, it would be fun. If it was another Isekai with and OP-MC who is trying to learn about the world andfinding his place while building his mandatory harem, also nice. If it would be about someone, who find himself in a new world, has to learn the rules and faces actual challenges, all could be nice and good.\\n\\n\r\nInstead watch the OP-MC, who already knows all the rules of the world, trying to progress without any actual goal, so the writers can try to give him as many contradictions as possible, to have it both ways in any way. Don't forget his love-interest sidekick, who is attractive, designed to love him and made me ask for the first time in all anime I know \"Why doesn't he have sex with her?\"\\n\\n\r\nMy main issue is the story:\\n\r\nWe follow Momonga, a nerd who played a SAO-RPG which is about to be shut down. He is the leader of the strongest guild in the game, he himself is the strongest player, the guild still exists with OP NPC guards as well. However instead of shutting down, the game somehow transports him and his guild to another world, where he suddenly is trapped, the NPC come alife and Momonga is... just there.\\n\r\nMomonga finds himself in this new world and with no actual goal. The entire plot is driven by him trying to get known so he could figure out if other player are also transported there - why he wants to know that and what he is going to do once he knows? Who cares, here see him beeing OP agan. The best way to do this, seems to join a guild, try to get a high rank, while at the same time keeping a low profile. Now one might wonder: How can one try to become known as one of the strongest warriors, while also avoiding showing strength? And that is a good question, which the show quite frankly ignores. The MC will at one point try to act normal and make others think he is just a bit stronger, then he will go forth and enslave beasts considered some kind of god or fight an undead army all by himself. You know, low profile stuff.\\n\r\nAlso while he does want to make his name known, to propably find others from the old game, he also changes his name and never mentions the name of his old guild - because that somehow helps.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story doesn't go anywhere and neither do the characters. The NPC are shown to having a personality designed by the guild and they are also totally OP and have pretty bland characters designs. So they don't get anywhere with a characters arc.\\n\r\nNeither does Momonga, of whom we don't even learn, if he considers other people in the wold as actual people or just NPC. One could think he is transforming into the actual skeleton-overlord his avatar is, because he is super easy on inoocent getting killed or even killing them himself. However when it comes to his guild, he suddenly shows emotions like shame. Which made me ask, why the heck does he have natural emotions towards characters, which he knows as actual mindless NPCs, but not towards all the other people in this new world, which he doesn't know anything about, including if they are thinking, feeling beeings?\\n\\n\r\nNow we have a story that doesn't go anywhere and characters who don't develope in any way or even seem to know what they are actually thinking. Now let's look at the delivery as well. Obviously, since Momonga is not an evil Wizzard, but a RPG-player from another game, he is reacting to the world by comparing it to his old. Which means narrating about spells and monsters and levels and mechanics, so we always know, why he is superior to everything presented.\\n\r\nBut beware, exposition-dump narration is not the worst thing, the show is offering to show us the world, no that  my friend, it is pointless buffing. You know buffs? Spells people use to strengthen their stats? The new world also contains buffing-spells and everytime they are used, we have characters uttering some spells and after that, do stuff, without giving a point of referrence to understand, what has changed. As someone who knows games, one can make out what those buffs will most likely do. However without a point of referrence on how the fight would go down without the buff, this is just pointless timewasting. It is just a plattform for the writers to show they can make up names for buffs or spells in general - as we are never presented some kind of magical-system or how certain spells actually change the outcome of a fight, it doesn't have any impact.\\n\\n\r\nBut the worst part and which shows best at the very end (so spoilers ahead) is how the show actually tries to raise the stakes:\\n\r\nSince the MC and his guild are only OP-characters know, the only hard fight the MC can have, is against his own minions, which happens at the end without any buildup (because that would need character developement). To know the stakes are high, we are shown an item which is said to be super-powerfull. Oh but it doesn't work. So let's get some items which are even more powerfull. Got that? Good. Now don't bother explaining what any of them do or if they are even used in the actual fight. With that out of the way, let's also use a couple of buffs without giving any referrence on what they do, use some super-powerfull spells, which where never mentioned before and no idea how they work and ofcourse a couple of new items which do stuff and make some kind of juxtaposition but acting like they are cheap or whatever but totally usefull.\\n\r\nAll set and done? Now tell give us more exposition on why Momonga wins this fight with some more tactics around stuff, that was never mentioned before.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in case that finale is not worse: after the fight Momonga is known to be powerfull beyond imagination - the one thing he tried to avoid...\\n\r\nOh but now we know there are others who might have some of the super-super-powerfull items, which can do \"stuff\" and work \"somehow\".",

            "content": "Ok, this show is not meant to be a cerebral experience. It does not have a weighty philosophy or ethical dilemma or even a who-dun-it atmosphere. It is not a meticulous character study or a depiction of humanity. It is a liberating experience for all the MMORPG lovers that brings out their inner God complex vicariously. It does tug and scrape at your conscience (intentionally) to reveal the true nature of this God complex. The protagonist is a leader of bad guys. He is an average human gamer thrust into this role of this supreme overlord. Well, as most RPG gamers can relate, we allseek to achieve such a powerful status while killing all the minions and sacrificing NPCs to gain levels. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs Momonga, the protagonist starts adjusting to his new life as the Ovrelord, he feels himself losing his humanity gradually. The people in the new world are all just pawns for extending his power and understanding of the unfamiliar place nad its potential. His actions become more calculated and cautious like that of a Mob boss.\\n\\n\r\nWe don't really know much about the NPCs who get slain by our characters in the games and so we don't mind slaying them. But in here , the show gives us deep insights into their background and struggles they face in their life up until the point they get killed by the protagonists. This show illustrates how video games subtly desensitize us to violence. To Momonga, the people are pawns he needs to improve his power in a video game while we as viewers feel empathetic to their life and the situation which makes it harder for us to actually root for the protagonist. I like the fact that the story has these neat layers to it instad of devolving into a rambling tale of easy conquest of a supreme overlord.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Building: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis show has is a visual and visceral treat for all fantasy lovers. From the magic system to different races inhabiting the world it simply is breathtaking. It resembles a MMORPG game very much in this aspect and it is glorious. The scope for further development is infinite due to the same reason.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nSplendid! Madhouse is as outstanding as ever in this department. I loved every frame and every design (well give or take a few). I couldn't help admiring how beautiful the art and animation was especailly during the battle scenes\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt's alright. Nothing that really stands out although it is composed to suit the atmosphere very well.  Occasionally, there are a few good scores which nicely complement the beautiful visuals\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say either you like em or you don't. The characters are, at a first glance, pretty simple and one dimensional ( save a few). HOWEVER they are damn interesting and enjoyable and subtly grow over the episodes. It is like observing NPC in the games starting to evolve gradually as they learn and adapt from theri experiences in the new world. I believe this is also one of the aspects of the story that the author aims to address as we see Momonga constantly making observations on how his subordinates change over time.\\n\\n\r\nMy one gripe is that most of the female characters were portrayed as evil, manipulative or bitchy. Some even looked a lot alike with blond hair. Almost all of them are smitten by Momonga. I wish the author had included some variety in his character design for the girls department instead of making the anime look like a cheap harem show.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this show from the first episode in Season 1 to the latest one. I could hardly stop binging on all the episodes. This might not be for people who are easily put off by overpowered protagonist with an evil side. The show does not dwell on the MC being morally conflicted by his actions or longing for his past life (which makes sense given he lost a part of his humanity) It does deliver fully on the entertainment scale with every developing event piquing our interest.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Hellsing Ultimate, Berserk or even One-Punch Man, do pick this one up without hesitation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Spoiler free section: The writing in this show is terrible and the author is clearly a hack. The characters are totally unrealistic and only behave in evil ways so they can have the maximum shock value. The characters in this show were clearly designed by a 12 year old edgelord and behave to be as edgy as possible with no regard for their setting or personalities. Skip this show. If you want to see a well written mmo anime watch Log Horizon or The King's Avatar.\r\nSpoiler section (not just for season 1 but some things from the following seasons as well):\r\nThe main character is anormal person with a boring job and no known desires to kill or torture any real people or game characters. He is the last remaining member of what was once the greatest guild in a dead mmorpg that is being shut down. He finds himself transported into another world as his game character with his guild's base and npc characters brought to life and turned into actual living and free thinking beings. At this point I loved the show, amazing setting and world building and as these characters are at max power they are all basically gods in this world (although it takes them a little while to realize that) and it is incredibly fun to see what they will do with that power.\\n\\n\r\nBut then things quickly go downhill. In the first interaction he has with the new world he finds himself in he decides to save a village but not resurrect the people that died in the attack before he arrived even though it is easily within his power and if he wanted he could also erase the memories of the people that died and those that saw them die so no one would know he had this power. He could make a huge difference in the lives of these innocent people but instead chooses not to for no reason other than that he doesn't feel like it. That just isn't a good enough reason. So many cool things could have come from that, maybe those memories could come back at some point/be discovered by an enemy that captures someone from the village in the future, ect. A lot of cool things could have developed from this moment but instead nothing happens just to demonstrate how uncaring the main character is. This isn't a show ruiner but it was the first red flag.\\n\\n\r\nLater he accompanies an adventuring group. A group of friends that band together and go on adventures just like the friends he used to have and lost and misses dearly. This new group is all killed after the adventure and he leaves them dead. Once again he can easily revive the dead and erase memories. He has the power to stop something in the past that traumatized him from occurring again but he chooses not to. (I'm told in the light novel he looked down on the party but in the anime he was friendly enough with them so the adaptations clearly differ and it is wrong to say that he should act the same way in every adaptation even if the events play out differently. The author also agrees because the actions he takes in the anime differ in places from the actions he takes in the light novels so this is clearly not a 1:1 translation of the light novel). Someone that has lost all their friends they used to adventure with and explore a world of mystery together with should see this happening and think \"I have the power of a God now and this will never happen again\" and bring those dead adventurers back to life. But he doesn't. They remind him of something he lost so his reactions should either be to protect them so he can feel like he protected his friends memories or he should feel like they are a pale imitation of his relationship with his friends and get angry at them for the perceived mockery of that bond. But instead he just shrugs it off. This is the moment the show was ruined for me. I've played a dying mmorpg and lost all my friends one by one. I am a borderline sociopath so I don't give a crap about most of what happens around me. But I would spit in the face of God if it would bring back even a small part of the fun times I used to have adventuring with my friends. The way this character behaves does not fit himself or his personality at all and that is why this show is terrible.\\n\\n\r\nYes he is a sociopath so he feels no emotions but allow me to phrase it like this: If you see a random object of no use to you lying around do you break that object? Just because you don't care about something doesn't mean you have a desire to destroy and get enjoyment from it. Some people just throw away paper plates when they are done with them and don't crush them up for the thrill of crushing something just because they can. Now imagine that paper plate was a plastic plate and had a picture on it that reminded you of something special to you. It would make a lot more sense for you to clean that plate and keep it when you were done instead of snapping it in half just because you're so cool and edgy. Not caring about something isn't the same as wanting to destroy everything. This author clearly thinks being a sociopath is cool and dark and that honestly isn't the case. Mental illnesses are not cool no matter what the media wants you to think. This is just another failing on the part of the author to display anything accurately. Not his characters, not mmorpg players, and not sociopaths. Everything is just how he wants it to be to satisfy his desire to show us evil characters acting like shitheads.\\n\\n\r\nAt the finale of season 1 the main character needs to fight against a npc guild member under mind control (The only challenge these characters have in this world is against each other because they are the only beings even close to the power level of the main character). And you get all excited because you finally get to see a serious fight using their mmorpg spells, items, and abilities. And how does the main character win the fight? He uses cash shop items that are stupidly overpowered and break the mechanics of the game. Do you know what real mmorpg players/gamers in general hate? God damn microtransactions that break their game. Selling game breaking items/xp to make money off the corpse of your game is sickening to anyone that actually loves the game and wants to have fun in it. No real mmo player would be like \"oh boy gotta show off those cash shop items in my anime and have them be the main mechanics in how this fight is won\". It's terrible.\\n\\n\r\nMany other things continue to happen in later seasons as well. For example:\\n\\n\r\nEven if you want to argue that those earlier adventurer group he watched die should have been left for dead because he didn't care about them the same way he cared about his actual friends/guild members one npc of his guild saved a human woman in need. The person that created this npc once saved the main character in the exact same way. Is the main character touched by these actions reminding him of his cherished friend he lost that once saved his life? Nope. He instead tortures the npc, dragging him in front of him and joking about having the girl killed before bringing the girl in and ordering the npc to kill her to prove his loyalty. That is not the actions the main character should have taken based on his background and personality. Once again the author clearly only cares about making him as edgy and cool as possible. It is dumb and written terribly.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you want to argue that him threatening an npc is in character you can't because he previously revived the npc he had to fight at the end of season 1 and showed great concern for her. So not only do his actions not make sense based on his personality and backstory they also don't make sense based on the things he has previously done in the show. The author is clearly a terrible hack.\\n\\n\r\nLater on a village of lizardmen are attacked, they all band together and the main character sees use in keeping them alive but he still kills a bunch of the village leaders who have the strongest abilities just to prove how edgy and cool he is even though this directly goes against the reason why he decided to recruit the lizardmen in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that his base gets invaded by adventurers looking to loot the place and he personally kills a group of them that have bonds of friendship so strong all of them agree to band together and try to hold him off so a young female member of their party can escape. As you should expect none of this reminds him of his lost friends that he cherishes so deeply. He cares nothing for their teamwork and personally kills them all, except for the girl they let escape. He orders one of the npcs to kill her instead. (In the light novel she is kept alive and tortured).\\n\\n\r\nAll this show does is make you care for characters by showing off how much fun and adventure they have together and how strong their bonds of friendship are before torturing and killing them to show how cool and edgy the main character is. It's a terrible show and I can't suggest skipping it strongly enough.",

            "content": "Overlord. There is a lot of good things I can say about this anime. Just to let you know, this review is based on the every Overlord season. Yes, season one through three. First off, the plot. Just like your typical stuck in MMORPG animes, the main character Momonga also known as Ainz got stuck inside the game and can't get out. But unlike many stuck in games anime, the our main character is a antagonist. Also it's not the actual game that he got stuck inside, he's clan Ainz Ooal Gown has teleported to a another world. But soon later, Ainz asked himself \"DoI really want to go back to the real world?\" And that proofs that this anime is not a regular stuck in games type of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing I can say about this anime is the mysteries. I mean, it's good but, it takes too long for it to solved or the anime adaptation don't give us enough information about it. For example, at the beginning of the second season, there was two people talking about Shalltear and how they should react to it. When Bangaisekiji also known as Zesshi Zetsumei (that girl with white and black girl) asked Ishokkusekiji her and Shalltear who's stronger? Ishokkusekiji said \"You\". But there is a reason behind it but the anime didn't say it, and it gives us some important information.\\n\r\nThis is the reason why he said yes. He compared the punch's between Shalltear and Bangaisekiji, and he knew that Shalltear was stronger. But Bangaisekiji had armors from the six gods and Shalltear didn't had any armor on. Or that's what Ishokkusekiji saw, of course Shalltear had the armor from Nazarick. But wow, a human is strong enough to win over Shalltear without armor. Even though she doesn't have any armor on, she's still the strongest floor guardian.\\n\\n\r\nThe third thing I can say about this anime is the character management. Unlike Mayoiga, we actually get background information, what they are capable of, and the meaning behind their names for every characters!  Although it's never mentioned, you can always see it by looking it up on Google. Now let's talk about the setting that the supreme being has put for the characters. When Sebas and Shalltear was talking inside the carriage, Sebas asked Shalltear why she's always fighting with Aura, she answered this \"Actually, I don't think she's too bad but my creator Peroronchino chose me to act this way so I'm just doing what he said to do.\" This sentence explains that the character is slightly different from the setting that the supreme ones gave to them. And also, their pretty similar to their creators! For example the creator of Sebas, Touch me and the creator of Demiurge, Ulbert has a really crappy relationship and so does their creation!\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth thing I can say about this anime is anime is how author manages every characters.\\n\r\nAgain, unlike Mayoiga (this is the last time I'm gonna compare this to Mayoiga I promise. I know these two animes have nothing in similar.) the author keeps a well track of every characters. For example, we even got to see what Hamusuke was doing when he was not with Ainz! And that's how you keep track a story with many characters. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, the score. Only one word can describe this anime for me, beautiful. I love the animation, characters, story, and the main character. This anime definitely earns a 10/10 from me. And it is my second favourite anime of all time.\\n",

            "content": "I have a bias towards shows that fall under the stuck in a game genre, but even more so towards fantasy.  So please understand, I thoroughly enjoyed this show.\r\nWhile the concept of being stuck in a game has been seen more frequently, I enjoyed the approach Overlord took.  In the past, all shows involved people becoming stuck in the game and the main goal is always survival and returning home.  Overlord took a different approach.  Sure anyone stuck in a game has hopes and desires to return to the real world, but it is definitely not the overarching theme in Overlord.Instead we find ourselves in a world where there might be nobody from the original game.  This allows us to learn about the, main character, the main character's friends and his former allies from the personalities of the floor guardians and every other NPC created by his guild.   The approach is different too because with his overwhelming power, the main character views the former NPCs more so as children and representations of his friends.  \\n\\n\r\nFor some people the blinding loyalty each floor guardian has towards the main character is extreme, but given the circumstances that he is the only remaining creator it is understandable where the NPC's are coming from.  It also can be hilarious, if you can relate to the concept of watching over and teaching children, for their arguments and decisions mirror the actions of loyal children.  Maybe too an extreme, but that ridiculous adds to the hilarity.  However, I can see this being one of the biggest obstacles for many people.  I believe that if your truly understand the situation and really think about the relationship between creator and created it adds a unique element to the story.  If you cannot do that I foresee many characters falling short of expectations for some.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting also sets the show apart as instead of the classic, fight, power level up we see across many animes, this setting the character is not only already extremely powerful, but he has a gigantic fortress and equally powerful allies right at the start.  This allows for a different avenue to learn about the world and a different lens through which we view the world. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I thoroughly enjoyed Overlord, laughed at the ridiculous comments made by the created, and enjoyed watching an overpowered mage dismantle the obstacles that appeared before him.  I would recommend Overlord to anyone who likes the fantasy genre (more so magic or undead) or the trapped in a game genre.  I myself found the show, and finished the 13th episode a few hours later.  Hopefully you will feel the same jubilation.",

            "content": "One would think that after so many anime revolving around similar concepts, something like Overlord is not going to bring anything new to the table.\r\nWell, it has.\r\nI was pleasantly surprised when Overlord offers a fresh angle on the whole 'trapped-in-a-virtual-reality' concept. The key difference in Overlord's setting that gives it uniqueness is this : The main character, Momonga is the only player in the new world, with the rest being 'NPCs'.\r\nWhy is this even important? \r\nIt is important because it sets the foundation for Momonga's subsequent actions. It is important because it separates and elucidates 3 different viewpoints:\r\n1. Momonga's viewpoint. To him everyone in thenew world are NPCs'; they are human and yet less than human to him.\\n\r\n2. The NPC's viewpoint. An NPC in the new world is leading a normal life just like how a normal human would lead a normal life in the real world.\\n\r\n3. The viewer's viewpoint. We know that Momonga is in fact a character from a game, somehow transported into this new world, but there is actually a real person in the real world who created this character.\\n\\n\r\nHow these 3 viewpoints were isolated so lucidly is precisely because of the fact that there are no other 'players' in the picture. At the same time, Momonga, while being a player, is the furthest thing from a human being as an all-powerful undead lich. I must say that it is brilliantly conjectured and brilliantly done.",

            "content": "I wanted to begin without breaking the whole spoiler. First of all. Its a MADHOUSE Studios, legendary studios which develop anime such as Death Note, One Punch Man, Iron Man the Animation, Parasyte, and so on. But this anime, you can say its a downfall and its finest.\r\nLike storylines, it almost related to Sword Art Online related, a Person stuck in a whole game and he had to spend his life in his Guild, and learn what he can do on outside his guild. And I like how the Anime idea was, Evil helping people, even though it was Necromancer class. The anime slowly startsgetting pumped-up then declined because the anime have less plot ideas than it shows, and the show seems demanding 24+ episodes instead of 13 Episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter design was nice, such as Momonga, but only Momonga a.k.a Ains Ooal Gown makes its appearance too well. Side character such as his minions NPC's, Narberal Gamma, Shalltear Bloodfallen, are the only character focused in the anime. Others are underutilized. I wish they have more story detail and battle with Albedo, I mean seriously. She's like the first Side Character but only showned as a fan-services big breast girl which is love-stuck with Momonga. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound design was pretty nice and colorful, only certain parts of art design kinda less good, such as episode 11 - 13 episode. I`m not sure.\\n\\n\r\nFighting seems great but I think the Magic fight is very underwhelming bland compared to actual sword-fight. But this is just my opinions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Its a Decent anime. I really hope they will plan for next season because it really needed for Season 2, to complete the ark of Season 1.\\n\\n\r\n4/10",

            "content": "\u201cOverlord? Overrated more like!\u201d \u2013 A goblin Jester from Overlord (a 2007 video game).\r\nOverlord, is an anime about an extremely, ridiculously, tremendously overpowered so called \u201cOverlord\u201d who is actually\u2026just a MMO player who found himself unable to log out from the game. Along with his uninteresting subordinates, he then goes on a rather boring journey to find his friends that are perhaps like him, trapped in the game world. That\u2019s the story in a nutshell. Not entirely fresh in terms of premise, the only thing that\u2019s new is the protagonist is a generic guy who is stuck in lich form.\r\nIn terms of action, its doesa fair job \u2013 however almost fails at it. Since not only Momonga(protagonist), but even his subordinates are outrageously powerful, any adversary are like flies to them, making the fights scenes less enjoyable to watch since the enemies can\u2019t even put a dent on them \u2013 of course other than the last battle, where Momonga faced someone who is more or less powerful than him. Still, majority of the fights are very one sided.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters frequently utter names of random \u201cspells\u201d or \u201cbuffs\u201d \u2013 any average gamer definitely know what those terms means. Few \u201cskills\u201d sounded self-explanatory to avid gamers, but there were some called \u201cSee-through\u201d and \u201cGreater Hardening\u201d, I don\u2019t know what the hell they do, but it sure made me chuckle. The battles are most likely the only biggest redeeming factor in this show. Even so, the action is nothing jaw-dropping or cool and very far from awesome. It doesn't even reach \u201cgood\u201d, in my standards. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the weakest aspect - I wasn't particularly interested in any of them. Admittedly, Albedo was hot and she\u2019s nice fap material, but other than that, I didn't find her particularly interesting, or unique whatsoever. Most of the time, she was just there to constantly praise Momonga \u2013 in fact, majority  of Momonga\u2019s servants didn't do much as well. In the first episode, we are already introduced to most of the supporting cast: a giant insect man and a weird guy in a suit, whom both resembles generic villains, two possibly trap siblings and lastly, a vampire loli with fake boobs; that\u2019s what I've been told. I can\u2019t even remember their names too well either, other than having to Google it or probably rewatching an episode, which I\u2019m probably not going to do.\\n\\n\r\nOther aspects such as animation & art was alright, but it\u2019s nothing memorable and the overall Sound was good.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Overlord is just a passable anime due to its rather mundane fights, combined with a cast of bland characters, while it does have a couple good moments in between, but still not entirely worthwhile. Do I recommend it? Well, I'd say, give it a shot - but don't expect too much.\\n",

            "content": "To get rid of the obvious (and least important, IMO) first, animation is a disaster. Moving on.\r\nI dived into Overlord on a recommendation from my best friend and a dedicated anime lover who usually has a pretty good idea of quality. Going by what they said, Overlord on a first note seemed like a very wholesome idea of a guy trying to help the remaining players trapped in the now real game-world, sprinkled with the sweet bits of edginess that is our titular character. I guess I thought it was going to be a bit like Goblin Slayer, if perhaps a bit less traumatic, andencompassing a bit more of cliche anime tropes and lighthearted bits of comedy/drama. And if it was anything close to that, Overlord would indeed be quite a solid watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlas, Overlord suffers from an age old formula that turns MCs into gods, and everyone around them into tools who serve no other purpose than to further reiterate just how gosh-darn AMAZING their master is. This too, seemed at the beginning like it could be wholesome, because the scene itself is pretty sweet and  radiating a \"gang getting together\" vibe but sadly boiled down to nothing more than servitude. \\n\\n\r\nThe little hope I had for a possible romantic sub-plot, the hint of which is in the very beginning of the first episode, was immediately wiped out by the fact there no love truly involved, as much as there is shameless fanservice and lewdness which, on some other genre and some other time, might be fantastic. In this very \"edgy\" series, it comes of as ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nAt some point, a dakimakura appears and kills all my good intentions towards world building.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just sad, because certain scenes in Overlord are pretty amazing. Certain bits a of otherwise terrible dialogue are pretty strong, characters are sometimes interesting. The problem is that it all comes down to that \"sometimes\" - Overlord is only good at very specific times, when something very specifically interesting or heavy is happening, which, on average, is three to five minutes per episode. It is simply not strong enough to carry on my interest, so the reason for why this series keeps on going remains a mystery to me.\\n\\n\r\nOh no, wait, of course, it's fantasy fulfillment. \\n\\n\r\nFigures. Because in that regard, Overlord is a fucking masterpiece.",

But the story is absolute garbage and I can't stop watching it.\r\nThe main character is a a player trapped inside a game where he is now a super powerful Lich. Women fight over not who will become his wife but rather who will become his first wife because he is so great that of course he will have a harem.\r\nThere's no challenge here for the cast. The main character has a small army under his control and most of them have the power to outclass a god of the worldthey're in. There is no threat that is introduced that even comes close to the main casts power level. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no character development. The main character's entourage unconditionally loves him. They all think he's the greatest ever and bend over backwards to justify any stupid thing he might do. From start to finish they're all exactly as they were. As for the main character he's got some magic spell on him that they don't want to elaborate on that stunts his emotions so they've added an in universe reason why he can't develop as a character. \\n\\n\r\nThere are no consequences. Right from the start the main character has the ability to resurrect anyone. So even if he were to lose everyone close to him he can just bring them back, and presumably the same can be done to him, but only his team has this power. \\n\\n\r\nBut here's the thing, It's such a train wreck that I can't look away, There's always something happening, It'll have terrible pacing and be incredibly contrived but this is what I imagine the Japanese version of Axe Cop would be except it's made by adults and not a 4 year old.",

The most common complaint i've heard is \"The main character is OP\" well no shit, they know what they are doing with him, if you are watching Overlord to see tense battles with high stakes then leave, let me give you a hint: AINS WINS. People complain about him being too strong well he is supposed to be, they never play at it like he is going to lose andyou aren't supposed to be worried about him. The entertainment value is in the interactions he has with other characters as well as the massive amount of side characters to get to know. My personal favorite is Shalltear and always will be due to how badass she is. My only gripes with it are that 1. The CG is super bad but it's funny to laugh at, and 2. The whole undercover adventurer thing doesn't come into use until season 3, which is really late but at least it plays a really important part in the story. It's story is really interesting due to how objective Ains feels about the world and people, he has no human emotion and therefore does stuff the way a evil undead king would, which is so refreshing instead of the stupid \"SAVE EVERYONE BECAUSE LIFE IS PRECIOUS\" approach. Save the village? Oh they are useful to my plans? Okay I guess I will then, but they will basically be my pawns to use when I need them. That is amazing, finally a main character that is fresh and interesting, he acts like someone trying to be a villain in an RPG and it's just perfect. So yeah this show is great, really loved it. Definitely worth a watch.",

I found the plot really unique for it's kind of anime but it seemed to me somewhere around the episodes the authors got bored of generating new ideas on how to give more enthusiasm to the audience  and they stood up with the main idea from the episode one and change it during the last episodes. Also the ending was very very rushing.\r\n\u2022 Art + Sound rate (6):\r\nFairly 6. I couldn't go higher than that. The art was really cheap for an anime released on 2015. The reason why im saying thatit's cheap it's because when you have an anime based on a story of MMORPG game and you show 2-3 skills maximum per episode without the awesome animation they should have had it's making the anime more poor. As about the sound it didn't had anything that surprised me, the actors had capture the full voice of their roles, the intro was nice as well.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Character rate (10): \\n\r\nYou may now wonder why i rate this 10 while i gave medium ratings to the other categories. Here is why. The characters fulfilled their roles like an mmorpg. Their reactions where exactly the same as characters playing those games also the supporting cast was brilliant and for sure i'll remember these characters in the future!\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment rate (8): \\n\r\nI can't say i disliked watching this anime. It was really fun to watch and i also believe gamers who don't even watch anime will watch this one just for it's main idea. Personally, i wouldn't rewatch the anime but i would recommend it to someone!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for your time to read my review! \\n\\n\\n",

This anime is nothing like SAO so stop comparing them and stop treating it like SAO\r\nFirst of all there are no incest-trial relationships like there are in SAO\r\nWhat does overlord offer\r\nWell itstarts off trapping the main character in a video game this is important because it allows the author to treat every character that isnt the main character as an NPC\\n\r\nBut he realized that that would be boring so he forced them to stick to the way that their scrips describe them while they use this information to form their individual personalities\\n\r\nSince the anime is really just an introduction its filled with character development it describes the main character Momonga in a lot of detail. Showing that he is a video game player not some white Knight beta pussy this means that he is doing everything for his benifit like any other experianced video game player would. This means that he appears to be the bad guy while doing good deeds because we know that hes only helping people for his benifit. Momonga is extreamly overpowerd in this anime but since he is in a world he dosnt understand because when he became trapped in the game his guild was transported into a different world. This means that he slowly moves forward checking somethings strength before engaging because he doesnt know what will happen if he dies.\\n\\n\r\nThat was a small description of the anime got your attention ? Then watch it the only people  that wont enjoy it are Hmmmmmmmm.

You could really enjoy it or be burned out by the 3rd episode, just try it and see what happens. \r\n(Extended review) This is honestly my number one favorite Anime of all time. What makes this anime so great isn't the complexity of the story, on the contrary the fact that it's so simple makes me love this Anime. Overlord takes an old idea and makes it a masterpiece in it's own right. The story makes the title makes sense, Aniz Ooal Gown is as actualOverlord and during his fights the only reason why he doesn't destroy his enemy in one shot is to gain knowledge of the new world he's in. He's fighting to build up knowledge instead of power or money, he's also trying to gain a reputation so he can try to contact other people that may be trapped in the world with him, which I found to be interesting. Depending on how you like your main characters this can make or break you, if you like overpowered main characters that AREN'T 14 years old than this may be for you. However, if you want to see a long drawn out story where someone gets stronger through hard and rigorous training TURN AROUND and watch Kenichi Mightiest Disciple or something.\\n\\n\r\nthis could be 9/10 or 3/10 but still my favorite anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

I have made my stance that it certainly isn\u2019t.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nWell the plot was pretty generic but still a decent one. It involves much violence and hilarious overpowerness and of course Fantasy and magic much as described. The anime revolves around a guy that plays a VR game called Yggdrasil and got trapped in the game. He got trapped in the game for an unknown reason and unlike SAO, he was trapped alone.The NPCs in the game that should have been programmed by the system before he was trapped turned to life and started communicating him.\\n\\n\r\nFunny thing is, we do not know who else is trapped but the NPCs still retain the settings they had before the player was trapped. Some parts can be extremely hilarious due to this.\\n\\n\r\nThe player that was trapped, Momonga-san decided to venture and search for potential players that are also trapped despite being trapped in a game that turned to life, he was surprisingly calm which bugs me abit when I first watched the anime but I\u2019m all past that and now I anticipate what will happen next for every episode I watch. \\n\\n\r\nThere is some violence in the anime but I enjoy it very much. The way Momonga is described at the beginning makes me feel that he is invincible not to mention his NPC servants that are almost equally powerful.\\n\\n\r\nI anticipate if anyone can stand a chance against him and if any others exist with him.\\n\\n\r\nThe suspense is killing me and I highly recommend. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike most of my reviews I go in topic on why I enjoy the anime but I\u2019m trying out another style where spoilers are at a minimum.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, I am extremely pleased with the art. Details are there, graphics are there, timing of different scenic shots are there. Colours are vivid and the art of individual characters some might seem normal but the Main Characters are definitely an array and the Main Character, Momonga is quite interesting. Not to mention the weapons and form of magic used.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nTimed right, voice acting pretty awesome too, I like when the MC has two voices. One he uses when talking to NPCs to make himself sound cool and the other kiddish voice when he is talking to himself. Also enjoy the music used the Opening and Ending were both great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot very much in detail but pretty developed at the start in the sense that we can roughly already Guess and predict what the characters are like. Wait... wouldn\u2019t that mean this anime is very generic? Arrgh nothing wrong with generics...\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWould recommend",

            "content": "What does the world look like when you're an evil overlord? What is the process of becoming a demon  king? If you've always pondered these questions watch Death Note or Code Geass, not Overlord. Or if you'd rather indulge in the cheap fantasy of wielding unmatched power, dominating kingdoms and commanding the devotion of hot babez...watch Overlord, but keep it to yourself. Sorry, that was unfair, someone could watch this show for legitimate reasons and perhaps be mildly entertained, but only mildly.\r\nCharacter motivation is the big weakness. The protagonist's minions (most of the first and second tier cast) are principally moved by a lockstepdevotion to their Overlord, which might be inspiring if it were shown to be justified...but it's simply the result of their programming. Even their gratitude for real kindness the overlord show them is rendered forced and hollow. Or it might be interesting if such unthinking devotion were critiqued and analysed...but don't hold your breath for that. Unjustified, unanalysed devotion is simply bad character writing and pandering to audience fantasies, to say nothing of the female lead's unsavoury sexual devotion. Aside from motivation, the minions' differing characters are actually expressed quite well, but the turd in the waterpipe remains. The non-minion supporting characters might have some interest to them, aside from futile opposition to the protagonist, but, again, I'm not holding out much hope there.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist spends more time flaunting his excessive power than displaying interesting character traits, or any reason for us to support or sympathise with him (possibly such a reason will come later, but it really should be there from the start) He disposes of the world he was born in with a line or two 'I have no ties or family', making the MMORG premise, (aside from conveying a sense of isolation that his minion's devotion promptly quenches) worse used than in any similar series. His base motivation of conquering the world in order to meet other stranded role-players is worse than his minions; the plot that is produced by such motivations appeared almost entirely, if not completely, uninteresting. And of course this is a light novel adaption, so nothing significant about this pile of tedium is likely to be changed in thirteen episodes. I may only have got through three of them, but the impression I received, of ongoing trends as well, was just that bad. \\n\\n",

            "content": "REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.\r\nThis anime is a very clever take on a hypothetical situation: What would happen if you were suddenly transported into the body of your character in an MMO? You're suddenly this super powerful skeletal wizard and you have control over a kingdom. What do you even do?\r\nThe resultant storyline of the main character Momonga (Ainz Ooal Gown, or AOG for the rest of this review) seeking to make himself famous in this weird new world is absolutely well done. Below are some notes I took during my viewing of the show.\r\nPOSITIVES:\r\n> Manages to make the viewer care about every single character that comeson screen. Almost none of the characters we see are one-dimensional in any way (despite some visual problems I'll get to later).\\n\r\n> Story is realistic, with AOG doing what any ordinary person might do given such an unexpected situation.\\n\r\n> The themes of past glory and friendship echo throughout the season, with AOG mourning the disappearance of his old guildmates in episode 1, and again throughout the story. Teamwork and mateship is something that isn't treated lightly in this series.\\n\r\n> The societies and communities that exist in the world are all quite realistic, but with unique spins on them that clearly echo MMO game mechanics. For example, in the town of E-Rantel there is a building where adventurers can go to receive quests, and are rewarded with money and standing within the local guild as a result. However none of this is treated as a gimmick, and functions very realistically.\\n\r\n> The voice acting in the show is generally good (with some notable exceptions that will be touched on later). A particularly well-done performance is that of Clementine. Her psychosis and disregard for others is conveyed incredibly well. Pandora's Actor is also very well voiced; yes, the character is intentionally lame and cringey, and yes, it's played to perfection, making the startled and furious reaction of AOG believable (as the entire audience is having the same reaction).\\n\r\n> Normally, 3D cel animation is really badly done in anime, but Overlord benefits from it, despite it occasionally being jarring (the battle between Narberal and Khajit being a particularly strange example).\\n\r\n> The opening theme, Clattanoia, is phenomenally good, and ranks as one of my favourite anime openings.\\n\r\n> The balance between comedy and drama is good, managing the audience's emotions in such a way as to ensure they never get too bogged down in negative emotions, or too comfortable with positive ones. By contrast. Hellsing is an anime that suffers because it doesn't have much in the way of levity, and thus bogs down the viewer. When I watched Hellsing Ultimate I couldn't watch it for more than a few episodes, as it was so tedious in its gratuity.\\n\r\n> Some of the themes presented are surprisingly progressive. It's revealed that a supposedly male member of the adventurer's party AOG travels with midway through the series is female, and the reason for her secrecy is because of the group's prejudice against female adventurers. \\n\\n\r\nNEGATIVES:\\n\\n\r\n> Some of the characters in Overlord are clearly representations of classic archetypes. The Wise King of the Forest is clearly just there for comic relief and to embarrass AOG, while Albedo's presence as a character seems little more than to be a (very sexual) love interest to AOG. Her conflict with Shalltear over both character's love for AOG borders on \"yandere\"  levels of insanity. Shalltear very closely follows the trope of \"gothic lolita\", as she dresses in the clothing, and happens to be a vampire. To her credit though, her brief \"lamprey\" transformation later on in the series throws this cliche out the window. Narberal is a straight up \"tsundere\", as well as a \"battle maid\". Adherence to these archetypes is detrimental to the quality of the show, because it removes opportunities for more nuanced exploration of the characters, and seems to just be for the sake of fanservice.\\n\r\n> While we're talking about fanservice, it's bad. Really bad. Whenever Albedo is on screen, she's either shamelessly professing her love for AOG, defending AOG from attacks, fighting with Shalltear over AOG, or just talking about AOG in general. The worst case of this is when the demon character Demiurge finds Albedo in her bedchamber, apparently masturbating with an AOG body pillow. I suppose the intended comic relief in all this is AOG is a skeleton, and so possesses no sex organs, but the joke falls flat every time, and is therefore very lame.\\n\r\n> It's very clear that the creators of Overlord are angling for a second season, because several of the character's we've seen have not been fleshed out at all. Gazef, Brain, everyone in the Slane Theocracy, Cocytus, Demiurge, and the twin dark elves come to mind immediately. However, just because an anime is angling for a second season doesn't mean these characters can be so conspicuously flat; it's a cheap tactic and mars the quality of what is otherwise a very good show.",

I liked the voice of some characters, but it is not enough to solve the problem with the rolesof each character; because, honestly, there are many characters that did not even last a minute.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I saw this anime was because someone told me that \"It is an inverse shounen, where the protagonist, instead of venturing into nothingness in search of more power, he already has the power\", and although this has similarities With SAO, at least I found it interesting to see something different.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the design of the characters, which I think go according to the original, but there were errors and bad designs in the animation in many parts of the anime (like the CGI, for example); and as I said above, the lack of protagonism in the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf someone really recommends this work, or would like to see it, better read the novel because before risking this adaptation, even if it is something similar to SAO.

            "content": "So I finally got around to watching this and I started understanding why people like it so much.\r\nI like the isekai genre through all its faults. However, this over-saturation makes it hard for shows to stand out often. Of course we get our SAO's which are big by being mainstream, but we also get Konosuba style shows that have enough meta-comentary on RPG's or games with a cast of lovable characters to be fun and entertaining.\r\nOverlord seems to break plenty of these bonds by achieving most of them very well. Now, it is somewhat mainstream, it has bouts of comedy, and I find myself caringfor each character on Ains' team. The biggest success however is playing it straight with no true story to be seen. You really see that the only goals in this world aren't a major story quest, but the goal that Ains' and other decide to set for themselves. Sure, he sets out to find out if any other players exist in the world, however, we also see that he has become more identified with his lich form. He cares for these characters not for their race, but for the bonds he build with his guild-mates over those previous 7 years.\\n\\n\r\nWhile you have Ains' playing the stereotypical OP MC role that you see in a lot of isekai, they break the mold slightly by showing most of his though processes throughout his ordeal. Ains' doesnt' seem to have any idle plans, and he is trying to think of an actual outcome to any battle he's in. He knows the value of knowledge, and that's the asset he plays the most. He never goes into a battle with a disadvantage because he already made sure to protect and buff the disadvantages he might have. He truly embodies the idea of \"never start a fight you know you can't win\". I was even refreshed to see him retreat when needed rather than bash his skull (got a pun in) against a fictional wall to prove his bravery.\\n\\n\r\nIt's interesting to watch this world develop as it's both familiar and unfamiliar to Ains. He has to reconcile what he knows from his experience, and what he must find out. Even being powerful, it doesn't ever imply he's invincible. Heavy costs come with poor decisions, and you can often feel the weight of each decision he makes for the good of the guild.\\n\\n\r\nThe show felt like it had some smarts to it, and more importantly, it impressed this upon the viewer when he came out on top. Sure, magic gives you some leeway; but, often they at least would show you the train of thought they had to make Ains come out on top in an encounter. One thing is for sure, when I start Overlord II I know everyone is going to want off \"Mr. Bones' Wild Ride\"",

            "content": "Story (5/10)\r\n-Overlord is way too heavy of a title for an anime of this mediocrity. The storyline is linear, but the pacing is almost atrocious. This anime is based off of a Light Novel, which would explain the weirdly-timed comedy and snail-speed pacing disguised as slow burn plot progression. I'm almost completely convinced that to make an RPG anime that would actually show what an RPG is like would take several seasons, and then some more for plot progression.\r\n-The story does not feel entirely fleshed out, and the entire season felt like it could have finished in 3 episodes if paced right. The \"final bossfight\" would have been epic if I actually knew the characters behind the weapons used, but instead I'm left out of the loop with three Guardians trying to narrate a boring fight in my ear.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\n-Madhouse was supposedly famous for its fight scenes, and I barely got to see any fight scenes actually worth noting in this show. Anatomy-wise, Madhouse exceeds expectations as usual. Animation-wise, it was completely lacking with respect to the studio.\\n\r\n-Heavy scenes were superimposed with cringe-worthy CGI that Madhouse tried to get away with through a mix of 2D and 3D character animation during these sequences, and that was just about the only real effort I saw in terms of art. The colors bounced off computer-generated skins that alluded to its RPG-world graphics, but I can't let that excuse the laziness this anime was left with.\\n\r\n-The art wasn't bad, per say, but it had a lot lacking. I'm just glad there were no inconsistencies.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10)\\n\r\nOpening Song\\n\r\n-I watched the first episode's OP, got tired of it, and skipped it every chance I got after. Just so you know, the intros range from 1:10-4:00, and the estimated time of the entire OP is 1:20. I memorized that just so I could accurately skip it.\\n\r\n-On that note, it's probably because I really don't care for pop rock songs. Especially ones that mix English with Japanese.\\n\r\nEnding Song\\n\r\n-Similarly treated like the OP, except I watched the second episode's ED as well just because I wanted to hear the singer say \"fxxking\" again.\\n\r\n-Still rock. Still don't like it.\\n\r\nSoundtrack\\n\r\n-Was there one? I would expect there to be at least mildly epic fight music but it was left as classical choir singing notes just as the climax hits. Not bad, but nothing new here.\\n\r\n-Lack of mood-setting music. There's no real game music whatsoever, and the range of song diversity falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10)\\n\r\n-This is what I wanted to get into: there are hardly any real characters. We just mostly see Momonga's unmoving skeletal face and hear an inner voice for endless monologues. I never felt a connection or any empathy towards him missing his fellow guild members. I don't even remember them much, besides that they had ridiculous names. Even the Nazarick NPCs were left for me to just wonder about, even if they were such a small cast. I still don't know how many maids there are or any of their names besides Nabe, and I only remember her because we were stuck with her for, like, 4 episodes.\\n\r\n-We never even get to see what Momonga was like in real-life. Peeved me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\r\n-I thought I would enjoy this a lot more. To be honest, with the title Overlord, I thought there would be a lot more of him lording over things and people.\\n\r\n-Some jokes were funny, even some dirty scenes here and there, and I can't say I didn't enjoy them but I can't say they'll make me laugh every time either.",

He and the NPCS in his guild are transported into another fantasy world and everyone becomes real, and so does the magic he used in the old game. \r\nThe story isn't the best I've seen, but it was still good and there were certain aspects of the story I really liked. I thought the concept of the series was brilliant, which gets some plus points, but it could've been executed slightly better towards the middle.  I didn't really like the factthat Ainz joined a guild in the new world they found themselves in, but that choice did lead to a few good scenes (all the ones with Clementine in them).\\n\\n\r\nEven with the flaws, the story was made well enough that it deserves to be watched. I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\n I really hope that Overlord gets a sequel. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was quite good. The art style was likable, the art itself was well rendered, and the actual animation was fluid and clean. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending were deliciously good. I don't remember a thing about the rest of the soundtrack - unmemorable but not awful I guess - but good god the opening and ending were amazing. It was one of those series where I watch the opening and the ending in their entirety every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was quite good as well (Clementine and Ainz had terrific voice acting.) Sound effects would well done too. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI think Overlord had a pretty good cast. Ainz, Albedo, and Clementine were the shining stars of the cast. The rest were not bad by any means, but it kind of disappointed me that more of Ainz's servants weren't expanded upon more (a lot of the series they weren't there because he was in the E-Rantel guild.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.8. I'll round it up and give it an 8/10 for the official score. Not bad at all.",

            "content": "After watching the final episode of Overlord, and taking some time to compile my thoughts on it, I hopefully have put together a coherent series of words to describe my thoughts.\r\nIn case you don't already know, Overlord is about our oh-so-normal gaming fanatic who poured his life into the virtual reality game Yggdrasil, however, due to whatever reasons, after 12 years of service, is shutting down. The MC, Momonga, decided to stay with his guild headquarters, The Great Tomb of Nazarick, which his guild, composed of 41 members painstakingly created. Thought, over the years of the game, eventually all but 4 of the members quitbecause their real lives took precedence. Lonely, Momonga takes up the guild weapon, the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown, which was a huge guild undertaking to make, to the throne room. He sits on the throne, and waits to be kicked from the game when the server shuts down at midnight. Midnight rolls past, and he is still in the game. The non-player characters whom always had just the basic level of AI, spoke to him. After confirming, they were now flesh-and-blood living people. However, he isn't just a human character, actually... none of the characters in Nazarick are. Momonga, realizing his life in reality isn't really worth much, so he decides to stay... and conquer this world!\\n\\n\r\nNow to the review-ish bits.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Madhouse be praised, the quality of the animation is fantastic. Each of the characters is well drawn, colored, and animated. The CG that was done was well integrated and not intrusive or ugly. When it comes to animation, Madhouse doesn't disappoint. 5/5\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: The sound and music of Overlord is pretty damn good, the OP/ED are catchy, the ambient music and sound effects are synced, and nothing sounds out of place or weird. 5/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Madhouse did very well with the first few episodes, giving the important time with the NPC's interacting with one another, easily getting across who they are and what they think of each other, and Momonga. I truly like the dynamic of the characters with Momonga, when he speaks, they shut up and give him undivided attention. Even the love-stricken Albedo obeys instantly, even if she doesn't like it. With a LN adaptation such as this, characters can't really get the development that you hope, but they can only pour so much into thirteen episodes. So on characters, 4/5\\n\\n\r\nStory: As far as the story goes, a lot of worry was emphasized on being an 'SAO clone,' and I was kind of worried it would turn off a lot of people from the show. However, episode 3 rolled around and it took that assumption and threw it out a window. The story was well paced, up till i want to say the last 3 episodes. They skipped almost all of The Bloody Valkyrie, but I can forgive them because they did an excellent job in keeping the story tidy and smooth for anime-only watchers. But as a LN reader, I was pretty disappointed. If i look at it from a Anime only standpoint, 4/5\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In my opinion, Overlord was excellent. Madhouse turned one of my favorite light novels into a damn good adaptation. The fights were epic, the dialogue was well written, and it felt like the book I had read. I have to say, this was my favorite of the season. I sincerely hope for season 2, as long as Madhouse does it. I feel like it stands on it's own and breaks a new path in the 'trapped in a game' genre. It is also truly worth reading the novels, as they are some of the best out there at the moment.",

            "content": "I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d masturbate to an undead - Overlord review\r\nFrom my first perception of Overlord, what caught my eyes were the punk-ish stylish look of the cover art. What turned me off was my assumption, from the description, that it was going to be another shitty fucking SAO. But then I read a comment saying to not put them on the same plane. I am pleased.\r\nThe virtual mmorpg Yggdrasil is on its last active day before shutting down completely. Momonga is the guild master of the guild Ainz Ooal Gown. Everyone of the guild members, his closest friends, have left to continue with theirjobs and feed their family. He is the sole remaining member. When he decides to stay in the game until getting kicked out by the server shutdown, he has strangely not been logged out. He cannot log out nor contact the GMs. He quickly finds out that the game is not a game anymore but a strange reality. The NPCs, his senses etc. have all become real in the strange phenomenon. Now he seeks to learn more about his fate in order to live in this world.\\n\\n\r\nI delved into Overlord with a neutral expectation. I adore the idea of an mmorpg anime, however, it does a great job of making you forget that it is actually an mmorpg while still being one. It does a great job of making you forget that the main character is human. And I\u2019ll explain why. The world setting is of that mmorpg aspects are a part of the normal, seemingly integrated in a masterfully blended way. NPCs will have no questions towards cash shop items or the usual game terms because it\u2019s a part of the world, at least to those of Nazarick for the most part. Momonga is a human being, and since he\u2019s a real undead in an assumingly real world, he has done things he normally would\u2019ve regretted or felt undeniably guilty because of his passive skill as an undead to not feel emotions. As the show progresses, he kills and hurts humans, whether they are evil or not, for the sake of his plan. It manipulates the audience smoothly with ease, progressively diverting our thoughts of reminder that it\u2019s an mmorpg based show.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse does it again giving Overlord the writing and direction needed for a damn good show. The connecting ideas within the story build this bridge in a universe that we come to care about, and not just some deus ex machina or random event without any idea or purpose behind it. It sets up future scenarios from various moments in previous episodes or events prior to that scene. While regrettably Overlord is only a 13 episode show, it delivers satisfyingly and tells quite a compelling contained story during that span of episodes. It sets up a season 2 perfectly, and by no means is it a sequel bait. The final conflict ends where it concludes nicely, then goes on to bring up sequences of events to hype us even more for what\u2019s to expect. Madhouse being Madhouse serves up quality art and animation. They\u2019ve created a foreboding atmosphere and a gritty setting. Though the CGI in anime like always seem out of place, but for Overlord you\u2019ll forgive it as it delivers in action and a satisfying range in narrative. Onto sound, it\u2019s great. Each voice actor does their part fitting of the characters they\u2019re portraying. For example, Momonga when he monologues in his human voice then transitioning to his character\u2019s voice makes it a great dynamic. Or Clementine when she screams in agony is so weirdly pleasuring. I think it did its job. The bgms assist the impactful scenes furthering the curiosity of upcoming scenes. Opening and ending are perfect. The intro and ending sequences along with the songs are a perfect date for one another. It\u2019s crisp clean. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters for the most part are reserved and collected, Momonga especially, acting the part, for the sake of being of Nazarick\u2019s citizens last and remaining supreme ruler. While not everyone gets the screen time to develop, from the start everyone is already at a mutual and respectable character. Momonga is our main protagonist, he uses his knowledge from what has learned in Yggdrasil when it was an mmorpg to communicate in the world he currently resides in. He shows he is not naive and reckless by taking reserved actions and scouting the world, even for someone as supreme as him, a max leveled player with godly gears and items. While he may seem consumed into being \u201canti-human\u201d via the undead passive he has, Momonga still has his human side. We see that he\u2019s still perplexed as to what to do in this world and misses his friends who have all left Nazarick. At first Albedo\u2019s absolute love and devotion to Momonga turned me off, even though he changed her settings right before the game became reality, she easily won me over for not overreacting in the most annoying way. In fact, she is quite hilarious. For example when Momonga gave her a guild member ring and left, she quickly turned around and just made a funny reaction. But the best example of her character is how she portrays her devotion to Momonga during their fight against the Slaine Theocracy within the first few episodes. It may seem cliche of her character but it works well. She was quite bad ass for the short lived moment it was. The rest of the cast like I said is mutually respectable. They don\u2019t have essential roles in the story as of yet, but for what they\u2019ve done to support Momonga is commendable and I was actually fine. I didn\u2019t find them at all a nuisance nor hindrance, but of worthy extension in the cast. My personal favorite being Cocytus, a collective and charming insectoid warrior \u2018thingy\u2019. Everyone else is pretty derivative of some character trait, however which is reasoned by how much of an otaku the 41 supreme beings were. They created them to represent themselves, or their favorite type of characters. Which in real life, if anyone had the chance, we wouldn\u2019t actually think of creating a super in depth character with a sophisticated and grim backstory. No. We would just make them simple and have fun. But any how, none of the characters I found were at any point a bother.\\n\\n\r\nI was wrong to to think of Overlord to be a rip off only to capitalize on the recent mmorpg boom. It stands on its own, much stronger than SAO, Dot Hack, and Log Horizon. It\u2019s unique to itself as a series. And that it why Overlord earns a 9/10 with an Undead body pillow seal of approval. It has a great narrative written exceptionally and adequately stands out the most of those in its genre. It shows and tells us why it deserves a sequel, and it earns it. An awesome story like this cannot be left hanging on a thread. Capitalize all you want Madhouse, you\u2019ve done it again. I\u2019ll see you guys on my next review.",

            "content": "I've dropped A LOT of animes using the MMORPG universe. I'm not fond of them and I feel they are very telegraphed. There's usually little element of surprise in the story or the characters. The people who created Hack// must feel really bad for giving birth to this animation sub-genre. \r\nAt first I wasn't at all interested in Overlord but a friend of mine recommended it so I gave it a try. I was kinda hooked from episode 1 because of the whole \"the MC is an evil liche king stuck in a video game\" and not \"a fighter grouping with other adventurers to setthemselves free from the MMO curse\".\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nThe server of a famous MMORPG is closing and a player gets stuck inside. He's the leader of a famous guild but all his friends stopped playing a long time ago. He realises he's stuck there with the harem of NPCs they programmed who become human-like after the servers close. By human-like I mean they have feeling etc. The MC's avatar is a pretty badass Liche King called Momonsan. Once the servers are closed his own feelings get erased and he thinks like a Liche King while still remembering he's human IRL.\\n\r\nSo pretty basic setup overall, he then realizes there's a human world he can access and tries to find other players. He joins an adventurer guild to learn more about the human world and disguises himself as a huge knight in armor.\\n\r\nWhile the story is not very original its still kind of catchy until episode 8-9. Then it just goes down a hole which really disappointed me. The last 4 episodes were utter rubish.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nWhile it's not amazing it's pretty consistent. Nothing crazy with the art style, the action is well animated but don't expect to have your brainz blown out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe dubbing is good but both the opening and ending kinda sucked. Thumbs up for the sound effects though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nMomonsan (the MC) is cool but his harem of NPCs who wanna ride his dick are a lot less adorable. Maybe I don't get the whole lolli thing. Still giving a 7 for the heartbreaking story with the adventurer group.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 5/10\\n\r\nThe last episodes just ruined it for me. No fun whatsoever watching them. The final fight is fine but the opponent is terrible. A lot of disappointement there. If you miss SOA and that kind of gibberish then you'll probably like this a lot more than me. Everything just falls apart at the end and the plot is full of hole. These inconsistencies make it hard for me to give it a higher grade than 5.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion not a bad anime but a very disappointing one. It get's your hopes up but nothing happens in the end. A very bland first season.\\n\\n\r\nOveral : 5/10",

            "content": "Overlord is what SAO should have been; there is no other way to describe it. \r\nOverlord begins by throwing you straight into the action and dynamics of the game, with the main focus being on Ainz Ooal Gown - a coterie (or intimately close guild) that plans to take over the land of Yggdrasii. While some may argue that this can be daunting or rather, offputting at first, the immersive story and brilliant dialogue keep you wanting to digest more information about this intricate online game. Its plot can be rocky at times and, not to mention, there are some episodes that seem too rushed.However, the depth of these episodes and how far they delve in exploring the relationships between the numerous characters feels enriching. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that leads me to my next point. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a work of art themselves. They are each, for the most part, imbued with different and complex personalities: lord Ains comes across as cold, callous, and calculating at first - however when his outer mental wall is stripped away, we get to see his finitely caring and selfless temperament. And sometimes, the characters need not possess depth; instead, their deep love and intense admiration (to the point of idolization) for Lord Ains is funny and strangely gripping on its own. The only problem is that there is just not enough of them.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a wealth of lore and history within the land of Yggdrasil - even a blind man could see that. And that, on its own, serves as effective temptation to draw you in. But one thing the anime lacks is the motive and time to dig up this knowledge and explore the different magic types and combat skills (online gaming paraphernalia) in enough detail that would be satisfying. This kind of 'skimming over' is my main problem with the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIt is also obligatory to mention that the combat is on another level. From the range of magic attacks cast by Lord Mormonga, or the physical parries by Shaltear, almost every action scene leaves you on the edge of your seat - wanting, desiring, and craving more. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you were left feeling unsatisfied with the undelivered potential and promise of SAO, Overlord will make up for the faults of its inferior predecessor and add more depth and lore, in measure of plot, combat, character, and plot. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Its safe to say that Overlord does not fit in the standard form of simply rating anime. Overlord is to be glorified and adored for many reasons. After the critically acclaimed Sword art online the craze started, the world wanted more anime like it, they wanted more Isekai. Many came following Sword art online's popularity, shows like Log Horizon and many others began to surface out of the depths of great Manga and amidst all the isekai to emerge, came Overlord. Overlord follows the same base idea of many isekai anime, that being a person is somehow transported into a fantasy or game like worldwith some iterations giving the main character some kind of overpowered boost that sets him from the rest of the world. Overlord is no exception to this. Although this is the case, Overlord seemingly and effortlessly makes an already overused idea into something enjoyable to watch. clever writing and direction really set the tone for the entire anime. There are moments where the audience already knows the might of the main character and that he/she has the capabilities of destroying worlds but time and time again the audience is lured into a false sense of power. The unknown is truly what scares most and the main character is fully aware and wants to be absolutely sure when continuing on with his plans.\\n\\n\r\nIt's destructive, and it's powerful. Overlord delivers everything that an isekai fan yearns for and a pleasant watch for newcomers to the series or anime in general. The music and soundtracks ooze power and pump adrenaline into the audience, the characters are well fleshed out and each character is far from a stale personality, they all have that bump. The anime is enjoyable to the very end and keeps the fans wanting more and more. Luckily by the time of me writing this review, the second season for Overlord is airing and is just as exciting if not more than its predecessor.",

            "content": "(SPOILERS for the first episode.)\r\nA likable protagonist? In my isekai anime? It's more likely than you think. \r\nIn fact, our hero's likability is pretty much what saves Overlord from becoming a huge bore. As Momonga, Satoru Suzuki is extremely overpowered, as you might guess from the show's title. Time in and time out, he manages to use his gaming prowess to defeat his enemies. \r\nThankfully, the show manages to be less like another No Game No Life and more like One-Punch Man in this regard; under the overpowered skeleton surface, Momonga is a genuinely relatable everyman. He's the kind of dork who communicates with hisfellow players using cartoonish smilies that contrast with his creepy avatar and spends the last day of his favorite MMO's existence screwing around with all the power he's amassed throughout his time playing. Seeing him so all the silly, sentimental things I could see myself doing if one of my favorite games was closing got me firmly on board with him as a character. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say our hero, along with Madhouse's stellar-as-usual artwork and sound, can save the show from every single flaw though. One of Overlord's biggest issues is in its pacing. While earlier episodes go by at a pretty steady pace, the overall arc starts to slow down in later parts and eventually goes full on One Piece shonen battle pacing by the end. While you might be able to tell from One Piece being firmly placed in my favorite anime that this didn't really bother me, I can see how it can feel slow if you're not the kind of viewer who is used to it. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as genres I'm not as big of a fan of there are also times the show teeters towards becoming a harem anime, with scenes where female characters argue over the usual harem crap. This was annoying and honestly felt kind of out of place with everything else, especially with Momonga himself being uncomfortable with it. \\n\\n\r\nAnother shortcoming of the anime is standard for the isekai genre at this point: the world of Yggdrassil is just your very bland, standard MMO. There's not much to see that's unique here. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, while not perfect, Overlord pleasantly surprised me. It's one of the first Isekai anime I've watched where I honestly related to the protagonist, and I enjoyed the shonen elements. I look forward to catching season 2 of this show in the future.",

            "content": "Seeing Overlord for the first time will make you think \u201coh\u2026it\u2019s just another op MC trapped in a game kind of thing\u201d but that all change when I actually finished it. Although the \u201cbeing stuck in a virtual game\u201d genre became a clich\u00e9 nowadays because of a certain anime if you know what I mean\u2026and of top of that the OP main character with ridiculous amount of strength is obviously a clich\u00e9 too. But this anime in particular is unique in its own way especially anime in this particular genre or setting. The difference is in its different views on certain subjects from the charactersideals and ambitions to total action packed OP badass that will make awe. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around a player trapped in a virtual game that turned reality and progresses into conquest of the land. Even though the plot is clich\u00e9 the story is not. The small detail of how the anime captures the memories of your comrades the hardships and joys of in-game achievement and adventures and the pain and loneliness of seeing your friends dwindle one by one leaving you all by yourself while gazing at the room that was once filled with you and your teammate\u2019s joys and laughter. On the bright side the story it is quite enjoyable it can be complicated at times when they are explaining certain gaming elements and stuff. The introduction is relatively slow to because of the introduction of the main characters and the supporting characters. However, as the story progresses the pacing and flow of the story changes from slow to moderate just like the rising and falling of events on the story. One of the most interesting factor on this anime is the MC or the subjects main point of views in the story that has a different feel or rather does not tie to the \u201cshounen protagonist/hero clich\u00e9\u201d that fights for justice and etc. It\u2019s not only the views of the main character but also the stories the different approach on thinking logically, strategically, emotionally and acting by principle. The anime gives you the question \u201cWhat should be the right approach on the current situation/circumstances?\u201d and also the phrase \u201cEverything has a reason/price in what you do\u201d. The conclusion of this anime will make you want for more or a second season in particular. The ending is in fact a mild ending scene; it is not too bad or does not have a major plot twist or impact. It just wants to make you want for more.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is actually good they did a good job with the use of some CG animation to feature some action sequences that are badass and impressive. The art fits with fantasy like setting and the mix of effects on scenes with fighting and usage of magic that smoothly mixes with the story. The representation of the characters personality matches with the art especially the MC\u2019s \u201cOverlord\u201d physique and representation. The most promising factor is the production gives the audience the blood and violence that the audience yearned for in a simple yet badass representation of blood and gore. It is not too gory and not to plain \u201cno blood\u201d killings. Also not over censored blood and gore that cover the entire anime.\\n\r\nThe voice actors portrayed the characters personality traits quite realistically. The BGM differs and is somewhat is in sync with the atmosphere of the story. The Opening and Ending song of the anime are in my opinion are awesome. The Opening for me represents the Overlord\u2019s ambition, thoughts and emotions. The Ending song is amazing with its mixture of metal and distorted electronic that is simply awesome.\\n\r\nThe characters development in the story is good the progression of each character but mainly the protagonist can be easily seen by the changes and circumstances of the events and situation and how they can cope with it. \\n\r\nThe characters portrayal and the development of each one with their different personalities and principles are quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion the anime overlord achieved somewhat my expectation on the trapped in a video game setting by giving it a different approach and unique points of view than the usual \u201cshounen protagonist troupe\u201d. The overall enjoyment is amazing it will give you incites in the different aspects on what will you do or the choices that may affect your judgment. While it has a deeper feel of being the last member of your guild and the only one who\u2019s trying to preserve it by making well known to the land. Truly one of my favorite anime, highly recommended for the people who likes a different views besides the usually clich\u00e9 style of delivering while it still has that OP character that is badass and amusing at the same time.\\n\\n",

It grabs you and doesn't let you go; great for bingeing. Although, there were a few things that broke me out of it. One or too inconsistencies and odd writing, but nothing too terrible, I think.\r\nArt: 8\r\nIt's good, it fits well and I didn't see anything that bothered me.\r\nSound: 10\r\nFantastic, the opening was great and really got me pumped for the show.

            "content": "My first reaction as this anime began was oh god not another one, as I had recently watched Log Horizon, and Sword Art Online (both seasons for both). I had also just finished One Punch man and was looking for something to recapture the fun I had.\r\n-Story \r\nDespite the story having been cut and shortened from what I could tell (missing plot points, and conversations left half-way) the story for the most part made sense. Despite the hidden aspects of the plot, the story doesn't feel forced, and has a nice flow to it. \r\n-Art\r\nEach character looks unique and easy to differentiate. Despite certain artassets looking old (eg. bad cg skeletons in the first 2 mins of the first episode) none of them look bad. Even the old art assets fit the anime, and sometimes even add to the anime's charm.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nThe sound effects always add to the impact of an action, and sometimes even manage to make you just listen instead of see. Each character sounds different although some fall to the super high pitch territory some may find annoying.\\n\\n\r\n-Character\\n\r\nAs mentioned, since each character looks and sounds different they are easy to identify. Most characters are only glossed over as the anime is quite short and goes into the plot before much self explanation happens. The characters hopes and dreams become clear from the actions they take, although some will take a while to figure out. Some side characters end up being a bit flat, but the world building makes you believe that you just missed the parts that gave them more depth. In the end the characters are fitting for the plot.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\nThis anime felt like a perfect mix of One Punch Man, Log Horizon, and Sword Art Online. It managed to conjoin the humor from One Punch Man, with the political intrigue of Log Horizon, and tied it all together with the action of Sword Art Online. I had an absolute blast watching, and re-watching, and re-watching, and re-watching this anime, and I will probably re-watch it again in the future. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall\\n\r\nI gave this anime a 10 not because it was flawless, but because the flaws add to the experience. Overlord is an anime that if you like the premise, once you start won't stop. It is an anime that makes the 24 min episode seem like 12 min episodes at most, and when it is done you wish for more. This was at least my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nMy fingers are crossed for season 2",

            "content": "This was definitely the best \u2018trapped in a game\u2019 anime that I\u2019ve seen so far. It wasn\u2019t a masterpiece, but still well worth watching.\r\nAnimation \u2013 no complaints. The art style was attractive and done appropriately for the mood and setting.\r\nThe sound was decent, and the voice acting cast was great. The opening and ending themes are acquired tastes, so you\u2019ll either love them or hate them. However they did actually complement the anime, contrasting well with the generally more apathetic MC and tone of the anime.\r\nThe premise has been done before, but this series had a unique twist to it \u2013 the MC was trappedin the game by himself! (At least for the duration of the anime, which in any case is what I\u2019m reviewing.) This actually played out in a really interesting manner, we got to see the MC adapt to everything by himself, as the only human with nothing but NPCs to rely on (and these were generally NPCs that he and other players had themselves created). The story is about how the MC reacts to his new surroundings and faces the challenges that come with it \u2013 therefore, not too focussed on character interaction, which was refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nI did like most of the supporting characters. Even though they didn\u2019t receive much development (due to the story being event and environment driven), their personalities meshed pleasantly with each other. There were a few cringe inducing moments, (particularly between Albedo and Shaltear) that I felt were unnecessary and even somewhat annoying. Only However, there were many great moments that made up for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe game world was presented brilliantly \u2013 the exposition relating to Nazarick in particular was excellent. The parts of the world that were featured heavily in the story were explored and developed, and the parts that weren\u2019t retained a sense of mystery that kept things interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a few brilliant battle scenes - some accompanied by exposition and some that were just pure action - but all were hugely enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also a strategy element to this anime that was somewhat reminiscent of Log Horizon, but it wasn\u2019t overused or particularly hard to follow. The MC being overpowered in this anime also felt natural and was pleasing rather than obnoxious (which it could easily have been if it had been dealt with differently). \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, not fabulous, but again, it was the best \u2018stuck in a game\u2019 world I\u2019ve seen yet. It was well done, but 8 was the best I could give because it didn\u2019t evoke really any strong emotions in me when I was watching it (even though I was interested enough by the setting, plot and characters to keep watching). \\n\\n\r\nObviously I\u2019d recommend for fans of the genre, but also for those that enjoy comedy or action anime that are a little more on the intellectual side.

            "content": "Overlord basically tells a story about this MMORPG named Yggdrasil that\u2019s currently dying. And thus it ended the legend of Ainz Ooal Gown, the most well-known and powerful player in the game.\r\nHowever, he notices that he can\u2019t sign off and thus he gets trapped in this world. But soon enough he notices that the environment is different and his guild NPC turns to be real beings with emotions. \r\nI\u2019m pretty sure most of us probably thinks that the story will surely enough be the same as of SAO, but I kid you not it\u2019s a lot better and I mean a LOT Better.\r\nWell, in Overlord,the protagonist is OP as crap, but in a way that is believable. I mean if you play an MMORG like WoW and grind up a crap ton you could end up just like him. And the protagonist have been playing this game since it\u2019s launching and never let go of it till the very end. He\u2019s like those people you see in the leaderboards ranking number 1 all the time. Different from shows like Sword Art Online, that makes a story of \u201credemption and revenge\u201d into this \u201cFan service 100%\u201d. Overlord plot inherent a sense of originality where it\u2019s fun to see the MC as this Over Powered person but also, believable. He plays the role of almost as an antagonist, who have the world in his hands. He can overthrow anyone and it\u2019s fun to see how he can shaped the world as their Overlord.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows main pros are it\u2019s character development. Every move that Ainz took defines his character as a person who knows every single detail about RPGs or we could call a Tryhard. And when he thinks of an idea, a plan of action he thinks very thoroughly on his plans, he knows the consequences of his every move and can handle everything on his own accord. Also not to mention, the other characters are also loveable and we could invest a lot for each character. The show also have a sense of comedy in a sense that no one knows about The MC\u2019s OPness in the new world. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art and OST of the show went well together and really dynamically show, the shows potential. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoy the anime and it\u2019s considered as an anime that I could think again as a really enjoyable show. That delivers a clear story and direction, the plot is easy to understand and in a sense we could imagine ourselves as the Overlord, that could take over the world.\\n",

Instead Overlord is a response to the already well established concept of Isekai, but with some twists which puts it above manyof its predecessors.",

            "content": "Overlord is the next in the series of novels where people are trapped in video games to be made into an anime. The story of Overlord is about Momonga, who almost immediately renames himself to Ainz Ooal Gown, who is online in a game called Yggdrasil at the last moment that the game is going to go offline. However, he is still there once the servers are supposed to go down and he finds himself in another world with everything that was in his castle at the time. In this new world of swords and magic, there are elements from Yggdrasil, but also elements thatare not. There, Ainz begins his search for what the heck is going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Overlord is very impressive and there are times when it feels like it is the quality of an OVA instead of just an anime series. The only downside to the animation is that sometimes, the skill effects look out of place because some are made with computer effects and have a bit of 3D whereas others fit in like standard animation. It creates a bit of inconsistency.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme of the series is fairly generic fast and loud guitar and song about power. The ending theme is similar, but more with Albedo and lyrics about love and obsession, which matches her character, but still sort of feels out of place like the opening theme. Had the music in the show itself adopted a similar style during even combat, it could have at least been more consistent. This greatly contrasts the fantasy setting that it is going for when the towns often play lighter music that sounds like it's from a banjo. However, the music that often goes into the Great Tomb of Nazarick matches its atmosphere and theme. If the series had been more consistent with its music, it might have been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nA big weakness in Overlord is the lack of proper character development. The entire story is pushed by the fact that Ainz does not know what is going on and attempts to do so, but we do not learn much more about him or his previous life. He just accepts things as is and hopes to seek out anyone else from Yggdrasil. Each of the Floor Guardians of Nazarick have their own personality and theme, but also do not change. They are all driven by their love of their masters and do little on screen but swear their loyalty with only a few exceptions. Each of those characters are supposed to have been programmed by members of Nazarick with complete character profiles and programming, but we never really get to see this.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a standard Shounen series or something like Sword Art Online and Log Horizon, you will enjoy Overlord. The main character is absurdly powerful to the point where anytime he or his companions enters combat, he just rolls his way forward destroying everything. For comparison, most trained soldiers are like at a level 20 range, the main character is close to 100 and can summon creatures that are considered to be legendary to the local population. However, the fights are not the focus of the series though there are a few epic ones. The focus is on the world and learning about it and a little more of the world is explored with each story arc. If you are hoping for character development and an eventual escape by Ainz back to his world, then you might want to skip this. If you want to see what happens when the most powerful being ever to exist ends up in another world, then Overlord might be worth giving a try.",

The one thing i didn't like about the show is how the main character is a skeleton and the prime demonic slut fighting on his side was totally into him, making this a bit too necrophiliac for my taste.\r\nThe annoying bit about this story is how it abruptlyends, without offering any explanation who the big dreadful opponent even is.

It's not only irritating, it is also incomparable.\r\nIf you want to compare Overlord to a \"similar\" you should compare it more to Log Horizon, where you know that the protagonist is trapped but know nothing or little about him from his past on real life, neither how the game was actually based upon.\r\nThis isn't a survival game plot. The story tells about someone who got trapped on a world he liked more than the real life, but nobody plays it anymore. Story follows some interesting aspects, like the change of personality andthe \"tense situation control\" on which an aura forces him to stay calm.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I liked the more about this anime is probably the character design, as the story gets twisted throughout the episodes, but in the end, gets somewhat solid and ready for a new season.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a great anime if you like to reach more deeply how getting \"trapped\" inside a mmorpg would end up like, protagonist affection with his old guild mates, behavioural change to adapt his new character, etc. \\n\\n\r\nPlease don't even think about comparing it with SAO.",

            "content": "Hello, this will be a review for Overlord. There will be minor spoilers, but nothing to ruin the show. It was an enjoyable anime, one perhaps that I would start reviewing however after seeing other users reviews I wanted to make one of my own. I have only watched the anime so that's all I can review.\r\nStory 6\r\n    When someone reads about this show they may already be hit with the stereotypical feelings they have for anime in this genre. Overlord is one of several recent anime that includes the main characters induction into a fantasy world hecant escape from. At the start of the show you see that the main character is a working man who plays an MMO called Yggdrasil which is being taken down. He decides to remain in the game until the servers are taken down. However when the time comes he finds he's still sitting in the same spot. Thus our show begins.\\n\\n\r\n    Even though Overlord presents itself in a different manner it doesn't introduce anything \"new\", or \"refreshing\" in terms of story. I put those terms in quote marks because these terms are used often to demean some form of entertainment. Even though the show isn't new or refreshing doesn't make it a terrible show. Its easy to critique other peoples work and simply hide behind general terms like this, rather than come to the forefront and make something of your own or explain what it is that the show did or didn't do correctly. Overlord is its own show within a typical framework. Just like most anime that people consider rip offs or clones.\\n\\n\r\n    The protagonist is named Momonga. After the initial shock he sets to work trying to figure out whats happened to him. This is a typical setup for an anime in this genre. However from here the anime fans out in another direction. Where the others work in the constraints of the MMO world, Overlord use the MMO world as a backbone for a fantasy story. This allows for a interesting new world to be explored without constraint. The premise of this anime is very interesting and unfortunately ended too quickly. \\n\\n\r\n    I will say Overlord seems to have a bit of a jumpy pace to it. After the first couple of episodes the story begins to go in different directions and when something gets introduced it feels rushed. Ultimately it feels like it would have been better if it would have taken its time and explained everything as it went. I haven't read the manga, but i imagine this is a case of being to much info to cram into a 13 episode anime.\\n\\n\r\n    All things considered I cant give the story section a high score. However I like the setting and the direction the story is going and find it enjoyable. Its not intricate, thought provoking, deep or mysterious but it is enjoyable.If your happy with a decent story in a fantasy setting you should give it a try. If your looking for a twist that will blow your mind or a show on the depth of human nature Overlord is not for you. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Music 6\\n\\n\r\n    I am not a huge stickler for art or music. These elements only add to an anime and hardly ever detract. The art side of Overlord seemed well done and nicely animated. The characters were well drawn and I particularly liked their facial expressions. The scenery didn't leave a big impact in my mind but it wasn't bad either. The CGI that was used added a nice look to some of the scenes. The intro and outro were nice and easy to recognize. The music played during the show mixed in well and didn't detract from the scene's. The music didn't stick out to me like other shows like Jormangund, Mirai Nikki, or Clannad but it was still well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7\\n\\n\r\n    I would love to be able to praise the characters outright, however its really difficult to do. In my opinion the characters are forgettable and not much to write home about. Most of the story revolves around Momonga and the npc guardians of the guild hall. There are other characters that seem important to the story but nothing really becomes of any of them. Even the villains feel shallow. Even if you can categorize a person based on how they act you never get a chance to truly understand them. \\n\\n\r\n    The npc's had the ability to be much more interesting than they are in the anime. Since the npc's were created by people in the guild and given personalities by them as well, they could have been used more in a variety of ways. I say a variety of ways because each npc had a different personality but for the most part they were loyal servants to Momonga. If even five people sat down and created a different person with a different personality to boot we would all come up with some odd people. Add in the fact that these are all fake people inside a video game and I would bet good money that they would stand out in a crowd. They tried to show that the npc's held the same characteristics of their creators but they never really pushed that angle either. The npc's really only stood out because they looked exotic in some way.\\n\\n\r\n    Momonga was the center of attention but he didn't really stand out either. People seem to call him evil but he isn't. The way the guild was organized caused him to become an \"evil ruler\" when he found himself in this new world. Of course there are some evil like things he says in the anime however they sort of explain why early on. He also tries to maintains the npc guardians image of him(which is above lesser creatures). This is played out several times during the anime and it is one thing that makes him more interesting. I should also mention that he is very powerful. I like powerful main characters because it does feel refreshing to see a character take action after watching weak or lazy main characters in other stories. He isn't so powerful its in your face and ruins any conflict that arises. I felt attached to most of the fights in the anime and wasn't disappointed with any wild escapes or ass pulls. Most of his power can be easily traced to common MMO elements and really meshes well with the MMO background.\\n\\n\r\n    I know I said that the characters were weak however they all work together well to build the foundation of this world that the writers want us to see. I managed to have a favorite character(Aura Bella Fiora) and enough attachment to the others that I would hate for one to be gone. The fact that I'm attached to them at all with the little knowledge I have about them means that the writers did a good job creating them. I watched three seasons of Dog Days and I can only tell you about the three princess's and the main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8\\n\\n\r\n    Overall I enjoyed Overlord. I may write more on the negative side of things, but its always the side easiest to write for. Overlord present itself in a nice fashion. It doesn't focus on elements that SAO and Log horizon presented(not that either of them are bad). Instead it opens up a new fantasy universe with a more concrete background. The character interactions and the situations in this anime may not keep you breathless but they will have you looking forward to the next episode. As a big fan of MMO and RPG games I was pleased to see well thought out character abilities and powers. I was constantly impressed with events in the anime because they played off of the MMO background but incorporated it well into their fantasy world they created. I'm looking forward to a second season and I plan to pick up reading the manga.\\n\\n\r\nPower Fantasy?\\n\r\n    Now that my review is finished I wanted to quickly discuss the term \"Power Fantasy\". This is a term that crops up a lot when a main character has some strength to them. The term is often used in derogatory fashion. If someone claims something is a power fantasy it has negative stigma attached to it. Why do we watch anime? why do we read books? why do we watch T.V? for each person who answers it will be different, however one of the biggest reasons is to be entertained. Almost every fantasy story has a strong character that the people who watch can rally behind. People talk about projecting yourself onto the character. Maybe some people can, but a lot of times its difficult to truly do this. Even if you do manage to see yourself as the main character there isn't anything wrong with that. We all are here to be entertained. None of us can fly, cast magic, fight in giant robots or do half the shit that happens in a fiction. Sure a super powerful character can ruin the flow of a story but most of the time its done well enough. We all have emotional needs. We all want to be accepted, to be understood, to be thought of. There isn't anything wrong with wishing you could live in an anime, video game or book. We have all dreamed of crushing our boss in someway or imagined what we would do in a zombie invasion. Giving an anime a bad review because you think the characters are too strong is ignorant, and so is calling out the people who enjoyed it and making them out to be some loser.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Pretty good, interesting enough to keep your attention but has some flaws.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Overall, I would say this is above average but not the best anime out there. Since the other characters are just NPCs (non-player characters) they are pretty one-dimensional. Regardless, there are a lot of funny moments.\r\nThis might resonate with people who are MMORPG players but in my opinion, apart from the \"trapped in a game world\" premise the rest of the story is not that interesting.\r\nHowever, it's nice and unique to have a lich (a skeleton type undead) as a main character.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve made two grievous mistakes in my life; one eating a spoonful of wasabi, and two watching mars of destruction because I did not heed the warnings.  By divine intervention I was prevented from making a third. I came really close to not watching this anime.  I read the synopsis for Overlord, I remember thinking \u201cgreat, another second-rate story.\u201d It sounded unappealing, at best I thought this anime was going to be a lame rip-off of SAO.  I\u2019ve never to been happier to be wrong, Overlord is the best anime of 2015.  I apologize if I sound dogmatic, but those who\u2019vewatched the series can attest to the veracity of my words.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started watching anime, I remember watching epic series after epic series.  Then after a while they started to dwindle and I was forced to watch mediocracy.  Not so with Overlord, this anime keep me fully immerse in the story.  I was at the edge of my seat and it felt as if I was on this adventure alongside the protagonist.  As I mentioned before the synopsis on MAL does not do this anime justice.  The story flows really well and everything is explained appropriately.  There are moments of actual humor, I love the inner dialogue of the protagonist.  There are no dull instances or fillers.  Everything happened with a purpose and was highlighted by the epic fight scenes and calculated scenarios.   \\n\\n\r\nMomonga or Ainz Ooal Gown is the only character that is not a NPC.  Most of the story revolves around his perspective.  I will admit he falls under the category of overpowered.  However, given that he has spent a great deal of time and money playing the game and was the only one still playing while the server was discontinued.  His strength and power will certainly be understandable.  He is joined by several NPC\u2019s that he and his friends had created over the years.  Each NPC is unique in appearance and personality and added to the overall awesomeness of the anime.  Given that I want to remain as spoiler free as possible I will refrain going into further details about the characters.          \\n\\n\r\nThe only real problem I had with this anime was that it was only 13 episodes.  Although the story did not feel rush in the slightest, I felt betrayed because the story stop.  This anime could have at least been made into a 24 episode series.  Now I am a little concern because from what I\u2019ve heard Madhouse, the producers of Overlord, are not too keen in making sequels.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is really crisp and the amination is very well done.  The music and sound were very enjoyable.  The opening song was extremely good and appropriate for the anime.  If you cannot tell by now I absolutely loved this anime.  Just about everything about this anime was done exceptionally well.  This anime certainly has the qualifications to be called epic. \\n",

            "content": "!Be warned. May possibly contain spoilers. Read at your own discretion!\r\nFirst, the concept of this anime is similar to that of Log Horizon and Sword Art Online (Arc 1). A player/players gets trapped in a video game. Sure, that's true. But it doesn't stop an anime from being good in its own right.\r\nPeople can say \"Copy Pasta. Copy Pasta. This anime is so copying off of Sword Art Online.\" But, I consider that to be controversial. Why? Take One Punch Man or Dragon Ball Z for example. Their main characters are broken. Overpowered. Unfair. Whatever you would like to call them, but then why arethey so well-liked by many and they don't consider those two to be copying off each other with overpowered main characters? A lot of concepts are used repeatedly. Whether you hate that or not is up to you, but people don't realize it that concepts are re-used a lot. I am a fan of One Punch Man. But that doesn't mean I going to hail it. I prefer taking an anime and pointing out it's rights and wrongs (of course based on my own opinion however). \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nOverlord, flat out, has basically no plot - at least for the anime as I have not started reading the manga. It was literally taking an OP dude and placing him in a story to act all bad-ass. However, this doesn't mean Overlord is a bad or good anime. This is for the watcher to decide. There are people who like overpowered characters and there are those who do not. \\n\\n\r\nAside from Overlord's (non-existent) plot, the art is good, but nowhere near the top of the season. For the anime's music, it was extremely catchy for me. especially the ending (L.L.L by Myth&Roid).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design was very weak to say in the least. Momonga. Overpowered skeleton. Albedo. Extremely sexual women who desires the love of the main character. But that's not bad. I'm sure you can name quite a few anime with characters similar to these two, and you might have enjoyed those anime too.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment? From episode one, I understood this anime will have piratically no story line. I embraced that fact and continued to the next few episodes. I told myself, \"Even if Overlord has no plot, if I like it, I will continue watching. However, if I find myself disliking, I will stop immediately.\" As I always to myself, \"If I don't like it, why bother continuing and finishing it?\" I consider it controversial of myself if I finish an anime if I knew I didn't like it from the get-go. Despite the lack of story, I found myself watching due to the plot (and personally, I like overpowered characters. I find them to be amusing.)\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to others who would be fine with Overlord having the same main concept of Sword Art Online and Log Horizion (being trapped in a game, that is). However, unlike those two, you need to be able to accept the (non-existent) plot and indulge yourself in the other aspects of the anime. Overlord is also rated as R - 17+ (violence & profanity). If you are not comfortable with blood and mild gore, refrain yourself from watching Overlord.\\n\\n\r\n!Warning!: Everything is of my own opinion. You are entilted to you own opinion and are free to disagree or agree with my review.",

The art-style was pretty interesting, the \"trapped on a game\" idea isn't new BUT the plot itself was pretty damn cool and I can't recall any other anime doing it (If you do, please name it in the comments). Another good thing I have to say It's that Overlord's opening is my favourite opening from this season(That engrish tho). Now let's go to the negative aspects... Most of the characters barely had screen time so we couldn't get to know everyone well and some eps just felt empy... like, they weren't all that necesary, they could've just put more time into making the main plot. At any rate, this was a really good anime, I really recommend it to everybody.",

            "content": "Story & Character:\r\nOverlord is a self-insert power fantasy done right. Although the plot may be completely predictable and even bland at times, its diverse and interesting cast is what makes it shine. Overlord is the show Sword Art Online wanted to be but spectacularly failed to be. \r\nConsider this: while SAO features a jerkoff protagonist with the personality of a hot turd surrounded by a pack of flies i.e a harem of virtual girls who inexplicably want to suck his dick, Overlord features a dude who loves to role play as an undead skeleton overlord but is actually insecure inside and easily succumbs to thepressure of having to meet the expectations of his minions who, incidentally, also want to suck his dick because they were literally programmed to suck his dick. \\n\\n\r\nYou see the difference?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters make and break this show, and it certainly is not boring in this regard. The Tomb of Nazarick is a colorful place with extensive history and lore, and seeing its inhabitants interact with the world around them is not only satisfying but intriguing. It's dark, it's edgy, and its characters are anti-heroic at best and cartoonishly villainous at worst. It's Overlord, and it's fun to watch. It's not exactly Shakespeare, nor is it a gritty fantasy psychological thriller like Re:Zero. It has the bare world-building and writing needed to immerse you into the story, but the thing that will have you staying is once again, its cast of crazy characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhile Madhouse worked their usual magic for the first few episodes, the animation quality really dropped off towards the end. Other than that, everything from the color palette to the character designs are fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOverlord's soundtrack is quite decent - good even. The OP and EDs are fairly catchy and will quickly grow on you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\n9/10 \\n\r\nI'll be honest, watching Overlord is pure guilty pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8/10 \\n",

            "content": "I should start out by saying I don't think Overlord is horrible.  There have been many series I have given up either because I found them to be utter garbage or boring and going nowhere.  The fact that I watched this show through to its conclusion means it was at least watchable.\r\nWith that said, the entire time I watched this show, I could not help but get the idea out of my head that was I reading a fan fiction that some guy wrote about how awesome everything would be if his fantasy MMO character was stuck in a real world based onthose same rules.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I could post [SPOILERS AHEAD!!!] but to be honest, if you've watched only the first episode of the series, by the time you get through the opening theme in Episode 2 it has basically told you the plot and any twists of the entire show.  There is nothing overall deep or thought provoking done by the show that you can't surmise from watching the OP a few times, including guessing all the plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is about a Japanese store clerk who played an MMO (with deep dive virtual reality technology very similar to SAO) that his guild has largely abandoned. The server is going down in a few hours and he decides to see it off to the very end before heading to work the next day.  A countdown clock ticks down to midnight and instead of being logged off, he finds himself trapped in his avatar's body, to a land similar to the online game, tended to by an army of NPC's come-to-life, most of whom were programmed by former guild members.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the NPC's in his care revere him and praise him.  We establish the idea very early that he is extremely powerful and rich with in-game currency.  And that's where the first problem with Overlord becomes exposed  Other than Ains (as he has his minions call him), none of the other primary/secondary characters have any development at all.  They are all overpowered and absurdly devoted to him.  Most of their conversations consist of either praising Ains or talking amongst each other about who is the most obsequiously devoted to him.  \\n\\n\r\nBeyond this, there is no real drama. We find out very quickly that Ains and his followers are light years beyond the power of anyone else in this universe and so a fair bit of his caution, while understandable, also leads to both ridiculous round about plans and no tension.  This latter point is because at no point in this entire show is there any question about whether any of the main cast will be hurt or die. In the second third, he confronts two villains from a neighboring country who are well established to be stronger than most but they are still ants to our hero.  At no point do we ever think the old man necromancer (whose name escapes me) or Clementine or a legitimate threat despite all being much stronger than any regular human in this series's universe. \\n\\n\r\nAs stated earlier, not much really happens in Overlord.  Our protagonist's grand plan is this convoluted strategy of posing as a dark knight (because he feels the overwhelming need to understand the melee mechanics of this world) and get his name under this pseudonym spread across the land so that somehow then his actual real persona as the overlord lich king can be known across the land.  If none of that makes sense that's the point.\\n\\n\r\nAins slaughters an entire mercenary army and briefly touches upon how taking the lives of others doesn't seem to bother him, as his personality is being taken over by his character.  That would have been a fascinating issue to grapple with, similar to Grimgar of Fantasy & Ash.  Perhaps the character could have afterwards great misgivings about what he did or a true moral crisis about weather the morality of our own society can or should be applicable in this fantasy world.  In the beginning, he asks one of his buxom female servants if he can grope her chest, ostensibly to test the mechanics of the world and while this servers as little more than fan service, this might have also been an interesting an refreshing route to go in exploring the ideas of if a relationship could exist in such conditions, especially considering her devotion was a result of a last minute programming change made before the MMO was supposed to shut down.  Or heck, they could have gone a more hentai route and even that would have been more interesting than where this show went.\\n\\n\r\nI confess I enjoy the \"trapped in another MMO\" trope.  I was a fan of the first season of Sword Art Online - albeit the first half more than the second that featured a damsel in distress Asuna as well as Log Horizon.  If we're willing to extend that genre to being in a fantasy world, Re: Zero and Konosuba were two of my favorite shows of last year. I had heard decent things about Overlord so I thought I should give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's where I get to the title of my post. Throughout it, I kept thinking, as someone who played an MMO at one time (RIP City of Heroes) that I could have written something on par with this when I was in high school.  The thought of Eric Cartman, from South Park, being just a little older and in the same circumstance kept coming to me.  Realistically an animated version of Clyde Frog or Polly Prissypants would have just been as believable in this show and would have fit in telling the character how awesome he was. \\n\\n\r\nI'd have to call this series a skip, at least for now.  A second season somehow got green lit, which shows what I know about anime, and so I may check it out to see if perhaps the snails pace of a story changes or if anything interesting happens (perhaps anything that is a legitimate threat to Ains), but for now this thirteen episodes if a solid \"meh\" for me.",

            "content": "! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! !\r\nOverlord is a dark-ish copy of Log Horizon. Its similar in so many ways that its pointless to outright list everything. If you watched both, you would simply know. To be fair, I did say its dark-ish and it is. Extra details to blood & gore, killing of characters just to paint the picture of how undead and dark the MC is and last, a good example of human cruelty. Not a lot, but enough. Its slap happy type of anime so its brutal elements aren't more than one combat scene.\r\nIts background story is of the \"not-so-well-explained-maybe-later-but-probably-never\" kind thatthe above mentioned anime also suffers from in my view. It focuses primarily on the role of the MC as the Overlord of his very own dungeon and his adventures and quickly dusts off the \"reasons\" and all of the \"why\" and \"how\" this happened. \\n\\n\r\nSince Overlord's story isn't the driving factor, its the art, sound, combat and psychological / tactical elements like in that other anime I mentioned. The Overlord is OP in many ways and while he finds some sort of \"equal rivalry\" at the end, he is still portrayed as the one above all.\\n\\n\r\nThe final battle resembles like a world of warcraft arena 1v1. Make them spend their spells before you do yours. Very fun, especially if you like that sort of PvP.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I find this good enjoyment to watch. Even though it has little romance or ecchi, it uses both in very tactical way, just enough to lure you in and keep you through-out the season. A job well done I'd say.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime to anyone that wants some mmo-like anime.",

            "content": "Overlord is a anime that breaks established standards of isekai anime in any ways. First of all, the main character Momonga is placed as a villain of the plot. Not that he is actually evil, but his character in this world is evil, so he has to adapt to act as such. Also, the character itself starts to change the persona of the player, and that symbiotic relation is very interesting. For exemple, he wants to do good things, but because he is evil, he can't do it exactly well behaved, but instead has to find evil and egoistic purposes to substantiate his actions. Thebackground of the main character is also very unique. Left alone by his old companions that have abandoned the game, solitude and loneliness are recurring themes throughout the work. Those emotions are the main fuel to the development of the plot, as he yearns to find his old friends, even if there is little to no chance to actually finding them. For this goal, he tries to make the name of their old guild (Ainz Ooal Gown) know all over the world. The execution of this plan involves drawing a lot of attention in either a good or bad way. This of course ought to bring challenges for the protagonist. those challenges are the main substance of this first season, as he struggles to make his name known. Considering how overpowered the protagonist is compared to all know characters of this new world he goes, we as viewers expect very epic battles, probably involving whole nations against the protagonist, but for this first arc of the anime, it's necessary to make the viewer know more about the world building and the side characters, to create more empathy for the cast. It's like a foundation of a building that doesn't draw attention of people, but is necessary for what comes after, the building itself. But this foundation arc is not uninteresting at all, and the interaction between the protagonist and the side characters dwelling in his fortress Nazarick is the main reason for that, as it is  a element that makes this anime very original. These characters were originally npcs created by Momonga and his companions players. Now that they are actual thinking beings, they treat Momonga as a godly kind. for them, he is a superior being, as the original creator gods, and the last one of its kind, as the other players, members of this pantheon, have disbanded. That makes all those characters to live in a semi-gnostic situation, as they can't say \"god has abandoned us\" but they can say \"every god has abandoned us, except for one, that may like the others come to abandon us\", with is a terrible edge to live on. Even if there is a lot of comedy situations throughout the anime, the themes of solitude and gnosticism gives to it a dark atmosphere that helps the viewer to immerse in the plot. That being said, the categories are:\\n\r\nStory: The story to this point (end of season I) involves little arcs of side quests needed to create the initial development of the plot. Those little arcs are well done, and brings to the viewer a good realism in which in life we can not go for our main goal during every second of our life, but instead many times we have to drift a little from the main course to solve other things, and than go back to the main course. All these experiences in apparently secondary challenges are important elements to arrive to your goals. Overlord teach us that. So i give it a 8, because it is well done, but the viewer can't yet catch a glimpse of the final goal.\\n\r\nArt: I miss so much the old times of studio Madhouse. They were really good. Even the use of CGI is kinda good, even though I hate it. 99% percent of anime CGI looks like it's rendered at 5fps, but in this anime it looks like 15fps. Not perfect, but great. If it wasn't for this, I would give it a 9. But a 8 it is. \\n\r\nSound: The sound track helps a lot in creating this dark theme around Overlord, without making it to melancholic, as it is a comedy too. The team has found a good balance of seriousness and lightness. But it's not like I would have this soundtrack to hear in my cellphone, as it is not that memorable. So I give it a 8\\n\r\nCharacter: for everything I said before, like how the interactions between the creator and it's creatures are a main element of the series, I give it a 9. It's not a 10 because I can't see a full personality in the characters but only cutouts. But good cutouts.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As it can be read above, this series has everything to make the viewer very amused. So it is a 9\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 8 because I considere a 8 every anime that I highly recommend to anyone I know that has some experience in the anime universe. It may not be interesting for some one that has not ever watched a anime, but the beauty of this anime is how it contrasts in relation to other animes, mainly in the isekai genre. It is guaranteed a unique experience that brings a more mature and deeper view of being in a isekai world.",

            "content": "Overlord was the first anime to start my MMO anime binge. I must admit, it took my by surprise; mainly because it exceeded my expectations and actually did something different to your typical 'stuck in a game' anime.\r\nThere aren't many smart quips that I can make about this anime, It doesn't take itself seriously but you get that odd sense of sincerity none the less. Despite this, its still incredibly enjoyable and taps into that core desire that we all get whenever we play an MMO: to be influential and OP.\r\nIn my recent review of Log Horizon, I mentioned something I like to call theInconsistent Triad of MMO Anime (ITMA). ITMA (triad implying 3 parts) consists of drama, personality and reality. Only 2 of these things can exist at once and trying to include all three will result in Sword Art Online. Overlord takes advantage of personality and reality. True, he isn't trying to find a way home but, despite being trapped, he still plays the game (that's what I'd do) and while the characters aren't necessarily real either, they are all unique and colorful and that really allows this anime to shine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\r\nThe story isn't about getting home or living life. Its not about community or establishing relationships. This anime is all about being in a new world and reestablishing the anti-hero reputation that was lost after the server trap. Our protagonist is already OP, already on top of the world and already knows everything about the game he is in. However, nobody knows him and that's basically the big problem that's covered by this story and it results in the need for one big display of power after another. \\n\\n\r\nOur anti-hero is the only human player in his adventure, although his guild was formed by many people and he is accompanied by the many NPC'S turned AI that were made by his former guild mates; so its not like his only friend is the audience; although he does communicate his logic through thought quite a lot and in a more human, less antagonizing voice - which I found quite amusing.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this anime doesn't take advantage of any MMO mechanics like Log Horizon does (which is always a plus) and could just as easily have been a fantasy anime bar a few minor tweaks.\\n\\n\r\nAs well as this, Overlord doesn't really have that much direction. Although the displays of power are bad ass, not much progress is made besides a few battles and a shiny sticker at the end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\r\nI don't know why but I f*cking love the intro. Its not even my style when it comes to music but damn its so appropriate and I love it. Just thought I'd share.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound are as good as the story makes it. Although its not a masterpiece, it does a good job of expressing the many atmospheres that are dotted throughout each episode (eg. Comedy, Action). I would say that its suits the anime and definitely gives an anti-hero vibe when in the presence of our protagonist.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nThe characters are all very unique. They have comedic appeal and can be very intimidating when they want to be. The fact that we are talking about a dark guild means that all the AI behave like villains, which I love because having an antagonistic personality means you are able to express personality in so many different ways than if you were a boring old hero. As there are so many AI, I won't go into detail about them, just know that they're all likable and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nSpecifically, Momonga, or whatever the f*ck he wants to be called, is a funny, likable and interesting character who's only flaw is that he seems to be good at everything. Apart from women (But hey he's a guild-master in an MMO, what do you expect). His attitude and confidence make the events of the anime that extra bit more satisfying and I don't think I would have him any other way.\\n\\n\r\nAlso as a quick note, Chris Guerrero does a f*cking phenomenal job in the dub as Momonga and I don't often praise VA's in my review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nAt first I felt like this anime was a guilty pleasure of mine. Now that I look back on it, there is some genuine merit behind my enjoyment. Episode wise its short and sweet and I honestly hope that other directors who seek to make an MMO anime follow this ones example.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\r\nOf all the MMO anime out there, this one is by far the most worth your time. I didn't think it was possible but I actually want more from a genre that is already sooo over-saturated. \\n\\n\r\nAs it stands, I'm going to look for the novels on the book store and listen to that intro again because I really want to continue with this story. However this ever gets a second season that would make me really happy. That's not to say its perfect, I think there are still a few chinks to iron out but hey, that's why its a 9 not a 10... just barely.",

So I watched it in a marathon and I regret it.\r\nI don't know man, I don't even understand the character, let's begin with the MC (Momonga). Just... What kind of character he is?\r\nHe is not a good guy (murdered people without any hesitation)\r\nHe is not a bad guy (still helps people, even though he says he did it for his own ego, but I don't feel it's like that)\r\nHe is not an anti-hero (he still cared for his slaveswhich are NPCs)\\n\\n\r\nI think the Momonga character is weak in term of personality. Not to mention that he acted up as a leader and sighing after he finished. That's a total turn down.\\n\\n\r\nThe most frustrating of them all is the fact that some characters knew that Momonga and friends come from another world. Hell, even they know the name of the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is truly slow-paced. After 13 episodes, there is still no clues of Momonga searched people.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing of this anime is the ED.",

He played the bad guy that everybody deserves. He's cruel in his methods, but there's still a sense of humanity within him, even though he played it off as merely being a coincidence with his plan. He's overpowered as he is able to crushhis foes with a single grasp, but he's also smart as he is able to turn the tables while fighting an enemy with similar caliber. Pairing him with Albedo, there's just no way of telling what they're both capable of! \\n\\n\r\nMomonga is simply captivating, and you can't help but follow his journey. Perhaps he might choose to conquer the world or enslave mankind or finding a way out of this virtual world. No matter what it is, i would still be cheering him on, because i know it's going to be interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that's a bit of an eye-sore is the use of CGI during the fighting scenes, especially the dragon.

I've read the manga too an the story is about the same, of corse there are some differences but thats normal.\r\nArt & Animation 9/10\r\nThe characters were well designed and the animation was flawless. Theres just one slight thing that bothered me while watching the show and that was the animation of the mass/ none-essential characters (see the graveyard incident). Ithink they looked a bit stiff and not well done but that could be the fact that the animators hadn't the time to put so much efford into the animation of the mass.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall it looked pretty amazing and the characters were nearly identical to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI've watched the show in english, japanese and german.\\n\\n\r\nThe japanese was bretty good and i can't complain about anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe english dubbing was also pretty amazing, but i dont get it why Momonga/ Ainz ooal gown has 2 different voices, the mental and the acoustic voise were comletly different.

Some lines were comletly left out and some jokes were porely translated and therefore werry unenjoyable. i managed to find at least 2 mistakes in the dubbing. first mistake was when Ainz ooal gown sait to albedo that the floorguardians should assemble exept for the guardians ofthe 4th and 9th floor (in the english dub its the 4th and 8th floor) and when he was as Momon deguised on his way to Carne village and Lukrut asked Nabe if she were Momos lover because they seemd to be werry close, in the english dub Nabe mentiones Albedo beeing the only one however that is not the case in ther german dub.\\n\\n\r\nBut becide the fact that in my opinion the german dub was a disaster i gave it a 9/10 because of the good english dub (exept for the thing with the two voices) and the good japanese version.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were awesome. They were werry detailed and animated.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that suprized me was the true form of Shalltear, witch was a bit creepy.\\n\\n\r\nSadly we couldn't see the floorguardian Victim (the floorguardian of the 8th floor, appears in season two) and Gargantua ( The floorguardian of the 4th floor, appears alos in the 2. season. Howewer hes not a crated NPC but a bonus won by Ainz).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show had a good plot, a lot of humor and werry interestin characters\\n\\n\r\ntheres not much to sy about it. Its just awesome!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy it a lot, even after the 7th time watching it i could still laugh about the show. In my opinion it's woth watching.",

            "content": "Let me confess one thing: I actually watched and finished Sword Art Online, except that you can't find it anywhere my list. Meanwhile, you can find titles like Date-A Live and Infinite Stratos, and even hackneyed things like Himouto Umaru-chan and Glasslip. Now why is that?\r\nThe answer is simple: I expected Date-A and IS to be harem-y and I know what I was gonna get and that's what I got (both exceeded my low-bar expectations anyway as I learned to acknowledge them both). Himouto and Glasslip, I expected them to be, well, hackneyed. \r\nBut when I watched SAO, I expected it to be RPG-fantasy-brilliant. It'sthe kind of expectation where let's say, I expect that the Ford Mustang to have a growling V8---but now that they also put an inline-4 engine under its hood as part of their \"EcoBoost\" lineup, it turned disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nSorry SAO-fans, but after knowing and playing Final Fantasy and the TRUE RPG games of PS1 such as LegendofMana, L.o.Legaia, Lo.Dragoon, Grandia, Alundra and those kinda, SAO has to live up to that, which it didn't. Instead, SAO was flaunting more of Kirito's moods and his inevitable harem and Asuna's armpits. That's what I mean about disappointment, and that's what SAO went for me, it simply lacked the RPG quality and poked the harem genre in it, thus I don't want it on my list.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, here's OVERLORD, which I could say according to my metaphor, is the Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 with that overpowering 5.2L V8, fit for an overlord alright.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 8\\n\r\nStraight away, this is quite the problem though. How the storyline was created kinda is, I admit, lacking in complexity...or should we wait for season 2? The RPG essence is there, make no mistake, but as to the messing up the fantasy world with a whole lot of thundagas and blizzagas, chaos and madness, it was all brief. But what I happily regard this is 8 is once you've watched this and you know what RPG stands for, you're entirely familiar with the magic spells and \"gameplay\", and this wins the hearts of true-RPG fans like me. We know, we simply know how emotions go to venture in a world that feels like Fa'Diel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART = 10\\n\r\nObviously.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 10\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending songs are simply rockatronic, just like how Japan used to make RPG BGMs with electric guitar riffs and adlibs, and not the keyboard-bound chimes nowadays.\\n\r\nSeiyuu-wise, I only know that Shalltear is voiced by Dekomori--I instantly recognized her voice and Sumire Uesaka's charm resonated, that's it---I didn't bother knowing more seiyuus knowing Dekomori's around.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERIZATION = 6\\n\r\nThis is perhaps the strong point but it's what I do expect if the main character, Momonga, is mighty. He has his mindset for conquering his newfound world. He has his \"press R1\" backup of non-playable characters aka. Guardians. He decides his party depending per quest, per episode bluntly stated, and the adventure begins as nonchalantly as racing the Mustang against a Prius. You know it's \"too much powerful\", you know it won't lose.\\n\r\nThis turned out because the story began when Lord Momonga was already on level 99, of course, with the premise stated with concise and short flashbacks that he did start as weak, or was on low-level then way back. \\n\r\nI have my qualms about \"too much powerful\" characters because they're only a wrong execution away from being a garystu/marystu, but because of the RPG-feels, I can't be bothered by it, subjectively. \\n\r\nObjectively though, is the reason I gave it a 6 because whenever I review here in MAL, I always separate my mental from my emotional takes. But as its plot made overpowerful characters forgivable, then they're nowhere near the realm of garystu/marystu because the plot and elements already evaded just that, and didn't pay the price.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 8\\n\r\nHonestly I did enjoy it, thanks to the RPG feels. :) Some dragging events pulled down a -2, but that can be overlooked.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 7\\n\r\nAgain, I metaphorically compared Overlord to the Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 V8, now why a 7? \\n\r\nThe thing is, it's got to do with my [car] preference. Take a look at this very Mustang: it's overly Shelby-powerful and you know what that means: a 5.2L V8 526HP spitting monster, it's all about speed and acceleration; and thanks to that, it has no backseats, no air-condition. The luxuries are sacrificed for the sake of saving weight. Sorry Mustang fans, speed is not everything for me as buying those cars means indulging; and that goes to other weight-saving supercars like the Ferrari 458 Speciale and the McLaren P1, I ain't a fan of those, too.\\n\r\nThat's particularly how I viewed Overlord for the metaphorical car-anime comparison. In RPG-terms. Overlord is grand, the plot is well-made, the characters are well-thought, but somehow having too-powerful characters made the story a bit dull (only One Punch Man succeeded pulling out of this). It's like playing RPGs with cheats of all-items-unlocked and max-level sorts. You know you're going to win, hence you know it's going to be boring unless you're a child.\\n\\n\r\nI expected Overlord to be RPG and it delivered my expectations just fine, it made me feel the feels back on PS1 RPG days, but the overpowering trait is also an expectation I know I'm not preferring to. And thus, it turned out to be 7 overall.\\n\r\nBut that's on me, I, who greatly respects the TRUE RPGs of PS1. My probably biased-perspective emitted out from those.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: Rest assured, if you're one who is playing PS2 and PS3 RPG games, or someone who haven't been introduced to RPG, or someone who is looking for a not necessarily 10 but still is a well-made anime, Overlord is your ticket.\\n\r\nIf you're on the otherwise, then consider looking at SAO's Asuna's armpits.",

            "content": "Overlord is a very complicated show to talk about because, on the face of it, it is one of the best anime series release we've had in years... the plot is a twist on the modern cliche of \"Guy in MMORPG world\", placing the main character effectively as one of the villains with an army of minions already set-up. The plot is actually very well thought-out and some of the action scenes, though simplistic, are absolutely fantastic.\r\nAnd yet it is one of the most deeply flawed anime I have ever seen... due to something that is rarely taken into consideration when reviewing/viewing an anime series;The direction. This anime has, quite possibly the worst director I have ever seen. Some scenes drag way too long, other scenes are cut absurdly short depriving the viewer for crucial information (Repeat viewings reveal this to be quite egregious). The pacing of the story is very poor, there are several episodes where barely anything happens at all, and others where the story is so drastically rushed that they set up an entire major story arc and many subplots in a single episode , making for a disjointed, incoherent mess (Ex: Episode 10 and 11 are a perfect example of what I am talking about).\\n\\n\r\nI know this is a strange complaint to make, but directing is one of those things that you only really notice if it went horribly wrong and in this case, it went horribly wrong. It has some fabulous scenes and sequences that are perfectly paced and executed, but these are very rare and sandwiched in between a lot of awful choices. For example, there is a scene somewhat early on where there is a huge setup for a massacre against some mages... but when the time comes for the actual massacre to occur, it just smash cuts to them walking back to base. What actually happened? who knows.\\n\\n\r\nConversely, some great examples are the end scene fade-out during a major fight towards the end of the series (You'll know it when you see it) and a slow moving murder that is absolutely beautiful. These are rare but precisely because of their rarity, they stand out a great deal.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo let's move on to a more traditional reviewing style now that the major flaw is done;\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThe characterization is very poor. There is very little character development for any of people we follow with the sole exception of the eponymous Overlord. Ironically, there are tertiary characters that get more development than most of the primary cast (Narberal Gamma, Nphirea Balear and Demiurge) which should tell you right there how little we get to know any of the main characters/how flat they are.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, there is a wealth of substance here with all of these characters ... but because of the poor directing, very little comes across. A lot of pivotal characters are portrayed as one-note and dull (Ex: Albedo, Cocytus, Aura/Mare, Shalltear Bloodfallen, etc.). But as I keep saying, there is a lot here, but it was just poorly executed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nThe story is executed very haphazardly, the reason for this is that it is adapting the story arcs from the Overlord novel, jumping from one to the other with very little setup and often times with very little pay off.\\n\\n\r\nA young man with a fairly bad life is somehow trapped in a game world. The entire plot revolves around him exploring the game world very cautiously looking for other humans rather than the NPCs he is surrounded by. There is not much in the way of a unifying thread , but that's fine... the whole season is basically world-building, setting up location, characters and establishing strengths, this is very good... the problem is, a lot of these things are done poorly. I'd hate to sound repetitive, but the bad direction makes it difficult to get a good grasp on where each location is and what the internal politics of the region are.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, there is no story, it is just world-building... but it is a very clear setup for a greater story to come. If there is a season 2, it will use the established story base to launch into a potentially epic storyline, we will see.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThere is a lot to be said for a main character that is depicted as actually being intelligent. It is so rare that when you see this series, you might not even catch how careful and calculated all of his actions are. Add to that the , frankly, irresponsible levels of fanservice-y scenes and you have a great combination. I would say I loved everything about this series except for most of the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe variety in characters, the surprisingly clever dialogues and actions made it a treat to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe terrible direction absolutely buries a fantastic show. The voice actors are clearing giving it their all, the animation while not good, is at least helped by wonderful art. The story and its twists are quite original and the general tone of the show shifts quickly but is pulled off masterfully (The one thing the director got right). \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of the current cliche  \"Guy trapped in video game world\", this is for you.\\n\r\nIf you want to see a main character actually make subtle, but very intelligent actions, this is for you.\\n\r\nIf you like non-sexual video game fanservice, this is for you.\\n\r\nIf you want a complex , overarching epic story, this is NOT for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThough this is now one of my favorite animes, I cannot deny that it is deeply flawed... if it has a season 2, it will probably be legendary, but as it stands, the first season suffers from too many issues for me to give a broad recommendation.",

            "content": "I wish to explain my rating of this show before I go on to a short review; Overlord is the sum of its parts. No aspect of it goes beyond what I would rate 7/10, as budget limitations, a sort of wish-fulfillment nonsense aspect of the story (I'm looking at you, Albedo) and sometimes drawn-out scenes will have its clear effect on the product. However! As none of these aspects are especially weak, together they carry Overlord to greater heights!\r\nI am going to break this show down to show you what I mean.\r\nStory 8/10:\r\nSort of standard isekai plot here - young guy in a fantasygame ends up in a fantasy world with his overpowered abilities and seemingly endless stash of super-items and in this case even a whole set of powerful servants, two of which are attractive females who are enamored with him.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a twist which does make a huge difference here - he's evil. Or rather, he's supposed to be, as an Undead wizard that quickly loses a lot of his human compassion (though hints of his humanity remaining seem to be there) and take steps to spread his name. He's saved as a protagonist by being more evil in his logic than his actions though, as it seems he will rationalize good deeds by stating their long-term gain to perplexed (evil) servants.\\n\\n\r\nI believe there is a comment being made about how one is shaped by one's surroundings and also how truly intelligent people will be benevolent, only greedy to a point and quick to protect others - as long term gain comes out of social harmony and not 'law of the jungle'-stuff that produces resentment and vengeance. A thoughtful subtlety, not overly obvious, is a plus in my book.\\n\\n\r\nThe story gets pretty dark at times without shying away from tragedy, despite the wish fulfillment-aspect of Overlord, which I believe deserves another nod of respect.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10:\\n\r\nBudget-restrictions are clearly in place here, but they really did a good job with what they did use. There is some 3D in here that looks better than in much newer shows and the interaction between 2D parts and 3D is actually pretty solid (remember the bone dragons and the fight in the graveyard?). Sometimes there will be clear shortcuts but overall it feels pretty balanced. Consistently decent animation blended with a good mix of dark and bright colors depending on the time of day and environment would, to me, indicate a knowledge in how to use a budget.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\r\nI am honestly not a sound guy, so I'm mostly going by gut feeling here. I felt like most sounds did what they needed to do, at one point there was a lack of music, giving an eerie vibe which I felt did justice to the moment. There is a metal element to the show's intro and outro songs which feels pretty cool, calling to the fore the mutual history of metal and fantasy. The voice actors do a good job and knows how to express a lot with small fluctuations in volume and tone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we have a main character that loses his humanity and becomes a pretty cold creature. You still root for and sympathize with him as he is obviously not as 'evil' as one would think, considering his ghoulish appearance. His journey of self-discovery only starts in season 1 but not having seen the sequel seasons, I find it promising. His cadre are mostly pretty simplistic characters, but I'm sure they will get further development as is usually the case in these types of multi-character stories. The side characters outside of his group are surprisingly well-structured. You get to see minor characters return seemingly out of nowhere but with good and consistent reasons. I find that exhilarating, having seen a lot of crap that will introduce characters for throwaway lines before they enter the Garden of Could Have Been.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nNeeding to immediately start the next episode, being excited despite knowing who is going to win the fight four times out of five and hoping minor characters are going to be saved but having those hopes dashed... it really works. I enjoy things are somewhat unpredictable and well-executed. Smart dialogue isn't bad. And Overlord is the cake to both keep and eat in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:\\n\r\nI believe Overlord deserves such a strong grade mostly because of how much I enjoy it. It is definitely biased, but a qualitative line of reasoning as well - if you can submit to some harmless and dumb fan service (I can stand rolling my eyes a couple of times without having to hammer out my anger on Twitter, unlike a few peeps) then there is a plethora of powerful scenes, cool action and interesting strategical maneuvering in Overlord for the fantasy/politic-persuasion of anime viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAlso those ridiculous names make me laugh out loud.\\n\\n\r\nAins Ooal Gown.",

I also think the show is pacing way too slow for my taste, they have to dominate the world but they've only seen one city and one town by the end of the season. I know they want to do more seasons but its still too slow. But I'm hopeful with this shows popularity that future seasons have a bigger budget andjust take out the insane amount of CG. I also hope that there will be more world building in the upcoming seasons. All that said, I'm down to watch some more.",

            "content": "Going into this season I didn't really know what to expect but at the same time I was kinda excited. Prior to this there was only one anime I've watched that was about gaming, and that was the popular SAO. SAO was a series that I found to be very overrated and while it didn't suck it ruined its concept that I initially thought was great. Like many I'm a person who enjoys video games and watching anime that take place in one is an idea that I hope can work well. Overlord is a title that I've been hearing recently so I wanted togive it a try. I was excited for this series for two main reasons; 1)it's a seinen meaning it's mature and dark and I like anime with darkness, 2) and it's done by the legendary Studio Madhouse. There are so many well done anime I've heavily enjoyed that were done by this studio examples being Death Note, Monster, Hellsing Ultimate, HxH, and One-Punch Man. So that being said does this season give Overlord a hot intro into the video game genre ??***contains MINOR spoilers***\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:7/10\\n\r\nA generic plot with a cool and interesting twist. The story starts off like SAO where the mc gets trapped within the game and he either has to return to his real world or discover how it happened. However watching this from a villain perspective is where we get something new and refreshing. Lord Ainz the protagonist is what drives the plot here, most of the story's reliance is on his characterization and getting used to his new world. That being said the anime's setting is so awesome and it really gives you that video game vibe. World building overall is very good as it discovers other villages and areas and how it feeds off its characters. But better yet there's more room for exploration and due to its cool environments it leaves the viewer to wanna learn more of it. There's also a nice balance of action, comedy, and fan service. As anime fans we know that fan service can be used so heavily to the point of insanity but here it's used very well and it's not too distracting or excessive. What let me down here was the pacing, at times the story could really drag. For example whenever the plot shift away from Ainz it actually becomes pretty boring. In terms of story and plot progression it honestly did very little as like I said earlier it's main focus was Lord Ainz trying to fit in his new world. The season's conclusion also kinda ended on a weak note but knowing the series is far from over if gives its story plenty of chances later on.   \\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nWhat's strange here is that while the animation in general was good, it still felt underwhelming. I'm so used to Madhouse giving us near perfect animation but in this series I couldn't say the same. There was a lot more CGI here than I anticipated and while it didn't look bad it wasn't fantastic looking either. Now don't get me wrong I understand that 2015 was a busy year for the studio so it probably meant that they weren't able to give this series their all. Where the animation really stood out tho was during its action where the magic spells are casted. I was also extremely impressed with how well they exaggerated facial expression to the characters particularly in episode 9. The magic spell effects were fantastic  and it really gave me this great video game vibe whenever there was an action sequence. The art however was even better with many awesome looking character designs. The multiple outfits Lord Ainz wore looked so cool and there was never a time he didn't look badass. A bunch of the side characters were given great detail although since some are cross dressers it was hard to tell their gender. The series visually is brilliantly filled with bright colors and in game scenery that left much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nI was once again impressed and satisfied in this area like I usually am with Madhouse. I absolutely adore the opening and ending themes here. The opening song \"Clattanoia\" was very catchy and with good lyrics that described the show's world well. My favorite however was the ending song \"L.L.L.\" it was mad epic and awesome to the point where it's been stuck in my head for a while recently. The background tracks were great as well as it had dark undertones that set the moods very well at times. Like most Madhouse projects there's a lot of rock music here and although Im not a huge rock fan I've always like OSTs the studio brought to their anime. My main problem with the music however is that it had a bad habit of drowning some of the dialogue and it did ruin some moments but not a whole lot. The sound effects were also solid something Im used to studio Madhouse excelling at. Both Japanese and English dubs did good here as well. Satoshi Hino and Chris Guerrero did great as Lord Ainz respectively with Hino's lighter tone nailing Ainz's comedy and Guerrero's gruffer voice fitting the badassery more. To answer which dub is better I'll give the edge to the Japanese but in the end it's really up to personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8/10\\n\r\nAn enjoyable cast with high potential and a dominate lead. The main protagonist Ainz Ooal Gown is easily the standout here as he's given a lot of focus. What makes him so interesting is how he battles his inside and outside personalities. On the outside he's this badass OP overlord with a dark commanding presence but on the inside he's a mere human who for a specific reason is scared to make allies. His character gives us a fun, cool, yet likable character that's almost impossible to get bored of. He also has great interaction scenes with other characters like the loyal yandere beauty Albedo who makes him uncomfortable and this leads to humorous scenes. The supporting characters have a lot of different personalities which adds variety to the cast. However what most of them have in common is their strict loyalty to Ainz which is so great to watch. It's also cool asf to see some of them are capable of kicking ass in battle like Nabe who's one of my favorites. And while most of them weren't given tons of development they are all complex enough to make you want to learn more about them in the future. I was hoping the villains/antagonists were a bit better tho. They weren't given enough insight to me and most of them came across as rather bland. For example there's this hot female named Clementine and she was portrayed as a sadist but outside of that she was nothing else. This is something I hope the series would improve in future seasons.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\\n\r\n+Story uses a more interesting and new take on a overused genre that make it different\\n\r\n+An awesome main lead that cool, likable, and downright joy to watch at all times\\n\r\n+Some great looking action that feature brutality that emphasizes the series' maturity   \\n\r\n+Side characters are very fun and have rooms of potential\\n\r\n+While mature and dark, the series can at times be funny and good use of fan service\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\\n\r\n-Pacing can be off, does little in terms of story progression\\n\r\n-Animation is a bit disappointing with a lil too much CGI effects\\n\r\n-Some bland villains that weren't given a lot of depth\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Favorites\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Ainz, Albedo, and Nabe\\n\\n\r\nArc: The Dark Warrior\\n\\n\r\nFight: Ainz vs Clementine\\n\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1 of Overlord gets off to a solid start. It has a very fun cast that's room for improvement and a great lead that's badass, op, yet likable, and relatable at the same time. It also has an epic soundtracks with great character designs and good yet somewhat underwhelming animation. What's cool about Overlord is that it's not just a gaming series it's also a dark fantasy and a issekai anime. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited to see how this series ends cuz imo the potential is through the roof. Im not tryna compare here but it's first season was a lot better than SAO's if u ask me. I was obviously mad late getting into this series and just like that I can watch the next two seasons w/o having to wait!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSub or Dub Recommendation: Sub",

            "content": "I stumbled upon this anime a long time ago only to forget about it until this last summer. I read that this anime was meant to be only one season and created purely to promote and sell the manga. However, the amount of support it got was overwhelming that the creator continued with the anime. For continuity/story sake it is only natural for some things to get cut or changed around for it to make sense to the watcher who hasn't read the manga. Even so, I cannot praise this anime enough! The Story and world building is outstanding and very deep for an anime.The art however due to an animation budget suffers at times with its CGI but sometimes makes scenes better - it's a difficult balancing act, and is up to personal preference. Other than that minor compliant this is a great anime. My only warning for newer viewers, again especially if you're an anime only watcher. Pay attention to everything in the sub, season 1 in particular is huge information dump and missing one sentence of information can easily make it hard to follow later on. If you have ever played an RPG, give this anime a try!",

            "content": "Overlord is probably the most chuunibyo series that I\u2019ve ever seen and despite the reviews you may see on MyAnimeList, I believe that it\u2019s worse than Sword Art Online. I\u2019m not sure whether this series was supposed to be purely a gag/comedy series, but if that was the point, it had nothing but dry coughs emitting from my throat at how juvenile, light novel that whole thing was. \r\n\t\u2022 The beginning of the series seemed to have promise, with a main character being trapped in a game with characters that his friends had programmed. But, the show never really emphasizes on the struggles of beingtrapped in a video game or gives any of the characters any identity crises involving the fact that their entire personalities are scripted by people, instead of them being unique individuals.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 But, I suppose a character wouldn\u2019t realize that their personality was all wired, just as us humans inquire about genetics and God. Aside from me justifying that point, I wish all of the characters hadn\u2019t felt so empty. The protagonist is pretty much straight out of a self-insert fan-fiction. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Albedo, one of his servants, is obsessed with him and thirsts for him constantly, because that\u2019s what her pre-established purpose in the world is. All of the servants, in fact, constantly praise the main character, when in reality, he\u2019s probably a scrawny programmer or something.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There are some interesting character designs and traits, such as: a loli vampire in a video game world getting a boob job, a miserly servant with with diamond sphere eyes, and a nazi that looks like it came out of Pink Floyd\u2019s The Wall. Wait, what?\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 This is what I hate about light novels. They don\u2019t form a cohesive plot and instead write anything and everything that they think looks cool or comes to them in some delusional drug binge. Everything in Overlord seemed retconned to shit and back. There was no severity about anything and since they\u2019re characters in a video game, they can just re-spawn. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The best part of the series were the designs, except for the weird maid bunny girl, fuck that; the voice acting was top-tier, I was especially impressed with the voice actress that did Madoka Kaname doing the most demented voice  that I think I\u2019ve ever heard on a character, and, well, that\u2019s it. I mean, Albedo\u2019s hot.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Overall, Overlord is not something that is worth accolades and an eight average on MyAnimeList. It\u2019s pretty much pandering chuuni garbage that will make any well-adjusted adult cringe upon watching. I give Overlord, the first season, a 2/10.",

            "content": "A guy becomes trapped in an MMORPG and wonders what to do with himself. He has a huge guild citadel filled with powerful gear and an army of incredibly loyal and overpowered NPCs. Momonga decides that he will spread his guild name across the land in hopes that anyone who previously knew him in the game will seek him out. Momonga is a lonely office worker so I guess he doesn't care about going home, though this is not really discussed at all. \r\nThe rules of the world are very unclear. Momonga and his castle are teleported to a new land, which is generically medieval,and all of the so-called NPCs just act like regular humans including Momonga's servants. There are occasional mentions of classes and skills but it isn't any different from people shouting out their ability names before attacking in any other anime. According to Momonga, some things work the same way as in his MMO, and some things don't. There are no flashbacks to Momonga playing the game in the past so we just have to take his word for it. Usually it just works as an excuse for Momonga to pull out random scrolls and spells that can do whatever he wants them to. \\n\\n\r\nThe show follows Momonga embarking on minor quests to gain information about the new world and get some cash. Momonga is vastly more powerful than anyone else he encounters, so everything pretty much amounts to: a villain or monster appearing, the NPCs gasping in horror, Momonga killing it with ease and then everyone being amazed. It's kind of jarring because everything is setup with suspenseful music and timing as though the event is actually supposed to be dramatic and impressive, but the audience is already fully aware that there's nothing on the line. There is absolutely zero progression on the story itself, we have no further information about why or how any of this happened in the last episode than at the start. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast of NPCs commanded by Momonga are well-designed and the art is of a high-quality. You will probably see a few of them that pique your interest. There isn't really any reason for them to all be demonic creatures but it does feel fresh. It would have been nice to see the story have more development for these NPCs, instead we mostly meet random new characters in the cities that Momonga travels to. The people he meets are actually interesting characters, it's just made clear that they will not be very important to the story as a whole so you become a little reluctant to invest in them.\\n\\n\r\nMorals is something I wish the show would discuss a little more. Sometimes Momonga has no problems killing people, other times he becomes attached to people and is concerned for them. Sometimes he considers letting bad things happen to look better when he saves the day, and other times he talks about justice and helping others. Momonga has no idea if he is just killing NPCs or not as things are clearly not the same as his MMO world, so I would really expect him to mull more over the implications for his behaviour. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the production value seems high and it can keep your interest most of the way. However I think this is because the themes grab your interest and you are holding on for some development and to see where it goes. But it doesn't go anywhere. It's literally just watching a guy stuck in a video game fuck around and do what he wants. Everyone either fears him or loves him, it does occasionally seem like an indulgent fanfiction for the author.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review encompass season 1, 2, and 3.  \r\nThe thing that bothers me most about the show is the main character.  If the wish fulfillment bullshit was absent in the show I think it would be a jolly good time.  Nothing particularly deep or well written, but with fun action, a neat world to explore, and interesting characters to meet.  \r\nThe main character is by far the worst thing in this show.  All his faults can be boiled down to two points.\r\n1.  The way the NPC's interact with him.  Re-writing the main hot chick to love you isstupid and cringy.  But the worst thing about it is its totally unnecessary, since all of the female NPC's, even the male ones sometimes, want the MC's dick anyways.  Adding this only serves to make the MC out to be a complete weirdo, which IS the point of his character, but it messes the whole dynamic of the show up for me.  Since every character already acts like this, it ONLY serves to taint my opinion of the MC and the Albedo.  Her whole character is just devoted to being in love with MC, and MC just becomes a creep. \\n\\n\r\nI have a problem with this because it ruins a theme that could actually be really interesting to explore, which they hint at.  And that is the dynamic between creator and creation.  Having the NPC's love the MC because he helped create them and then stayed with them when all of the other guild members left is a really cool idea.  Especially if they found out what Ains is really like.  That hes not the \"overlord\" but just some nerd.  I think that could be really fun, and heartwarming.  For them, it would be accepting that their creator is a weirdo, and for him allowing himself to show his true side.  But that is all ruined by the fact that albedo is demoted to being just a slave with a sole personality trait that every other character has anyways. \\n\\n\r\n2.  Ains is fucking boring.  I like the joke that this guy does not know what hes doing.  I genuinely think its funny.  But just imagine, if he was allowed to have emotions on top of it.\\n\\n\r\nIt boggles my mind that this guy is not allowed to have emotions by some bullshit green lights.  I simply cannot wrap my head around the justification for restricting him to being generic and vaguely evil.  \\n\\n\r\nJust imagine, Ains being allowed to react in a way that might get him into some hot water.  Like he gets embarrassed by some social interaction and he has to justify it to the people loyal to him.  He could pull out some BS, make it out to be a positive, and everybody would love him for it.  This happens already, but just at the absolute base level, and without much of Ains' input at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the joke stops being funny, you can pull back the veil, and you can do the interesting character stuff from my last point.  I think that would be great.  As it stands now hes just a boring, husk of a character.  Again, they hint at this concept, allowing us to hear his inner thoughts.  But actually allowing him to stumble, then try to pick himself up would be 10x better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the show is pretty alright.  Season 2 onward raised this show from a 3 to a 5, with its emphasis on other characters besides Ains.  \\n\\n\r\nThe world and characters are pretty fun to learn about, its just a shame the main character drags the whole thing down so much.",

The character does not seem to have logged off his account since then so it does not make any sense at all. In other words, I'll reiterate how the background of the story remained sloppy and unexplained. However, the flow is alright and makes it watchable after a few episodes.\r\nART\r\nNothing special. Generic art with a lot offlashy animations.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nSFX is good, although generic. However, the opening theme is good and resembles the Parasyte OP song.

The feeling of Guts from Berserk resonates from the character. Although uses high levels of magic instead of brute strength.

Other than that, the rest of the characters are bland, and not memorable. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThe first few episodes were boring and horrible. But the storytelling improved thereafter.

The last player, Momonga, was the guild leader of Ainz Ooal Gown, one of the strongest guilds within the game, which consisted of 41 members. Upon the cessation of the Yggdrasil, Momonga finds himself still trapped within the game, unable to utilise the normal player functions to contact other players or quit the game. Thus, he takes on the name Ainz Ooal Gown as a message to other Yggdrasil players, who may bestuck in game like him, and begins to explore the new world that he is trapped in.\\n\\n\r\nOverlord shares many similarities with other anime, such as Sword Art Online, wherein a player becomes trapped within a game and must work to solve the mystery behind their imprisonment. The anime\u2019s plot is interesting and relies heavily on the characterisation of Ainz Ooal Gown (\u201cLord Ainz\u201d), who is portrayed as the supreme overlord with unparalleled power and strength. Due to his immense power, there is some similarity between Lord Ainz and Saitama from the anime, One Punch Man, who also was ridiculously powerful that no one stood a chance to defeat him.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a supreme overlord who is incredibly impressive, his mere presence commanding power and respect at every turn, Lord Ainz is likeable and illustrates his love and compassion for his guardians and servants, along with a kindness that one would not expect from such a powerful being. It is both amusing and eye-opening, the way his guardians and servants pledge to remain loyal to him to the bitter end and long to be in his company. The odd \u2018love\u2019 one of his guardians has for him makes for some humorous and oftentimes uncomfortable moments.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with characteristics which portray ultimate power, Lord Ainz\u2019s appearance also speaks volumes of his abilities. With such a bold and domineering presence, it\u2019s no wonder that he was chosen to be the supreme overlord of the guild. It\u2019s also no surprise that his guardians and servants all fawn over him, desperate to serve their great and powerful master.\\n\\n\r\nWhile similar to Sword Art Online, watching the anime did bring about a longing to jump into games like World of Warcraft or The Witcher, having been hyped up via the anime. Thankfully, each episode ends brilliantly, leaving us wanting more from the story and desperate to know the truth about why Lord Ainz became trapped.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes are incredible, with brilliant sword fights and magic duels, which are followed by epic music. Watching Lord Ainz use his abilities to defeat those who we believe might be stronger than him is enchanting and magnificent. It\u2019s extremely satisfying to be kept in suspense right to the very end, which is exactly how Overlord progresses. \\n\\n\r\nVisually, Overlord is filled with bright colours, brilliant animations and an in-game scenery that leaves much to be desired. The various armour and attire worn by Lord Ainz is magnificent, as are that of his guardians. It is slightly peculiar though that the Dark Elf siblings are depicted as cross-dressers, though this is no way a judgement of any kind. Rather, it was simply unexpected and was confusing initially to uncover which one was female and which male. That being said, both were undeniably adorable yet over-powered in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was as epic as the series itself, with dark undertones that set the mood of the anime. However, despite the catchy soundtrack and incredible music, it was disappointing that this music drowned out much of the dialogue of the anime, which made certain crucial moments inaudible.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, Overlord is a good watch, especially for fans of the isekai and action genre.",

Those who had seen that moment already probably will think about me as a psycho from now on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIf you watch this you won't regret It, esspecially if you adore gothic style / death as  I mentioned above. It's a unique anime, and there is a reason why It has 8+ out of 10 overall.",

Well, this anime delves into that situation.\r\nFirst, let's look at how this series differ from other RPG-set series. For one, it doesn't explain how the MC dived into the game. There were no indication if he teleported or if it's all just a dream. Other than that, neither we or the MC know who's behind the complications found in that world, leaving us in suspense.\r\nAlso, the MC is introduced as two characters, but just one person. There's the unnamed protagonist who controls Ains, and Ains himself. From here, wesee two sides of the same coin, something that has not been explored before. Just the thought of having two characters being just one character makes you think how ingenious that idea is.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was... okay... It's not anything special. But the opening song was the first reason why I started watching this series. The lyrics fit the show perfectly!\\n\\n\r\nWas it enjoyable? Personally, it was okay. If you're not into OP characters or RPG-like themed series, I wouldn't recommend it. So I suggest you get yourselves prepped before facing Overlord!\\n\\n",

If ganking is not your thing, than for the love of god do not watch this anime!\r\nStory 5/10\r\nOverlord had a lot of potential. As you can read in the discription, Overlord is about the MMORPG Yggdrasil in which the main character gets stuck in said MMORPG. With his loyal servants he now plans to take over the world.\r\nEverything in this description is true, except the part about taking over the world, which is the MOST IMPORTANT PART! I will not spoil anything for you, but this show is not about taking over the world.Its about the main character, together with his loyal servants, protecting and helping the minor settlements around his dungeon. He does this with the intent of eventually conquering the world but I think even you can agree that if there is no conquering going on, you can't really talk about the main character conquering the world, can you?\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty bland. There aren't any plot twists or psychological battles. Want to know why? Because the main character is overpowered. And not just a little overpowered. This guy kills everything in a single blow. He's like one punch man without the yellow suit. Because of this, there is never really any excitement. You never wonder if the main character is going to make it out alive, since you know he destroys everything on his path with effortless ease.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all bad though. The story that is told, altough its not what you will expect, is fairly decent. The things that happen may grasp your attention enough so that you won't drop it before the final episode(as it did with me), but that is about it. For that reason, the story receives a 5 out of 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. It's not amazing, but it's better than average. I can't really say a lot about this since the art isn't outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe battle music is pretty cool but overall I wouldn't listen to the OST of Overlord. Again, it's nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are aweful in my opinion. I'm sorry for being so negative, but dear lord, they could have at least made the characters a little funnier. You won't really bond with the characters, except with the main character, who isn't interesting at all. He likes to reminisce about the good old days and is afraid of the women who adore him. He constantly complains about his surroundings and decides to lay low throughout the story even though he is the most powerful being in this MMORPG. It doesn't make any sense.\\n\\n\r\nMost characters develop poorly and are not interesting at all. For that reason i give the characters a 4 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure that there are people who enjoy this anime and there's nothing wrong with that. Like I said before, It's not aweful as there are some good parts in this anime, but they mean too little to me to make this anime a good one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime could have been something great. It could have been about vast armies fighting each other with the main character and his servants leading the troops. Instead you get some boring story about one punch man laying low for a while. This anime is not for me and I DO NOT recommend this. Unless you love every anime that is about MMORPG's or if you like ganking, you will not like this one.",

Recommend it.\r\nBut if you haven't seen Sword Art Online, then i will explain other way: The anime is about a man stuck in a game; in this game he is in the last level possible, so he is very strong, almost a God there. \r\nThen, he want to discover about this world that he is stuck, even though the worldis practically the same of the game he was playing. The protagonist is kind of dumb and choose very contestable ways to reach his goals...\\n\r\nThe first episodes are very exciting, but this season was kind of a introduce for the universe.

The OP is nice and the ED is nice as well. The VA is good for some character butnothing too special about it. The characters are well written and executed perfectly into the stories.

A child drop his ice cream?\r\nThat's what Overlord is. Its that feeling distilled and presented in color and sound.\r\nThe premise is simple. A nerd loser spends all his time playing video games as an escape from a complicated world. Suddenly his video game becomes real. But this isn't sword art online.\r\nInitially he is elated but slowly his \"escape\" becomes a reality that is just as plagued with problems as his home life. He struggles to retain hisinnocence and humanity as he is figuratively (and literally) forced to become the monster he chose as his vehicle of escape. Its the epic of a man confronted with a crumbling dream. Except now, there is no escape to flee to. \\n\\n\r\nIts as if everyone was turned into the monsters they pretended to be on halloween. Sure being an undead is fun, for an evening. But for ever?\\n\\n\r\nWatch as our dynamic and deep character experiences the love of another for the first time, only to realise that as an undead monster he cannot consummate it. Watch food turn to ash in his mouth. The warm rays of the sun burn him as children run form him in horror. He begins to go insane. Deep questions haunt the audience, will he succumb to his new identity? Or was he really a monster all along, his fantasy character a mere mask for the heartless murderer that lurked within? After all did he not CHOOSE to be an undead? Was his taking the mantle of the bad guy a cry for help? was it simply fun and games? Well it isn't a game now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank God this awesome premise wasn't ruined with gothic lolita, harems and two dimensional enemies. Image what would have happened if a narcissistic idiot was in charge of this project. \\n\r\nWould the interesting magical system be totally undermined by main characters that have such mastery of it they may as well be gods? Instead of seeing him have to consider politics for the first time, while confronting the new reality of a world that despises the sight of him, would we be shown huge anime tities flopping around? Would the plot have no connections? Would we scream bloody murder at the screen as yet another so called antagonist is swept away with pathetic ease? Would the author be so infatuated with his character that he can't bear to have him possesses any weakness at all? \\n\r\nWould nothing matter in the end? The climax be pointless and utterly unfounded on the preceding episodes? Would every horrible anime trope rear its ugly head and lay waste the the best premise since fullmetal alchemist? \\n\\n\r\nOh. Wait. That's exactly what happened. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime tities are pretty good though. Nice and floppy. Should have just been hentai.\\n\\n",

All the people saying that Overlord was a masterpiece, I'm not going to argue with you, however with me, the anime was dreadful for me watching it. In the first episode, the animation was so choppy for me that I literally wanted to puke. I'm unsure whether it was the server I was using or what, but it was utterly disgusting. The story was mediocre because, what am I supposed to say? Oh... A guy got stuck inside a VR game... that's very original (not like an anime became mainstreambefore that). I mean seriously I took this up since it was one of my friend's favorite anime, but I just couldn't watch past episode 2, the characters are OK they could be a whole lot better if someone thought the idea through. Overall I can say that I hated the anime and don't plan on starting it again. 3/10",

            "content": "This was disappointing. The anime starts with interesting premise, but fails to deliver anything interesting, and doesn't live to its full potential.\r\nThe interesting premise is: Imagine \"isekai\" (transported to another world) anime, where you end up in fantasy world as a .... LICH with a knack for world domination. A dark undead necromancer wizard with tendency towards world domination. Sounds cool, right? It should be awesome, right? right? WRONG.\r\nMost of the time the anime plays with large number of unrelated topics, and ultimately just scraps many of them, forgetting that certain events happened at all. \r\nIn the end I think it'll be mostly interesting toMMO crowd, because it preyty much talks about player remembering past glory days of his favorite guild and trying to protect the guild hall. \\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown is below:\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nStory is not good. It is drawn out, feels like it could've been compressed in 6 episodes or less. It ultimately fails to get to any point, and the world is not very interesting by itself. Basically, the anime fails to decide whether the anime world is real or some sort of virtual reality, which ultimately makes the anime less believable. We can have dramatic event at one spot, and then people talking about \"NPCs\" and \"Greater Beings\" (i.e. players) in another.\\n\\n\r\nSo, it is not good. There was a huge potential regarding malevolent lich character, but it is never realized. Many topics and important events are outright forgotten, that includes whole arcs of the story. There's also sever dissonance in tone of different scenes. Some are relatively light, whil in other scenes heads start flying.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAverage, and sometimes bad. The characters are drawn decently, however, the anime uses very noticeable CG graphics, especially in mass scenes. Those graphics ultimately ruin visuals of the first episode. So, decent, but CG is not good, and ultimately there's nothing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDoesn't really stand out. It is there, but it is not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMajority of characters are cardbord cutouts, and anime doesn't seem to care about any of them. They don't really develop anywhere, and are more like plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI think I wouldn't have lost much if I skipped it completely. I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMight be worth checking out if you're a fan of MMO, and maybe for the first 2 episodes, which are darker. In all honesty, there are better Isekai anime worth watching.",

We don't know how or why the MC is trapped inside the game. He quickly excepts it without hesitation and barely questions it. He travels around the game in hopes of finding other players who've been trapped to. One thing I noticed about overlord is that it does more telling than showing which leads to a long dialogue of info dumps. Also I don't even think this anime has a story to behonest. I was quite bored after 5 episodes  and zoned out numerous times while watching.  The world building is pretty nice and enjoyed watching the characters travel around. Eventually I grew tired and uninterested so I dropp it. \\n\\n\r\nArt/ the art in overlord is pretty good I enjoyed the character designs and fight animations. However I noticed that a couple of Shitty CG models were thrown in and they looked atrocious. \\n\\n\r\nSound/ overlords sound track really isn't memorable one bit actually it was quite bland to be honest. However I will admit that the opening song was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters/ probably the weakest point of the show. Almost every character in this anime is boring, bland, and uninteresting. Except for the Main Character. Despite him being a annoying Gary Stu I found him to be a rather enjoyable MC. None of the other characters are memorable in any way to the point where I wouldn't have given a damn if they died or not. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/ despite this anime being extremely unoriginal and somewhat  boring. It was actually pretty enjoyable. It wasn't anything amazing but it wasn't bad either which is why I'm giving this a 5/10. \\n\\n",

The result is you end up \"just going along\" with the mini-stories constantly waiting for something huge to happen. I felt that the story finally picked up around the final episodes when it was already too late...\r\nArt/Sound: 7 Both the art and sound seemed to fitmy idea of what an MMO should be. The MC constantly looks like a badass, which is fitting for someone who is supposed to be one of the best players in the game. The other characters  also looked nice and were easily distinguishable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 Unlike Kirito from SAO, the Overlord aka Momonga, feels like what a seasoned guild master should be. Where Kirito is some kid who can just jump into an MMO and automatically be amazing at everything for NO REASON, our MC is a BADASS because he clearly has spent many many hours with his friends mastering the game in which he is trapped. Because of this, his arrogance is not only acceptable, but WELCOME. I would act the same way if I was thrust into a game where I was the most OP being. The rest of the characters complement each other nicely as well. The voice acting was really well done and draw you into an otherwise boring story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 This was a hard one to rate. I really enjoyed the \"bad ass\"  characters and very solid voice acting. The fight scenes were entertaining and always kept me wondering about the true potential of MC's powers.  The downside to this anime is that the story seems erratic and the pacing suffers as well due to there only being 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 This anime gets a 6 which is disappointing because it seemed so promising. The pacing and the shortness of the series costs this anime big time. Otherwise, I really enjoyed watching our badass MC in action against various foes. \\n\\n\r\nPros: \\n\r\n- Good action scenes\\n\r\n- Strong character design \\n\r\n- Great voice acting\\n\r\n- Barely any fanservice  \\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n- Plot has pacing issues and doesn't go anywhere until the end\\n\r\n- Series is too short for this type of anime",

            "content": "Just didn't have enough of anything it tried to do for me to keep watching. It tried fan-service, but it was minimal. The story was uninteresting and going nowhere fast; akin to SAO but it doesn't make you care for the main character because even the main character didn't care about the main character before he became overpowered.\r\nThat's where the show fails again: the main character being overpowered. 2 shows that have handled this well are One Punch Man, and Dragon Ball.\r\nIn Dragon Ball, Goku is always the most powerful, until he's not. His strength is constantly being tested by his opponents and through thatyou get to see progression in his own strength, and the hero overcoming adversity.\\n\\n\r\nIn One Punch Man, Saitama is always the most powerful and that's established pretty quickly, much like Overlord. Saitama's power, much like Ainz, is never fully defined, and furthermore, never capped. The place where these two shows differ, is that Saitama is constantly fighting enemies that look like they could one-shot the whole earth, meanwhile, he looks like he's supposed to be working at subway. In Overlord, Ainz looks OP, and acts OP. \\n\\n\r\nIn short:\\n\r\nGoku looks OP, doesn't act OP. (in a sense of being humble)\\n\r\nSaitama looks weak af, and acts weak af. (in a sense of being humble)\\n\r\nAinz looks OP, and acts OP. \\n\\n\r\nThat's where you fail as a show when you write an OP character. Goku, Saitama, Naruto, and Deku are all fun to watch because they could topple a skyscraper with the flick of a finger, BUT they never act so full of themselves because of it. We get to see these characters coming from a place of weakness and dissatisfaction with their current power; a yearning to get stronger that constantly drives them to improve themselves. \\n\\n\r\nTherefore, when you write a character wherein the first 3-5 episodes they basically turn on God mode, it becomes about as fun to watch as... actually turning on God mode in a video game. Great for the first 30 minutes; extremely boring afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nWhat compels me to keep watching Overlord if Ainz is already top tier, owns a castle, and has 2 of the FINEST bitches in the whole show? It's like watching My Hero Academia but Deku's already mastered his quirk, has the whole female cast sucking him, somehow bought the school, and became the #1 hero. Like yeah, it's fun for 3 episodes, until you're like \"good for you dude\" and move on with your life. I don't need a nigga flexing in my face 24/7. There's a reason the creator of One Punch Man made him live in a 1 bedroom apartment.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: If a character has everything he needs, and can get what he wants without the slightest of struggles, it might be fun to watch in some cases, but it's rarely compelling in most. Where's the fun in starting a show at the end?",

            "content": "A show with a protagonist so powerful that nothing can stand in his path, sounds like an interesting concept? Think of it, a guy whose guild of 40+ members worked hard to create the best castle and obtain ultimate items, finds himself trapped in virtual world with all the skills and items he possessed. He's also magician class, thrown into some generic fantasy land full of mediocre and weak creatures. He has also got numerous extremely powerful servants, so does such starting point of an anime or any RPG sound interesting? What is the point of playing a game where you already have dominance?\r\nI've mentionedsome parts of the story in former paragraph, the story is blunt - a guy is trapped in RPG world and tries to protect his place from any possible invaders. He's also scouting around, but that's what I've got from story so far, I've read some reviews and noticed there isn't much of a plot at all.\\n\r\nArt and sound are mediocre, though I'd say some character designs don't look appealing at all, especially the protagonist whose design looks pretty bad (why creating such giant cloak, also those two red balls on shoulders which look horrible?).\\n\r\nThe show falls horribly at characters. The protagonist is typical guy in harem shows, making stupid reactions when a female makes a move to him, for example: *gulp* I...I touched her *loses breath*.  He repeats this every time, and no matter that most of those scenes are supposed to look like jokes, they are just blunt and annoying. Let's move to the servants, they are typical AI, no personality, just responding to the player. They are just talking about the protagonist and how much they love him, though there was a feud between Albedo and Shalltear who will marry the protagonist and give a birth to the heir... which is just.... I almost puked when I watched that scene. Especially since they are undead, so why would he need a heir?? It was just pathetic scene, especially the art and sound were horrible when a character would become obsessed about the protagonist. What about others? I haven't watched much, but I'd say they have barely any role in the show, to let us see the capabilities of protagonist and his servants. They are typically good guys or bad guys, nothing more or less.\\n\r\nNow about enjoyment... There wasn't any. All these elements combines heave a pathetic image of a horrible show with no interesting scenes and characters or good points. The whole show is that some bad guys try to do bad stuff to good guys, the protagonist gets involved, the whole drama starts and it's built slowly, the bad guys spend a lot of time summoning their champion which gets destroyed in a blink of an eye. Is the purpose of the show to make us see how ridiculous power of the protagonist is? To see how the servants can be robots who do nothing but obey their master? \\n\r\nOverall: the show is annoying, contains only one generic character while others are just some beings who react to the protagonist and have nothing of their own, jokes are overused and blunt, action is boring and done in matter of seconds... Makes me wonder why do people adore this show. \\n\r\nI lasted only 4 episodes, I don't know will I ever get enough strength and nerves to watch more to provide more details because this show is just pathetic. \\n\r\nIf you think of watching the show, I kindly suggest you to skip this rubbish.",

Because Kirito is an emo little bitch in spite of being the ultimate Mary Sue(or since he's a guy Gary Stu) and having an army of anime bitches thatwant to hop on his dick, the dudes got no reason to be depressed all the time. \\n\\n\r\nKirito also had no reason why he should be so overpowered, he played solo a good portion of the time, used leveling tactics that he admitted were ineffective, and the beta test only gave him 6 months more time with the game than non-beta testers and no advantage over other beta testers, in sword art online its also mentioned that some of the mechanics had changed since beta so there was no reason why it would have given him the kind of omniscience he seems to possess with regards to the game. \\n\\n\r\nMomonga and Kirito have in common that they are overpowered, but with momonga it actually makes sense for him to be so powerful: he played the game for years, probably from its initial release of its peak in popularity up until the point the servers shut down, in any case long enough to reach maximum level, him and his guild had also collected items from all over the game's world and he kept all the items his comrades left behind. \\n\\n\r\nThe MMO world of Overlord also makes more sense than that of Sword Art Online's... at least from what I've gathered from watching these 13 episodes they make sense, in Sword Art Online, its as if the writer had never played an MMO himself. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately having a protagonist who is less insuferable than kirito and having a fictional world that actually makes sense because it sticks to its own rules dosen't make for a good show on its own, the NPCs are still pretty flat because they don't really have notworthy personality traits other than admiration for momonga and the other MMO neckbeards they've mistaken for gods, the show's pacing is bogged down by its need to explain everything in excessive detail and bombard you with other kinds of useless information.\\n\\n\r\n I couldn't help but be a little annoyed with the fact that the show gave momonga's first party so much screen time and then killed them off, and this wasn't even due to any attatchment I had to these characters that i was annoyed, it was just annoying that the show wasted my time with these characters that didn't really serve a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nI consider the show to be of poor quality but at least I didn't feel like it completely wasted my time, only mostly wasted it which is why I give it a 4 rather than something lower",

Simply put: Overlord has an amazing premise. A really cool looking, overpowered, lich lord, with all the power in the world, ready to explore and very possibly conquer a completely new world, with his overpowered followers? FUCK, looks great. And for the first episodes after the first two (they acted as a setup) it was! Ainz (Or Momon, however ya wanna call him), reallygave the impression of the overpowered, godtier guy and it was done well, giving me a boner whenever he showed how great his power was.\\n\r\nBut then...eh.\\n\r\nI started to realize, episode by episode, how the anime is overall bland: the protagonist (again, he is probably the most powerful being in the world and he knows that), spends his time being the insecure idiot-smartass that he is, \"\"\"exploring\"\"\" his new surroundings and defending himself from fucking worms that can't hurt him anyway (why he is even worried about them?) while his followers, who are all bland characters with no interesting personality, do stuff for him. The premise of this godtier being destroying and conquering everything is soon gone by episode 6, and falls even more as the writer puts some bullshit to make stuff more spicy (\"OH MY GOD X IS BEING MIND CONTROLLED BY SOMEBODY FOR NO REASON AT ALL I AM SO WORRIED ABOUT IT AND I SPEND TWO EPISODES FIGHTING X ALTHOUGH THE FIGHT COULD'VE ENDED IN THREE SECONDS WOW\"). To top it off, there are even more useless characters and at the end of the anime the protagonist walks out of a tavern saying some bullshit like \"GUYS GET READY OMG DIS GON BE BIG\" to characters that we don't know just to hype us up. Well, I'm not hyped. I'm disgusted that a character that looked like he was going to be GREAT ended up being meh. And that's the worst kind of disappointment: I couldn't see the bullshit at first, and ended up wasting precious time on it because of this cool looking skeleton guy.\\n\\n\r\nSigh.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 and I'm being generous.",

Every two minutes someone tells, how great he is.\\n\r\nEveryone just shove Momonga in my throat. \\n\r\nNot let me judge by his actions, no! He is great, deal with it! \\n\\n\r\nAnd he isn't even that great!\\n\r\nHe played this game for years, and his skill is mediocre at best! \\n\\n\r\nWich makes this anime just boring. \\n\r\nYou now why OP characters works in other anime? \\n\\n\r\nIn One-Punch Man it works, because it presented with humor. \\n\r\nIn Hellsing it works, because Alucard gives you some great guro all the time. \\n\\n\r\nIn Overlord they hide, and being careful, and you don't even know why (i'm talking about the anime). So you have to read ranobe as a manual. \\n\\n\r\nRecently i've read manga: Skeleton Knight going out to the parallel universe.\\n\r\nAnd that was done better. The same concept with OP skeleton in game-like world is working better! Because the protagonist don't have a whole army of OP servants, that will do your every wish. \\n\r\nAlso protagonist is making some facial expressions. \\n\r\nSkeletons can do that! Look at Brook from One Piece!\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: This anime is one jiant Momonga's suckfest. \\n\\n\r\nHere is more elaborate version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRBhRCDyy4s",

            "content": "I was curious at first how it would play out because of how popular it seemed and how much attention it gets from other users. As I have previewed the series without even looking at the synopses/reviews, and to my disappointment, I did not find the reason behind Overlord being hyped. Overlord is another Isekai show... Nothing too unusual, except for the fact that the main character--although generic at best--is a hero wearing the capes of a villain.\r\nThe story revolves around a male protagonist who happens to be a guild leader of a dying MMO. The show doesn't delve deeper into the information regarding \"thereal life\" of the user, except for several flashbacks that shows fragments of memories about his guild-mates who apparently quit the game due to their circumstances. Even taking for granted how convenient the world transfer and the world setting is for our main character, Momonga (AKA Ainz). As overpowered as he is, mainly because of being a cash user and gaining the items of 40 other cash users, the setting of the show tells us that the universe he was randomly transported into is inferior to his character and guild. Along with the non-player characters (NPCs), he first hints at taking over the world in order to help other players of the MMO by making the name of his guild Ainz Ooal Gown known throughout the country (thus, the name change from Momonga to Ainz). The difference in the show itself is that our main character technically has no people from the same game by his side--as opposed to other \"Isekai-MMO shows\" that usually have a group of people working together to accomplish a goal. The story gets dull as the show is full of useless banter and dragged out dialogues. The overpowered being is just not appealing when the show is just slow-paced and not clear on what direction the series wants to go to. The progression of the plot is not evident as it goes randomly from here to there. Also, the series contains a lot of information that seems to be irrelevant despite the possibility that the information might be used for setting up flags/necessary events for plot advancement. For me, as a viewer, it feels like the author might be a bit scatterbrained.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters all have different personalities and character designs. As usual, such a thing is necessary in order to make the show seem a bit more dynamic, but in this case the contrast just feels outright annoying. The inconsistency of some characters and just how they were designed appeared to be quite irritating because it felt like the show always hints at fan-service. On the other hand, there were times that I felt fairly amused because of how stupid the characters became. Although, considering that Overlord was produced quite recently, the art is mediocre, not to mention the poor CGI designs in several scenes. I was also bothered by how usual they forced \"English\" into the show as it contained many commands or skills, but I felt that it was not necessary. \\n\\n\r\nIt's fairly decent but it's just a little bit better than some of isekai anime adaptations out there. I finished watching the whole season 1 in one sitting and it feels lacking in several aspects (such as its plot,conflict, character development, world-building, art & animation, flexibility in voice acting/script-writing)... but I managed to watched through it so I guess it's bearable. I can't see why people are/were hyped over it.\\n\\n\r\n[TL;DR]\\n\r\nOverlord is a generic Isekai anime adaptation with a not so generic main character archetype. It's not bad per se; it is somewhat bearable and sometimes fun to watch.\\n\r\nStory : 4 (40% = 1.6)\\n\r\nCharacter : 4 (25% = 1)\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 5 (20% = 1)\\n\r\nSound : 5 (15%= 0.75)\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 4.35 ~> 4/10\\n\r\n(Enjoyment : 6, Not Included in Criteria Rating)",

            "content": "Overlord was recommended to me by several friends but it took me a while to get around to finishing it. While I did enjoy the series, it's got a few issues that held it back from being genuinely good.\r\nLet's start with the premise. This one's a mixed bag. It's your standard Isekai light novel adaptation where someone is trapped in a popular MMO with a few key differences. First, the main protagonist, Ains, is a gigantic lich who was the head of a monster-themed guild. The second is that he's the only one that was trapped in the game and seemingly entirely on accident. Thebig problem here is that it's never adequately explained how or why this happened. The first episode starts of pretty strong with its premise with the NPCs suddenly becoming way more lifelike and the world around Ains gets a lot more dynamic depth to it all of the sudden. The first few episodes do a wonderful job of setting up the main dilemma, introducing the main character as well as several secondaries.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis would have been nice if it were consistent. A major complaint about the setting I had was that while the first half of the series tries to make a real fantasy world that explains weird parts of MMO logic but then mid-way through seems to forget that and we soon get characters talking about HP and MP pools, abilities, items, and the like as if they all suddenly remembered they used to be a video game. It was frankly jarring and while it's assumed that Ains trusted his monster lieutenants that he was part of a guild that created and programmed them as part of a video game AND that they both understood and believed him, it's never hinted at and we're just left to assume that it had to have happened because it was the only thing that made sense. It was bluntly absolutely jarring.\\n\\n\r\nAins himself will make or break the show depending on how you view him. He's another Isekai overpowered character but I felt he was an OP character done right. As a max-level player who's been playing the game at the head of a highly-successful and dedicated guild for years, he was one of the game's big shots and had a huge amount of power, wealth, resources and fun magic items at his disposal. This at least makes Ains a believable OP character as we can clearly understand why he's as powerful as he is in a way that makes sense in the context of the story. However his personality and motivations are vague and hard to follow. His lieutenants had far more actual personality than he did and none of them got enough limelight to really shine in any meaningful way. They're introduced in the second episode and feel like they're going to be important but wind up fucking about sitting in the castle while Ains does stuff with less interesting characters for most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat saved me from giving up on this series was mostly how much I enjoyed WATCHING it. The visuals are great with very nice and interesting character designs that were just distinct enough to be cool but not elaborate enough to be gaudy. The visuals and magic effects in this show are great and the fight scenes are really fun to watch. Overall I enjoyed Overlord and I wouldn't dissuade someone who was interested from giving it a shot purely on that reason. But the story falling on its face half the time might be a problem for people with less patience.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the biggest issue I had is that things take a nose-dive story wise. There is never any concrete goal for the main character other than to gather information and he chooses to go about it in increasingly complicated ways for no discernible reason. It's JJBA levels of overplanning without the explosive payoff most of the time. The other big issue is that while the first few episodes do a great job of establishing the world we're watching, nothing really truly progresses past that. Several episode-long mini-arcs feel like they could have been compressed into single episodes or even parts of them. Too many characters and factions are introduced with the expectation of them being critical to the plot only to have things fall flat and have them be forgotten. This leaves several unanswered questions that never get adequate time to be explained. Every single story thread in this series was left unresolved by the end... Every. Single. One. It feels like the entire plodding first season was a prelude to a much larger story the show wants to tell but didn't have the time or budget to try and get going, but this leaves the show as it stands feeling like little more than a lengthy introduction.\\n\\n\r\nThe show did get greenlit for a second season. I'm hoping it picks things up. I really want to give this another chance.",

I just kept hoping it would somehow turn that art and sound that was already well done into a masterpiece with a good story but it never happened.  I actually enjoy fighting in real life in matches.  So for me I love the feeling of \"Fuck yes LETS KILL THEM\"  figuratively of course to pump myself up for the match and that same kind of blood thirst came across is some of the scenes.  Sadlythe main characters were about as dull as the person who thought static faces were okay.  Like sure in a book that is fine but this is called \"Animation\" for a reason.  So sadly the crazy blood thirsty characters never outdid the lame people.  I just sat there like ow wow who cares, even when the main characters were in trouble I was like \"Please kill them\" and end my pain.  They should have reversed the rolls and make the bad guys with emotions be the main protagonist and the boring one personality good people the antagonist.  At least then I could have cheered for the people I was directed to support.  I just watched it again to see if I may had miss remembered it as I was deciding if I wanted to view season 2 when it is released.  One good thing I can say is I love the blood thirsty faces and those eyes man are mesmerizing.  Not worth watching just for that alone.",
