            "content": "This is the perfect example of a video game adaptation done wrong. Trying to fit in about 25 hours of material into 13 episodes is NOT a good idea, unless you want an extremely rushed show with very flat characters. It is horrible.\r\nThe story was actually pretty decently adapted. While it was rushed, nothing very important was omitted. However, I have some issues with the investigations. How do you expect anime watchers to identify the culprit if the most important part in mystery solving is rushed in about 3 minutes? Rushed investigations also made it seem like Kirigiri and Naegi were pulling things out oftheir asses during trials.\\n\\n\r\nThat is another thing : class trials. There were 13 people in the first class trial. Everyone had to speak at least once, right? So, once again, the actual mystery solving part was rushed. Though, as the show went on, there were fewer students, so the trials did not feel as rushed (chapter 4 and chapter 5's trials are the best examples.) Still, this just proves 13 episodes only was not enough.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the art. The character design is very odd, but it makes the characters look colorful and very different from one another! You could pretty much tell who had what talent just by looking at their appearance. Komatsuzaki Rui really has not dropped the ball design-wise.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the animation quality was quite subpar. Some episodes had okay animation, some terrible. The amount of stills also hurts, but it is acceptable. Generally, class trials had good animation, but the rest (investigation and the pre-investigation segments) took a huge hit. \\n\\n\r\nI like how they kept Monokuma's small quirks in the background, though. Like eating pancakes after a particular execution.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing is the soundtrack. Composed by Takada Masafumi, the music is very catchy and really sets in the mood in most scenes. A prime example is the song named \"DISTRUST\" playing during big revelations, absolutely perfect! I don't dislike the OP theme, but the game's is way better. The ED, however, is pretty awesome. Personally, I love the 8-bit part at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very well done, as expected of big name seiyuus. Monokuma's especially is perfect for the role.\\n\\n\r\nNow here comes the bad part of the anime, and the main reason why I did not enjoy the show as many as I thought I would : character. In the game, characters are mainly developed by hanging out with them. As you hang out with them, you learn more about them. That is where they get development, and since the anime completely skips hanging out, there is nearly no character development for the whole cast, with the exception of Kirigiri, Togami and, to some degree, Naegi. This is a bad thing because when a character dies, it is hard to feel anything because you could not get attached to them. And that makes some twists feel pretty underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the Danganronpa anime had a few good things about it, but it was severely crippled by a lack of character development and a very limited number of episodes. And that is why I did not enjoy the anime very much.",

            "content": "\"You've got that wrong!\"\r\nFirst off, if you detest/abhor/dislike this anime, read no further. I've just seen many overly-negative reviews and wanted to have an alternate opinion available for anyone who needs one. This is also a very naive review, as I've never played the game, nor have heard of its popularity, so expectations were average.\r\nOh god, what am I getting myself into?\r\nThe setting of Danganronpa has to be one of the strangest. A despair-filled high school where you have to butcher your classmates to \"graduate?\" Not going to lie, I thought this probably wasn't going to be the greatest of shows...\r\n\"You've got that wrong!\"\r\nBut howso, Naegi?\\n\\n\r\n\"The people around me and the events that occur are very peculiar, but interesting!\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. Ahh, I see now. So the characters are extremely unique (and contrast each other perfectly), I mean, a Super Duper High School Level Wrestler that looks like a body-building man but is really a girl?! My brain was surprised and I'd imagine it started seeping out of my nose. But nonetheless, the characters (obviously) really made the show for me. Not a single character in the show can be labeled, by me, a bad character. Hell, I might just start a new list for Most Hated Characters just because of Monokuna. So I think it's safe to say that you'll enjoy the characters.\\n\\n\r\nConsistency: 7/10. Alright, this is the one thing that got on my nerves. The series did tend to be quite episodic at times and left important information out as well. That was a big downer for me as well, because to me, the series could've been almost nearly perfect if it didn't just drop information. However, I do understand that this was a seasonal anime, a Summer seasonal to be exact, so there really wasn't a way to break out of 12-13 episodes. Long story short, this anime would've been awesome if it was a few episodes longer to include all the information.\\n\\n\r\n\"But remember, there's always some other great things that we have as well. Trust me, I'm a fortune-teller.*wink*\"\\n\\n\r\nThank you for the information and for creeping me out, Yasuhiro. But this holds true as well. For example: Mystery! The mystery in this series is absolutely top-notch and very invigorating (and this is coming from a HUGE Higurashi no Naku Koro ni fan), and almost always kept me anxious and nervous until they were solved. The prime example of this was the Classroom Trials, which was the highlight of the series for me. Sure, some of them were rushed, but quite honestly, who cares?! It was so exciting when I saw the elevator descending to the Classroom Trials room. The folowing debate would be very interesting, and was extremely interesting to see how each student used evidence to support themselves and to attack others. I must say, it was a bunch of fun.\\n\\n\r\n\"You've got that wrong! Those trials were always difficult and were almost always put on my shoulders!\" \\n\\n\r\nTrue, Naegi, but that bullet thing you did was always really cool.\\n\\n\r\n\"Uhhh, thanks....I guess...\"\\n\\n\r\nOkay, stop interrupting me, I'm trying to write a review.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one more complaint I have of this series. The constant 'yadda yadda Despair blah Despair-filled bluh bluh Despair' dialogue was WAY overused, and it's very evident near the end. I mean, my god, I understand this is about despair, it's in the freaking title! The show just crammed that down my throat until I felt that was the only word I knew anymore. However, I did feel like I was reading a well-drafted essay, because I noticed a sequential tone structure, with a very strong tonal shift. Although this might not be very useful for anyone nor will you care,but I thought it was worth mentioning in case others noticed it as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere's one more thing I'd like to cover: Sound: 9/10\\n\r\nVA's 10/10: The voice actors in this series seemed like they were MOLDED to be perfect for each character. I couldn't see any character any other way. Even at first, I couldn't stand Monokuna's voice, but it grew on me fairly quickly. You could play any character's voices and I could deduce them almost immediately, they are THAT distinct.\\n\\n\r\nOST: 9/10: I can't believe I'd ever love a rap song, but TKDz2b hit the tone of Danganronpa write on with \"Never Say Never.\" I will admit, I did NOT expect an English rap song to come on when I started it (and there were no accents, even a bigger surprise), and I immediately fell in love with it. Takada Masafumi \\n\r\nalso created a great soundtrack for this anime (I mean, he DID get chosen to do music composition for Super Smash Bros. Brawl) and the mood was always enhanced when the music started up. The ED (Episode 13's was great), however, didn't really do it for me. It contrasted with the feel of the series (somewhat like \"Torch\" from Clannad: After Story), so it was a slight mood killer, but it wasn't too bad, because it was still a great song.\\n\\n\r\n\"You've got that right!\"\\n\\n\r\nWow, you feeling okay Naegi? That's the first time I've heard you agree!\\n\\n\r\n\"I just express my emotions enthusiastically and raw.\"\\n\\n\r\n...that gave me a weird image. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. Yes, I loved this series. I had a great time and an exciting time watching it. If it was slightly longer and didn't try to implant the word \"Despair\" on me and shove it down my esophagus, I would've loved it just that much more. \\n\\n\r\nYet again, this is completely my opinion, so please don't take any of my ramblings too hard. I also won't go over the story because everyone will have contrasting beliefs on it, so there really is no point.\\n\\n\r\nThank you Naegi and Yasuhiro for the commentary on my review. Now get out of here and live on in despair.\\n\\n\r\n\"Uncool, man. Uncool.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhatever Yasuhiro.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Note: I watched the last 7 episodes while having a high fever and it made me feel a lot better by just watching it, so this may have a slightly higher score than it would've, but, I digress. \\n",

            "content": "I think it should be a general rule that if you're going to adapt any type of game, that you cannot make it 1-cour. If Danganronpa isn't a prime example of this rule, than I don't know what is.\r\nBeing a fan of the game, I was very excited to hear that Danganronpa was receiving an adaption. The biggest issue though was 13 episodes - which, considering that Danganronpa relies a lot on character and plot development for it to work so well, was obviously going to be a huge let down in the series. Even as a standalone anime, Danganronpa doesn't work as well asit could've.\\n\\n\r\nThe series revolves around 15 high school students, chosen to go to an academy of hope - Hope's Peak Academy - based on one major thing they excel in, be it detective work, fortune telling, anything really. I won't get into detail about the story, since well, there is a synopsis, but the words \"15 high school students\" and \"13 episodes\" should already start sounding alarms for you.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because the show obviously doesn't have time to explore all of these characters, which is honestly a shame. The characters, honestly, come off as very one-dimensional and underdeveloped due to how quickly the pace moves. Characters that were supposed to have spent lots of time and have connections with Naegi, our main protagonist, are severely cut back which makes the murders all look like petty shock value.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I have always praised Danganronpa for was its excellent characters, which are almost completely butchered in the anime. The amount of foreshadowing and interactions that they all had was amazing, but in the anime, again, even as a standalone, is just very flat. Obviously, the characters who survive longer get more development, but without any actual character development or depth given to them, the entire impact of the death, trial, and executions are just.. gone. It makes it seem like just another petty death game, which unfortunately, is what the anime feels like.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself suffers due to rushed time as well, since again, the rushed pace takes away from a lot of foreshadowing that tie in to key events, most specifically a major plot twist near the end of the show. The story is pretty coherent and easy to follow, but in the end it never comes off as more than just mediocre due to how the anime is presented. Not to mention, so many things come off as complete asspulls. This is really present in the trials because of how short the investigations are. It makes it seem like some of the conclusions and accusations are just pulled out of nowhere for convenience. Important points that come up later on just feel extremely forced, and the drama that occurs as well feels too melodramatic due to lack of time spent in the setting and characters. It's all just a very overall rushed and messy anime.\\n\\n\r\nI both give credit and displeasure towards the artwork of the anime. I give credit to them for staying true to the character designs, actions, and sprites that were in the game. But my displeasure leads towards both the overall animation and the executions. The studio, Lerche, is a studio that has done hardly any actual anime and their lack of budget is very obvious, especially in the early episodes. It's also noticeable when you realize that a lot of animated scenes in the game, the executions obviously, are just traced over. Literally. I mean, good, I'm glad you tried THAT hard to stay true to the game, but that's just lazy when you have to trace over this. Not to mention the entire anime feels far too.. game like. As if the studio didn't know if they were making an anime or a game with more movements.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is honestly a pretty generic rap song, and changes at odd times. The OST, while excellent in the game, doesn't seem to be as fitting in the anime? It's hard to describe, really, but it just doesn't feel right, though that could just be me. I do, however, appreciate all the VAs, namely Junko's, for their excellent job on the characters. The ED theme is also very well-done as well, and a very catch tune.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I'd find it very hard for one to genuinely enjoy Danganronpa if they haven't previously played the game. The immense flaws in the characters and storytelling is just so obvious, though then again if you're into just overall death game anime, then you may like this. Most of my enjoyment simply came from seeing all my favorite characters animated, though obviously if you haven't read the LP or played the game, you won't have that in it for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Danganronpa shows exactly what is wrong with game to anime adaptions - cut time for key things like the characters and plot can really break a show, especially one that relies purely on that. If I were to recommend Danganronpa to someone, I'd recommend the translated game or the Let's Play any day. If you've already watched the anime and happened to like it, definitely go for one of the following, because the depth it goes into is quite amazing. If you wanted more out of the anime, then again, go for the LP or game. It's actually coming out for PS Vita come 2014, so if you get the chance, perhaps even buy it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the end of the 13th episode hints at Super Danganronpa 2, the sequel to Danganronpa, being animated. Essentially, if this gets greenlit for an anime and is only 13 episodes and you're interested in it, don't bother. SDR2 can and will only work as 2-cour. I'd honestly recommend it either way since it answers many questions that Danganronpa had left behind.\\n\\n\r\nI sure as hell got my fill of despair from this, but not in the way I wanted to..",

            "content": "This review is based solely on the anime.\r\nFormer players of the murder mystery video game, Danganronpa: Academy of Hope and High School Students of Despair, are likely to find this adaptation as a disappointment with several changes or downgrades in the characters. Unfortunately, it does not differ much for someone who is unfamiliar with the game either. Danganronpa has an interesting plot with its dangerous game and potential to conduct an excellent thriller. However, you can imagine how well this murder mystery goes with only 13 episodes. Danganronpa\u2019s motive was to create a horrifying show with gruesome deaths, but it embarrassed itself with its unpleasantartwork. The rushed pacing left no room to learn about the characters or give them time to develop. With a complex game such as Danganronpa, 13 episodes was a bad idea and left many plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa started off on a good note, introducing the characters and the survival game to consist of one winner. The execution is poor. A murder case lasts only 2 episodes, so it doesn\u2019t hesitate in getting to the point or wastes time with sob stories from each character. Cases gets unbearably cheesy when the gullible and disinteresting male protagonist Naegi gains the spotlight by being the only one finding flaws in someone else\u2019s theory. Danganronpa drifts away from the horror aspect with occasional changes in the rules. They use fanservice as a distraction once the story actually gets serious. A downside for the viewers who are solely interested in discovering which student is clever enough to conduct a murder and get away with it are likely to be disappointed with the ending. Of course, with a murder mystery also comes relevant questions of the game\u2019s originality. This creates a rushed pacing in an attempt to answer every single question but leaves several plotholes and ridiculous outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of a menacing teddy bear named Monobear as the mastermind is not bad, considering that he proved himself to be a threatening individual. However, Danganronpa became less of a thriller as Monobear's personality occasionally became laidback and panicky. The high schoolers had diverse personalities, including a bipolar chick and the manliest looking girl, and the potential to be likeable characters. Sadly, Danganronpa reveals nothing about the characters besides their name and given nickname. Naegi even lacks any background, so his personality leaves him as no one but another clich\u00e9 male protagonist. Mainly all, except 2 or 3 side characters, are just there to die or be present as an investigator. The elimination of characters continues without revealing anything about them until the very last minute, and there is hardly any time to feel sympathy for the dead or understand a character's motives. This leaves some questions unanswered, causes disappointments from misleads, and creates a strong lack of character development. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is indeed unique but mostly awful. Most animation from game adaptations hide the fact they base from a game by fitting close to an anime as possible, but Danganronpa makes it extremely obvious with the arcade-animated scenes. Danganronpa supposedly is a horror. Admittedly, the combination of eerie music and sketched dead bodies makes it a bit terrifying, but how do they ruin it? Magenta blood. Slice the characters\u2019 bodies in half, and you\u2019ll find veins of playful colors. Also, the 3D elements could be cool, but it is more of a sneaky way to censor the deaths. No complaints about the character design, because it was really diverse and suited each character's personality.\\n\\n\r\nOddly, Danganronpa is the first anime I\u2019ve known to have a rap song as the OP. It\u2019s not bad, and the lyrics relate to the show quite well. The ending is an arcade song that is questionable. The seiyuu fit the anime perfectly as each character had their own personality. The characters were diverse and included a manly female, great detective, and a bipolar chick. The seiyuu did an excellent job portraying those characters, especially the one who played Monobear.\\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa could be a better show if it wasn\u2019t so rushed, paid more attention to the characters, and perhaps followed through with the game. I suggest watching it through the first murder case to decide whether you want to continue or not. Regardless, go into this with no high expectations or play the game as most game players suggested.",

            "content": "I like to play games. I mean, we all do once every while when we're bored right? The fun thing about games is not to only to kill time but also for achievements in some cases. When you win a game against someone, you get that feeling of pride knowing that you were better than your opponent. When you lose though, you might feel disappointment but also hoping to do better next time. But what if you're in a twisted game where there's no next time? What if you only get that one chance because if you lose, your life will end? Well, in DanganRonpa, you won't get another chance if you screw up. Your life is at stake and in order to graduate/win, you have to kill someone and get away with it. \\n\\n\r\nGoal: achieve a perfect murder.\\n\\n\r\nDangan Ronpa: The Animation is an anime adapted from the game of the same name. The game is a murder mystery visual novel. I have not played the game so this review will be judged based on from an anime perspective alone. And coming fresh from this series, Dangan Ronpa offers what it is based on its concept \u2013 a murder mystery story with twists and surprises.\\n\\n\r\nFor most part, the series is pretty straight forward. The initial episode introduced a variety of characters where each of them possesses a special talent of sorts. These ranges from talents such as lying, fortune telling, computer programming, or even the art of murder. One particular student stands out though because he doesn't possesses any special talent. In fact, he is invited to the school (Hope's Peak Academy) based on a raffle. His name is Makoto Naegi and he realizes his life is never ever going to be the same again. \\n\\n\r\nThe main premise of the series is to survive and escape the school. In order to do that, they have to commit the perfect murder. They must kill one of their classmates and get away it but that's a lot easier said than done. Of course, this spurs up a lot of tension and distrust among the students themselves as to who can be trusted. It's obvious though to suspect everyone and play safe but trusting no one. If you think the premise is twisted though, wait and till you meant the headmaster of the series. Its name is Monokuma (also known as the Monobear) and boy, he is someone that is shrouded in mystery. For starters, he has a very sarcastic personality. No one really knows what he says is true or not. However, the students of the academy quickly learns the hard way that his words are serious. In fact, this is proven by his dangerous powers to kill anyone on the spot. As a character full of mysteries, Monokuma plays the role of the primary antagonist as he enjoys the situations the students are in. His face also depicts a twisted like personality with one side being cute while the other side being disfigured. Furthermore, he has a tendency to uphold the laws of his game with absolute power as he is willing to kill others that breaks the rules or threatens his very existence. \\n\\n\r\nBecause there are 15 characters in this series, expect all of them to make their own spotlights. However, expect that number to go do down with each progressing character because of the premise. As fate knows it, there will be murders committed. Among its cast though, Naegi is the most average of them but also has the most guts and determination. Judging by his character, he is willing to help others and tries by any means to end this twisted game. \\n\\n\r\nAs the rules of the games go, you must commit a perfect murder to graduate. However, there is also a catch involving the classroom trials that proceeds each time a murder is committed. This is done in order for the characters to determine the culprit. If you guess right, the killer will be killed on the spot in a gruesome fashion. But hey, what if you guess wrong? Remember what I mentioned before about second chances? Well, that can go to hell because if you guess wrong, everyone else but the killer dies. It's a game that only our Monobear can think of to be this twisted. \\n\\n\r\nAmong the character casts, there are several students that makes their presence known more than others. Besides Naegi, there is the mysterious Kyouko Kirigiri. She comes off with a mysterious girl but a very intellectual mind combined with coolness and reasoning skills, she is one of the prominent members of the series. More importantly though, we can see that she also seems to form a close bond with Naegi even from the beginning. Other important characters include Byakuya Togami, an arrogant rich boy. Despite his attitude, he also possesses keen intellectual skills in problem solving. However, every character is part of the problem because every time someone is killed, there's someone to blame. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the problem solving goes, there are various hints dropped in here and there. This usually happens at the crime of the scene. Then, there's the class trials that proceeds the murders where arguments are ensured and accusations flies in the air. The murder themselves are always different and seems to be coupled with some sort of motive. These varies each time but the result is almost always the same \u2013 someone committed the deed and they will pay. But then of course, if the others guess wrong, they die themselves. It's literally a kill-or-be killed situation. While all this is going on, Monobear plays the fool. Man, talk about being a chill bear.\\n\\n\r\nBecause this is a mystery theme series, there are various twists and surprises. In particular, there is more than just meets the eye regarding the origins of the game. In fact, \u201cwho is Monobear?\u201d \u201cWho or what is the real mastermind pulling the strings?\u201d \u201cWas there anyone that successfully escaped years back before this graduation trial?\u201d There are many questions that I'm sure viewers will come up with their heads as the episodes progresses. The fun aspect of Dangan Ronpa is making theories based on hints. Then when the class trial comes, viewers will be able to figure out if they are either right or wrong. The experience here is thrilling because regardless of the result, you'll feel like being in the classroom itself. \\n\\n\r\nAs thrilling as Dangan Ronpa is, I do feel like some of the murders are a bit too easy to solve with the given clues. This is especially true in the beginning where some of the clues are ridiculously obvious. Then, there's the executions themselves that comes after the trials. From what I've known, the executions incorporates reused animation from the game rather than anything new. The execution itself may also seem brutal but it can also be taken hardly serious because of the animation style. I find the animation to be poorly constructed and out of place. Also, from what I understand, there are things that should have been adapted but left out. Through my experience of watching anime adapted from games, this is always bound to happen on occasions so don't expect everywhere there. After all, games are the superior brand of its anime adaptation. Furthermore, the length of only 12 episodes gives this show a case of cramping and rushing things through. There are also some cheesy dialogues with an underwhelming ending so don't push the expectations too high.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, Dangan Ronpa is like a crumbled cookie. It's like the chocolate is overbaked or something because the animation style is edgy and looks hardly realistic or to take seriously. Monobear is designed as a fusion of cuteness and psychotic. As far as the character designs go, they all do have an unique appearance. These match with their titles and personalities, some more ways than one as you will discover later on personally. One drawback I also found about the animation style is the murders. The blood is colored differently than what you may be used to and doesn't seem to be serious at all either. To me, it doesn't fit quite right.\\n\\n\r\nFor soundtrack, Dangan Ronpa executes an OST that mixes with rock, metal, and techno on occasions. There is a thrilling like feeling every time the soundtrack is played because viewers can tell that something big will happen. The OP songs are also artistic with the montages of the characters. On the other hand, the ED song provides a glance of the characters of every episode. Voice acting wise, Kirigiri's VA Yoko Hikasa plays her role quite well with her calm personality. In fact, she is always seen as being level headed and her voice tone is a good reflection of that. Monobear himself also has a voice full of sarcasm and cruel intentions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Dangan Ronpa can be received differently depending on how you will enjoy this. As a viewer coming directly fresh into this, I did enjoy some aspects of it. However, there are times when I find the murder to be quite predictable along with the way being handled sort of out of place. What Dangan Ronpa brings though is the thrilling experience of finding out the culprit behind the murders. As the episodes progresses, more and more mysteries are unlocked where they might come as unexpected. For me, some of the expectations I had for this series were met while others I had were met with mixed results. Like I said before though, Dangan Ronpa is a mystery theme series with touches of psychological and horror. Therefore, it can be received differently for everyone. However, if there's one thing that we all share in equal, it is death.",

            "content": "Yadda yadda, first review, bluh bluh. \r\nA group of teenagers, each of them exceeding in their own field, be it sports, programing or leading an outlaw biker gang, get locked up in an elite school with no obvious way to escape, except one: Kill a fellow student and don't get caught. An interesting take of the snowed-in-in-a-mountain-cabin trope and good set up for a murder mystery. Or is it? \r\nDanganronpa was based on a game of the same name. Since the game was a success which spawned a sequel and huge, dedicated fanbase, it was only natural to cash in on it. Ananime is a nice way to do so. While I do understand that converting one medium of storytelling into another is not a copy-and-paste process, I can't help it but to compare those two. The game was awesome. The show, less so. Why is that? A few reasons which boil all down to the same problem: the show only has 13 episodes. Let me elaborate: \\n\\n\r\nWhile the story itself is captivating and interesting (even if sometimes over the top) and the characters sympathetic and, more or less, not cardboard cutouts of certain stereotypes, none of them is given the time to breathe and develop. Every single story arc gets compressed into 2 episodes: the murder and detective work getting down, and the school trial, an event in which the boys and girls need to determine who the murderer is. The game got a good balance between those two. Every arc is a few hours long, allowing the player to build social contacts, get to know the cast, investigate the crime scene and have a debate in which the murderer is uncovered. Many of those things do not happen or happen in a very compressed form because of the limited time the show has. The result is that the viewer does not get to know the characters and has no chance to connect with them, the investigation part is reduced to a few minutes of listing the evidence, and a, sadly in many cases, too short episode to find the culprit. It gets confusing and leaves a general feeling of something missing. That's all I have to say about the differences between those two. Lets talk anime-only. \\n\\n\r\nIgnoring there was a source material we've got a cast of throwaway characters of whom the majority only serves to be killed of. The story and its creative setting are captivating, but do not get enough time to leave an impact. I seriously can not stress enough how little time this show has to develop it's story and characters. The animation is pretty weak and not up-to-date with other anime. The soundtrack is good (*cough*keeptfromthegame*cough*). \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have no idea who this anime was targeted towards. Fans of the game will only get quick reminder of the experience they had with it, people who would want to play it will get spoiled without enjoying the \"whole\" story, and people who are just in it for the lulz will get a mediocre murder mystery with terrible pacing. Should fans of detective anime watch this? Yes if you want a general idea of the events but can not or do not want to play the game. No if you want a good ride for your money (and time). There are better mysteries out there like Death Note (obviously), Monster, Another, Ergo Porxy and (the very lengthy) Detective Conan (aka Case Closed).\\n\\n\r\n6/10, would only recommend to fans of the game.",

            "content": "Okay, before you press the \"Not Helpful\" button after seeing my rating, realize this: I haven't played the game. This is a review from a watcher who thinks of this as just a regular anime, not a game adaptation. And, as someone who didn't play the game, I think it's a anime worth watching. Let me explain:\r\nStory: 8\r\nIt's a really creative, well adapted version of the \"Last man standing\" plotline, which seems more clich\u00e9 than it actually is. I personally really like the idea; when someone gets murdered everyone has to crack the case together and if that culprit gets found out, he/she dies too.The story revolves around 15 teenagers who are invited to attend Hope's Peak Academy, ad when they step inside, all they can feel is despair when they discover that their principal is  sadistic, moving and talking Black and White Teddy Bear that goes by the name of Monobear, (or Monokuma). He instructs the students that this is all a test. Only one student is allowed to leave the school and that's the one that manages who doesn't get found out as a culprit or just manages to survive until the end. I loved the whole idea and personally, I love animes that mess with your head like this, because you NEVER know who the culprit is going to be or what is going to happen next. The only thing is that some of the elements were really confusing, and it takes a while to process what's happening, but overall, it's a really great idea. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a great transition between different art styles. From time to time, it switches from the normal expected art style and an urban vintage type art style, and thought it really enhanced the mood of a dramatic plot point. It was really unexpected and surprisingly relevant. I've never ever seen an anime hat does something like that, EVER. And I would highly recommend it to other animes in the future. Also, the effects during the anime, especially during the class trials, were really good and different from anything I've ever witnessed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt was pretty good, the transitional soundtrack and also the opening. I love how the opening was westernized into a rap, American song. It was really original ad I liked it. It was unexpected and fit the rest of the anime really well. I mean, it's nothing to sparkle at and listen twice to, but it was really original. The transitional music tracks were placed very well. I like the soundtracks in the Class Trials, it added suspense and put a mysterious twist on the plot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nOf course, with 15 teenagers, there were going to be ones I hated and ones I liked, but I didn't really necessarily \"hate\" any of the characters. In fact, I really like the mix of different design and personalities that made up of the group; from a multi-personality freak, to a body builder monster woman, Danganronpa covers it all. I really liked the main character; though, he turns kind of cheesy in the ending, but totally worth it right? Of course, the mix of personalities is what the anime really had going for it. Each character had their own tag, their own extreme personality that got them into the school in the first place. It really added effect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed the whole mix of the different elements that each added some originality to the anime. I couldn't look away from the screen, it was so worth watching it.\\n\\n\r\nEnding: 8 (I won't give any spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nI know from experience that an ending can really ruin the anime. It's happened millions of times and that's why I'm really scared to watch the ending of Shingeki no Kyojin today... but that aside, I'm going to tell you what I thought of the ending. There is so much of a plot twist that you yourself hurt your brain by watching it, but that's not always a bad thing. I mean, Danganronpa puts the ending together really well, so well in fact, that it will get you banging your head against your desk for a week.  I mean, there's slight cheese, but it's not overwhelming like in SAO. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed watching it. It really put me on the edge of my seat and gave me chills with all of its beautifully executed elements. I would definitely recommend this to a close friend, or anyone to that matter! I believe this anime is really underrated and needs to be recognized. Right now, everything is buried in the shadow of Shingeki no Kyojin, but I'm telling you, it's a fantastic anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n",

            "content": "Here is a very basic rule of thumb that all animation studios should have learned by 2015: \"Just because something worked as a video game, doesn't necessarily mean it will work as a show!\"\r\nDanganronpa was a successful video game because it had goofy characters, decent comedy, and allowed the player to think and solve mysteries. The story and characters weren't very deep or well developed, but it didn't matter because the entire point was for the player to actively solve the puzzle. A TV show is largely a passive form of entertainment in which the viewer is not controlling the events and using skills tosolve a puzzle. That is why the quality of characters and writing needs to be higher in order to make a good show vs. a good game. Tetris is a great game without having any plot or characters to speak of, but it would SUCK as a TV show! \\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise is that a bunch of students are trapped in a highschool and manipulated into killing each other off. The students need to figure out who trapped them there and who is killing everyone. Basically they just lifted the plot and premise from an old Agatha Christie novel. Although this worked well for \"And Then There Were None\", it doesn't work out NEARLY as well here. One of the reasons is that the same \"trick\" used by Christie to throw off readers on who the true killer was actually was shocking and original in 1939, but really NOT in 2014. I don't want to completely spoil it, but if you have read the original novel you are not going to be surprised when the killer is revealed. The other reason Danganronpa fails is that the characters are all ANNOYING AS FUCK! I am dead serious when I say that MonoKuma is one of the single most annoying characters in anime history! In a videogame, a character can be REALLY annoying and players simply tolerate it. This goes all the way back to 1985 and that damned Duckhunt Dog! However, in a TV show it really isn't acceptable to have so many annoying characters with so much screen time! \\n\\n\r\nIt hardly helps matters that the animation in this show is dreadful and the CGI death sequences are so shitty looking you would rather die the death onscreen than have to watch it! I think Oregon Trail had better death cinematics than this piece of shit!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nPopular videogames being made into unbearably shitty anime is a trend that really should stop for the good of the anime industry. The ONLY positive thing I will say about Danganronpa is that it is better than another recent cell phone game adaptation: Vampire Holmes!",

            "content": "Danganronpa - KNGTZNK - The Animation (I KNOW!) is a weird anime. Not because he it pinkish blood, or it feels as if you're flying with Enterprise within the distance of a small country or anything alike - it's just weird. \r\nTo put it off my chest, I loved first 4-5 episodes. They really hit the point with me since I love the detective stories. They were well executed, they actually had SOLID pacing (I KNOW!) and weren't as ... well, as bad as the rest of them. As for the rest of them, they suck - flat out suck.\r\nThe story of Danganronpa is simple- you have sixteen (fifteen) students stuck in a school and only one of them will graduate. How? By killing others and not being found guilty, of course. The anime instantly opens the question of moral, self-indulgence and various other things concerning oneself in regards to others. We have a large range of characters, and a great setting. The rest is simple: some drama and dialogue, murder, investigation and trial - hence and repeat. No, seriously. The story skyrockets in speed in the last five episodes. You are constantly being fed enormous amount of information and you don't know whether you're supposed to remember or not. And the last two episodes (especially the last) ... oh gosh ... think of it as the entire Sauske/Itachi arc done in one and a half episode. Yep. \\n\r\nAll in all, story is half-assed at best. It opens solidly and creates decent foundation, but then is skips through itself so quickly you forget what the hell is actually happening. It has no tools other than constant, constant, CONSTANT, boring dialogue and monologue to resolve all the questions, so yeah. \\n\\n\r\nThe saving graces of this anime are probably art and sound, and even they are not great. Art itself is nothing special; animations can sometimes (often) be so stiff you can barely look at them. Not to mention 5 minutes of talking where no one moves a limb. Eyes blinking and mouths opening and closing. Yeah. However, animation somewhat shines during the executions; they're quite well done, all unique in their own ways, flashy and disturbing of course. However, what killed the art for me was that bloody, pinkish blood. I detest the censorship, especially in anime where blood actually matters. Executions seemed as unicorns taking a crap rather than bodies being mutilated and dismembered in the most awful ways. Characters designs are also quite good, I might add. All characters look fresh, unique and distinguishable enough. It's their personalities that make you forget about them. As far as the sound goes, music is your standard tense stuff which is actually not half-bad. The voice actors vary; even in the last episode, I still couldn't stand the MC's voice, but it's just me. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the character department. Considering there are sixteen (fifteen) students, and thirteen episodes, you know it's going to be a train-wreck. Only two characters receive mild development (Kirigiri & Naegi) but not in the true sense. From the very first episode, they all have established personalities and they stick to them (well, Nagei kind of receives a new one by the end). There are two or three interesting character, including the bear (which is probably the most interesting) and the psycho-killer-schizophrenia-amnesic-catastrophe. Kirigiri will be okay for some people, but I found her character ... just plain boring. The characters are not memorable. Let alone their names. Not that you even bother to remember, or need to remember. Just ... bad characters overall.\\n\\n\r\nIn the enjoyment department, for the first 5 episodes, I give this anime 10. For the last 6 episodes, I give it 0. And we find in the middle. First two-three cases are relatively fun, but the formula quickly runs out. And then they tip of a twist which just couldn't make any sense unless they pulled out some really weird crap (which they did) but hey, I lived through it. The anime has A LOT of twists. Are they good? Some of them. However, after the number of people clears up a bit, it's rather easy to predict who killed whom, and even that mystery aspect kind of disappears. And then the last two episodes. Complete and utter train wreck. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I hated the most about Danganronpa are those last five episodes. Up until then, HOPE and DESPAIR were never found in the same sentence and were mentioned once or twice in an episode. But then writers took some acid and decided to go nuts. They invented a new drinking game. Whenever you hear the words HOPE and DESPAIR in the same sentence in the last 5-6 episodes, take a shot. You won't live through one. For some reason, the writers decided to go full-out-pretentious (never go full-out-pretentious) and not in a good way. They constantly kept throwing around the subjects such as despair and hope, and characters (especially MC) kept giving the old same speeches how \"... as long as I can hope,  I can change the world with my hope ...\" (yea, I'm looking at you Naruto) and you just want to close your eyes and forget you're watching it because you're embarrassed. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend Danganronpa? Well, unless you're sucker for extremely fast paced anime with so many plot twists that will make your head twist (and not in a good way), go for it. However, it is obvious that this anime needed far more than 13 episodes. Even someone who never played the game realizes that.",

            "content": "Boy, oh boy. This is a rather short anime so I decided to dedicate time to watch it. While I wouldn't say it was a mistake, given the chance, I would rather not have seen it at all.\r\nThe story is interesting indeed, especially people who are suckers for mysteries like me. It's based on a video game of the same name, however, this adaptation managed to do so many things wrong and its main failure lies in the lack of time for development.\r\nThe class trials were just really poorly executed. 1-2 episodes per trial (including the crime, the investigation and the trial itself in thatshort a span) just doesn't cut it. The twists came off so suddenly, without any prior build-up and just comes off as poorly-done. What's the point of creating a mystery if you don't give the audience a chance to even formulate their own theories?\\n\\n\r\nI found the characters lacking as well. Given that this was a show featuring extreme characters, they weren't really quite made to be realistic. Yet we weren't given a chance to see them grow, to even /see/ how they are. When they died, I mostly just went \"oh, okay\" because I didn't manage to form an emotional attachment to anyone. I especially wish the main character could have been given more well-rounded, seeing as how we were watching the story from his point of view. We just didn't know anything about him and yet we had to trust him as there was no other way to watch it. Aside from Kirigiri, no one else was molded to be a somewhat three-dimensional character. The way the show portrayed the characters, no one was very memorable except maybe for Monobear and Kirigiri.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to the anime's credit, atleast there's the soundtrack and art. The seiyuus were mostly all right, but the one who voiced Monobear deserves praise. The rest wasn't quite as notable but the music was intense and gave way to tension that wouldn't even be existent without it.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork, though a bit... unique, gave the anime the vibe it should have. I found the purple blood to be a nice touch. Details were on the spot and I thought the angularness and thick lines were perfect. The character designs were very particular. The animation of the executions was also a wonderful touch, it gave the scenes a stranger, trippier, more intense feel. Danganronpa wouldn't even be half the anime it was without the very original art. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, I don't think anyone would be satisfied with how it ended up. Original fans from the game would be pissed at the poor adaptation, new viewers would just be confused with what /exactly/ is going on (I sure was). If the anime could have been extended up to, say, 25 episodes to give way to character development then I'm pretty sure this could have ended up great but the way it is now just leaves a gigantic room for improvement.",

            "content": "This is based solely on this awful adaption, not the game.\r\nNow, I've said this before and I'll say it again, I love Battle Royale premises. What I don't like is when the concept is completely butchered with poor characters, art and predictableness.\r\nThe story gets a 7, mostly because I'm just generous towards anything that involves a bunch of people that have to kill each other in order to survive. It takes place in a school where the characters are told by a cute little bear that they have to kill each other and then hold trials to try to guess who the kill was. Ifthey get it right, the killer dies. If they get it wrong, they all die except the killer.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give the story props for being different in that regard, but honestly, it was done very poorly. The rules and the 'motivation' to kill the others were stupid, and I don't see why the characters were dumb enough to actually kill anyone. The trial scenes were the same with the main character always figuring out who it was. The way it was executed was laughable, as were the death scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace was rushed. It became formulaic and boring, as I didn't care who died since the characters were just there to die anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art (4), well, it looked bad and out of place. Most of the character designs were horrifying and everything looked like it was copied and pasted from a game (OH WAIT, it was). And what I can't over look is the fact that the blood was pink. PINK. It looked ridiculous. The deaths of the killers after the trials also looked funny and out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was alright. I liked the opening and ending songs, but they weren't anything special. Within the anime, there weren't any soundtracks that stuck out. Mediocre at best. 5.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is where this show really suffers. They were introduced lamely and had one-dimensional, generic personalities. The main character, Naegi, was the worst, being your typical no personality character. The same goes for Kirigiri, who was supposed to be 'mysterious' but at the end of the day wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nMonobear wasn't scary at all. I don't know why they decided to give him that voice, but it wasn't threatening, it was lame. So was his pathetic excuse of an explosion in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe main villain and the ending was a surprise, I didn't see it coming. That being said, it would have been nice to see what it was like outside the school.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I didn't care who died or who did the killing because the characters were so one-dimensional. They all could have died, for all I care. 2, because of how awful they were handled.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I feel bad for the game, because I've heard it was great. Unfortunately, the anime was atrocious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment was a 4, mostly because of the premise and the ending, which was the only thing that wasn't predictable. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Just walk away. Run if you have to.",

            "content": "I mean... seriously? Everyone's talking about how the show is bad compared to the game and so on but this is just painfully mediocre in it's own right.\r\nThe bad: \r\n- The animation? Not a fan. I mean some might like the 3D-ish elements, but for me it was just painful to watch. In addition to the execution segments the 3D stuff just felt out of place and completely unnecessary. To be honest I didn't like the art style either. \r\n- A word about music. I usually find most anime OPs quite amusing or interesting even if they don't suit my musical preference. This OP (andending tbh) were pretty bad. Nothing worth noticing about either of the tracks. Just filler music to spend 1.5 minutes of air time that COULD be spent on char. development.\\n\\n\r\n- The way the trials were set up didn't really work for me either. The whole verbal bullets thing seemed childish and although I'll admit that it was interesting to listen to the thought process at times overall it was quite boring.\\n\\n\r\n=== ENDING SPOILERS IN THE NEXT BULLETPOINT ===\\n\r\n- The characters are totally undercooked. People have said this time and again and I will agree with them. The story either doesn't fit the format of a show when comparing to a game or just needed more time, because we never shown what some of the characters actually do or are good at. Some of them just appear and disappear 2-3 episodes after that without any character development what-so-ever.\\n\r\n=== END OF SPOILER ===\\n\\n\r\nThe ... good?:\\n\\n\r\n- I'm a sucker for a good mystery so this kind of thing had me caught up in the story despite the show itself being bad. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest there probably are tons of shows worth watching instead of Danganronpa so... just do that, I guess.",

            "content": "Ping, pong, pang, pong....... As I make this review,1st thing is 1st, I haven't played the video game yet, then again such game would cost a fortune here in Mexico and I haven't yet read both the manga and the light novel yet, so for this review, I'm only gonna base it for this anime and this anime only. Por qu\u00e9 todos ustedes entiendan, muchachos? Bueno, bueno, let get down and dirty, so far this is another very good anime for this season,  despite of the spoilers available in MAL and other anime site info, it didn't affect my desire to watch and beamuse as to how the mystery and the deception unfolds with the students of Kib\u014dgamine Gakuen, thought there are question abound as to what's the concept of such school be conceive, it really doesn't matter at all. if I were to compared this with it's western counterpart the closes it would be is \"The Cube\" were both involves people trapped in such confined place where everything is a puzzle that every individual has to figure out in order to get out, but unlike the movie 'The Cube,\" in Danganronpa the group of individual enjoy comfortable amenities and knows who the adversary is despite the fact that the said adversary is using a disguise, but what really make it enjoyable despite of the spoilers is how the anime was presented ok so never mine about the pink blood and the not so gruesome murder of the victims  and the over-elaborate execution of the guilty, the real enjoyment was knowing how the mastermind  (despite of the spoiler) did it and given that she's to be found out how will she react. Frankly, on the last episode I was kinda hoping that Junko is gonna be up to something to escape her own execution or does something to make the escape of the final six a bit more difficult, so my ratings for this 13 episode anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory, enjoyment, overall: Good 8\\n\\n\r\nexplanation already provided, above.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Poor 3,\\n\\n\r\nI give such score since the characters illustration doesn't match the anime's concept, also, the execution, character's attire, murder and background are just too over-elaborate, thought this anime should use a little bit of Junko, Kirigiri and Sayaka fanservice. About Sakura, I would have prefer that this series' illustrator would have made her a he or make her a hot babe rather than an bulky FBB who pumps themselves with steroids.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair 6. \\n\\n\r\nFor the op and ed- me not likey, but, for the Monobear, the one who did its voice was very compelling to say the least too bad that Junko's VA wasn't able to do it properly. Then again, the way Junko delivered her lines in the final episode was pretty awesome and so as Genocider Syo.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI would have given it an 8, but the fact that Mukuro Ikusaba's roles was too brief, should limit this part to a 7. Then again, it ain't that bad, since it was Naegi and Kirgiri who gave this anime the most impact and the 2 are the only ones who kept the group together even is there are times along this anime's episodes that they have to the escapegoats. Also, Monobear, really did play a good role foe being the antagonist in this anime, also I like the way that Junko (I'm referring to the real one) who came out on the last episode as this psychotic despair spreading freak dish out her freakish side and the way she tries to use deception and manipulation as a last attempt to escape execution in the last episode, though, she could have done it in a much a more easier way, then again, I'm thinking if this anime will have a season 2, I won't be surprise if she faked her own execution. As for the others, like Aoi, I really hate the fact that she's moire of a lucky bimbo than anything else, Yasuhiro, on the other hand was merely useless in fact I can never understand why a fortune teller like him can't predict any of the student's future nor was he able to foretold who is behind Monobear, Touko or Genocider Syo, was pretty useless as well, she more of a comic relief than a fearsome serial killer. Togami, is another character that contributes to this anime's overall impact, but, I see him as this play safe character, who's pretty much does everything to keep himself away from the bubble.\\n\\n\r\nThe end, muchachos.",

            "content": "It is known fact that if you make an anime/movie adaptation off a video game , it will never be as successful as the video game itself, given that it has the same content and story. Video games allow you to experience and make your own decisions, which is not an option in movies/anime. Infact, many innovators actually believe that decision making video games MAY replace movies in the future (If you've played \u201cLife is Strange\u201d, you\u2019d agree with this fact).\r\nAnyhow, before you read any further, if you oppose this anime solely due to it not being able to live up to its video gamecounterpart, I advise you to piss off. I'll write this review based solely on the anime itself, and will not compare it to the game (Not like I've played the game anyways).\\n\r\nNow for the anime itself. I started watching this anime, not expecting too much from it. As I finished watching episode 1, I was thinking of dropping it. But I must admit, shit got real from then on. Everything that happened had my full attention. And before I knew it, I had been indulged into it.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf I am to keep it spoiler free, I'd say that the story is very average to start with. It only gets interesting after the first murder. Since I haven't watched like 500 Anime series to be writing this review, the story was interesting for me. It kept me really really curious as to who the murderer might be. Some Mystery series fail to keep audiences curious (won\u2019t mention them here).

Which I think were nabbed off of the video game (?), since it was pure CGI.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nAll and all, its an 7 for me because I love Mystery anime.",

            "content": "Danganronpa is a series I wanted to like more. It's by no means terrible. The story is interesting, some of the characters do have the potential to grow on viewers even if they're unfamiliar with the source material, and it manages to build up a serious level of excitement around each individual trial. Furthermore it has unique style which reminds the viewers of it's origins as a game. This is both one of it's greatest strengths as well as it's greatest weakness. While it lends itself to a distinct atmosphere and helps maintain a sense of energy that persists throughout the series which prevents onefrom feeling the whole show is dragging along. Some of the visual cues are neat in their own right. Yet, at the same time, it feels too much like one is watching a video game. While not a \"formulaic\" show per se, it lends itself to feeling strangely mechanical and predictable from time to time. This can also take the viewer out of the action so to speak. For people unfamiliar with Danganronpa this aspect can be irritating where it may have been intended to appeal to fans of the game. Some scenes appear as if they were torn directly from the source.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the fact that this series is heavily rushed. A lot of characterization, character development,  and plot elements that the source material had time to flesh out are often barely touched upon, rushed, or outright excluded. This lends Danganronpa to feeling a little sloppy and it shows. While the source material may not have aimed for hyper realism, this unfortunately makes some scenes and important reveals feel utterly ridiculous and absurd in ways that only serve to hurt it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the opening song. It's not bad but the lyrics some times seem like who so ever wrote it was trying too hard to make it related back to the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side, the plot is more-a-less faithfully adapted. No major liberties are taken with what is overall, a fairly well written story. The art style is pretty decent. At it's best moments it can be pretty damn fun to watch. Even if the execution sequences do like they were taken right from the game, they do make for an entertainingly absurd bit of dark comedy.  What character development made it in was fairly well handled and most of the cast ends up being fairly likable.  Just like the game that spawned it, Danganronpa has a sense of style even if it's not handled as well as it could be. Most of the voice cast (at least with the Japanese language version) does a decent job.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it's more interesting than the average series, fans will probably enjoy it more than someone totally unfamiliar with the franchise. While I would not hesitate to call it a good series, it suffers in some significant ways from time constraints and stylistically clinging too close to it's source even as it uses this very same element to elevate itself in other aspects.",

            "content": "Before I start this review I want to make something very clear, I am NOT analyzing the adaption part of this anime, what I will try to do in the next lines is view this a anime as a something on its own, I will not compare it to the original work in any way, therefore this review is more guided towards people that have not played the original game.\r\nThat being said lets move on, shall we ?\r\nDanganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei - The Animation, or Danganronpa, or even DR for shorts, its a mystery/investigation anime, in which the main plot isas it follows : Several students with unique characteristcs are invited to join a private school, once they get there they discover they are locked in there and the only way to get out is to kill one of their classmates without being discovered by the remaining classmates as the killer, all this is orchestred by the main mind behind this sick \"game\", a fellow that goes by the name of \"Monokuma\" and only comunicates with the students by using mechanical teddy bears.\\n\\n\r\nSounds at least interesting right ? And in fact it is, the story itself is one of the major good points about DR, besides the \"weekly\" or so mystery of a student assasination, and therefore finding the culprit for such assasination, there is also the main mystery surrounding Monokuma and the reason the students are locked down in the school... I confess that I, personally, found the answer for both these question to be satifasctory (as well for most of the murder cases), but of course this can vary from person to person.\\n\\n\r\nNow, lets talk about the major down point in DR, the Art. Here is where i thouhgt a bit more of care could have taken place. Dont get me wrong, I dont think the art is bad per say, but in this current generation is possible to make a much prettier anime with just a bit more care to details, color pallete, and that kind of stuff. Also, pink blood ? Seriously ? \\n\r\nWell at least at a good side i can point out, the execution sequences, that were really good, and \"artistic\", and also most of the character design... pretty original and good looking, specially Junko and Ishimaru\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the Sound... Here i I thought once again Dr did a pretty good job, the soundtrack during investigations and trials are really good and catchy, the kind that will stuck in your head for a whole day.\\n\r\nThe OP's were ok, nothing flashy, but nothing terrible either, and I really enjoyed the main ED (episode 1-12), really great song, cheerful wich usually generated a nice contrast with the almost ever dark and tense episodes endings.\\n\\n\r\nIn the character segment DR did pretty good as well, with a few cliches of course (Naegi, Togami, etc), but nowadays i highly doubt anyone can find one anime (or movie/tv show for that matter) that does not have at least one cliche character. To be quite honest, with this many characters I was expecting a much larger number of cliche types, but then again i was happily surprised to see that most of them has actually a pretty cool background and personality (I am not going to cite names here becuase I dont want to give possible spoilers). If I have any complains at all here, is that some of the characters had too little screen time, I would love to see some more action of them, and some times the development felt a little rushed... nothing major thouhg. Could a larger number of episodes solved these problems ? Probably yes, but I will take what I can get.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great plus on DR resum\u00e9 is definetly the enjoyment. The sense of immersion on this show is fantastic, and trying to figure out who is the culprit in each murder case is truly awesome. Of course the script does not make it easy for the viewer, if you really want to get to the correct answer before the next episode it will take a LOT of time and thinking, and most of all attention to the minimun details. Doesnt sound so fun right ? Thats why I believe the focus in this anime is another, the anime does not want you to find out who is the culprit, you dont have to. What it wants you to do is have crazy guesses and theories, do not try to have fun by analyzing every bit of evidence, its not your job to do that, the anime will give you the answer in the next episode no matter what. Have fun by taking the wildest guess you can think of until then ! Its like in a movie or tv show, you are not supposed to know who the culprit is before the script tells you, you just sit back and enjoy the ride. If you can do that, I assure you the anticipation to find out who is the culprit will be great. Oh and PLEASE DO NOT LOOK UP FOR SPOILERS ! I think this is pretty much mandatory in  mystery animes, but still its always good to remember.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Danganronpa is a good anime, and a pleasant surprise of last season. If you are looking for a nice mystery with interesting characters look no futher, you have found it. Its not a perfect anime (hell,its far from it) but its a great ride and it will probably hook you up until the end.",

            "content": "This is the perfect example of a video game adaptation done wrong. Trying to fit in about 25 hours of material into 13 episodes is NOT a good idea, unless you want an extremely rushed show with very flat characters. It is horrible.\r\nThe story was actually pretty decently adapted. While it was rushed, nothing very important was omitted. However, I have some issues with the investigations. How do you expect anime watchers to identify the culprit if the most important part in mystery solving is rushed in about 3 minutes? Rushed investigations also made it seem like Kirigiri and Naegi were pulling things out oftheir asses during trials.\\n\\n\r\nThat is another thing : class trials. There were 13 people in the first class trial. Everyone had to speak at least once, right? So, once again, the actual mystery solving part was rushed. Though, as the show went on, there were fewer students, so the trials did not feel as rushed (chapter 4 and chapter 5's trials are the best examples.) Still, this just proves 13 episodes only was not enough.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the art. The character design is very odd, but it makes the characters look colorful and very different from one another! You could pretty much tell who had what talent just by looking at their appearance. Komatsuzaki Rui really has not dropped the ball design-wise.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the animation quality was quite subpar. Some episodes had okay animation, some terrible. The amount of stills also hurts, but it is acceptable. Generally, class trials had good animation, but the rest (investigation and the pre-investigation segments) took a huge hit. \\n\\n\r\nI like how they kept Monokuma's small quirks in the background, though. Like eating pancakes after a particular execution.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing is the soundtrack. Composed by Takada Masafumi, the music is very catchy and really sets in the mood in most scenes. A prime example is the song named \"DISTRUST\" playing during big revelations, absolutely perfect! I don't dislike the OP theme, but the game's is way better. The ED, however, is pretty awesome. Personally, I love the 8-bit part at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very well done, as expected of big name seiyuus. Monokuma's especially is perfect for the role.\\n\\n\r\nNow here comes the bad part of the anime, and the main reason why I did not enjoy the show as many as I thought I would : character. In the game, characters are mainly developed by hanging out with them. As you hang out with them, you learn more about them. That is where they get development, and since the anime completely skips hanging out, there is nearly no character development for the whole cast, with the exception of Kirigiri, Togami and, to some degree, Naegi. This is a bad thing because when a character dies, it is hard to feel anything because you could not get attached to them. And that makes some twists feel pretty underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the Danganronpa anime had a few good things about it, but it was severely crippled by a lack of character development and a very limited number of episodes. And that is why I did not enjoy the anime very much.",

            "content": "\"You've got that wrong!\"\r\nFirst off, if you detest/abhor/dislike this anime, read no further. I've just seen many overly-negative reviews and wanted to have an alternate opinion available for anyone who needs one. This is also a very naive review, as I've never played the game, nor have heard of its popularity, so expectations were average.\r\nOh god, what am I getting myself into?\r\nThe setting of Danganronpa has to be one of the strangest. A despair-filled high school where you have to butcher your classmates to \"graduate?\" Not going to lie, I thought this probably wasn't going to be the greatest of shows...\r\n\"You've got that wrong!\"\r\nBut howso, Naegi?\\n\\n\r\n\"The people around me and the events that occur are very peculiar, but interesting!\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. Ahh, I see now. So the characters are extremely unique (and contrast each other perfectly), I mean, a Super Duper High School Level Wrestler that looks like a body-building man but is really a girl?! My brain was surprised and I'd imagine it started seeping out of my nose. But nonetheless, the characters (obviously) really made the show for me. Not a single character in the show can be labeled, by me, a bad character. Hell, I might just start a new list for Most Hated Characters just because of Monokuna. So I think it's safe to say that you'll enjoy the characters.\\n\\n\r\nConsistency: 7/10. Alright, this is the one thing that got on my nerves. The series did tend to be quite episodic at times and left important information out as well. That was a big downer for me as well, because to me, the series could've been almost nearly perfect if it didn't just drop information. However, I do understand that this was a seasonal anime, a Summer seasonal to be exact, so there really wasn't a way to break out of 12-13 episodes. Long story short, this anime would've been awesome if it was a few episodes longer to include all the information.\\n\\n\r\n\"But remember, there's always some other great things that we have as well. Trust me, I'm a fortune-teller.*wink*\"\\n\\n\r\nThank you for the information and for creeping me out, Yasuhiro. But this holds true as well. For example: Mystery! The mystery in this series is absolutely top-notch and very invigorating (and this is coming from a HUGE Higurashi no Naku Koro ni fan), and almost always kept me anxious and nervous until they were solved. The prime example of this was the Classroom Trials, which was the highlight of the series for me. Sure, some of them were rushed, but quite honestly, who cares?! It was so exciting when I saw the elevator descending to the Classroom Trials room. The folowing debate would be very interesting, and was extremely interesting to see how each student used evidence to support themselves and to attack others. I must say, it was a bunch of fun.\\n\\n\r\n\"You've got that wrong! Those trials were always difficult and were almost always put on my shoulders!\" \\n\\n\r\nTrue, Naegi, but that bullet thing you did was always really cool.\\n\\n\r\n\"Uhhh, thanks....I guess...\"\\n\\n\r\nOkay, stop interrupting me, I'm trying to write a review.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one more complaint I have of this series. The constant 'yadda yadda Despair blah Despair-filled bluh bluh Despair' dialogue was WAY overused, and it's very evident near the end. I mean, my god, I understand this is about despair, it's in the freaking title! The show just crammed that down my throat until I felt that was the only word I knew anymore. However, I did feel like I was reading a well-drafted essay, because I noticed a sequential tone structure, with a very strong tonal shift. Although this might not be very useful for anyone nor will you care,but I thought it was worth mentioning in case others noticed it as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere's one more thing I'd like to cover: Sound: 9/10\\n\r\nVA's 10/10: The voice actors in this series seemed like they were MOLDED to be perfect for each character. I couldn't see any character any other way. Even at first, I couldn't stand Monokuna's voice, but it grew on me fairly quickly. You could play any character's voices and I could deduce them almost immediately, they are THAT distinct.\\n\\n\r\nOST: 9/10: I can't believe I'd ever love a rap song, but TKDz2b hit the tone of Danganronpa write on with \"Never Say Never.\" I will admit, I did NOT expect an English rap song to come on when I started it (and there were no accents, even a bigger surprise), and I immediately fell in love with it. Takada Masafumi \\n\r\nalso created a great soundtrack for this anime (I mean, he DID get chosen to do music composition for Super Smash Bros. Brawl) and the mood was always enhanced when the music started up. The ED (Episode 13's was great), however, didn't really do it for me. It contrasted with the feel of the series (somewhat like \"Torch\" from Clannad: After Story), so it was a slight mood killer, but it wasn't too bad, because it was still a great song.\\n\\n\r\n\"You've got that right!\"\\n\\n\r\nWow, you feeling okay Naegi? That's the first time I've heard you agree!\\n\\n\r\n\"I just express my emotions enthusiastically and raw.\"\\n\\n\r\n...that gave me a weird image. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. Yes, I loved this series. I had a great time and an exciting time watching it. If it was slightly longer and didn't try to implant the word \"Despair\" on me and shove it down my esophagus, I would've loved it just that much more. \\n\\n\r\nYet again, this is completely my opinion, so please don't take any of my ramblings too hard. I also won't go over the story because everyone will have contrasting beliefs on it, so there really is no point.\\n\\n\r\nThank you Naegi and Yasuhiro for the commentary on my review. Now get out of here and live on in despair.\\n\\n\r\n\"Uncool, man. Uncool.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhatever Yasuhiro.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Note: I watched the last 7 episodes while having a high fever and it made me feel a lot better by just watching it, so this may have a slightly higher score than it would've, but, I digress. \\n",

            "content": "I think it should be a general rule that if you're going to adapt any type of game, that you cannot make it 1-cour. If Danganronpa isn't a prime example of this rule, than I don't know what is.\r\nBeing a fan of the game, I was very excited to hear that Danganronpa was receiving an adaption. The biggest issue though was 13 episodes - which, considering that Danganronpa relies a lot on character and plot development for it to work so well, was obviously going to be a huge let down in the series. Even as a standalone anime, Danganronpa doesn't work as well asit could've.\\n\\n\r\nThe series revolves around 15 high school students, chosen to go to an academy of hope - Hope's Peak Academy - based on one major thing they excel in, be it detective work, fortune telling, anything really. I won't get into detail about the story, since well, there is a synopsis, but the words \"15 high school students\" and \"13 episodes\" should already start sounding alarms for you.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because the show obviously doesn't have time to explore all of these characters, which is honestly a shame. The characters, honestly, come off as very one-dimensional and underdeveloped due to how quickly the pace moves. Characters that were supposed to have spent lots of time and have connections with Naegi, our main protagonist, are severely cut back which makes the murders all look like petty shock value.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I have always praised Danganronpa for was its excellent characters, which are almost completely butchered in the anime. The amount of foreshadowing and interactions that they all had was amazing, but in the anime, again, even as a standalone, is just very flat. Obviously, the characters who survive longer get more development, but without any actual character development or depth given to them, the entire impact of the death, trial, and executions are just.. gone. It makes it seem like just another petty death game, which unfortunately, is what the anime feels like.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself suffers due to rushed time as well, since again, the rushed pace takes away from a lot of foreshadowing that tie in to key events, most specifically a major plot twist near the end of the show. The story is pretty coherent and easy to follow, but in the end it never comes off as more than just mediocre due to how the anime is presented. Not to mention, so many things come off as complete asspulls. This is really present in the trials because of how short the investigations are. It makes it seem like some of the conclusions and accusations are just pulled out of nowhere for convenience. Important points that come up later on just feel extremely forced, and the drama that occurs as well feels too melodramatic due to lack of time spent in the setting and characters. It's all just a very overall rushed and messy anime.\\n\\n\r\nI both give credit and displeasure towards the artwork of the anime. I give credit to them for staying true to the character designs, actions, and sprites that were in the game. But my displeasure leads towards both the overall animation and the executions. The studio, Lerche, is a studio that has done hardly any actual anime and their lack of budget is very obvious, especially in the early episodes. It's also noticeable when you realize that a lot of animated scenes in the game, the executions obviously, are just traced over. Literally. I mean, good, I'm glad you tried THAT hard to stay true to the game, but that's just lazy when you have to trace over this. Not to mention the entire anime feels far too.. game like. As if the studio didn't know if they were making an anime or a game with more movements.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is honestly a pretty generic rap song, and changes at odd times. The OST, while excellent in the game, doesn't seem to be as fitting in the anime? It's hard to describe, really, but it just doesn't feel right, though that could just be me. I do, however, appreciate all the VAs, namely Junko's, for their excellent job on the characters. The ED theme is also very well-done as well, and a very catch tune.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I'd find it very hard for one to genuinely enjoy Danganronpa if they haven't previously played the game. The immense flaws in the characters and storytelling is just so obvious, though then again if you're into just overall death game anime, then you may like this. Most of my enjoyment simply came from seeing all my favorite characters animated, though obviously if you haven't read the LP or played the game, you won't have that in it for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Danganronpa shows exactly what is wrong with game to anime adaptions - cut time for key things like the characters and plot can really break a show, especially one that relies purely on that. If I were to recommend Danganronpa to someone, I'd recommend the translated game or the Let's Play any day. If you've already watched the anime and happened to like it, definitely go for one of the following, because the depth it goes into is quite amazing. If you wanted more out of the anime, then again, go for the LP or game. It's actually coming out for PS Vita come 2014, so if you get the chance, perhaps even buy it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the end of the 13th episode hints at Super Danganronpa 2, the sequel to Danganronpa, being animated. Essentially, if this gets greenlit for an anime and is only 13 episodes and you're interested in it, don't bother. SDR2 can and will only work as 2-cour. I'd honestly recommend it either way since it answers many questions that Danganronpa had left behind.\\n\\n\r\nI sure as hell got my fill of despair from this, but not in the way I wanted to..",

            "content": "This review is based solely on the anime.\r\nFormer players of the murder mystery video game, Danganronpa: Academy of Hope and High School Students of Despair, are likely to find this adaptation as a disappointment with several changes or downgrades in the characters. Unfortunately, it does not differ much for someone who is unfamiliar with the game either. Danganronpa has an interesting plot with its dangerous game and potential to conduct an excellent thriller. However, you can imagine how well this murder mystery goes with only 13 episodes. Danganronpa\u2019s motive was to create a horrifying show with gruesome deaths, but it embarrassed itself with its unpleasantartwork. The rushed pacing left no room to learn about the characters or give them time to develop. With a complex game such as Danganronpa, 13 episodes was a bad idea and left many plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa started off on a good note, introducing the characters and the survival game to consist of one winner. The execution is poor. A murder case lasts only 2 episodes, so it doesn\u2019t hesitate in getting to the point or wastes time with sob stories from each character. Cases gets unbearably cheesy when the gullible and disinteresting male protagonist Naegi gains the spotlight by being the only one finding flaws in someone else\u2019s theory. Danganronpa drifts away from the horror aspect with occasional changes in the rules. They use fanservice as a distraction once the story actually gets serious. A downside for the viewers who are solely interested in discovering which student is clever enough to conduct a murder and get away with it are likely to be disappointed with the ending. Of course, with a murder mystery also comes relevant questions of the game\u2019s originality. This creates a rushed pacing in an attempt to answer every single question but leaves several plotholes and ridiculous outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of a menacing teddy bear named Monobear as the mastermind is not bad, considering that he proved himself to be a threatening individual. However, Danganronpa became less of a thriller as Monobear's personality occasionally became laidback and panicky. The high schoolers had diverse personalities, including a bipolar chick and the manliest looking girl, and the potential to be likeable characters. Sadly, Danganronpa reveals nothing about the characters besides their name and given nickname. Naegi even lacks any background, so his personality leaves him as no one but another clich\u00e9 male protagonist. Mainly all, except 2 or 3 side characters, are just there to die or be present as an investigator. The elimination of characters continues without revealing anything about them until the very last minute, and there is hardly any time to feel sympathy for the dead or understand a character's motives. This leaves some questions unanswered, causes disappointments from misleads, and creates a strong lack of character development. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is indeed unique but mostly awful. Most animation from game adaptations hide the fact they base from a game by fitting close to an anime as possible, but Danganronpa makes it extremely obvious with the arcade-animated scenes. Danganronpa supposedly is a horror. Admittedly, the combination of eerie music and sketched dead bodies makes it a bit terrifying, but how do they ruin it? Magenta blood. Slice the characters\u2019 bodies in half, and you\u2019ll find veins of playful colors. Also, the 3D elements could be cool, but it is more of a sneaky way to censor the deaths. No complaints about the character design, because it was really diverse and suited each character's personality.\\n\\n\r\nOddly, Danganronpa is the first anime I\u2019ve known to have a rap song as the OP. It\u2019s not bad, and the lyrics relate to the show quite well. The ending is an arcade song that is questionable. The seiyuu fit the anime perfectly as each character had their own personality. The characters were diverse and included a manly female, great detective, and a bipolar chick. The seiyuu did an excellent job portraying those characters, especially the one who played Monobear.\\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa could be a better show if it wasn\u2019t so rushed, paid more attention to the characters, and perhaps followed through with the game. I suggest watching it through the first murder case to decide whether you want to continue or not. Regardless, go into this with no high expectations or play the game as most game players suggested.",

            "content": "I like to play games. I mean, we all do once every while when we're bored right? The fun thing about games is not to only to kill time but also for achievements in some cases. When you win a game against someone, you get that feeling of pride knowing that you were better than your opponent. When you lose though, you might feel disappointment but also hoping to do better next time. But what if you're in a twisted game where there's no next time? What if you only get that one chance because if you lose, your life will end? Well, in DanganRonpa, you won't get another chance if you screw up. Your life is at stake and in order to graduate/win, you have to kill someone and get away with it. \\n\\n\r\nGoal: achieve a perfect murder.\\n\\n\r\nDangan Ronpa: The Animation is an anime adapted from the game of the same name. The game is a murder mystery visual novel. I have not played the game so this review will be judged based on from an anime perspective alone. And coming fresh from this series, Dangan Ronpa offers what it is based on its concept \u2013 a murder mystery story with twists and surprises.\\n\\n\r\nFor most part, the series is pretty straight forward. The initial episode introduced a variety of characters where each of them possesses a special talent of sorts. These ranges from talents such as lying, fortune telling, computer programming, or even the art of murder. One particular student stands out though because he doesn't possesses any special talent. In fact, he is invited to the school (Hope's Peak Academy) based on a raffle. His name is Makoto Naegi and he realizes his life is never ever going to be the same again. \\n\\n\r\nThe main premise of the series is to survive and escape the school. In order to do that, they have to commit the perfect murder. They must kill one of their classmates and get away it but that's a lot easier said than done. Of course, this spurs up a lot of tension and distrust among the students themselves as to who can be trusted. It's obvious though to suspect everyone and play safe but trusting no one. If you think the premise is twisted though, wait and till you meant the headmaster of the series. Its name is Monokuma (also known as the Monobear) and boy, he is someone that is shrouded in mystery. For starters, he has a very sarcastic personality. No one really knows what he says is true or not. However, the students of the academy quickly learns the hard way that his words are serious. In fact, this is proven by his dangerous powers to kill anyone on the spot. As a character full of mysteries, Monokuma plays the role of the primary antagonist as he enjoys the situations the students are in. His face also depicts a twisted like personality with one side being cute while the other side being disfigured. Furthermore, he has a tendency to uphold the laws of his game with absolute power as he is willing to kill others that breaks the rules or threatens his very existence. \\n\\n\r\nBecause there are 15 characters in this series, expect all of them to make their own spotlights. However, expect that number to go do down with each progressing character because of the premise. As fate knows it, there will be murders committed. Among its cast though, Naegi is the most average of them but also has the most guts and determination. Judging by his character, he is willing to help others and tries by any means to end this twisted game. \\n\\n\r\nAs the rules of the games go, you must commit a perfect murder to graduate. However, there is also a catch involving the classroom trials that proceeds each time a murder is committed. This is done in order for the characters to determine the culprit. If you guess right, the killer will be killed on the spot in a gruesome fashion. But hey, what if you guess wrong? Remember what I mentioned before about second chances? Well, that can go to hell because if you guess wrong, everyone else but the killer dies. It's a game that only our Monobear can think of to be this twisted. \\n\\n\r\nAmong the character casts, there are several students that makes their presence known more than others. Besides Naegi, there is the mysterious Kyouko Kirigiri. She comes off with a mysterious girl but a very intellectual mind combined with coolness and reasoning skills, she is one of the prominent members of the series. More importantly though, we can see that she also seems to form a close bond with Naegi even from the beginning. Other important characters include Byakuya Togami, an arrogant rich boy. Despite his attitude, he also possesses keen intellectual skills in problem solving. However, every character is part of the problem because every time someone is killed, there's someone to blame. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the problem solving goes, there are various hints dropped in here and there. This usually happens at the crime of the scene. Then, there's the class trials that proceeds the murders where arguments are ensured and accusations flies in the air. The murder themselves are always different and seems to be coupled with some sort of motive. These varies each time but the result is almost always the same \u2013 someone committed the deed and they will pay. But then of course, if the others guess wrong, they die themselves. It's literally a kill-or-be killed situation. While all this is going on, Monobear plays the fool. Man, talk about being a chill bear.\\n\\n\r\nBecause this is a mystery theme series, there are various twists and surprises. In particular, there is more than just meets the eye regarding the origins of the game. In fact, \u201cwho is Monobear?\u201d \u201cWho or what is the real mastermind pulling the strings?\u201d \u201cWas there anyone that successfully escaped years back before this graduation trial?\u201d There are many questions that I'm sure viewers will come up with their heads as the episodes progresses. The fun aspect of Dangan Ronpa is making theories based on hints. Then when the class trial comes, viewers will be able to figure out if they are either right or wrong. The experience here is thrilling because regardless of the result, you'll feel like being in the classroom itself. \\n\\n\r\nAs thrilling as Dangan Ronpa is, I do feel like some of the murders are a bit too easy to solve with the given clues. This is especially true in the beginning where some of the clues are ridiculously obvious. Then, there's the executions themselves that comes after the trials. From what I've known, the executions incorporates reused animation from the game rather than anything new. The execution itself may also seem brutal but it can also be taken hardly serious because of the animation style. I find the animation to be poorly constructed and out of place. Also, from what I understand, there are things that should have been adapted but left out. Through my experience of watching anime adapted from games, this is always bound to happen on occasions so don't expect everywhere there. After all, games are the superior brand of its anime adaptation. Furthermore, the length of only 12 episodes gives this show a case of cramping and rushing things through. There are also some cheesy dialogues with an underwhelming ending so don't push the expectations too high.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, Dangan Ronpa is like a crumbled cookie. It's like the chocolate is overbaked or something because the animation style is edgy and looks hardly realistic or to take seriously. Monobear is designed as a fusion of cuteness and psychotic. As far as the character designs go, they all do have an unique appearance. These match with their titles and personalities, some more ways than one as you will discover later on personally. One drawback I also found about the animation style is the murders. The blood is colored differently than what you may be used to and doesn't seem to be serious at all either. To me, it doesn't fit quite right.\\n\\n\r\nFor soundtrack, Dangan Ronpa executes an OST that mixes with rock, metal, and techno on occasions. There is a thrilling like feeling every time the soundtrack is played because viewers can tell that something big will happen. The OP songs are also artistic with the montages of the characters. On the other hand, the ED song provides a glance of the characters of every episode. Voice acting wise, Kirigiri's VA Yoko Hikasa plays her role quite well with her calm personality. In fact, she is always seen as being level headed and her voice tone is a good reflection of that. Monobear himself also has a voice full of sarcasm and cruel intentions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Dangan Ronpa can be received differently depending on how you will enjoy this. As a viewer coming directly fresh into this, I did enjoy some aspects of it. However, there are times when I find the murder to be quite predictable along with the way being handled sort of out of place. What Dangan Ronpa brings though is the thrilling experience of finding out the culprit behind the murders. As the episodes progresses, more and more mysteries are unlocked where they might come as unexpected. For me, some of the expectations I had for this series were met while others I had were met with mixed results. Like I said before though, Dangan Ronpa is a mystery theme series with touches of psychological and horror. Therefore, it can be received differently for everyone. However, if there's one thing that we all share in equal, it is death.",

            "content": "Yadda yadda, first review, bluh bluh. \r\nA group of teenagers, each of them exceeding in their own field, be it sports, programing or leading an outlaw biker gang, get locked up in an elite school with no obvious way to escape, except one: Kill a fellow student and don't get caught. An interesting take of the snowed-in-in-a-mountain-cabin trope and good set up for a murder mystery. Or is it? \r\nDanganronpa was based on a game of the same name. Since the game was a success which spawned a sequel and huge, dedicated fanbase, it was only natural to cash in on it. Ananime is a nice way to do so. While I do understand that converting one medium of storytelling into another is not a copy-and-paste process, I can't help it but to compare those two. The game was awesome. The show, less so. Why is that? A few reasons which boil all down to the same problem: the show only has 13 episodes. Let me elaborate: \\n\\n\r\nWhile the story itself is captivating and interesting (even if sometimes over the top) and the characters sympathetic and, more or less, not cardboard cutouts of certain stereotypes, none of them is given the time to breathe and develop. Every single story arc gets compressed into 2 episodes: the murder and detective work getting down, and the school trial, an event in which the boys and girls need to determine who the murderer is. The game got a good balance between those two. Every arc is a few hours long, allowing the player to build social contacts, get to know the cast, investigate the crime scene and have a debate in which the murderer is uncovered. Many of those things do not happen or happen in a very compressed form because of the limited time the show has. The result is that the viewer does not get to know the characters and has no chance to connect with them, the investigation part is reduced to a few minutes of listing the evidence, and a, sadly in many cases, too short episode to find the culprit. It gets confusing and leaves a general feeling of something missing. That's all I have to say about the differences between those two. Lets talk anime-only. \\n\\n\r\nIgnoring there was a source material we've got a cast of throwaway characters of whom the majority only serves to be killed of. The story and its creative setting are captivating, but do not get enough time to leave an impact. I seriously can not stress enough how little time this show has to develop it's story and characters. The animation is pretty weak and not up-to-date with other anime. The soundtrack is good (*cough*keeptfromthegame*cough*). \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have no idea who this anime was targeted towards. Fans of the game will only get quick reminder of the experience they had with it, people who would want to play it will get spoiled without enjoying the \"whole\" story, and people who are just in it for the lulz will get a mediocre murder mystery with terrible pacing. Should fans of detective anime watch this? Yes if you want a general idea of the events but can not or do not want to play the game. No if you want a good ride for your money (and time). There are better mysteries out there like Death Note (obviously), Monster, Another, Ergo Porxy and (the very lengthy) Detective Conan (aka Case Closed).\\n\\n\r\n6/10, would only recommend to fans of the game.",

            "content": "Okay, before you press the \"Not Helpful\" button after seeing my rating, realize this: I haven't played the game. This is a review from a watcher who thinks of this as just a regular anime, not a game adaptation. And, as someone who didn't play the game, I think it's a anime worth watching. Let me explain:\r\nStory: 8\r\nIt's a really creative, well adapted version of the \"Last man standing\" plotline, which seems more clich\u00e9 than it actually is. I personally really like the idea; when someone gets murdered everyone has to crack the case together and if that culprit gets found out, he/she dies too.The story revolves around 15 teenagers who are invited to attend Hope's Peak Academy, ad when they step inside, all they can feel is despair when they discover that their principal is  sadistic, moving and talking Black and White Teddy Bear that goes by the name of Monobear, (or Monokuma). He instructs the students that this is all a test. Only one student is allowed to leave the school and that's the one that manages who doesn't get found out as a culprit or just manages to survive until the end. I loved the whole idea and personally, I love animes that mess with your head like this, because you NEVER know who the culprit is going to be or what is going to happen next. The only thing is that some of the elements were really confusing, and it takes a while to process what's happening, but overall, it's a really great idea. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a great transition between different art styles. From time to time, it switches from the normal expected art style and an urban vintage type art style, and thought it really enhanced the mood of a dramatic plot point. It was really unexpected and surprisingly relevant. I've never ever seen an anime hat does something like that, EVER. And I would highly recommend it to other animes in the future. Also, the effects during the anime, especially during the class trials, were really good and different from anything I've ever witnessed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt was pretty good, the transitional soundtrack and also the opening. I love how the opening was westernized into a rap, American song. It was really original ad I liked it. It was unexpected and fit the rest of the anime really well. I mean, it's nothing to sparkle at and listen twice to, but it was really original. The transitional music tracks were placed very well. I like the soundtracks in the Class Trials, it added suspense and put a mysterious twist on the plot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nOf course, with 15 teenagers, there were going to be ones I hated and ones I liked, but I didn't really necessarily \"hate\" any of the characters. In fact, I really like the mix of different design and personalities that made up of the group; from a multi-personality freak, to a body builder monster woman, Danganronpa covers it all. I really liked the main character; though, he turns kind of cheesy in the ending, but totally worth it right? Of course, the mix of personalities is what the anime really had going for it. Each character had their own tag, their own extreme personality that got them into the school in the first place. It really added effect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed the whole mix of the different elements that each added some originality to the anime. I couldn't look away from the screen, it was so worth watching it.\\n\\n\r\nEnding: 8 (I won't give any spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nI know from experience that an ending can really ruin the anime. It's happened millions of times and that's why I'm really scared to watch the ending of Shingeki no Kyojin today... but that aside, I'm going to tell you what I thought of the ending. There is so much of a plot twist that you yourself hurt your brain by watching it, but that's not always a bad thing. I mean, Danganronpa puts the ending together really well, so well in fact, that it will get you banging your head against your desk for a week.  I mean, there's slight cheese, but it's not overwhelming like in SAO. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed watching it. It really put me on the edge of my seat and gave me chills with all of its beautifully executed elements. I would definitely recommend this to a close friend, or anyone to that matter! I believe this anime is really underrated and needs to be recognized. Right now, everything is buried in the shadow of Shingeki no Kyojin, but I'm telling you, it's a fantastic anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n",

            "content": "Here is a very basic rule of thumb that all animation studios should have learned by 2015: \"Just because something worked as a video game, doesn't necessarily mean it will work as a show!\"\r\nDanganronpa was a successful video game because it had goofy characters, decent comedy, and allowed the player to think and solve mysteries. The story and characters weren't very deep or well developed, but it didn't matter because the entire point was for the player to actively solve the puzzle. A TV show is largely a passive form of entertainment in which the viewer is not controlling the events and using skills tosolve a puzzle. That is why the quality of characters and writing needs to be higher in order to make a good show vs. a good game. Tetris is a great game without having any plot or characters to speak of, but it would SUCK as a TV show! \\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise is that a bunch of students are trapped in a highschool and manipulated into killing each other off. The students need to figure out who trapped them there and who is killing everyone. Basically they just lifted the plot and premise from an old Agatha Christie novel. Although this worked well for \"And Then There Were None\", it doesn't work out NEARLY as well here. One of the reasons is that the same \"trick\" used by Christie to throw off readers on who the true killer was actually was shocking and original in 1939, but really NOT in 2014. I don't want to completely spoil it, but if you have read the original novel you are not going to be surprised when the killer is revealed. The other reason Danganronpa fails is that the characters are all ANNOYING AS FUCK! I am dead serious when I say that MonoKuma is one of the single most annoying characters in anime history! In a videogame, a character can be REALLY annoying and players simply tolerate it. This goes all the way back to 1985 and that damned Duckhunt Dog! However, in a TV show it really isn't acceptable to have so many annoying characters with so much screen time! \\n\\n\r\nIt hardly helps matters that the animation in this show is dreadful and the CGI death sequences are so shitty looking you would rather die the death onscreen than have to watch it! I think Oregon Trail had better death cinematics than this piece of shit!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nPopular videogames being made into unbearably shitty anime is a trend that really should stop for the good of the anime industry. The ONLY positive thing I will say about Danganronpa is that it is better than another recent cell phone game adaptation: Vampire Holmes!",

Everything happens too fast and nothing is explained, especially during investigations. A lot of important information is lost.\r\nThere is no character development, apart from things that are very important for the story.

            "content": "Danganronpa - KNGTZNK - The Animation (I KNOW!) is a weird anime. Not because he it pinkish blood, or it feels as if you're flying with Enterprise within the distance of a small country or anything alike - it's just weird. \r\nTo put it off my chest, I loved first 4-5 episodes. They really hit the point with me since I love the detective stories. They were well executed, they actually had SOLID pacing (I KNOW!) and weren't as ... well, as bad as the rest of them. As for the rest of them, they suck - flat out suck.\r\nThe story of Danganronpa is simple- you have sixteen (fifteen) students stuck in a school and only one of them will graduate. How? By killing others and not being found guilty, of course. The anime instantly opens the question of moral, self-indulgence and various other things concerning oneself in regards to others. We have a large range of characters, and a great setting. The rest is simple: some drama and dialogue, murder, investigation and trial - hence and repeat. No, seriously. The story skyrockets in speed in the last five episodes. You are constantly being fed enormous amount of information and you don't know whether you're supposed to remember or not. And the last two episodes (especially the last) ... oh gosh ... think of it as the entire Sauske/Itachi arc done in one and a half episode. Yep. \\n\r\nAll in all, story is half-assed at best. It opens solidly and creates decent foundation, but then is skips through itself so quickly you forget what the hell is actually happening. It has no tools other than constant, constant, CONSTANT, boring dialogue and monologue to resolve all the questions, so yeah. \\n\\n\r\nThe saving graces of this anime are probably art and sound, and even they are not great. Art itself is nothing special; animations can sometimes (often) be so stiff you can barely look at them. Not to mention 5 minutes of talking where no one moves a limb. Eyes blinking and mouths opening and closing. Yeah. However, animation somewhat shines during the executions; they're quite well done, all unique in their own ways, flashy and disturbing of course. However, what killed the art for me was that bloody, pinkish blood. I detest the censorship, especially in anime where blood actually matters. Executions seemed as unicorns taking a crap rather than bodies being mutilated and dismembered in the most awful ways. Characters designs are also quite good, I might add. All characters look fresh, unique and distinguishable enough. It's their personalities that make you forget about them. As far as the sound goes, music is your standard tense stuff which is actually not half-bad. The voice actors vary; even in the last episode, I still couldn't stand the MC's voice, but it's just me. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the character department. Considering there are sixteen (fifteen) students, and thirteen episodes, you know it's going to be a train-wreck. Only two characters receive mild development (Kirigiri & Naegi) but not in the true sense. From the very first episode, they all have established personalities and they stick to them (well, Nagei kind of receives a new one by the end). There are two or three interesting character, including the bear (which is probably the most interesting) and the psycho-killer-schizophrenia-amnesic-catastrophe. Kirigiri will be okay for some people, but I found her character ... just plain boring. The characters are not memorable. Let alone their names. Not that you even bother to remember, or need to remember. Just ... bad characters overall.\\n\\n\r\nIn the enjoyment department, for the first 5 episodes, I give this anime 10. For the last 6 episodes, I give it 0. And we find in the middle. First two-three cases are relatively fun, but the formula quickly runs out. And then they tip of a twist which just couldn't make any sense unless they pulled out some really weird crap (which they did) but hey, I lived through it. The anime has A LOT of twists. Are they good? Some of them. However, after the number of people clears up a bit, it's rather easy to predict who killed whom, and even that mystery aspect kind of disappears. And then the last two episodes. Complete and utter train wreck. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I hated the most about Danganronpa are those last five episodes. Up until then, HOPE and DESPAIR were never found in the same sentence and were mentioned once or twice in an episode. But then writers took some acid and decided to go nuts. They invented a new drinking game. Whenever you hear the words HOPE and DESPAIR in the same sentence in the last 5-6 episodes, take a shot. You won't live through one. For some reason, the writers decided to go full-out-pretentious (never go full-out-pretentious) and not in a good way. They constantly kept throwing around the subjects such as despair and hope, and characters (especially MC) kept giving the old same speeches how \"... as long as I can hope,  I can change the world with my hope ...\" (yea, I'm looking at you Naruto) and you just want to close your eyes and forget you're watching it because you're embarrassed. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend Danganronpa? Well, unless you're sucker for extremely fast paced anime with so many plot twists that will make your head twist (and not in a good way), go for it. However, it is obvious that this anime needed far more than 13 episodes. Even someone who never played the game realizes that.",

            "content": "Boy, oh boy. This is a rather short anime so I decided to dedicate time to watch it. While I wouldn't say it was a mistake, given the chance, I would rather not have seen it at all.\r\nThe story is interesting indeed, especially people who are suckers for mysteries like me. It's based on a video game of the same name, however, this adaptation managed to do so many things wrong and its main failure lies in the lack of time for development.\r\nThe class trials were just really poorly executed. 1-2 episodes per trial (including the crime, the investigation and the trial itself in thatshort a span) just doesn't cut it. The twists came off so suddenly, without any prior build-up and just comes off as poorly-done. What's the point of creating a mystery if you don't give the audience a chance to even formulate their own theories?\\n\\n\r\nI found the characters lacking as well. Given that this was a show featuring extreme characters, they weren't really quite made to be realistic. Yet we weren't given a chance to see them grow, to even /see/ how they are. When they died, I mostly just went \"oh, okay\" because I didn't manage to form an emotional attachment to anyone. I especially wish the main character could have been given more well-rounded, seeing as how we were watching the story from his point of view. We just didn't know anything about him and yet we had to trust him as there was no other way to watch it. Aside from Kirigiri, no one else was molded to be a somewhat three-dimensional character. The way the show portrayed the characters, no one was very memorable except maybe for Monobear and Kirigiri.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to the anime's credit, atleast there's the soundtrack and art. The seiyuus were mostly all right, but the one who voiced Monobear deserves praise. The rest wasn't quite as notable but the music was intense and gave way to tension that wouldn't even be existent without it.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork, though a bit... unique, gave the anime the vibe it should have. I found the purple blood to be a nice touch. Details were on the spot and I thought the angularness and thick lines were perfect. The character designs were very particular. The animation of the executions was also a wonderful touch, it gave the scenes a stranger, trippier, more intense feel. Danganronpa wouldn't even be half the anime it was without the very original art. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, I don't think anyone would be satisfied with how it ended up. Original fans from the game would be pissed at the poor adaptation, new viewers would just be confused with what /exactly/ is going on (I sure was). If the anime could have been extended up to, say, 25 episodes to give way to character development then I'm pretty sure this could have ended up great but the way it is now just leaves a gigantic room for improvement.",

            "content": "This is based solely on this awful adaption, not the game.\r\nNow, I've said this before and I'll say it again, I love Battle Royale premises. What I don't like is when the concept is completely butchered with poor characters, art and predictableness.\r\nThe story gets a 7, mostly because I'm just generous towards anything that involves a bunch of people that have to kill each other in order to survive. It takes place in a school where the characters are told by a cute little bear that they have to kill each other and then hold trials to try to guess who the kill was. Ifthey get it right, the killer dies. If they get it wrong, they all die except the killer.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give the story props for being different in that regard, but honestly, it was done very poorly. The rules and the 'motivation' to kill the others were stupid, and I don't see why the characters were dumb enough to actually kill anyone. The trial scenes were the same with the main character always figuring out who it was. The way it was executed was laughable, as were the death scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace was rushed. It became formulaic and boring, as I didn't care who died since the characters were just there to die anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art (4), well, it looked bad and out of place. Most of the character designs were horrifying and everything looked like it was copied and pasted from a game (OH WAIT, it was). And what I can't over look is the fact that the blood was pink. PINK. It looked ridiculous. The deaths of the killers after the trials also looked funny and out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was alright. I liked the opening and ending songs, but they weren't anything special. Within the anime, there weren't any soundtracks that stuck out. Mediocre at best. 5.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is where this show really suffers. They were introduced lamely and had one-dimensional, generic personalities. The main character, Naegi, was the worst, being your typical no personality character. The same goes for Kirigiri, who was supposed to be 'mysterious' but at the end of the day wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nMonobear wasn't scary at all. I don't know why they decided to give him that voice, but it wasn't threatening, it was lame. So was his pathetic excuse of an explosion in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe main villain and the ending was a surprise, I didn't see it coming. That being said, it would have been nice to see what it was like outside the school.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I didn't care who died or who did the killing because the characters were so one-dimensional. They all could have died, for all I care. 2, because of how awful they were handled.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I feel bad for the game, because I've heard it was great. Unfortunately, the anime was atrocious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment was a 4, mostly because of the premise and the ending, which was the only thing that wasn't predictable. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Just walk away. Run if you have to.",

Everyone's talking about how the show is bad compared to the game and so on but this is just painfully mediocre in it's own right.\r\nThe bad: \r\n- The animation? Not a fan. I mean some might like the 3D-ish elements, but for me it was just painful to watch. In addition to the execution segments the 3D stuff just felt out of place and completely unnecessary. To be honest I didn't like the art style either. \r\n- A word about music. I usually find most anime OPs quite amusing or interesting even if they don't suit my musical preference. This OP (andending tbh) were pretty bad. Nothing worth noticing about either of the tracks. Just filler music to spend 1.5 minutes of air time that COULD be spent on char. development.\\n\\n\r\n- The way the trials were set up didn't really work for me either. The whole verbal bullets thing seemed childish and although I'll admit that it was interesting to listen to the thought process at times overall it was quite boring.\\n\\n\r\n=== ENDING SPOILERS IN THE NEXT BULLETPOINT ===\\n\r\n- The characters are totally undercooked. People have said this time and again and I will agree with them. The story either doesn't fit the format of a show when comparing to a game or just needed more time, because we never shown what some of the characters actually do or are good at. Some of them just appear and disappear 2-3 episodes after that without any character development what-so-ever.\\n\r\n=== END OF SPOILER ===\\n\\n\r\nThe ... good?:\\n\\n\r\n- I'm a sucker for a good mystery so this kind of thing had me caught up in the story despite the show itself being bad. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest there probably are tons of shows worth watching instead of Danganronpa so... just do that, I guess.",

            "content": "Ping, pong, pang, pong....... As I make this review,1st thing is 1st, I haven't played the video game yet, then again such game would cost a fortune here in Mexico and I haven't yet read both the manga and the light novel yet, so for this review, I'm only gonna base it for this anime and this anime only. Por qu\u00e9 todos ustedes entiendan, muchachos? Bueno, bueno, let get down and dirty, so far this is another very good anime for this season,  despite of the spoilers available in MAL and other anime site info, it didn't affect my desire to watch and beamuse as to how the mystery and the deception unfolds with the students of Kib\u014dgamine Gakuen, thought there are question abound as to what's the concept of such school be conceive, it really doesn't matter at all. if I were to compared this with it's western counterpart the closes it would be is \"The Cube\" were both involves people trapped in such confined place where everything is a puzzle that every individual has to figure out in order to get out, but unlike the movie 'The Cube,\" in Danganronpa the group of individual enjoy comfortable amenities and knows who the adversary is despite the fact that the said adversary is using a disguise, but what really make it enjoyable despite of the spoilers is how the anime was presented ok so never mine about the pink blood and the not so gruesome murder of the victims  and the over-elaborate execution of the guilty, the real enjoyment was knowing how the mastermind  (despite of the spoiler) did it and given that she's to be found out how will she react. Frankly, on the last episode I was kinda hoping that Junko is gonna be up to something to escape her own execution or does something to make the escape of the final six a bit more difficult, so my ratings for this 13 episode anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory, enjoyment, overall: Good 8\\n\\n\r\nexplanation already provided, above.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Poor 3,\\n\\n\r\nI give such score since the characters illustration doesn't match the anime's concept, also, the execution, character's attire, murder and background are just too over-elaborate, thought this anime should use a little bit of Junko, Kirigiri and Sayaka fanservice. About Sakura, I would have prefer that this series' illustrator would have made her a he or make her a hot babe rather than an bulky FBB who pumps themselves with steroids.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair 6. \\n\\n\r\nFor the op and ed- me not likey, but, for the Monobear, the one who did its voice was very compelling to say the least too bad that Junko's VA wasn't able to do it properly. Then again, the way Junko delivered her lines in the final episode was pretty awesome and so as Genocider Syo.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI would have given it an 8, but the fact that Mukuro Ikusaba's roles was too brief, should limit this part to a 7. Then again, it ain't that bad, since it was Naegi and Kirgiri who gave this anime the most impact and the 2 are the only ones who kept the group together even is there are times along this anime's episodes that they have to the escapegoats. Also, Monobear, really did play a good role foe being the antagonist in this anime, also I like the way that Junko (I'm referring to the real one) who came out on the last episode as this psychotic despair spreading freak dish out her freakish side and the way she tries to use deception and manipulation as a last attempt to escape execution in the last episode, though, she could have done it in a much a more easier way, then again, I'm thinking if this anime will have a season 2, I won't be surprise if she faked her own execution. As for the others, like Aoi, I really hate the fact that she's moire of a lucky bimbo than anything else, Yasuhiro, on the other hand was merely useless in fact I can never understand why a fortune teller like him can't predict any of the student's future nor was he able to foretold who is behind Monobear, Touko or Genocider Syo, was pretty useless as well, she more of a comic relief than a fearsome serial killer. Togami, is another character that contributes to this anime's overall impact, but, I see him as this play safe character, who's pretty much does everything to keep himself away from the bubble.\\n\\n\r\nThe end, muchachos.",

            "content": "It is known fact that if you make an anime/movie adaptation off a video game , it will never be as successful as the video game itself, given that it has the same content and story. Video games allow you to experience and make your own decisions, which is not an option in movies/anime. Infact, many innovators actually believe that decision making video games MAY replace movies in the future (If you've played \u201cLife is Strange\u201d, you\u2019d agree with this fact).\r\nAnyhow, before you read any further, if you oppose this anime solely due to it not being able to live up to its video gamecounterpart, I advise you to piss off. I'll write this review based solely on the anime itself, and will not compare it to the game (Not like I've played the game anyways).\\n\r\nNow for the anime itself. I started watching this anime, not expecting too much from it. As I finished watching episode 1, I was thinking of dropping it. But I must admit, shit got real from then on. Everything that happened had my full attention. And before I knew it, I had been indulged into it.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf I am to keep it spoiler free, I'd say that the story is very average to start with. It only gets interesting after the first murder. Since I haven't watched like 500 Anime series to be writing this review, the story was interesting for me. It kept me really really curious as to who the murderer might be. Some Mystery series fail to keep audiences curious (won\u2019t mention them here). But luckily, Danganronpa wasn't one of them (For me at least, because I am a fan of Mystery series)\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNo doubt about it, the animation was very good. The character design was cute as well. I must admit, I did start this series only because I liked the character design. The only part I disliked was the \"punishment\" periods. Which I think were nabbed off of the video game (?), since it was pure CGI.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nAll and all, its an 7 for me because I love Mystery anime.",

I thought the concept was very interesting and it was a very fun anime to watch. I liked certain characters and hated others but that was the point. The last few episodes did feel rushed and at certain times throughout the series, you will feel like there could be a lot more. I wish this animewas 26 episodes because the murders and investigations were very short at times. Overall though I would recommend this anime to others.

            "content": "Danganronpa is a series I wanted to like more. It's by no means terrible. The story is interesting, some of the characters do have the potential to grow on viewers even if they're unfamiliar with the source material, and it manages to build up a serious level of excitement around each individual trial. Furthermore it has unique style which reminds the viewers of it's origins as a game. This is both one of it's greatest strengths as well as it's greatest weakness. While it lends itself to a distinct atmosphere and helps maintain a sense of energy that persists throughout the series which prevents onefrom feeling the whole show is dragging along. Some of the visual cues are neat in their own right. Yet, at the same time, it feels too much like one is watching a video game. While not a \"formulaic\" show per se, it lends itself to feeling strangely mechanical and predictable from time to time. This can also take the viewer out of the action so to speak. For people unfamiliar with Danganronpa this aspect can be irritating where it may have been intended to appeal to fans of the game. Some scenes appear as if they were torn directly from the source.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the fact that this series is heavily rushed. A lot of characterization, character development,  and plot elements that the source material had time to flesh out are often barely touched upon, rushed, or outright excluded. This lends Danganronpa to feeling a little sloppy and it shows. While the source material may not have aimed for hyper realism, this unfortunately makes some scenes and important reveals feel utterly ridiculous and absurd in ways that only serve to hurt it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the opening song. It's not bad but the lyrics some times seem like who so ever wrote it was trying too hard to make it related back to the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side, the plot is more-a-less faithfully adapted. No major liberties are taken with what is overall, a fairly well written story. The art style is pretty decent. At it's best moments it can be pretty damn fun to watch. Even if the execution sequences do like they were taken right from the game, they do make for an entertainingly absurd bit of dark comedy.  What character development made it in was fairly well handled and most of the cast ends up being fairly likable.  Just like the game that spawned it, Danganronpa has a sense of style even if it's not handled as well as it could be. Most of the voice cast (at least with the Japanese language version) does a decent job.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it's more interesting than the average series, fans will probably enjoy it more than someone totally unfamiliar with the franchise. While I would not hesitate to call it a good series, it suffers in some significant ways from time constraints and stylistically clinging too close to it's source even as it uses this very same element to elevate itself in other aspects.",

            "content": "Before I start this review I want to make something very clear, I am NOT analyzing the adaption part of this anime, what I will try to do in the next lines is view this a anime as a something on its own, I will not compare it to the original work in any way, therefore this review is more guided towards people that have not played the original game.\r\nThat being said lets move on, shall we ?\r\nDanganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei - The Animation, or Danganronpa, or even DR for shorts, its a mystery/investigation anime, in which the main plot isas it follows : Several students with unique characteristcs are invited to join a private school, once they get there they discover they are locked in there and the only way to get out is to kill one of their classmates without being discovered by the remaining classmates as the killer, all this is orchestred by the main mind behind this sick \"game\", a fellow that goes by the name of \"Monokuma\" and only comunicates with the students by using mechanical teddy bears.\\n\\n\r\nSounds at least interesting right ? And in fact it is, the story itself is one of the major good points about DR, besides the \"weekly\" or so mystery of a student assasination, and therefore finding the culprit for such assasination, there is also the main mystery surrounding Monokuma and the reason the students are locked down in the school... I confess that I, personally, found the answer for both these question to be satifasctory (as well for most of the murder cases), but of course this can vary from person to person.\\n\\n\r\nNow, lets talk about the major down point in DR, the Art. Here is where i thouhgt a bit more of care could have taken place. Dont get me wrong, I dont think the art is bad per say, but in this current generation is possible to make a much prettier anime with just a bit more care to details, color pallete, and that kind of stuff. Also, pink blood ? Seriously ? \\n\r\nWell at least at a good side i can point out, the execution sequences, that were really good, and \"artistic\", and also most of the character design... pretty original and good looking, specially Junko and Ishimaru\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the Sound... Here i I thought once again Dr did a pretty good job, the soundtrack during investigations and trials are really good and catchy, the kind that will stuck in your head for a whole day.\\n\r\nThe OP's were ok, nothing flashy, but nothing terrible either, and I really enjoyed the main ED (episode 1-12), really great song, cheerful wich usually generated a nice contrast with the almost ever dark and tense episodes endings.\\n\\n\r\nIn the character segment DR did pretty good as well, with a few cliches of course (Naegi, Togami, etc), but nowadays i highly doubt anyone can find one anime (or movie/tv show for that matter) that does not have at least one cliche character. To be quite honest, with this many characters I was expecting a much larger number of cliche types, but then again i was happily surprised to see that most of them has actually a pretty cool background and personality (I am not going to cite names here becuase I dont want to give possible spoilers). If I have any complains at all here, is that some of the characters had too little screen time, I would love to see some more action of them, and some times the development felt a little rushed... nothing major thouhg. Could a larger number of episodes solved these problems ? Probably yes, but I will take what I can get.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great plus on DR resum\u00e9 is definetly the enjoyment. The sense of immersion on this show is fantastic, and trying to figure out who is the culprit in each murder case is truly awesome. Of course the script does not make it easy for the viewer, if you really want to get to the correct answer before the next episode it will take a LOT of time and thinking, and most of all attention to the minimun details. Doesnt sound so fun right ? Thats why I believe the focus in this anime is another, the anime does not want you to find out who is the culprit, you dont have to. What it wants you to do is have crazy guesses and theories, do not try to have fun by analyzing every bit of evidence, its not your job to do that, the anime will give you the answer in the next episode no matter what. Have fun by taking the wildest guess you can think of until then ! Its like in a movie or tv show, you are not supposed to know who the culprit is before the script tells you, you just sit back and enjoy the ride. If you can do that, I assure you the anticipation to find out who is the culprit will be great. Oh and PLEASE DO NOT LOOK UP FOR SPOILERS ! I think this is pretty much mandatory in  mystery animes, but still its always good to remember.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Danganronpa is a good anime, and a pleasant surprise of last season. If you are looking for a nice mystery with interesting characters look no futher, you have found it. Its not a perfect anime (hell,its far from it) but its a great ride and it will probably hook you up until the end.",

            "content": "Danganronpa is a series based on a PSP game from Spike, a company best known for their work on various DBZ games. They also worked with Capcom on a very under-rated game called Crimson Tears. This game, I never heard of until the anime came out. So I'm going to be judging the series entirely on its own merits and I'm not going to notice if they screw up something from the game. The adaptation was handled by Lerche, a company that, according to ANN, has only been involved with seven anime productions. None of which I've seen. So let's take a look at therecently finished Danganronpa anime and see what it's about. \\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with our protagonist, Naegi, walking to his new High School. No sooner does he cross the threshold when he finds himself waking up in a classroom that's been bolted shut. An announcement plays requesting all students assemble in the gymnasium. He finds himself with fourteen other students and a stuffed bear apparently belonging to Harvey Dent appears claiming to be the Principal. They're told that they won't be allowed to leave until they graduate. And the only way to graduate is to kill someone and get away with it. Now, Naegi has to solve the mystery of just what is going on at Hope's Peak Academy, figure out how to escape, avoid getting killed and solve any death that happens or he, and all of the other innocent students, will be killed. This anime is very silly, but in a good way. It's like a very macabre parody combining murder mystery with the whole \u201cstudents being forced/ strongly encouraged to kill each other\u201d genre that was popularised by Battle Royale (which happens to be on one of my book shelves between the Handmaid's Tale and Suzuki Koji's Dark Watch.) Now, I don't just refer to it as a parody because the antagonist you spend most of your time with is a teddy bear. The character designs are also goofy, the tone stays rather macabre but avoids getting too dark by showing execution scenes in very muted colours and leaving the gorey bits to your imagination. There are also some rather silly scenes. To give one example, Kirigiri finds a clue in the underwear of one of the corpses. When asked why she would check there she shrugs it off as no big deal. It's not like she checked their socks or something. Let's move on to the mystery elements. This is an area where the series excels. The investigations go by very quickly, but they manage to give you all the information you need to either solve the case or figure out where the discussion should begin in the classroom trial. The only exception is the trial before the last one, in which they disclose very little but I'll let that one go since there is a good story reason for it. One thing that I really liked is that they managed to make the discussions interesting, even when the solution was obvious. So you never feel like you're watching a bunch of idiots flounder around to figure out something that should be obvious. This isn't Hyouka. My biggest criticisms of the series are that they leave a lot of unanswered questions , which I unfortunately can't ask since most of them involve spoilers, and the ending is pretty cheesy. Now, a lot of the series is cheesy, in a good way. The ending, however, gravitates more towards the facepalm inducing end of the cheesiness spectrum. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters in this are pretty typical. Naegi is a lot like many other shounen protagonists, he's young and na\u00efve but he's got a lot of heart and great potential. Many of the other students are also representative of rather flat archetypes. Maizono, Ishimaru, Hagakure, Yamada and Oowada to name  few. Now, in all fairness, most of these characters are passable even if they aren't particularly deep. There are some very problematic elements to the way a few of the characters are handled. Particularly Fujisaki and Sakura. There are some characters with really interesting concepts behind them, but they never get fully developed. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is interesting. I already mentioned the goofy character designs and the execution scenes, but there are other facets worth discussing. A second way they tone down the gore is by having blood be some bizarre colour like bright neon purple or green. The evidence is also presented in such a way that it feels like a game. It gets brought up in boxes or contradictions will be illustrated by the image of a bullet shattering into a person when Naegi raises an objection. Which does give it a unique aesthetic. \\n\\n\r\nThey got some really stellar voice actors for this. Including Ogata Megumi, Ishida Akira, Hikasa Yoko and Sawashiro Miyuki. All of whom give great performances. The biggest issues are with Kujira and Yamada Kappei. Kujira plays a female character but gives a heavily masculine performance, which is one of those problematic elements with Sakura's character. Yamada just gives a very flat and kind of annoying performance. The music is good. It's used to accentuate the action pretty nicely. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ho-yay factor is a 1/10. This has no Ho-yay. I kept expecting there to be some, just because it is starring Ogata Megumi and I'm used to seeing her play characters with either a same sex love interest or at least a one-sided crush on someone of the same sex like Haruka, Yukito, Kurama, and Ayato. But no, she doesn't this time. \\n\\n\r\nSo, how is Danganronpa? As a horror piece, it doesn't really work. But if you have a dark sense of humour and you enjoy a good mystery you will likely enjoy it quite a bit in spite of its problems. If  macabre elements creep you out or mysteries make your head hurt, it's not going to be for you. For myself, I give it a 7/10. It's a good anime and I did enjoy watching it. Next week, horror anime month ends with a look at some cute little animals... from the Petshop of Horrors.",

            "content": "You know it's not a good sign when you see an apology in the beginning of a review but let me express my condolences  for the anime-only newbies of the Danganronpa series as they are the victim of something I'm sure we've all experienced before: overhype.\r\nWhen it was announced the popular PSP visual novel would be receiving an anime adaptation many of us were bouncing off the walls with excitement (and with good reason).  If you've seen the anime and are still willing to give the game a shot, go for it.  It's definitely worth it.  If you're someone looking foran interesting anime to watch, I'd suggest playing the game first because if you only watch the anime you'll be bound for disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa's story is one of its main attractions: you're trapped in a high school  with other students, the only way to get out is to kill someone without getting caught, if the students cannot manage to identify you as they killer they all die, and if you're found out you're executed.  Of course this game of death between high school students isn't the most original idea but if you take the mutual killing aspect of Battle Royale and mix it with the mystery solving aspect of Phoenix Wright you're bound to get good results.  The premise of this series is actually one of its high points and it's what keeps you clicking on the next episode.  In a world where murder is usually frowned upon, one can't help but be interested in seeing how some teenagers (and one really air-headed fortune teller that was held back more times than Kanye West goes on a Twitter rampage) go about in a kill-or-be-killed scenario.  I'm sure most of us have all heard of these murder game plots before (Btooom! and Mirai Nikki come to mind), but it's still an attractive idea and I commend Spike for taking a more crime-solving approach with it.\\n\\n\r\nBut sadly, a story can't execute itself well without any support which is the downfall of this adaptation.  Another reason why this anime was overhyped at first was because of how fantastically the visual novel handled its characters.  This is not the case for the anime, however.  With only 13 episodes to cover the deaths of, ideally, all but one of the 15 students, you can expect a lot to be lost in the transition from the PSP screen to the TV screen.  And without question, a lot is definitely lost.  Literally every character in the cast loses the depth they once had in the game.  Because moments in between the murders are scrapped to keep the plot moving along within the short span of 13 episodes, the viewer can't form any emotional attachments with any of the characters before they wind up dead.  I distinctly remember watching an emotional scene with my friend and she said bluntly \"I feel nothing.\"  I don't blame her.  A huge reason for Danganronpa's success is how likable and developed all of the characters are.  Unfortunately, in the anime they receive little to no development and just kind of tag along for a ride on the plot train.  So if a fan of the game comes up to you saying \"I love ____!  ____ is an awesome character\" don't fall into the hype.  Chances are they already threw their computer out the window when they watched that character get reduced to a one-dimensional plot device just because the anime couldn't cover the entire game that made them amazing.  And don't think I'm just an angry veteran fan complaining about the differences from the game; the characters are definitely one-dimensional and it doesn't take having the game in the back of your mind to know that.  If I had a say, the characters in the anime were probably more cardboard than the characters in the game whose sprites basically looked like a One Direction cutout.  However, the characters do have their enjoyable moments and you may even start to like some of them.  Just don't expect much beyond one iota of development or else you'll be very disappointed with how the characters turn out.  They can be lovable and their designs can definitely pull you in.  Just a warning, though: all the characters you might like at the beginning may very well end up dead.\\n\\n\r\nStory and characters aside, there's not much left of Danganronpa that can be described as something other than \"decent.\"  The art is nothing special.  It's not terrible and the characters all actually have great (and sometimes crazy) designs.  The art in general wasn't bad at all, just very basic.  Other than that, though, there's not much to comment on.  You can tell the animation is cheap and there's no real fluid movement (really there's not a lot of movement in general).  The only good parts of the animation you'll be looking forward to are the executions which are, you guessed it, pretty much taken directly from the game.  The blood is pink which I'm assuming is the anime's way to be faithful to the game's censorship but I was honestly expecting good ol' fashioned red blood this time around to get a more realistic, gore-y feeling.  I don't mind pink blood at this point but I'm very aware of how frustrating it can be for people new to the series as it makes the adaptation even more of a joke than some consider it to be.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of jokes, get prepared for stupid revelations out of nowhere.  If you expected a mindfucking, dramatic buildup you've come to the wrong place.  I can't stress it enough: if you're looking for stuff like that then go play the game.  You'll be much more satisfied.  The anime doesn't do a great job of letting the viewer attempt to solve the crime scenes which isn't great as it's the difference between \"wow!  I can't believe it was ____ all along\" and \"are you fucking kidding me\" kind of reactions.\\n\\n\r\nWith that rant out of the way, now for the part I've been waiting to talk about - THE SOUND.  I have so many things to say about the sound.  The new tracks were mostly sad piano pieces that just contributed to the whole melodrama of the whole thing and the tracks from the game were frequently used out of place.  I distinctly remember one of the calmer, peaceful tracks being put in a trial scene.  Remember how trials are basically you decided whether you lived or died?  Yeah, calm and peaceful isn't the kind of song you want to be going for in that situation.  It just kind of ruins the whole intense and stressful analysis that the game executed so well for the sake of...basically nothing.  I'm not sure why some tracks were placed in certain scenes but whatever they were aiming to accomplish definitely wasn't working.  Don't get me wrong, the songs from the OST are phenomenal and definitely worth a listen.  It's enjoyable to hear them when done right in the anime; they're just misplaced a lot of the time.  Now, the voice acting is awesome.  I'm not completely particular about voices but I do have my preferences and I'll just say that Danganronpa takes the cake.  I can't go into too much depth on this part but I think watching the anime will make you realize why I'm saying this as it goes on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd rate Danganronpa 6/10, give or take a number or two (although it's definitely not deserving of an 8 in my book).  Yes, this adaptation has its negatives that still make it look bad without being put next to the game but it can still be an enjoyable series to watch.  The plot really is its strong point and the fact that it can potentially keep you interested and watching regardless if you think everything else is bad or not should say something.  The OST itself is pretty good (and definitely unique) and the voice acting is amazing.  The art and animation is tolerable and the characters aren't particularly deep but still charming.  If you're willing to look past all the negatives I'd say have at it, but if you want to see Danganronpa at its full potential I'd say go for the game.  My best advice is to not go in expecting much as you'll have your expectations completely obliterated.  I can understand why the anime initially got as hyped up as it did but I'm sure if fans knew it was gonna turn out like this we'd glorify it much less but still encourage you to watch it as it is worth watching.",

            "content": "Ok let me get this out of the way for all those complaining about the anime not living up to the video game. A game and a Anime are two different things and i wont be using the game in this review because its just not a very comparable subject. OK on to the review.\r\nStory: The concept of the story isn't very original; but the way they took on the concept was. the hole concept of killing someone while at the same time you cant get caught by others hasn't really been done like this before. the whole trial system was good too but feltlike it was a little rushed but for me rushing it wasn't as bad of a thing as other say; it kept me watching and because of the fast pace i wasn't bored at all; the down side to this is i wasn't as surprised either when a \"twist\" happened.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where the series fell short because you don't really learn much about the characters in this anime. The information you do get on the background of the characters if you actually get some is very little and doesn't contribute much to the story. They do focus on the characters but not the same way (or should i say not in the way the should) compared to other anime. They focus more on the character at the present moment and how they act towards things then actually getting to know them and telling about there past which really brings the rating down.\\n\\n\r\nArt: i don't know why people where so angry about the art it felt very fitting for this type of anime. Its was bright and colorful while at the same time eerie and sinister which kept me glued to the screen. Also it made each character very individual and very easy two spot what kind of person they where gonna be and made me more surprised when some characters had more to them than expected. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack was enjoyable for me. not as much to say about it though. if you like the sound track to persona 2 your gonna like the soundtrack for this (weird and obscure i know)\\n\\n\r\nI played the game after i watched the anime so i don't know if that's the reason why i like the anime more than others. either way i don't care the game and the anime are two different things with a similar story that take on the story in two completely different ways. This is why is why its a bad idea to compare these two and i hope future reviewers see this and think about how different they are before making a review.\\n",

I know everyone is saying ''Animu is bad play the GAME'' but at first I watched the anime it was 6 decent at first but then I heardof that VN and played it and it was nice after that I give the anime 4 why ''bad adaptation'' will you say but HELL NO anime did It's work and promoted the game nicely. Anime was just a commercial about this VN but why the heck did I change my score to 4 the reason is I have played the VN and like everyone the VN was better than anime but now you are asking ''Why the heck did you say about us saying 'bad adaptation' is wrong now you did even say it'' the answer is simple. The commercial or ''the anime'' you could say did it is job right it made me play the VN. But I realized anime was a bad adaptation is it good? No It is actually good to be honest when you learn something from animes about a thing you didn't know you realize how bad was adaptaton but then get into the original thing and creators making the good money about it. That why the reason to call it a bad adaptation but that is actually the point of the show to realize how bad it was so it made us play the VN and making us hate about it and even sometimes cringe fanboys are involved in this they always say ''Hey you Stop watching the animu the GAME is better play it''(By the way that is how I learn about VN of Danganronpa) and then everyone plays game and cringe fanboys are increasing that is funny actually but a very decent way to make money this is why I call it a ''smart way to make money'' that is all for the fanboys of VN. Now let's look at the show :\\n\r\nDanganronpa is just for making money so I will start with 5 point if you read the first paraghraph you understand what I mean. The art in the Danganronpa anime is godly I mean literally godly you can see there is to much styles out on the show. They do even used scenes that are in the VN  and it was hella crazy but the art doesn't make the show a 10/10 so as a person who don't care about animation it didn't make me feel like I am less animated then them. I just laughing at sound effects and opening on the show Monokuma just sounds like a Japanese grandmother on the show that was funy actually as a main character to sound like that or the opening as english felt weird beacause I haven't see that much of english opening and opening was just Monokuma dancing and showing bunch of useless characters. Did I say characters well Danganronpa don't make you try to love the characters they are just there just sit down and watch them die. It doesn't even bother you they are just dying and you are watching that is all. If you empatize one of them sorry he/she will die because the show is make all the characters die except detective kuudere , useless main character , book worm yandere , dumbass , a rich asshole and a pair of boobs is living in the end that sure is a bad cast but I watched the show just for Monokuma I haven't seen an evil main character like him before but it was sure annoying that ''despair is love despair is life'' speeches of him (or her maybe I could say) are repetitive and always shown on the show as ''Despair will win'' but the good guys ''Hope will win'' uh damn it ''Why don't we just live our own lifes and don't even care about despair or hope'' that is a better answer. That words are just the full story and It didn't even make sense why the heck is despair always try to beat hope or why the heck does the hope try to beat despair that story is bad as a sack of shit stacked in to a bag of garbage because It don't even make sense is there an origin of hope and despair I hope someday We learn that. Someday actually doesn't look that far don't it but it sure is far far far away. My favourite part of the VN are not inclueded in the anime or 2 of my favourites Investigation time and Free time. Did you remember an episode you see Invstigation time fully. The answer is no Don't it whatever even if We did see it it was 2 or 4 things don't even explained in the VN It was really easy to find the answer but anime don't even exlained the details that is a huge problem and there are no Free times. In the VN We could talk and hangout with characters such as a Otaku pig , a Goth , the best girl , trap and more but man like as I say if you don't empatize you don't get sad for them dying to be honestly. I do give this anime 3/10 adding 1 more point just for kind heartness 4/10",

            "content": "Disclaimer: I have not played the game nor did I know that the anime was based off of the game. I am judging this solely off the anime and do not have a bias towards the game or anime. With that being said, Danganronpa: Academy of Hope and High School Students of Despair seems interesting at first but quickly falls off as the series goes on. The characters are colorful with clothing and hair unrealistically overdone. But this soon gets boring as it follows what I like to call the 1-2 guide.\r\nThe 1-2 guide is when one episode it sets up the problem and/or introducesthe conflict and the second episode immediately resolves it. This is incredibly boring and repetitive showing no creativity or uniqueness as the viewer just sometimes wants to skip past some of it because they all know what is going to happen. Without revealing too much the main character, Naegi, is as bland and boring as they come with little to no redeeming factors. Monobear looks pretty cool and puts off the cut yet dangerous look. \\n\\n\r\nThe first part of the 1-2 guide sets up who is going to be killed, i.e. if there are 4 people then person 1 kills person 4 and the remaining 3 must figure who did it by finding clues. After they find clues they move onto the second part which is a trial in which all the remaining people (person 1, person 2 and person 3) all come together as they try to get the \"black\". At first the way things were done was interesting and I was intrigued to see all the characters try to fight for survival while also killing off their fellow classmates. \\n\\n\r\nSadly this quickly gets boring as it is easy to find out who did it. There is no sense of wonder or even having to think hard as the clues are spoonfed to both the viewer and the people. The killer is always obvious and the way he/she tries to hide what they have done is pathetic. Once episode 5 hit I instantly got bored and wanted to turn off the anime and watch something else. \\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't that bad until it gets to the death scenes. The way they draw out each person is for some good, and for others bad, here it is bad. I found the animation horrible and it looked like something I could make if I got bored one day. The animation for the rest of the anime is good and some of the characters look over the top but still pretty cool. Sadly not much changes and with limited places not only where they can go, but also with limited people, the art doesn't change too much and is sad. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters all seem and look colorful. Most of them are the average stereotypes like the pretty girl, the strict hall moniter and the adolescent rebellious biker. They are all drawn in their own style though and I liked how some of them looked. Although they the characters are limited because they are isolated from the world and without spoiling much, they don't gain anything new as the anime goes on with the exception of a few twists here and there. I like how some of the characters looked, while others... not so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is forgettable, I do not remember a single song as it did not appeal to me. I enjoy music from as far back as the 1940's to the present day. Music can be creative and unique or boring, bland and repetitive. Danganronpa has no memorable music that stuck out to me. Even thought the opening is different then normal anime openings if I wanted to listen to a rap like anime opening I would listen to Samurai Champloo's opening Battle Cry by Nujabes (I do Recommend a listen).\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime doesn't offer much from the generic style that most animes follow today. It is uninteresting and has an ending which I found underwhelming and disappointing. In my opinion you should not watch this anime and instead save yourself (average anime length, with commercials, 30 minutes x number of episodes 13) 390 minutes or 6 1/2 hours of your life. It goes without saying that this anime has no replay credibility at all.\\n\\n\r\nSeparate Scores for those who are curious:\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 2\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nenjoyment: 3\\n\r\nAverage Overall: 4.0\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever hated a show so much that you need to keep watching it just so you can rant about it with more legit arguments? Have you ever hated something so much you need to research it so you can explain to anyone why it sucks? Because those are my feelings towards this series.\r\nI'm not gonna talk about the premise. You already know it if you are reading this, MyAnimeList has a description. And actually, I thing the plot could be good, if well done. Which might have been the case on the game. I didn't play it, so I have no idea ifit was. The thing is, in the series, it is not.\\n\\n\r\nSaying the characters are \"flat\" is an understatement. They are pathetic. Monokuma in particular. I'll talk about him later. Their talents? The \"special traits\" that helped this characters get selected for the school? The reason they are considered \"high class students\"? Justified in two or three of them. The rest of their \"special traits\"  are not worthy of the name. Like, seriously, since when can I get a scholarship on a super-advanced and prestigious school by being a \"super duper magazine collector\" or a \"Super duper rebel\"? (Not to mention the fact that they actually use the words \"super duper\", like an 8 year old would)\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, I can not stress this enough: THIS CHARACTERS ARE PATHETICALLY DESIGN. Visually and psychologically. They are the poorest excuse of a character. Maybe with one or two exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the fucking bear. He is not the cinical mastermind that should be running the whole thing. Some of his actions make no sense. One minute he is bored and wants something interesting to happen, the next he is getting bored WHILE the \"interesting\" thing IS happening. He is obnoxious, annoying, predictble as hell. Also, because of his design, there's no way of telling what the fuck his blushes, o his sweat beads, or anything that happens with his face means. Seriously, LEARN HOW TO FUCKING DESIGN A CHARACTER.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are bad the whole time, but they become plainly HORRIBLE in the execution scenes. Sure, it's fun the first time, maybe the second one too. After that, you just realize they are the cheapest attempt at doing something interesting but without spending too much money on it. Actually, the amount of still drawings used in the series makes me wonder if the producers where part of a \"who can make an anime spending the less posible money on it\" bet. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the mystery solving goes: While some of the murders are solved in an interesting way, there are some cases that have a, here I go again, PATHETIC resolution. And when I say pathetic, I mean that the clue to solving them is overly used... and in kids shows. Seriously, I don't want to be specific, but NO ONE with a television could make mistakes like those after murdering someone and trying to play innocent. All of the murderers go crazy and start rambling and shouting nonsense when they are discovered. It gets old really fast. And some of the cases have strings that are never tied up. Clues that make no sense once the mistery is solved.\\n\r\nAnother thing to say about the mistery solving, is that it is not posible to tag along as a viewer. Why? Because when a characters says something that will give the killer away, it is shown as text on the screen. So, non of that fun for us. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the \"emoitional\" moments lack emotion, and the comedy is bizarre and sick. I guess some like that tipe of comedy. What can I say, killing someone by turning them into a sauce and eating them is very, very far away from my definition of comedy. Also, the bear being annoying or the characters being overly ridiculous and overly stereotiped are the most used \"comedy moments\" in the series. Might I say, those are even more pathetic attempts at comedy. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the last episode. Oh god, how it shows the true spirit of the whole thing: CRAP.\\n\r\nThe bigest plot twist? Not only doesn't make sense, but also has a ton of mistakes. The last death? Well, there's actually like five of them. And it's only one person dying. Only, they don't die, even if they clearly should. They just keep being alive and getting killed in different ways.\\n\r\nThe main character of the episode? Triple, if not tetra presonality. Seriously, it changes back and forth between Psyco, Basic-stupid-hamsterlike-anime girl, Fetish-boobs-teacher, Serious, Traumatized and Normal. ALL THE FUCKING TIME. For no reason whatsoever, not adding anything to the atmosphere of the scene, and making the whole thing just plainly annoying.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the last episode, there was a little something that makes me think there will be a sequel to this anime. Needless to say, I will stay the hell away from it.",

            "content": "Initially I had no intention of writing a review for Danganronpa, because I didn't really think it deserved one. I thought it was a weird little show without much substance and even less creative story writing, but that it offered enough mild entertainment to balance it out. However, the more I thought about it the more I disliked it. And after thinking a good while, I disliked it so much that I decided to write a review and vent a little, as well as hopefully deter anyone who had considered watching this show. (As an aside, this review won't even touch on the multifarious plotissues this show had, because had the show been successful in other areas, they could have possibly been forgiven.)\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, who the heck drew this thing?! When the show started out, I thought the characters' bizarre appearances were somewhat interesting, and had the show been at least mildly good, they would have been appealing. But as the show advanced and became more and more twisted, the characters\u2019 brightly colored, ridiculously idiosyncratic appearance took on a sickening quality that made every disturbing turn seem worse. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on, \"We're Really Really Trying To Be Disturbing And Creepy\" should have been the tagline for this show, as its only goal seemed to be showing how cruel acts carried out by and on teenagers are good fodder for horror shows. But to be honest, they even failed at showing that. It was almost painful how hard they were trying to actually be scary. What was even more painful was that besides that goal, there really was no point to Danganronpa. At all. And as horrible as this sounds, the show was really boring until someone was brutally murdered. The lack of plot and character development almost left you WANTING someone to die, just so something would actually be happening. This fact was re-emphasized repeatedly throughout the show, with every pathetic \"moment of peace\" that came directly before a murder. It was as if the creators of this show came up with the whole high school ruled by an immortal, murderous robot bear wherein the students kill each other idea, but didn't know the first thing about actual human interaction (let alone the basic tenants of fluid story-writing), so they threw in little \"funnies\" in the form of conversations between characters that I assume they thought real people would actually have. But juxtaposed with the horrific character of the show, these moments of \u201chumanity\" seemed like a joke, and not the kind that actually delivers a message and makes you stop to think. No, it was the kind of joke that your annoying Uncle Bob tells at every family get-together and gets cheesier and cheesier with ever re-telling. In short, what little character development the show tried to have was actually a show-killer.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I would like to talk about redemption. Redemption is the source of all hope in the world. It is the reason we fight poverty, seek to protect those abused, and long for peace instead of war. Redemption is a second chance. Redemption speaks to the whole of humanity on an integral level, because we all seek it, in one way or another. Redemption is the one thing which could have saved Danganronpa. So many people had died and so much had been lost that even redemption for a few would have seemed poor compensation for all the hurt done, but it would have given us a reason to hope. It would have made us stand with the characters and hope for a brighter future which could turn the darkness of our respective pasts into something beautiful and better for everyone. Sadly, Danganronpa did not seek redemption for the victims of its lousy story telling and absurd animation. Instead, its ending slapped you in the face with its lack of redemption. It gave you a little sputtering flame of hope and then promptly snuffed it out. I could almost feel the creators sneering as the final episode came to a close. Something being disturbing isn't always bad. Heck, one of my favorite anime/manga is Gunslinger Girl, a series with a plotline that practically revolves around the disturbing. The difference is, again, redemption. When hope is removed from the equation, everything crumbles into crapiness. Danganronpa was certainly no exception. \\n",

            "content": "My experience finding Dangan Ronpa was a weird one. I was in the family car, and I kept seeing the subbed episode on my sister's iPad. I caught episodes 9,10, and 11. So naturally, I was already spoiled for who lived and who died.  I didn't even know it was a game.\r\nLet me get this straight: as an adaptation of the game, it's mediocre at best. Only the class trials had the same amount of quality. But that's because they took a different approach. Instead of having Naegi walk everybody through the trial as he did in the game, everybody was able to contribute,this streamlined it, and didn't run the risk of the other characters looking like idiots.\\n\\n\r\nI'll get right onto the voice actors. With the exception of Bryce Papenbrook as Makoto Naegi, none of the game actors are returning. Papenbrook absolutely nails it as Naegi as he's had experience fine-tuning the role over multiple previous appearances. But with the exception of Togami (Spouting the same English VA as Sadao Maou, ironically), none of the voice actors quite know how to play their roles. I kept hearing other roles the actor played. I don't hear Maizono, I hear Kaede Kayano. I don't hear Asahina, I hear Emilia the Hero. I don't hear Junko, I hear Liz Thompson.\\n\\n\r\nThe back-end was horribly rushed. Not even an extra long episode 13 can alleviate some of its problems. 13 episodes was probably the right length, but 22-25 minutes per episode was not enough. There's enough material here for episodes twice that length. Just look at the game. All the free-time events, all the subtle visuals to incorporate. The script was writing itself, and with a franchise like Dangan Ronpa (2 critically-acclaimed games strong at that point with more on the way), as long as you made it halfway decent, fans were going to buy it. They'll get their friends hyped for it.\\n\\n\r\nI call this the Scott Pilgrim of anime. (It doesn't help that Makoto looks like Scott.) Yeah, it's an adaptation that's good on its own, but the original medium is so much better.",

            "content": "To start my review I would like to start things off by saying, my rating on this anime will be based off of the anime alone.  I am well aware that this started as a game and got turned into anime and like all things before they get animated, was most likely better.  For all the sections I cover,  I will break things down and at the end of the section there will be a tl;dr (too long, didn't read) for those who want to get straight to the point.  I would like to give an apology in advance if thereare any spoilers in my review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story: 7.5\\n\r\nThe foundation of Danganronpa is set quite clearly and successfully. A group of highschool students are taken as hostage. They can only escape if they kill another student. If one is gutsy enough to kill one of their classmates, there is an investigation and trial session in which the group discuss who the killer is. The investigative process is timed so collecting clues will be limited. So characters are not just blurting out names of the ones they hate during the trail process, they have to come to a unanimous decision together on who the killer is. If the classes guesses right, the killer gets punished, if they are wrong, they get punished . There are indeed motives and intensives set. There is a dilemma on both sides whether or not you commit a murder. There is very, very, little romance in here (if you could call it that).  It would've definitely been a  plus if there was a more well developed romance. Reason being love triangles are always a good way to add further twists and motives. Given the 12 episode limit, you are just squeezing things together while at the same time not forgetting about key events.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr - Danganronpa has an adequate story . It meets all plot devices, an exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Just the way it was executed could have been done a better.  Also gets a definite minus 1 for almost no romance with that abundance of characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6.5\\n\r\nFrom the cover, the art looked great. The tone of the anime to me felt a bit retro, futuristic and colorful. The reason why I  rated so low was when it came to the punishments and the plot twists of facts it was so... flat and basic. I mean this is where the person dies or pleads to the classmates that they were not the one who did it. I remember seeing the first death (not spoiling any names) but I was so excited to see how this character was going to be executed, but instead it was just a total let down. So to me it felt like there should've been more. There was definitely a balance, not just a typical chop off head, and blood spurts out everywhere type, but was still disappointing. I mean in an anime you animate!  I do understand that there some people who are a fan of the simple and done, but for an anime with a futuristic type set tone, doing a plain and simple doesn't quite cut it. (Okay, maybe I lied, blood spurting out does sound good in this type of anime.)\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr - It was not creative enough in the parts that mattered the most which is a total buzz kill. In an anime, you animate!\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music - 7 \\n\r\nAside from the art cover, I usually judge whether  I want to watch an anime or not  is based on the opening theme song. As we all know good theme songs = good anime, look at Shingeki no Kyojin for example! The intro was a below average intro to me. Like I stated in the art section, the song also gives this anime a futuristic tone. It was not something catchy and remember-able. If a song is about hope and beating despair, the voice needs to be that way as well. The woman did have a good voice, but her tone was a little off in my opinion.  Another example I'll use to show my point is LiSA's Sword Art opening, Crossing Field. She had a very strong and encouraging voice that matched with what she was saying in the lyrics. There was none of that in here. That being said, the best part of the intro is when the woman transitions and starts singing, there's a little sexy and slow dance that Monobear does which I found hilarious and entertaining itself, it gets a plus one in sound and in art just for that. (hopefully you do too so i don't look crazy).  Now for inside the anime, it does use pretty well quality sounds. To put it simply, when it needs to be creepy and suspicious, you got creepy and suspicious background noises.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr - Monobear can work it! But really, I cannot stress enough how important it is that if everything shows Danganronpa is a futuristic anime, the art needs to match the feel where it matters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s) - 7.5\\n\r\nNow with animes that introduce a group of potential  main characters all at once, they all get a minus in character development because of the quantity and not enough quality, they cannot fully bring out the true character. So in return, you kind of don't give a shi* about some. This one is no exception, with that many characters, you kind of forget who your following or who that character is. Of course if they fully developed the characters there wouldn't be enough episodes so I am not bashing on Danganronpa completely on this. They did well in the time allotted. Because of the amount of characters there are of course \"throw away characters\" . Now I don't know if the producers we're trying for this but some characters were just annoying, such as Genocider. I understand that she's supposed to be some sort of deranged maniac murderer, but that voice just kills me. It sucks too because she was pretty cool(I personally like bipolar characters especially if the other half is psychotic), but that damn voice! If they we're going for  an annoying voiced super villain, they succeeded! Still doesn't get a plus in this section though. One thing I was kind of half and half on was the title these characters received, which were Super Duper ______ insert personality here. I think it's corny,  on the other hand whenever I heard the full title in the anime it was just so entertaining.  In this section I'll give a plus to Monobear's \"Ping, pong, pang\" announcements (or is that supposed to be in sounds XD, whatever). In my opinion, the best characters were, Monobear, Naegi, Kirigiri and Enoshima (wish she had a longer part).\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr - Not fully developed characters and because some aren't they kind of get on your nerves when they finally do get a bit a dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7.5\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime, even if there are some shaky rushed parts. In some animes you have to get to the middle and sometimes even close to the end where you're like, \"Dang this is getting pretty intense\". To me because it was so rushed, you are getting hit with all these different things and if you do comprehend them it feels like your stuck in the same dilemma as the characters. That being said in later episodes it does lose it's steam as it has to wrap even more things up, so there are more unanswered situations that we just have to live with. It is personally better to me to end with a big bang, that start with one,(don't be a Vegeta and use your ultimate move and the have nothing to back it up in-case it fails). Nonetheless, personally I enjoyed the anime. It's one of those animes where, you will go to the next episode because you do want to know what happens next, not because you started it and now you have to finish it.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr - I believe the ending sentences said it best. In my opinion, this is a type of anime that you will click next episode on for the sake of wanting to know what happens next, not just wanting to finish it because you started already.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7 \\n\r\n(Since this is only four sentences, there will be no tl;dr.)\\n\r\nWith everything to consider I do believe this anime is something people should watch. It was an adequate anime that did not fail too hard, but did not do too amazingly well. So it get's an adequate score from me. This is where simple and done works :P.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Statements / Final Thoughts\\n\r\nI do understand that fans that have played the game will be a bit disappointed in this anime, but like I said in the first paragraph, to those who have never even heard of the game and are considering to watch it should. If your like me and have finished watching all the amazing animes for the Summer and are waiting for Fall animes, this surely will kill a little bit of time.  Watching over 100 animes, this is my first review so I would like people who found this helpful to tell me and those who didn't what I would need to work on. If you took enough time to say it was bad,say why, not just say it was horrible. You won't hurt my feelings I promise...or maybe you will but it's okay! I would like to end this review by saying thank you for reading it even if it was just the tl;dr's and hopefully it helps answers your question to, \"should I or should I not watch this anime.\" \\n",

            "content": "To me, Danganronpa is the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of anime (see the avgn if you don't get what I mean). First off let's see the anime main selling points. The artwork is okay, the anime is kinda artistic without being particularly good. The OST really is the main strength of this show, the opening is nice to the hear and give you a decent minute and a half worth watching and might give you the impression that what you'll watch will be good. You can't be more wrong though, the fun definitely ends here! \r\nFirst off, making an anime out of agame rarely does anything good and this show is no exception to this rule. The premise is interesting, you might be wondering if you should give it a try but let me tell you why you should not. I haven't played the game and I am pretty sure the game should be good, but this adaptation is up there on my list of the worst anime I've ever seen with the like of Eiken. The characters are very unlikable, you got almost no information on them until something very bad happen to one of them like dying for example. That makes everything very chaotic and unpredictable, and when I say everything, I mean everything. You won't be able to find anything that is actually happening, from what are the mysteries surrounding the area to who did it. The problem is the character don't share much information and you don't have access to what they are thinking. That's a very big problem because when they will try to find who did it, you won't have all the information because the character will keep it to themselves. I'm pretty sure that in the actual game you can act in order to get those information and sort them out before you actually get to deliberate who did it. Receiving information like 2 second before resolving a crime is not a very good thing to do in a show, it should be resolvable. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not that bad from this point, the anime can still be like a 4/10 or something, every episode are not fun at all to watch, but I've seen worst, like the second part of Guilty Crown for example. But so far, having done a very similar show to the game really was not a good idea; it does not goes well with the pacing of an anime, a 13 episode one in addition of that. Other minors things that bugs me is the censorship, why is it even there? The story is kinda dark, there's murder theme, blood, hatred... why would you censor this anime? Then again it's not that bad but why make the blood pink? Is that a kids show?\\n\\n\r\nSo what was getting me to continue watching this? The answer is the story. Till now, the story is really interesting because of it's randomness, but one thing can make this whole mess be worth watching. If the ending is good, and it has the potential to be, I would give this anime a fair amount of point. The ending of the show was on another level that I have yet unseen, something absolutely replaceable in my memory, something I can say that I am proud that I witness it, but for all the wrong reason. I had some idea of how bad an ending could be, Guilty Crown and Spiral where my best screwed up ending example till i saw this. Danganronpa pushes the very limit of bad ending to a whole new level. I won't spoil it, but it's bad, super bad. It's so cliche, unrealistic, random and mind blowing. I swear to god this anime was made for 5 or 6 years old kids, nobody can makes any kind of sense out of the ending. I mean with all the information we have, with means like not at all because once again, everything is trowed to our faces at the very end, right just before the conclusion, anything could have made sense I guess. To give you an example, imagine you favorite show, and add to the ending that an extraterrestrial put all the memories into the mind of the main character and then shot to another planet, to live a complete different story, how would that sounds like? Danganronpa's ending give the same feeling.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you still want to give it a try, please don't. Play the game, I'm sure it should be good like other one of this genre. Watching the anime will refrain you of doing that, you'll know about too much of the story to enjoy the game I think. Danganronpa might be the worst commercial to a game to date and sure is, out of more than 200 animes, to the bottom of my entire list.",

I really like the story and the conflict in this anime.\r\nThe basic premise of Danganronpa is that 15 high school students are trapped in a school an the only way to get out is to solve murders or get away with murder. So this anime is basically find the killer and have him/her punished via execution or get the wrong person who committed the crime and die while the real criminal gets released.\r\nThe characters all have unique characteristics emphasized in this anime. The two best characters are Naegi and Kirigiri. They have thebest chemistry in this show because of their platonic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment I got from this anime was beyond my expectation. There were only little nit-picks that I don't like about this anime, but overall it is a great show. Every trial in this show was outstanding not only because it was life or death, but because it just throws the viewer curveball after curveball and the actual person who committed the crime is someone that you never expected.",

            "content": "Danganronpa: Academy of Hope and Students of Despair. Just from the title of this anime you are intrigued as to what it could be about and as to where it leads to. This anime is basically a mystery genre and I believe it to be very well done. My only complaint that would keep it from being a 10 is the rushed feeling you get. But let's get into this review!\r\nStory: 9\r\nThis story has quite a unique setup for animes that I haven't really seen before. Essentially 14 of the best students in their particular areas (Super Duper High School Students) are gathered together alongwith one lucky person to attend this academy that guarantees success in life upon graduation. Everything sounds great until upon entering the school, everyone is knocked out and reawaken to a summoning by the principal who is a talking bear named Monokuma. He informs the students that they are trapped within the school and the only way to escape is to kill another student and not be voted guilty during a trial period in which the whole class participates to try and decide who the murderer was. As the story progresses, it focuses on the murders and mysteries within the school rather than the character interactions as a whole, and the classroom trials that take place, all determining who was the murderer. Quite a unique setup. The murders that take place a well thought out and it is quite difficult to figure out who the culprit is until soon before they announce them,\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nOur main protagonist is Makoto Naegi who is the lucky student selected to attend this wonderful academy. His personality on the whole is quite bland, however he does get along well with the rest of the characters and does his job well. Most of the story is told from his perspective and on the whole he is a likeable character. Another notable character includes Kyouko Kirigiri who is extremely cool under pressure and helps Naegi the most in figuring out mysteries. There is a bond of trust between the two developed as their time together increases and they learn to rely on each other, even with the situation they are presented with. On the whole they are memorable characters each with their own specialty area that makes them unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound + Art: 8\\n\r\nI really enjoyed listening to the Opening and Ending songs for Danganronpa, and the music chosen throughout the anime itself is suspenseful and creates the right atmosphere. The art is quite good as well, particularly with the executions that are done in a cinematic style.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime and finally being able to finish it off. It had me on the edge of my seat, excited for what would come next and how things were going to be solved. If you are into the genre of mystery then I highly recommend watching this anime.",

            "content": "Upupupupupu..... Today's quote \"Life is always full of surprises\".\r\nI have never seen an anime which surprise me to the point where I almost lost my guard. I enjoyed this anime so much.\r\nDangan means bullet and ronpa means refutation.\r\nRefutation means \"disproof a statement\".\r\nPLOT (9):\r\nPOM POM POM POM. The students will be very surprised when they entered Hope's Peak Academy. They will realise that this is a game of torture whereby only one of them will graduate from this school if he or she manages to kill someone without anyone being aware of it at all. The game which requires wits to solve mysteries. HAHA! I managedto fool them. Anyway, cut the joke. \\n\\n\r\nLerche, the company that produces this anime who also produced Carnival Phantasm also took the effort to come up with anime \"Danganronpa\", which is a game adaptation. This anime was compressed into 13 episodes which will be a very difficult task to do that, and Lerche managed to successfully compress it into 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode, starts off with the introduction to the characters and the following episodes will focus on the mystery aspects of the show. Each mystery has 2 episodes. However, sadly the anime did not focus on the free-time events of each characters just like the game did.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't get me wrong, this is one of the best set-ups in anime I have ever seen and it could have been longer and more enjoyable because the comedy in the first episode has made me laugh so hard and the first episode leaves me with excitement about how this anime turns out to be. The mystery scenes are awesome, it surprised me a lot and it kept me on the edge of my seat wanting for more. \\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has made use some references like the bullets in the James Bond movie. The bullets are words which can strike a person like to prove something wrong. The court room was designed from the checkers game like saying \"Checkmate\"!. I have never seen such creative images and I will give credit for that. There is a bit of shaky-camera in some executions but at least they handled it very well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (10):\\n\\n\r\nOh my God! The opening and ending themes are awesome. \"Never say Never\" was a cool theme song which I listened again and again and I never get bored by it. \"Despairity, a Hero's Treatment\" was also a cool theme song which I will never get bored after listening to it a lot of times.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a superb job in portraying the voice of the characters. Nobuyo Ooyama's voice was very funny when she portrayed Monokuma for the first episode. Megumi Toyoguchi was funny when she voiced Junko in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\n[Spoiler Alert]\\n\r\nMiyuki Sawashiro's voice was very funny when she did Genocider Sho. \\n\r\n[End of Spoiler]\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (7):\\n\\n\r\n The characters start off as annoying but every trial scene they develop and mature as they learn how to understand people and their surroundings. They also really have great motivation and courage to fight off despair with hope. I will go through the characters\\n\\n\r\nMakoto Naegi - At first, he didn't surprise me because I thought that he would be a wimp throughout the anime. But he went through a development and he had motivation. He believes that hope is always there in a world of despair. I really like his guts.\\n\\n\r\nKirigiri Kyouko - She is my most favorite character throughout the entire series. She is smart, calm and composed. Even though she is cold on the outside, she has a nice personality on the inside. She also showed compassion to all of the characters present even also help Naegi overcome fear. She is one of my favorite character of all time if not probably my #1 favorite character of all time.\\n\\n\r\nCelestia Ludenberg - Her cunning and creepy personality kept me surprised. She is my #2 favorite character in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters that I like:\\n\\n\r\nByakuya Togami, Chihiro Fujisaki, Junko Enoshima, Sakura Oogami, Ishimaru Kiyotaka\\n\\n\r\nIf Junko was in this anime throughout, then I would give her a good recognition. But don't get me wrong, I wanted to see more character development in other characters as well, so that I can get attached to them. I really sympathized with all the characters as they go through mind games and confusion when they are in dire situations.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime. I feel that this anime should extend to 24 episodes because I really enjoyed all the witty dialogues and great character development throughout the anime. But never mind, what's done is done. At least I really appreciated Lerche's effort in compressing the game adaptation to 13 episodes. In fact, if possible, I would like to have an OVA which involves the free-time events of Danganronpa. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime was fast-paced and you really have to pay attention and never miss any episodes. Because if you miss any episodes, you will become more confused and you will have a lot of questions unanswered in the end. If you really like to have comedy mixed with a mystery game to solve. I highly recommend this anime and be prepared for more surprises to come.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people say that comedy anime is not meant to be taken seriously but not all of them are. Comedy is just here to relief depression and make us interested in the anime. Some comedy also give us a great learning experience and they have a darker feel in them. I really feel that this anime doesn't deserve the hate that everyone else thought it to be.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has served a great purpose by telling us that \"In a world of despair, there is always hope\". This is a quote I will never forget. Because with hope, we can conquer anything. \"Dog & Scissors\", you see this is what you are missing.  This is how you make a great comedy by not reusing old materials, develop the characters and also create a learning experience for everyone. It will be one of my favorite anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway for those of you who haven't seen this anime. I give you 3 minutes to stop reading this review and watch Danganronpa now. And your 3 minutes started 2 minutes ago. Carry on.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Silence)\\n\\n\\n\r\nHey, what are you waiting for? Christmas is it? *slaps*",

            "content": "So, this is my first review for an anime that is adapted from a video game that I've never played. Also, my computers broken, so, currently typing this on my mobile, so, excuse any misspellings. \r\nDanganronpa is a show about a group of 15 teenagers, each excelling at a specific skill, who are enrolled in an Academy, where their only way out is to successfully kill one of their fellow classmates and get away with it. If you are caught, you're executed, if you aren't caught, everyone who is innocent gets executed. \r\nStory-9/10- The story of Danganronpa is unique, in that it plays out ina way that keeps you on your toes and guessing who's going to be the culprit. There were many times where iI had thought I had guessed the culprit through logic, only to have it be a completely different person using logic that was equally reasonable. If you're a fan of mysteries that will make you want to re watch it just to find all of the fine details that prove a characters guilt, this is the show for you. \\n\\n\r\nArt-9/10- The ar is another great part about this show, although for the most part its just good, when they get to the execution scenes and mix together the 2d and 3d, it really looks amazing. The character designs are also noteworthy, as they each give them a distinct personality and helps add to the atmosphere of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound-7/10- The ost does its job of keeping the tone and atmosphere of the show consistent, but, that's about it. No songs stand out in particular, but they do a good job of fitting the scenes, and that's all we should really expect. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10- The characters are by far what makes this show for me. Each has a unique personality, and the voice actors really did an amazing job portraying the characters they were given. Although at first it may seem a bit overwhelming by how many characters there are, and how much they each lack development, you come to notice that even those who only get so much as two episodes of screen time play important roles in the story and has an impact on the group. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall -9/10- I've seen many people say that this show is an awful adaptation, and is very rushed, which at sone parts it is. But, having not played the game, and judging it solely on its own, I'd say Danganronpa is definitely worth watching, even if you aren't too fond of mysteries. It's characters are charming and unique, while it's story is gripping, suspenseful and will have you second guessing yourself over who did it. Danganronpa has easily joined my top ten anime of all time and I think everyone should at least try it.",

DanganRonpa is an anime with a great art style and character design that captures the core themes of the anime perfectly.  The pink blood is something that I personally love, it helps to show how messed up the situation these highschoolers are in actually is.  The pink blood also plays well alongside other aspects of the show such as Monobear which take the seriousness of the brutal deaths away and make them somewhat comedic,again showing how twisted the school they are in is.  My favourite thing about DanganRpnpa are the characters, each one is unique and there were none that I disliked, especially Monbear.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few things that forced me to give this show an 8 rather than a 9 or a 10.  Firstly, I felt that it was a little too short, 13 episodes was not enough to do each of the characters justice and many of them were not around long enough for me to get invested inn their story meaning that their deaths did not have as alrge an impact as they could have.  \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, DanganRonpa is a great anime which is well worth watching.  The mysteries behind the  plot and the results of the investigations will keep you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\n8/10",

Supposedly, the story in the game is more developed and I recommend checking that out if you read the blurb on this anime and thought that's exactly what you wanted. \r\nNow the story itself; in a word, broken. The themes it tries to develop amount to nothing and are literally dumped in the last 10 minutes onto the viewer in an attempt to compress 25 hoursworth of gameplay in less then 5 minutes of summary. The execution of said story, through the murder-mystery plot, is just as broken as the attempt to shoe-horn in a 'deep' message at the end. The characters suffer from 'not-being-characters-at-all' and are simply underdeveloped, apart from the MC, who has a consistent if not completely vapid arch. Nothing shows the complete absence of character more then the 'trial' segments, which as mentioned in other reviews feels rather like the ending to the series in that it feels compressed, rushed and bereft of either meaning or other value. It just a reveal of facts, do a group of characters you don't know or care about to solve a mystery which lacks mystery to in the end hear what could be mistaken for a 10 year olds view of the world. \\n\\n\r\nSo as you might have guessed; I really don't recommend this. Having watched this anime before playing the game, I have probably 'spoiled' it, and I advise anyone who reads this to play the game instead if you are at all interested in the story.",

            "content": "Note 1: MAJOR SPOILERS! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE PLAYED DR1 OR WATCHED THE ANIME!\r\nNote 2: This review will rate the Dangan Ronpa 1 media as a whole, which also includes the game, and not strictly just for the anime.\r\nBefore I begin, let me clarify that this review is gonna:\r\n1) Have a lot of fangasms (I am the self proclaimed Ultimate Dangan Ronpa Fanboy, so...)\r\n2) Brutally bash the Japanese voice acting (with harsh language) while critically praising the English dub\r\n3) Rate the Eng dub of both the Dr1 game and Dr1 anime\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nOk, let's begin. Dangan Ronpa is my shit. Practically the BEST game/anime franchise I'vecome across. I love how this franchise portrays the concepts of hope and despair. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely fantastic. Trials are carefully planned and beautifully executed. Plot twists near the end are mindblowing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE the unique art style of Dangan Ronpa. Nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOST is more than just breathtaking. The fact that I play many of the songs of the franchise on repeat says a lot. \\n\\n\r\nJP voice acting: 2/10 (I'm being generous, tbh)\\n\\n\r\nI view the entire Dangan Ronpa franchise as one of the worst cast series of all time in Japanese (#1 worst being Dragonball).\\n\\n\r\nI effing hate Megumi Ogata and most of her roles; she is the voice of Makoto Naegi, the protagonist. Please note that I'm strictly a dub viewer, and it is my policy to reject Japanese ideals on what constitutes as an authentic boy voice. Megumi in particular has offended me greatly by butchering numerous post prepubescent male roles; she is #2 on my Seiyu Shitlist (#1 is Mitsuki Saiga, but given that she's not a part of Dr1, I'm not gonna delve into her). Megumi also has another role in the Dangan Ronpa franchise, but given that it's irrelevant to Dr1, I'm not gonna mention it. Examples include (practically every male character that isn't a kid, but I'll list all of 'em, anyway):\\n\\n\r\n1) Ayato Naoi (Angel Beats - Greg Ayres in dub)\\n\\n\r\n2) Itona Horibe (Assassination Classroom - Ricco Fajardo in dub)\\n\\n\r\n3) Yukito Tsukishiro (Cardcaptors - Steve Staley in dub)\\n\\n\r\n4) Shinji Ikari (Evangelion series - Spike Spencer in dub)\\n\\n\r\n5) Izumi Rio (Fullmoon - Waikun Chan in Chinese dub)\\n\\n\r\n6) Ricardo Gavarni (Chaika - Greg Ayres in dub)\\n\\n\r\n7) Eagle Vision (Rayearth - Jerry Gelb in dub)\\n\\n\r\n8) Misogi Kumagawa (Medaka Box - Leraldo Anzaldua in dub)\\n\\n\r\n9) Yukimura Sanada (Samurai Deeper Kyo - Chris Kromer in dub)\\n\\n\r\n10) Satoru Takishima (Special A - Clint Bickham in dub)\\n\\n\r\n11) Masaya Aoyama (Tokyo Mew Mew - Scottie Ray in dub)\\n\\n\r\n12) Blue Knight (Tokyo Mew Mew - Sean Schemmel in dub)\\n\\n\r\n13) Deep Blue (Tokyo Mew Mew - Andrew Rannells in dub)\\n\\n\r\n14) Kurama (Yu Yu Hakusho - John Burgmeier in dub)\\n\\n\r\n----------------\\n\\n\r\nOh, lookie here. FOURTEEN ROLES butchered. This woman has no respect from me. The fact that pretty much all of Megumi's non-prepubescent male roles are voiced by actual males shows a lot - it shows that America actively rejects inauthentic male voices, or half assed male voices that sound like a woman trying too hard to sound like one, and would rather opt for a real male actor to give out a fully fleshed performance that truly does said male characters justice. Just for clarification: No, I'm not against the practice of females playing as male kids. Keyword: Kids. Think about it - male kids could be portrayed by females because their voices have yet to mature, and quite frankly, females could pull off a much more authentic male kid than actual grown males. Only actual male kids could top off those performances. I am, however, totally against the idea of females playing male TEENS and grown males. There are some exceptions, but Makoto isn't one of them. No siree, no dice here.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, fuck Megumi's portrayal as Makoto; it's garbage. From the clips I've heard, Megumi gave very little emotion as Makoto - sounded like she was reading off of the script most of the time. Her rendition of \"No, that's wrong!\" (or whatever the fuck it's said in Japanese), which is the highlight catchphrase of the entire Dangan Ronpa franchise, is more than just simply disappointing. Megumi says it way too fast. Jesus Christ, slow the fuck down. On top of that, Megumi made Makoto sound like he was unenthusiastic, which is quite literally the OPPOSITE of what Makoto really is. So much for being the Ultimate Hope, am I right? Fuck that shit. Much more enthusiasm is needed to spread hope like a disease. Not that it matters anyway, the performance was gonna suck either way cuz it's a miscast.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on the opposite spectrum, Bryce Papenbrook (also voice of Eren Yeager) truly does Makoto justice by giving the character a more masculinely authentic voice, better acting and shouts, and is the true definition of the entire composition of Makoto's character. Bryce is also the only voice actor to reprise his role for the Funimation dub of the Dangan Ronpa anime, leaving all his LA pals behind. Bryce's rendition of \"No, that's wrong!\" is very awe inspring. Unlike Megumi, Bryce takes his time to enunciate all three words out instead of jamming it into a clusterfuck. I don't know what the JP counterpart of \"No, that's wrong\" is, but I remember it being longer and way less concise and to the point. Also, Bryce sounds MUCH MORE enthusiastic as Makoto, which is something that Megumi was severely lacking. Either way, Dangan Ronpa sucks balls in Japanese; English terminology for this franchise is like, 1000x better.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Koki Miyata gives more than just a saddening performance as the resident trap of the franchise, Chihiro Fujisaki. Most traps are voiced by females; is there a defining characteristic of Chihiro that makes him an exception? No. He is just like any other trap. Fuck Koki's performance; it's a load of shit. Barely even sounded female, and I could tell that it was from a guy almost immediately. Given that Chihiro's actual gender is a plot device in the story, that questionable casting choice is just... no. Whatever intention the author had was fucking lost thanks to Koki. The dub voices of Chihiro for the game and anime are Dorothy Elias-Fahn (Kaoru from Kenshin) and Kara Edwards (Nymph from Heaven's Lost Property). America does not buy into Japan's perspective on what defines as an authentic trap voice, so there. Given that both Eng voices for Chihiro are female, they, of course, without a doubt, gave a more convincing and authentic performance as Chihiro. I personally think Dorothy fits Chihiro better than Kara, though.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the villain. MONOKUMA. God, I fucking hate his seiyu. What was her name again? It's Nobuyo Oyama, I believe. The voice she gave Monokuma was HORRENDOUS - didn't even remotely sound like a male. I mean, Monokuma isn't supposed to have a super manly voice and all, but jeez. That ain't gonna cut it. Brian Beacock (Takato from Digimon Tamers), the English game voice of the same character truly defines the role for what it is. Menacing, fitting voice, great laughter, on point acting, need I say more? In fact, as an aspiring voice actor, I often try my best to imitate Brian's Monokuma voice just for the shits and giggles. Well, enough about Brian. Greg Ayres (Tomoki from Heaven's Lost Property) is the voice of Monokuma in the English anime. While still more fitting than Nobuyo, I don't think he does the role more justice than Brian.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's pretty much all the miscasts I've identified in the first game. So, let's move on to the other characters, shall we?\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nVery interesting characters, but I'm afraid I cannot give a perfect score for this because... well, find out on the next review when I evaluate the charas in... welp, that's a secret. Stay tuned. In any case...\\n\\n\r\nLet me first clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each of the dubs before I evaluate which Eng performance is more to my liking.\\n\\n\r\n--Game--\\n\\n\r\nPro 1: Better voices\\n\\n\r\nPro 2: First names are used as opposed to last names\\n\\n\r\nCon: Weaker acting\\n\\n\r\n--Anime--\\n\\n\r\nPro: Better acting\\n\\n\r\nCon: Some particular voices fall short to the LA counterparts\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\r\nWe're now ready to evaluate each of the characters, save for those that were already evaluated above.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Sayaka Maizono-\\n\\n\r\nEng game: Dorothy Elias-Fahn\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Monica Rial\\n\\n\r\nMonica did the role more justice than Dorothy, given that there were more lines to actually voice for in the anime than in the game. Monica's voice also fits better, too. In the game, only the trials are fully voiced. All other events merely have minimal voice acting (with only short sentences, sighs and grunts); with some exceptions, of course, but you get my point. The fact that Sayaka was the first victim doesn't help Dorothy at all. \\n\\n\r\n-Kyoko Kirigiri-\\n\\n\r\nEng game: Erika Harlacher\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Caitlin Glass\\n\\n\r\nWhile both voice actresses gave a very suiting voice for Kyoko, Caitlin Glass wins my vote here. If both voices are equally as good, the only determinator as to which portrayal is better is evaluating the acting, of course. As I've mentioned above, the anime has better acting. Caitlin more so sounded calm and collected than reading off of the script, which was what Erika did for Kyoko more than 30% of the time. Thus Caitlin wins.\\n\\n\r\n-Byakuya Togami-\\n\\n\r\nEng game: Jason Wishnov\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Josh Grelle\\n\\n\r\nAgain, both VAs did a voice that fit the character. However, Josh Grelle is better than Jason IMO. Jason sounded way too bored as Byakuya; but Josh? Oh boy, he portrayed Byakuya as a highly condescending prick. The tone, his way with words, they all suggest that. And guess what? That's precisely what Byakuya is. A stuck up rich kid that does not view anyone as his equal.\\n\\n\r\n-Kiyotaka Ishimaru-\\n\\n\r\nEng game: Sean Chiplock\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Austin Tindle\\n\\n\r\nBoth voices fit the character, but Austin wins this round for better acting.\\n\\n\r\n-Celestia Ludenberg-\\n\\n\r\nEng game: Marieve Herington\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Lindsay Seidel\\n\\n\r\nGetting sick of me voting Texans over Californians? Well, looks like your wish is about to come true, cuz Marieve fits the role to a effing T.\\n\r\n...actually, Marieve is Canadian, but ANYWAY! Marieve gave Celestia an old English accent to go with her gothic lolita attire. It's completely mindblowing when Celestia snaps and LOSES her accent. That sort of irritation is what makes Marieve better in the role - the acting for this particular character is so much better than Lindsay, aside from the accent. \\n\\n\r\n-Toko Fukawa-\\n\\n\r\nEng game Toko: Amanda C. Miller\\n\\n\r\nEng game Genocider: Erin Fitzgerald\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Carli Mosier\\n\\n\r\nWhile I give Carli props for voicing both the Genocider and regular Toko, the combined efforts of Amanda and Erin completely blows Carli out of the water. Both of Carli's voices do not fit the character as well as Amanda and Erin. Amanda's voice fits Toko better, and also gave the character several attributes that defines what Toko is - a constantly stuttering, easily flustered, and skeptical insecure girl. On the other hand, Erin sounded completely bonkers as the Genocider - which is precisely what she is. Erin's LAUGH in particular is impossible to top - not the seiyu, and not Carli; neither of them could do the Genocider better than Erin.\\n\\n\r\n-Aoi Asahina-\\n\\n\r\nEng game: Cassandra Lee Morris\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Felecia Angelle\\n\\n\r\nBoth voices fit, but I choose Felecia.\\n\\n\r\n-Sakura Ogami-\\n\\n\r\nEng game: Jessica Gee-George\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Rachel Robinson\\n\\n\r\nBoth voices fit and sound similar; they were going for the gruffy tough woman archetype. I choose Rachel for better acting.\\n\\n\r\n-Hifumi Yamada-\\n\\n\r\nEng game: Lucien Dodge\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Tyson Rinehart\\n\\n\r\nI personally view the character as disgusting, so I'll try to keep it short. Lucien does the role better than Tyson because of better acting, and going for the intellectual nerdy voice rather than the shut in goofy nerd. \\n\\n\r\n-Yasuhiro Hagakure-\\n\\n\r\nEng game: Kaiji Tang\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Chris Bevins\\n\\n\r\nKaiji wins. His voice fits the character better, more so than the surfer dude tone with Chris.\\n\\n\r\n-Mondo Owada-\\n\\n\r\nEng game: Keith Silverstein\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Chris Sabat\\n\\n\r\nI choose Keith. Chris Sabat's voice may fit Mondo, but it was a bit too low for my own liking. Keith gives off a cool sounding badass voice for Mondo, so I like it better.\\n\\n\r\n-Leon Kuwata-\\n\\n\r\nEng game: Grant George\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Justin Cook\\n\\n\r\nGrant. Some of the lines he did for Leon were especially memorable, such as:\\n\\n\r\n\"These goddamn shit for brains have got it all wrong, I'm telling you!\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Do I object...? Hell yes I object! Of course I do! I object, I object, I object! I mean, all of this is just a bunch of stupid theories! You need evidence! Where's the evidence!? Without evidence, it's all bullshit! It's bullshit and I refuse to acknowledge it!\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI refuse to acknowledge you! You're stupid! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nJustin's voice, while fitting the character, is not nearly as memorable as that of Grant. I also feel like Grant's acting is more authentic than Justin, so there.\\n\\n\r\n-Junko Enoshima- \\n\\n\r\nEng game voices: Amanda C. Miller and Erin Fitzgerald\\n\\n\r\nEng anime: Jamie Marchi\\n\\n\r\nJamie. Junko is a messed up bitch of despair. Having two people do all of Junko's personalities kinda loses the point of her being the epitome of despair. That, and I think Jamie had better acting to top off all her different voices for the character as well. I also think Jamie's valley girl accent for Junko when she's speaking as herself fits the role because of her status as the Ultimate Fashionista.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's a wrap for all the characters.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNuff said. I'm the Ultimate Dangan Ronpa Fanboy. No need for further elaboration.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDangan Ronpa is my #1 fav franchise. No series of games/anime have gotten me so hooked up before. Kazutaka Kodaka, you sure are something else. Why Dr1 does not have a perfect score will be revealed very soon...",

            "content": "Danganronpa the animation is one of those anime with mixed receiving. The funny thing is that, people who don't like this anime, a lot of them, are actually danganronpa fans. People mostly knew nothing about Danganronpa before watching it, and I'm one of them. \r\nTL;DR: 8/10, but not recommend watching if you like playing game. \r\nSo is Danganronpa a good anime? Yes\r\nPink blood, battle royale with trials, execution, Monokuma. Danganronpa the animation definitely guarantees a fresh and exciting experience for people who knew NOTHING about it. The character design and the \"hope v despair\" theme may be a little bit embarrassing at first, but that'sjust something for people to get used to. The plot is next level, everything in this anime rounds up in the most incomprehensible, but not necessarily acceptable, way.\\n\\n\r\nThe investigation part is clearly not well done. All the evidence just flashes across the screen without explanation, it is almost impossible for audience to guess the killer from the evidence unless they are Sherlock Holmes or have read spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nBut even so, Danganronpa is still a great thriller. The pace is so intense that you don't bother to find out who is the killer is yourself, you just want to watch the next episode!! \\n\\n\r\nI would give it a 8 out of 10 as an anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut did the anime do justice to its source? No. \\n\r\nI played the game and its sequel after I watched the anime. The anime is not nearly as good as the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is so rush that:\\n\r\n1. You know nothing about the characters and they die.\\n\r\n2. Investigation is so short that it is impossible to figure out the culprit by the evidence.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime gives you a feeling that you are like watching a quick walkthrough of the game, as it cut everything from the game except for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nYou won't get blown out by the twist, because you saw it miles away, and you have played the detailed version.\\n\r\nYou won't get terrified by the execution, because you have seen it multiple times.\\n\r\nYou won't get emotional (except chapter 4) becasue you haven't spend much time with the characters.The team decided to make it as a 1-cour thriller so the character part is sacrifised. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not a very good anime for people who have played the game. maybe a 5 or 6 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nBut at the end of the day, I don't think it is ever fair to call an anime bad because the game is better. Anime has its own limitation, you can't expect a 4-hour anime can display every merit from a almost 40-hour game. Compromising  is a must. \\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa the animation is definitely a successful anime that introduce a lot more people into the franchise, including me. I still remember how excited I am when I first watched this anime, how scared I am watching the first execution, how shocked I am when I learned the truth, and how cautious I am when using the Internet because spoilers are everywhere. I'm very glad that this anime exists even it cannot represent the game. Without this anime, I don't think I would ever learn about this franchise, and play Danganronpa 2 (which is still my favourite game up to date).",

            "content": "Danganronpa is a steroid-enhanced Judge Judy drama that brings together a perfect mix of mystery, horror and sometimes comedy to create an overall exhilarating anime watching experience. \r\nAn example of comedy within this seemingly bleak anime would be the wacky accompanying art style of this anime that adds a somewhat comedic twist to the gloomy deaths that follow from Monokuma\u2019s tyrannical rule upon the 15 \u2018good guy\u2019 characters.\r\nMonokuma is clearly set up to be the main antagonist of the series from episode one, with a podium for extra clarification, but the initial feel that is presented by his appearance and voicing doesn\u2019t fully pass thisidea across us, and rather creates a mixed opinion. However, it becomes evidently apparent that Monokuma is a despised character in Danganronpa, encased in an extremely infuriating position of absolute control over our beloved protagonists due to an unfair booby-trapped environment. It is this annoyance that is sparked within us, the viewers, towards Monokuma that make the demises of some of our favoured characters even more gut-wrenching and painful to watch as the series progresses. \\n\\n\r\nYet even though Danganronpa pushes us, the audience, to complete agony through the relentless assault of beloved waifu-esque (or husbando-esque) characters, the complementation of a stimulating mystery for practically all episodes throughout the series makes the idea of not continuing damn near impossible. It is this impossibility that holds us firmly in place as it slowly dissects the hope from our hearts, the distant hope that our favourited character will somehow survive the horrors of Hope Peak Academy and turn Monokuma into a monochrome pin cushion, roasting above a fire in hell. The underlying mysteries revolving around Hope\u2019s Peak Academy also inspire intrigue within us, pushing the viewer\u2019s perspective away from the direct interactions between the characters in the series and more towards a greater, darker realisation that is to be revealed as the series moves forward. \\n\\n\r\nThe harsh puppeteer that is Danganronpa yanks at the heartstrings, especially with a dismaying realisation near the end of the series, that is equally followed by a somewhat satisfactory conclusion that unfortunately leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Danganronpa is a sensational mystery-filled adventure that will consistently keep you hammering at the next episode button with its enigmatic nature and thrilling premise of death and judgement. Nevertheless if this electrifying anime doesn\u2019t grab your attention through any of its plot or key aspects, then at least stay for Asahina, I mean\u2026..come on\u2026..have you seen her? \ud83d\ude09\\n\\n\\n\r\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 This review is solely based off my personal opinion and does not intend to conflict with other people\u2019s views about this anime.\\n",

            "content": "This review will mostly echo what others have said, and that is: play the games first, then watch the anime if you'd really like to. I had played the first two games (plus UDG) before watching this, and did so to stick to my fandom completion ratio, I suppose. I've had friends look at me funny when I say that I like Danganronpa and then start talking about the anime; when I clarify that I'm talking about the games, they usually respond by admitting that they didn't know the games existed. \r\nTrigger Happy Havoc as a game is, well, much more well-rounded than its animeadaptation. I don't entirely blame the team behind it, as it is tremendously hard to fit as much material as said game has into thirteen episodes, but I do think they should have pushed for more. I'll go into my two main gripes with this adaptation. \\n\\n\r\n1) Incredibly fast pacing. I had no issue with how most of the story was handled, but my god, the trials were breakneck. Another review has said something along the lines of 'it seems like Naegi and Kirigiri are pulling stuff out of their ass during trials', and the lack of explanation we got during investigation time just means that the trials themselves made little sense unless one already knew what was going to happen. I was watching the first trial episode beside a friend and commented that so much was left out, because, well... It was. The logic leaps needed on the viewer's part to follow what the characters had discovered, given that they hadn't been given most of the information, were ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\n2) Flat characterization. Now, I understand that a lot of the bonding with characters in-game comes from School Mode- as I said, I've played the games. I'm not expecting the anime to have one-on-one scenes with Naegi and every other character to fill this void, but the fact that nothing at all replaced this (even made-up scenes with the class would have been preferable + simulated some kind of bond) was disappointing, to say the least. If you want to care about the characters as people, please do play the games. They're all pretty great. \\n\\n\r\n--- \\n\\n\r\nAs I've acknowledged, a lot of the issues I had with this anime are ones that I know hinge on the limited amount of episodes allotted to fit the story into. I maintain that I can't blame the team for this, as I'm sure they did the best they could with condensing all of the material. However, I can't give the anime adaptation of THH more than a 'ehhh' and shrug of the shoulders. \\n\\n\r\n(I will say, though- the voice acting in this anime is superb. Monokuma, Hifumi and Hagakure's voices drove me up the wall at first, and then I realized that they were all exactly as annoying as I would have expected. Monokuma's voice actually grew on me after a few episodes, because it fits so well.)",

Even though the plot was clear it was hard to understand at some points. For example the overall reason for an issue to present itself was lack explanation. Furthermore I believed that the conclusion was rushed just to end it. Nonetheless, I believe that overall the story line was filled anticipation which I enjoyed.\r\nArt & Sound- The art was modern, however at some points videogame visuals appeared.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Their was a character for ever type of personality. I liked how some of the characters were relatable. Their personalities really compliments each other.Essentially they all have a role to play.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I really liked this anime, it introduced an new concept to the anime world. It blended mystery, psychology and horror so well and the transitions were nicely done.",

            "content": "I just want to clarify that I have not played danganronpa, although this series made me want to check it out since I'm a sucker for mystery. I also felt the need for a neutral review of someone who had never heard of the danganronpa franchise before (don't ask me how).\r\nMy expectations of danganronpa weren't the highest, I honestly expected it to turn into an ecchi harem, and we all know how high quality those are. So yeah, I went into it under the impression that I would drop it after the first three episodes. But surprisingly, I sat out the entire show in oneday. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know if I recommend this show because you're deciding whether it's worth your time or not, I'd say skip it. UNLESS you're are a huge suckers for good mystery and episodic shows like me. In which case I say, go check it out. It's enjoyable but underdeveloped, which results into unfinished characters and stories. If you can overlook those things and are just looking for mystery, this might be something you'll enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY : 6\\n\r\nThe story is, well, like what a 6 means: fair. It's most definitely not why I enjoyed the show so much even though I'm not forgiving when it comes to an unsolid plot. It's not neccessarily bad, it's just the ending. It felt kind of forced and not at all like a \"Eureka\" moment. What made the story enjoyable were its episodic aspects, the mystery of the week feel. Like I said; I'm a huge sucker for mystery. \\n\r\nBut then, there were also some pretty big plot twists that were not at all explained and just occured for the sake of plot convenience. If you can't stand plot convenience you should probably skip this show since a lot of the overarching story relies on coincidences. \\n\r\nThen, one of my main issues with the story is that a lot of questions remain unanswered, which can be quite frustrating\\n\\n\r\nART : 8\\n\r\nThe overall animation is  good which would make me give it a 7. But what made me give it an 8 were the details. For example, instead of blocking out parts of the screen with annoying black spots or inverting the colors, they colored the bloody stuff magenta, which is something I can really appreciate. I know some people don't like it but I thought it was a great way to avoid censorship. (and it looked really cool in my opinion) I also particularly enjoyed the \"punishment scenes\" in which the art style turnst into this 3D paper doll style. The character design was pretty good as well for a lot of the side characters, the main characters were quite boring to my disapointment.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6\\n\r\nNot bad, but no outstanding tracks to which I'd listen individually. The opening's nothing special and neither is the ending. It's kind of disappointing since mystery shows always have so much potential for eerie choir music and such. But yeah, it wasn't good, but not bad either, just standard.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS : 4\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the secondary characters I would have probably dropped this show. The \"protagonist\" is your standard cut out good guy, which is why I originally thought this show would turn into a harem anime. He's so boring I kind of wished he'd turn out to be one of the bad guys. The same goes for Kirigiri, the incredibly smart tsundere girl and potential love interest. These two get the most screen time, which results into no emotional attachment to any of the characters. With no character development whatsoever and the main characters being good at everything for some reason (because remember kids: CHARACTER FLAWS ARE BAD). The only thing I liked about the characters were the secondary characters who had loads of potential. But those never got the screen time they deserved. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : 7\\n\r\nLike I said, I love to try and solve mysteries before the story reveals anything which is one of the main factors why I like this series. I don't love it, and I'm definitely not blind towards its flaws but I don't feel like something has to be a masterpiece to be enjoyable. The side characters are quite unique and loveable and the animation is lovely. Right after I watched this series I wanted to give it a solid 7, but that wouldn't be fair.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : 6\\n\r\nThis series was too short and needed more time to develop its plot and spend more time on neglected characters. The mystery aspect of this anime I found to be one of the highlights as well as the animation. Danganroupa started in my head as an ecchi harem series, developed into an episodic mystery series, and ended in \"wait, that's it, it's over?\". This is one of those rare anime that I want to give a higher rating because I actually anjoyed it, but it wouldn't be fair. If I gave it a 7 and I'd compare it to other series I've given a 7 the difference would be laughable. \\n",

As a result you are able to overcome any crisis just as anyone is able to overcome a foe with a weapon. The difference is in the will of every user.\r\nThe story is set in an ultra modern academy where the \"students\" are forced to abide a set of rules that explain the situation they are in. One bad step and death will follow. From that point of view it is not unique, take forexample SAW. It shares some details with Danganronpa, but SAW covers everything Danganronpa has except for the protagonists comeback that is generally specific to anime.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is not something that will impress you but I will say this, the characters designs are unprecedented. You can summarize artwork by its non excessive use of colors and lighting and by the pink blood that I would say was used as a form of censor but you would find that hard to believe because of its age rating.\\n\\n\r\nOne particular aspect I enjoyed about this anime is the fact that each character is unique with his pros and cons and that fact is indirectly stated in the first episode.\\n\r\nAlso the level of predictability is extremely low, so from this point of view it is like a stream of cold water in an arid desert.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of my seemingly pessimistic words from above I have enjoyed watching this anime because of the detective thinking that puts facts head to head in order to assemble the truth. It is one of the things I like doing. So if you share my taste in this matter I can assure you that Danganronpa is a worthwhile anime that creates a quality enjoyment level.\\n",

            "content": "As someone who has neither played the video game nor even seen the novel versions of Danganronpa, let me just start off with a disclaimer that this review is based solely on the anime itself, without any comparison or reference to other versions. \r\nI think Danganronpa is a masterpiece within itself. \r\nEvery single word in this anime is worth hearing, and every single scene is important, so to call it a fast-paced anime would be an understatement. I understand how some people may think the anime progresses too quickly, and that vital scenes such as the trial scenes are rushed too much for the viewerto follow adequately, but I had no such problems, and honestly think it differs from person to person, depending on the person's interest in the anime itself. \\n\r\nDanganronpa never fails to drop as many questions as it answers, leaving the viewer in a constant chase for more; more to know, more to see, and more to discover. Every single episode is brilliantly written so that the show itself is a complex web of characters, plots, secrets and twists that leave you wondering about it for hours on end. \\n\r\nThere may be arguments that the general theme of the anime is overdone with Battle Royale and the Hunger Games and the like, and that the idea of people killing each other in a game is overrated, but Danganronpa is nothing like either of these examples because it focuses on something that shifts the focus of the entire show; the investigations. As thrilling and exciting and amazing as the murders themselves may be, the trial scenes and investigations are a thousand times better. As a viewer, I found myself debating with myself over possible suspects and trying to pick up on the clues that this show so subtly drops over everything like dew. And though solving many mysteries filled me with absolutely inexplicably strange satisfaction and joy, the show gets more complex as it progresses, and with it, the mysteries and questions get more difficult to solve.\\n\r\nThe characters of the show are perhaps my favourite part of the entire series. Throughout the show, every character is designed intricately and with enough care so that not one of them can be deemed \"boring.\" The characters surprise the viewers again and again as new traits surface along the way, and to call them predictable wouldn't be accurate in any way. \\n\r\nOverall, this show has quickly surmounted my list as one of my favourite animes, and I absolutely recommend it to everyone who enjoys fast-paced, clever, genuinely well-written mysteries and thrillers.",

            "content": "I DID NOT PLAY THE GAME\r\nThat said, I noticed that this anime got a lot of negative reviews from people who actually did play the game. So I am going to speak about it solely based on that. \r\nStory: 7\r\nYou could tell a lot of thought was put into the story. The concept of a battle royale where people have to kill each other is nothing new. But they blended it with murder mystery which I like. The murders were also very well thought out. But the problem was that there wasn't very much character (I will get to that later), and there was verylittle put into the investigations. We get to see all of the evidence, but we didn't get much time to dwell on it. The only time we got to think about the evidence was the actual trial itself. I would have liked more time, which could have been solved with a higher episode count.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThese character designs were brilliant. The trial and execution animation was also great. I've heard fans of the original say that they are just traces of the video game footage, but I don't see anything wrong with that. It's breathtaking, so I'm not surprised they traced it. I can see the disappointment, but I'm not surprised they did it. That said, the rest of the animation is nothing special. Just run of the mill anime animation with limited movement and occasional stills.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nHoly crap this is some really good music. I heard a lot of the video game fans complaining that the episode 1 opening was a rip off of the original video game opening. I looked it up, and they're right. On it's own, I would have called it really good, but then I saw the original one. And the anime just did a cheap rip off of it. The anime only opening wasn't too bad, but the original video game opening can't be touched. The soundtrack was flat out amazing. I hear that was taken from the game too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nBesides leaving out time for investigations, this is the biggest place the anime tripped up. The character designs were amazing, so I was left curious and wanted to learn about almost everyone. But then I never got to learn about anyone. So when someone died I would think \"aw, I like that design\". But then I didn't feel much about the loss of the character themselves. I felt a little bad about the deaths in the first and second trials, but besides that, I didn't feel much at all. I heard the game hand \"free time events\" where you got to learn about the characters, but these were not in the anime. Again, with a higher episode count, this could have been solved.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI did not play the game, so for me, this was a really cool experience. The murders were great, the visuals were good, and music was great. I absolutely loved it. But the flaws did poke at really badly, and areas left me disappointed. Most of the video game fans said it was a terrible adaption. I think it was just hampered by an episode limit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7  \\n\r\nThe anime had a lot going for it. But the main issue was lack of bonding/development with the characters. The build up for the trials through investigation was also extremely rushed. All of this could have been fixed with a larger episode count. The video game fans seemed tortured by the fact that the game was so rushed. I can understand why they would be bitter. But as a stand alone product it is not bad at all. It is a shame, because if this had 26 episodes instead of just 13, this show could have easily gotten a 9. Regardless, I do think the show is worth a watch.",

The high school setting is really appealing and the mystery element is portrayed flawlessly! \r\nWith so many characters it becomes slightly difficult to connect with each one, but if you are interested in it and find time to read wiki articles or play the Dangan ronpa game, the experience of watching the anime will increase drastically. With fun and original plots, villains and protagonists it really is in a league of its own.\r\nI have seen quite a lot of people who dislike the art style, but I find that it stays perfectly trueto the graphics of the game and has a simplistic charm of sorts.\\n\\n\r\nThe censorship also brings a pop art feel into the anime, almost as if it was set in a video game, many people complain about the pink blood, but I really do believe it adds to the 'Dangan ronpa charm.'\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone who loves a good mystery and enjoys original plots and concepts that open new worlds of ideas to the viewer.",

            "content": "It seems that most people who have reviewed Danganronpa: The Animation were comparing it to the game, but I'm going to try my best to not compare it to the game.\r\nDanganronpa has a great plot. It's interesting, creative and caught my attention. Sadly, the story is a bit rushed even when I'm not comparing it to the games. Some of the trials were too short for my liking and it would of been better if they made the anime longer than thirteen episodes so they could take their time with developing the story and characters. There were some things that didn't make any sense orjust seemed convenient but other than that the plot has a really cool concept. This anime also had an amazing plot twist that I didn't expect.\\n\r\n The art and animation in  Danganronpa is usually pretty good but there are times when the animation or art goes from being good to looking somewhat lazy and mediocre. Sometimes the images look blurry and low quality but it's usually pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the change in art style when it came to the executions though. I would've preferred if they kept the style they used in the rest of the show. It looked funny and out of place. Though I know there a lot of people that liked it. (The hot pink blood is also a pretty good idea in my opinion.)\\n\r\nI usually hate dubbed anime but I actually liked the dub for this one. Most of the voices weren't annoying and suited the characters. There are a lot of animes where the dubbed voices sound annoying and forced or just aren't right for the character, but this anime did a better job than a lot of other animes with the audio. I also liked the opening, even though I'm usually not a fan of that type of music. The opening was a bit inconsistent at the beginning though.\\n\r\nThe characters are my favorite aspect of the show. I fell in love with most of the characters. There are only 4-5 characters I don't particularly care for. Kirirgiri, Chihiro and Fukawa's characters were really interesting for me. Even though I like Naegi as a character, I will admit that he was a kind of bland for a protagonist. I think I know the reason though but I'm not going to talk about the game. My main complaint is that some characters didn't get much development, I think Kirigiri, Sakura, Fukawa and Asahina got most of the attention when it came to developing the characters. Most characters got at least some development but a few barely got any. I think if they made the show longer they'd have more time to focus on character development. Maybe Chihiro as well. I think they should have spent more time introducing the characters as well.\\n\r\nOverall, the show is pretty good. I really enjoyed watching it. The plot was interesting, the art is usually pretty good, the audio is better than a lot of shows and I really liked most of the characters. If you were thinking about watching this show, I'd say go for it. Sure it isn't as good as the games but I still think it is a very good show.",

            "content": "This is a review written by someone who HASN'T played the Danganronpa game series. Keep that in mind while reading this review.\r\nThe anime ideia by itself was very outstanding for me, but I need to confess: I did not watched it until one of my friends actually order me to watch, and I  got to say: thanks, friend. I should have watched this anime sooner.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe concept is really interesting, but when you see it actually done, it is more than you expected. What I felt while watching the Classroom Trials was undeniably exciting. The mistery is very well constructed during the storyand that season finale was amazing. The battle of Hope against Despair is something I will never forget. Even though some details I don't think were well explained, the general is simply amazing. Truly something that I won't find again easily.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nYou see, the art wasn't something really outstanding. I would even dare to say it was actually a bit disappointing. The character design is really good indeed, but the animation is kinda weak. It is a really common aspect of the series. But exceptions MUST be made when talking about the punition scenes. These scenes were innovating in my point of view. I was going to rate the art with a 7 but character design and the animation during the punitions changed my mind. Congratulations there, Danganronpa character design team and animation team.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nSound is a bit hard for me to judge, but I loved the opening Never say Never. (No, not that famous canadian singer's music)\\n\r\nThe seiyuu's were also amazing. I can't imagine now Kirigiri being voiced by other person but Yoko Hikasa (or Hikasa Yoko... I'm not good with japanese names), as well as the other characters (by the way, I got to admit that Monokuma's voice is kinda weird in the beginning, but when you get used to it you simply start loving that annoying \"Pupupupuuu\" sound... or hating).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAs you would expect from an anime almost entirely focused on the fact that only talented students study inside Hope's Peak Academy, the characters are unforgettable. Some of them are expected to act that way, like Yamada-kun and Togami-kun, but some of them are really unexpected, like Fujisaki-san and Kuwada-kun. It is always deeper than what we initially thought.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI loved each one of the 13 episodes of the series and was looking forward for the second season (which is a really confusing job to tell which arc you have to watch first to have a better experience of the series). If you like mistery and murders with a bit of fantasy it may be the right anime for you, but if you can't stand violent scenes and/or get easily attached to a character in a way that you suffer A LOT when he or she dies, I guess it's a better decision to stay away from this show (even though the blood is pink... it must be really hard to take those stains of the carpet).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI love this anime. That's it. I can't even explain in words how much it changed me.\\n\\n\r\nBut as I said before: if you can't stand violence, some psychological drama and main character death, I highly recommend you to stay away from Danganronpa.",

            "content": "(Note: for me, personal enjoyment is the most important factor in ranking an anime, which is why I give it more weight than other aspects.) Also Note: I have never played any of the Danganronpa games, but I still love the anime series. I think that's a sign it's a good quality show on its own. \r\nStory 8/10\r\nDanganronpa The Animation has an engaging story concept that instantly made me want to try watching it. Fifteen high school students gather at an esteemed academy and find themselves trapped there and under the control of an extremely annoying and honestly pretty creepy little robotic bear. The onlyway to escape Hope's Peak Academy, says the bear, is to kill a classmate and get away with it. If you are discovered as the one who killed your classmate, you will be executed at the weekly Classroom Trial. If you didn't kill anyone, you had better find out who did-- otherwise, if you convict the wrong suspect at the Classroom trial, the entire class except the actual murderer will be executed. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as story structure goes, the creators did well building the plot and setting up the main mystery and its conclusion. It's really impressive that they excellently sewed together so many elements into only thirteen episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI do have to say that Danganronpa does not do so well if you are looking for a classical mystery story. While the underlying mystery of the \"mastermind\" at the academy is admirably presented, the small murder mysteries (usually one per episode) are less so. For one thing, they are rushed. For another, the average viewer probably cannot piece together the answer of who dunnit with the extremely limited information given. Instead of the VIEWER trying to figure out each episode's murder, Danganronpa is designed for viewers to watch the Classroom Trial play out and follow the thinking of the characters as THEY solve the mysery. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (10/10): Why I Love Danganronpa\\n\\n\r\nI love the \"Death Game\" genre of anime, where lots of people die off from enemy/monster attacks OR are forced to kill each other within the bounds of someone's effed up game scenario. Examples of this genre are Mirai Nikki (Future Diary), Bokurano (Ours), Btoom!, Deadman Wonderland, Death Parade, the Fate franchise (such as Fate/Zero), Gantz, Higashi no Eden (Eden of of the East), Magical Girl Raising Project, Mai-Hime, Jyuu Oh Sei (King of Beasts), Juuni Taisen (Twelve Warriors), Sword Art Online, and Ousama Game (King's Game). All but the last item are fascinating and thrilling series. \\n\\n\r\nAll that to say, Danganronpa is also a Death Game anime, and I believe it's one of the best in the genre. Why? Because the story has many orginal and entertaining twists, the characters are diverse but all of them likeable, the stylized animation is refreshing, the voice-acting is first-rate, and there is enough suspense and violence to keep me entertained but not disgusted. There is realistic mortality and abundant character death, but each character gets his or her own good moments, and there are a number of survivors at the end along with a positive message of hope over despair.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\\n\r\nStudio Lerche has become successful and popular thanks to titles like Assassination Classroom and Classroom of the Elite. Danganronpa the Animation came out before any of those big titles, so I think of it as Studio Lerche's introduction into popular anime. They did a great job making the animation unique, stylized, and much more creative than the average anime of this level of budget. Since most of Danganronpa is dialogue, though, you won't see any particularly fantastic action scenes. No, the art isn't \"stunning,\" but it's entertaining and anomalous in a positive way.\\n\\n\r\nSome people are annoyed by the animation sequences of the executions, but I think they are interesting and, in a good way, creepy and weird. After all, scenes of kids dying should be creepy and unsettling.  Another small thing that apparently pisses some people off is that the blood in Danganronpa is colored purple instead of red. I like that, though. It's imaginative and does a good job capturing the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Danganronpa The Animation is more than satisfying. Granted, the opening song (\"Never Say Never\" by TKDz2b) is pretty silly, but it's catchy, and great for laughs. \"Zetsubousei: Hero Chiryouyaku,\" which is the main ending theme, is excellent. The dramatic short peice of music used when a corpse is discovered fits perfectly and gives a sense of dark humor. The score used for classroom trials is interesting and fun to listen to. The other scores, which feature a lot of fast-paced tracks with heavy percussion, are also enjoyable and fit well with the anime's mood.\\n\\n\r\nI'm writing this review for the sub and not the dub. I can't stand dubs. I much prefer to hear the voices of the Japanese seiyuu. Voice acting plays a big role in whether I like the show or not. In the case of Danganronpa, several of my favorite seiyuu have parts, and as usual they do a great \\n\r\njob. I've been a fan of Ishida Akira since I first heard him as Kaoru in Neon Genesis Evangelion. He plays Togami Byakuya in Dangronpa. I also admire the voices of Naegi, Kirigiri, and Fukawa; they are played by Ogata Megumi, Hikasa Yoko, and Sawashiro Miyuki, respectively. \\n\\n\r\nOgata Megumi is an older woman who does a great and convincing job of playing boys whose voices haven't changed yet. She is most famous for voicing Shinji in the Evangelion Franchise, Yuugi Mutou in Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Kurama in Yuu Yuu Hakusho. More recently, she played Itona Horibe in Assassination Classroom, Ayato Naoi in Angel Beats!, Tsubaki (the innkeeper wolf) in Konohana Kitan, and Cranberry in Magical Girl Raising Project. As Naegi, Ogata performs commendably with passion and skilled voice control. \\n\\n\r\nYou can look up the others yourself, but I just want to say two things. First, I love many of the roles played by Sawashiro Miyuki, and as Fukawa of split personalities she does a fantastic job. Second, Hikasa Yoko (Kirigiri) has a beautiful voice and you might be surprised at how many roles she's played.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people complain that fifteen (or sixteen really) is too many characters for a thirteen episode anime. However, I think that Studio Lerche does a great job with its large-cast anime like Danganronpa, Assassination Classroom, and Magical Girl Raising Project. There's not enough time for truly in-depth character development, but time spent on characterization is sufficient enough to give you a solid idea of what each character is supposed to be like. \\n\\n\r\nSome characters were given more diverse emotions and character arcs than others; for instance, Asahina gets a lot of time and depth that characters like, for instance, Sayaka never got. However, I still hold that the makers should be appreciated for managing to develop the characters even as much as they did. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are colorful and unforgettable, with sometimes funny but still superb character designs. I was especially happy that a few characters were included who challenge gender stereotypes. Sakura is a woman, but looks as muscular as a male weight lifter, and has an awesome scar on her face. Her voice sounds very husky and deeper than that of most female characters. On the flipside, there is Fujisaka, someone who seems at first to be a reserved and soft-spoken girl... but don't let looks and social mannerisms decieve you. Watch to find out her/his story of battling with her/his gender. \\n\\n\r\n.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, the enjoyment, the animation, the sound, and the characters all make Danganronpa The Animation a show that is worth your time. \\n",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**\r\n**DISCLAIMER: I HAVE NOT PLAYED THE GAMES!!* \r\ntl;dr : DR is a very enjoyable and quite suspenseful series with a wacky sense of humor that is dark in some senses, interesting and fun character designs that take a spin on the stereotypes of your usual anime characters in a high-school anime, however, the anime falls short with some of the character's lack of personality and the fact some of the story is hard to keep up with. \r\n**STORY**\r\nThe story in this anime is one of the key features to why it is so great. If you didn't know, the main premiseis about a bunch of elite high-school kids who are forced to kill each other in order to leave the hellish school and graduate. Not only that, but you need to not be /caught/. If someone fails to identify you as the murder, you live, and the others die.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot more to the premise, as that is only scratching the surface to this somewhat original take on the popular One Man Left type of story telling used in most horror. However, if there was a few things about the story or how different parts of the premise was handled, it lies in the investigations.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, I feel like the investigations are a bit short-lived and need to be stretched out with a bit more spice to make it quite interesting and kinda fun to figure out.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in this case, most investigations are just some of the characters walking around explaining some topics about the murder scene while the show gives us details about the things surrounded around the murder scene. I would of liked more mystery, which is saved by the classroom trials. (I'll get to those later, I promise). And, while I'm not thirsting for more in the investigations, I do agree they could of been done a lot better. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, then there is some parts of this show that are very hard to follow, and I had to replay short moments of the episode or ask a friend about what the flying hell was going on because of how weirdly it was described to me, a viewer. This is mostly show in the two ending episodes where everything is unfolded like a blanket of sorts, if I can find a good comparison. \\n\\n\r\nI found it quite frustrating and a bit unenjoyable for me to sit through because of how hard it was for me to understand all the things that was being thrown at me. \\n\\n\r\nAs for classroom trials, these were quite interesting, but got somewhat mundane after a few times. While the saving grace in this is the ability for the creators to build together good plot twists and interesting debates in these trials, in the two final episodes, the trials came off as...boring.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a bit of a nitpick, which is why it doesn't really affect the rating of the story, but I feel in some of the episodes, the characters overreact to some of the most weirdest things. For example, in the first episode, everyone freaked out over the video tape of their parents. I remember one of the characters taking it to the extreme by screaming and running away and crying.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't like the characters were dying, or the parents were dying, in fact, it was just a video of them standing in a well-lit room cheering the characters on before it shifted into a weird land. This is well explained later down in the show where it's revealed the world is in shambles, but the characters simply didn't know that before that was revealed to them. It just seemed unrealistic to me. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to note too is the fact that the execution scenes, while some do a good job of showing some brutal yet satisfying death scenes, some of them fall short. I feel like the writers and creators could of done a better job at making the execution scenes and how to make them satisfying and brutal. \\n\r\nI'm not sure if the execution scenes are from the game or not, because if so, then I can't really say much about it, but if not, then I think it's a problem that should be fixed. \\n\r\nOverall, the story is a 8\\n\\n\r\n**Art**\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is very good in my opinion, and it shows to have a distinct art-style in comparison to the moe and average schoolgirl anime you'd see these days. The character designs are very interesting and well done, as you can tell their personalities from how they look. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, Sakura. You can tell from her rough and tough look, yet her innocent image with the simple slip of schoolgirl clothing she is tough yet sweet on the inside with feelings. And, with Togami, that he is a smartypants that strives to be the smartest out of the group, and it goes on. The artists did their jobs in terms of character design, however, if I had to be  honest, some of the character designs are not very original. \\n\\n\r\nThis is mostly shown in characters like Naegi, who is just your typical teenage boy. However, even then with very uninteresting character designs, I still found there to be personality in how they were handled. Naegi is small and cowardly, kinda like how his character designs show him off to be. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, one of my favorites in terms of character designs, Monokuma, as he is perfectly illustrated. It fits his character very well, and makes him part of why he is one of the best characters to a lot of DR fans in the series. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, the animation hasn't really bothered me, as it's really just average in terms of how smoothly it moves and how it's drawn in most shots. The characters were very well-drawn, and the scenes where the animation shines brightly the most is in execution scenes.\\n\\n\r\nYou can clearly see that they put effort into making a twisted, whacky fun-fest of horror in these executions. All the way from the artstyle and how descriptive and spooky it is all concocted, to how the animation is shown. Stilted, yet it fits. It fits well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the animation isn't anything special to be considered beautiful or outstanding, but is it great? In some cases, hell yeah. The executions, the classroom trials and how stylized some of the scenes are make it quite an interesting treat to snack on while watching. \\n\\n\r\n**SOUND**\\n\\n\r\nI don't really /care/ about sound when it comes to anime, as it really depends on how well I can hear the characters and if they are crystal clear or just plainly hard to see. In this anime, there isn't much to say about in terms of sound.\\n\\n\r\nI can hear everything from the character's voices, and it's very crystal clear. Nothing else. However, you can tell that the staff put some effort into the sound. A good example is if they are in a large room, like the cafeteria, you can hear their voices echo throughout whenever they yell loudly. While I do admit that it goes away and it's short-lived, it's neat.\\n\\n\r\nAnd surprisingly, the dub is good. It's decent. It's the version I watched, and it was fairly enjoyable, especially the English role of Monokuma, in which the voice actor portrays his character very, very well and it's one of the reasons that Monokuma hits powerful in this anime in terms of character.\\n\\n\r\nSo, 9.5 out of 10. Not much to say. \\n\\n\r\n**CHARACTER**\\n\\n\r\nThis is the strongest point in the entire anime. Besides Story and the art, this is one of the reasons why DR is so special. The characters to be summarized, are basically stereotypes of your average anime based on a high-school. Except, the creators actually try to develop them somewhat. \\n\\n\r\nYou can actually care about the characters in this, despite being a spin on the stereotypes used in boring, uninteresting characters. Characters like Yamada or Sakura who are usually just underdeveloped personality types in some other animes are used in a way where you can kinda root for them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are some problems in the character department. For example, Naegi. Naegi, in my opinion, is the weakest character in this story. He has no personality, as he brings nothing new to the table. Unlike characters like Celestia who bring an interesting, new personality to take in  as you watch the story unfold in front of you, Naegi is just there.\\n\\n\r\nWe don't know much about his past in this anime, as it's rarely dived into. And, that brings up one of the biggest problems in the character department. They are very uneven in terms of how much they work out the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSome of them are developed and are given a past, while some remain blank and just stuck with that boring, stereotypical personality. The creators didn't give enough time to stretch out the characters at least a little bit equally so we could learn more about them, as if your characters are what the entire thing is about, it's important to set aside a good understanding of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nNaegi and the love interest that is first shown at the beginning are the biggest offenders of the no-personality rule. But, despite some of the rough patches in character development, you get very, very enjoyable and entertaining characters that make watching DR a blast for me. \\n\\n\r\nMonokuma is one of the best villains I have ever seen in a show in a long time in my opinion. He's snarky, he's rude, he's funny, yet he's strangely cute. And, this goes along with his character design and his voice-acting, and every inch of detail put into this character makes him pack a powerful punch, and he is one of my top five favorites. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite some of the rough patches, the cast of characters are bright and interesting. 9 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\n**ENJOYMENT**\\n\\n\r\nI had an absolute blast watching this anime. Not only because am I a fan of the whole One Man Standing formula sometimes used in horror media, but because of the characters and how well they were laced together into the horrifying situations thrown at them throughout the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe suspense in this was great in my opinion, and a lot of the drama and plot twists that were thrown at me had me stuffing popcorn down my throat and my eyes widening in surprise. The aspects of intensity, mystery, truth, suspense of horror made this fun to watch for me and it's why it's one of my favorite animes. \\n\\n\r\nMy only issue with the enjoyment is, like I said, near the end of the series, 11-13. Through then, the plot takes a slight dip in terms of enjoyment, and as I mentioned in the story, it's very hard to follow some of the plot that is going on during the episode, making me having to restart parts of the episode to fully gather and process all the information that is thrown at me.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, problems like these often track down to one thing. How much that is being thrown at me, how uneven the character development is. It all comes down to the thirteen episodes. The fact that they were just...thirteen episodes. While, I feel like the story wasn't really rushed and I enjoyed the pace it went by, some of the problems I listed would not be as major if there was more space and time to give more of the characters development and to slowly feed the information of a classroom trial or investigation to the viewer to fully chew. Due to the short times and episodes, of course, we are going to have rushed and fast-paced classroom trials to try and get through without wasting too much time for the next episodes. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, I found the anime quite enjoyable and a blast to watch. It was a great introduction back into the anime world, as this has proven to strike a path for more great anime shows to come my way.\\n\\n\r\n**OVERALL: VERDICT*\\n\\n\r\nWith this show, I think I feel a light eight to a somewhat strong nine. Somewhere in the middle, a 8.5, to be exact. Overall, the show is very enjoyable and was great to watch. As a fan of horror, it certainly did not disappoint me, and I recommend you go and watch it to if you're looking for wacky humor, suspense, drama or you just love horror overall. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, by the way, so I apologize if some of my reasoning is flawed or bias, or I'm being too generous in terms of how I rate the series. But, this is what I feel deep down inside when I take a look at this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, it's 12:30, and it's time I end this review...here.",

            "content": "So starting this show, I had mixed feelings about it, as I had been given different impressions of it. Many reviews that I'd read told me that the show was mediocre,but most of my friends seemed to have enjoyed it. I guess it made it all the more fun to watch, because I had this feeling similiar to the one you feel when you watch a show you know nothing about. Since I had mixed \"reviews\" on it, I really was excited to watch it and formulate my own opinion.\r\nSo here we go! Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation, mostly knownas Danganronpa The Animation, or simply Danganronpa!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs you probably know,this show is based on a game,that goes by the same name (Danganronpa). In fact, this show uses the same plot as the game, and that plot is really interesting and complex. The concept is preety good and the mistery side of it really keeps you interested. Here's the catch: The plot is so complex and so big that the producers couldn't make it fit on 13 episodes, and so the plot feels somewhat rushed and gets a little underdeveloped, which is a real shame, since the plot IS very good. So good that being underdeveloped still earns a 7 on my board.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe Art for this show is good, not great, but good.And here's why: It uses a lot of the art and scenes of the game, which makes it a little sketchy. I feel like it could have used more original art, as some art sequences didn't make as much sense on the show as they did on the actual game. Other than that, the show improves on the art of the game while staying true the designs and scenarios,which is really good!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nLet me say this: I found the choice of the English opening really interesting, it's not something you see everyday as the original opening. And in my opinion, it was very good, bravo. It was a risk, but they did a very good job. The voice casting was great and I felt like the voices really suited the characters. They ARE the same as the ones in the game,so they couldn't really mess up there as long as they kept the voices,which they did (Keep in mind that I've watched the Japanese audio version). As for the music: it's okay, it doesn't really stand out but it doesn't get in the way either. All of this results in this grade for this subject.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very,VERY, interesting. The whole idea of gathering students with different talents is a cool thing,and the development of them is very good...for some of them.And that's why this category doesn't score any higher.It suffers from the same problem as the plot:it's rushed. The character development could have been better and it would have made the show much better. Some characters do get some development, but others are just kind of there. For some of them, we don't even see them using their talent or, you know, attempting to.Which is shame, because the characters have good designs and ideas behind them and could have been great with some more work.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nAll this categories aside, I really liked the show. The concept was solid, the characters were likeable and the show is enjoyable to watch. I was on a run of more happy shows so this came in a very good moment for me to like it, so maybe that influenced my enjoyment, even tough I think this grade wouldn't change much if I watched it in another period. There isn't really much to say when trying to explain \"personal enjoyment\",so this is all I can really say (sorry!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7,4 -> 7\\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa is a good show for people who like violent shows and/or mystery shows. It is under developed,yes,but it still does a good job on delivering the overall plot and entertaining the viewer.So I still recommend you watching this show, especially because the new seasons are supposed to be very good!So give it a try,it IS only 13 episodes long.Chances are you'll end up liking it!",

            "content": "Well, just realized that Kyouko is a main character now.\r\nDanganronpa is a well game based anime, or we can say it's a survival game anime. Not bad though, but i feel something odds.\r\nStory:\r\nKill and win, this survival game's just like others for sure, such as Mirai Nikki. Just don't be caught or you'll die. After all, maybe it's more like a quiz game than a survival game, find the killer and you win. But, why such a mystery solving anime like this has only 2-5 minutes time of investigation and fortunately get all the clues? It's too rushing for me. Or I can say thatthe trial time is the investigating time itself. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nLove the character design, and I like the art changed when execution declared. You  can find out the characters' characteristics just look from their appearance. Colorful, but i don't like the color of the purple blood. It just clean out the psychological genre.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI don't really like the OP, altough it's fitted to a game genre anime. The voice acting is great enough, fit with the character itself. Monokuma's voice is a nice one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWell, i like when there's some characters those have more than one personality. Junko is the example. And there are 2 traps included, it just make this anime is so colorful with the character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWho loves survival game will love this i think. But for me, I just enjoy watching the trial and execution time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nDanganronpa has its good and bad things inside. Maybe if it developed to become a 24 episodes anime, that'll be great and no brief investigation anymore. I'm not really enjoying this but I like it.",

            "content": "I haven't played the game, so I'll judge this as what is was for me: a mediocre mystery anime.\r\nDanganronpa has an overused but interesting premise, and I was pleasantly surprised (at first) that they included the murder mystery theme to spice up a straightforward battle royale. The problem is that it's frustratingly obvious where the writers have (lazily) covered up massive plot holes. A good mystery has an intelligent villain, the clues and suspects are clearly established early on and the viewer should potentially (shouldn't be easy) be able to guess who the culprit is. The twists in Danganronpa come out of nowhere, and thevillain often relies on his position of power rather than his own intelligence to get out of sticky situations. Usually I wouldn't mind, but you'd expect more from a mystery villain, especially if he'd agreed to follow the rules of the game!\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all bad however; this anime is worth a casual watch if you're into mystery. The side mysteries are quite good, and I thought Monokuma's design was perfect. The saving grace in Danganronpa is definitely the death scenes, which, with beautiful stylised CGI and really unique methods of execution, were pretty damn entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I don't like this anime, but if you're into mystery give it a shot. It's one of the few that came out this year.",

In the anime however, I felt that it was rather rushed . I mean, it's not like that they didn't have much to work.

            "content": "Even though I have already played the game before watching this, I do my best to write a review on the anime itself and not do the annoying thing of comparing the anime with the game. Seriously, though, about every post here does a very good job of ruining the excitement for future watchers.\r\nStory (9/10) If you're looking for anime that makes you think and think and think and when you're sure of something then it blows all over your face, this is definitely a watch for you. I admit, the mysteries are not all that...mysterious. It's not hard to figure out by yourself. Ithas those moments where something will totally take you by surprise and will make you want to cry and giggle at the same time and puke on a unicorn. (It's how I felt HAHAHAHAHA) Anyway, I absolutely do not regret watching this. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) The art is amazing. Though it does not's not really as good as other animes such as SnK or whatever, the thing that stands out here most is the way the characters are portrayed. They really did a good job of making sure that each and every character has a different kind of expression when they react to something. The way the places were drawn were also very cool and fitting to the theme. And who doesn't love Monokuma? \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) Nothing seemed out of place when it came to the background music. It all fits in nicely. I personally enjoyed the creepy music thing they got going on, but I advise you not to watch it by yourself at night. >:)  The opening that was used (Never Say Never) was really awesome. Some episodes didn't have an opening song though. But it's all good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10) At first, there were so many characters that I had trouble keeping up with them. I had to hit pause everytime a new character introduced himself/herself, since I was somehow used to there being at the most, five main characters in an anime. But by the time I was somewhere in the middle of the episodes, I had already memorized their names. I can't say why I rated the characters so high without spoiling stuff for you so see for yourself! :D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) I reeaaally enjoyed watching this anime though I'm sure not everyone would think the same. It's too short, though. It is honestly one of my favorite anime this season. Though it has a mysterious theme to it, there are funny moments where you just have to laugh. The animation is really refreshing too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) I'm crushed by all these negative reviews. I mean, I played the game beforehand but that didn't stop me from enjoying it to its last moments. I recommend this anyone who likes mysteries and survival game stuff.. and people who like diversity when it comes to characters. I know some of them are a little cliche, but there's so many of them. It's really fun to watch them interact with each other.",

I would always assume one thing and the anime would immediately go the opposite, which would conclude a better story. The characters were also well done. I could connect to the characters within the first episode and so on it would get stronger. Overall, it was a good anime and I highly recommend it to people who can accept the outcome of the characters without hating it.If someone really likes Saw, the movie, then this is an anime for you. This will really tug at your heart and make you go through emotional switches from hell, meaning that there are so many it hurts. \\n",

            "content": "Being a person who played the game I knew the plot already but it still made me feel at times like I was playing the game. Sometimes I was leaning forward wanting to hit the action points to break holes in peoples accusations then quickly realized that I was watching the anime, not playing the game. If you haven't played the game then I think you would enjoy it a lot more going into it with a fresh mind. However, those who have played the game understand it more and get to enjoy the anime in a way others won't. The plot will keep youguessing though some parts might be a tad predictable. It'll keep you on your toes from start to finish. I would recommend this to anyone who has or hasn't played the game just like I would recommend the game to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is spot on like the game but of course they have to make it look slightly more fluid in movement. It's pretty much how I pictured the game would look like if it was more fleshed out animation wise. It holds that unique style that is danganronpa without looking too gmmicky and as if it's trying to play on the fact that it was the game. I loved how when people died they used the game animation and during cases they used the bullets whenever the main character or someone was going to interject. It made me feel like I was in the game again like I said before. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple, it's a classic find the killer in an aloted time and if you don't then the loser goes free and everyone dies. it's explained I believe on the first episode. It turns everyone against each other at first but eventually teams start to form which is like what would normally happen. Each person does their best to solve a murder and the murderer does their best to hide it though of course there is always a slip up. If you've played the game you're pretty much watching it knowing hwo did it so that's why I say if you haven't played the game it might be better because you get to enjoy the twists and turns. Though if you did play it you get to see the investigation more flushed out, so it's a win win either way. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all this anime is unique, interesting, charismatic, and will keep you guessing if you haven't played the game. It brings back fond memories of when I did play it and it reminded me just how much fun I had playing the game. The gore isn't too bad since the blood is pink but be careful with that still. Why not watch it and see if you can guess who did it? You'll be in for a ride and a twist you'll slowly see coming the more you progress.",

            "content": "I\u2019m gonna be honest with you: I\u2019m a huge Danganronpa fan. I\u2019ve played all the games, seen all the anime, and spent a lot of time looking at news for V3. So from a fan\u2019s perspective I\u2019m going to tell you all why this show doesn\u2019t deserve the hate it gets from a lot of the gamer fans and why you should check it out. \r\nThe story is based of the first game, where young Makoto Naegi and his fellow Super High School Level friends are imprisoned within Hope\u2019s Peak Academy by the mysterious Monokuma. Obviously the stuido had to cut some scenes and charactermoments from the game in order to make it fit within its required 13 episodes. But aside from one awkward scene during the 3rd class trial it downright nailed the entire story and never felt rushed to me. In fact I would argue that the final class trial was done better here than it was in the game but hey that\u2019s just my opinion. Is the story still awesome and shocking? Yes! The Danganronpa games are popular because of their awesome stories and I think this translated pretty well into an anime. If you want to start Danganronpa but aren\u2019t much of a gamer I think you\u2019d be totally fine starting with this. It hits all the right marks and only made an occasional mistake here and there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style, known as Psycho Pop, is simply beautiful to look at and doesn\u2019t differ to much from the games. There may not be much action but the class trials and truth bullet sequences will blow you away to the point where you might even start imagining your in a trial the next time you have an argument with your pals. The execution scenes stick close to the original game\u2019s and I dare say even improve on them a bit. Its visuals are so unique and fun to look at that you won\u2019t want to look away for a second. I should also note that the pink blood was awesome! I found it strangely beautiful to look at and thought it really helped sell the whole \u201cPsycho Pop\u201d feel Danganronpa is known for.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I can understand why some people complained about this. Obviously with this many characters and with at least 2 dying every trial, they couldn\u2019t tell everyone\u2019s backstory and give them a chance to shine. But for the characters that do it really nails them. Naegi\u2019s still Naegi, Kyoko\u2019s still Kyoko, and the character relationships are still there. Will you get to know everything about everyone? No. But if you want to know more you can always go play the game. There\u2019s only so much someone can do in 22 minutes before it starts to feel overcrowded and rushed, so I give it a pass. They were fun, interesting, and the deaths still hit hard.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this a lot I\u2019d say. It was fun, thrilling, and whether you\u2019ve seen the story before or not it\u2019s still an awesome journey with a mastermind that nobody will see coming. Check it out if you love murder mysteries!\\n\\n\r\nOverall I\u2019d say don\u2019t believe what some people might say about this one. Its a really good adaptation of a game and speaking as a fan of the source material I say it did an awesome job translating it. I\u2019ll see you all next time and welcome to Hope\u2019s Peak Academy. Let\u2019s hope you survive the experience, nyuk nyuk nyuk!",

            "content": "This anime has received much hate; and to those who have yet to watch it the only thing I can say is don't listen to that hate. This is the literal best fucking anime; it is by far my favourite of all time, and after watching it all the previous anime series I had completed looked like complete trash. At least give it a shot, please- the first episode may seem a little dull and the third has a really weird song, but it's weirdness is one of my most favourite things about the series. I would definitely also recommend watching the anime and thenbuying the second video game; best game I've ever played.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nDanganRonpa automatically has a cool story. A bunch of high school students are kidnapped and thrown into a school in where they must kill each other off. The anxiety I can practically sense brimming off of Naegi during the first night was immeasurable, despite him not being the best character. The story is so rich, holds so much mystery and shock but don't even get me started on the class trials. If you're new to DanganRonpa, class trials are where the students have a debate to decide on who committed the murder. If they get it right, the culprit will get executed. If wrong, they will. The class trials are unexpected, slightly comical at times, dramatic and surprising; trust me, I've never gotten one right. And perhaps the best and worst part is that your favourite characters will die.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say overall the story is filled with twist and turns, and definitely a 10/10 in my perspective. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nOh. The art. The art is... absolutely stunning. By far my favourite art style in anime. It's bright, colourful, blizzard at times, odd, and overall really beautiful. The characters have big eyes, big hair and distinct features; there is not one character in the series that you wouldn't recognize automatically. In the Danganronpa art style, literally any type of character can be made. It's really appealing to the eye and very pleasant to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing i really liked was the pink blood; sure, weird and unrealistic. But that's also what made me fall in love with the series- I couldn't even begin to imagine Danganronpa with red blood. I fucking love the weirdness im Danganronpa; it's supposed to be a dark anime, but killings aside it has a rather light vibe. Its not meant to be serious; so don't go in expecting Death Note or Attack On Titan from it.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is just okay; the op is trash and even the ending is that good. Well, that was my initial thought upon first watching it; there wasn't any memorable soundtracks or anything. But, as I slowly got deeper into the series I fucking loved the music. The ending? It's bad, I will admit, but it's beautiful at the same time. Its the best anime op I know of, just because I've bonded so much with the series that looking back at the song just brings fondness and good emotions. Not only that, but the actual soundtracks inside the anime are amazing; they're simple, with nice beats and a retro like feel. \\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nHow to say this without going crazy. The characters are the absolute best; they all have unique and quirky personalities that make them easily distinguishable. They're likeable, charming and at times comical and dramatic; each character is perfectly crafted and has layers upon layers of depth. While they may seem simple on the outside, once you grasp the character you'll never look away... These are the type of characters that haunt you for months and months to come. I advise if you're new to the series to pay lots of attention to their personalities, their vibes, mannerisms, greetings, speech and really everything about them. Danganronpa essentially takes all the stereotypes and puts it into an anime that appears cliche but is probably the farthest from that. \\n\\n\r\n10/10, and after playing the second game you will understand what true beauty is if you don't know already. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAn obvious 10/10 I think. It's nice and short, simple yet so complicated and very mysterious; you're constantly guessing but at the same time enjoying the characters and animation. And when you think you like that character, well too bad they're dead; there are even some characters that you will like after they've already died. It's not just that though; perhaps Danganronpa's overall weirdness is one of the greatest aspects of it. The pink blood and odd songs you will grow to love; it is all apart of what makes Danganronpa what it is. \\n\\n\r\nI will also add that the murder mystery aspect is perhaps one of the most enjoyable. It is a great anime for making predictions and what not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nA 10/10, higher if I could do that. It's not even just this anime that is nesscarily the 10/10, but the whole franchise that ties it all together; if you like the anime you'll probably play the game and from there you've been brainwashed by the producers forever. But even the anime alone is amazing, and I'm positive it will linger in your mind for awhile. \\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa is actually an inspiration to me; not only have I gotten actually smarter from watching it, but I've taken such a higher value to life now. Because of Danganronpa, there's so many things I want to do. There is nothing but utter passion for it within my soul, and I see it as a mentor of sorts. Call me cheesy all you want, but it taught me many things including what true beauty is and how deep both characters and people can be. \\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend at least giving it a try; and if you do, have an open mind when it comes to the pink blood and stuff :3",

            "content": "So before I get into this review, I do have to lay down another little disclaimer. Like almost all anime based on video games, I have not played Danganropa. I have seen people play it, though have not seen all of the game. With that, it means that I cannot fully say if this anime is the best representation of the game when it comes to the feel of you playing it, I can only base it on visualization and some of the storyline. \r\nWhen it comes to the characters, I am not going to go through all of them. Seriously, 16 characters including Monokumaare way too many to have to pick apart and talk about. Not to mention, sadly we don\u2019t get very much about them as well. I do remember that in the actual game, we had much more time to select our favorites and talk with them, get to know them better and start to have connections. Sadly, the anime seems to be way to short for that as it only follows the main game sequences. We really only get to know Naegi (who is pretty much a blank slate), Kyoko (who is pretty much mysterious), Byakuya (snobby rich kid), and Toko (timid and paranoid). While we do get a little more out of them besides these stereotypes, most of it leads to spoilers that I can\u2019t really speak about. I think my favorites were Toko and Kyoko though as they seemed to have more about them that I liked. For most of the show, I really didn\u2019t like Byakuya at all, thinking he was to snobby and never really showed any growth to his character in actually working with the others.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, I can\u2019t really speak much on the story without major spoilers, but I do want to talk about something that did tend to bother me a little bit. It was the pacing of the show. I feel like it went to fast. While I understand that not everyone would like a show to be long and drawn out, I feel the show went a little to fast. The format of the show was basically murder in one episode along with searching for clues and then next episode was the class trial ending with them figuring something out, and then next episode was rinse and repeat. We didn\u2019t even get all of the clues ourselves when they are searching around, most of those clues showed up in the trial making it hard for us to guess who did it. The one thing I love about mysteries is trying to solve the show before anyone else did in the show. That plus the fact we didn\u2019t get to know anyone personally meant that it felt rushed. I could have seen it being at least a 24 episode show instead of a 13 episode one.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual presentation is very clean and matches the game pretty well. With a game that normally has static character designs that don\u2019t move much, they were able to show the emotion and \u2018switch\u2019 of a characters perspective pretty nicely in my opinion. I loved how they integrated the \u2018bullet time\u2019 and other small mini games into the show but the word mini game felt as though it went a little to fast. I understand as an anime, it shouldn\u2019t take very long so not to bore the player, but we also probably could serve a bit better if they had Naegi talk a tiny bit then. They also kept the death sequences almost exact to the gameplay; it was as though they just took the cut scenes from the game for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was very well done for most of the characters, the only one I seemed to feel that was not voiced fully well was Junko, though exactly why is something I can\u2019t say within my review. All I can say was that she sounded really annoying to me. I don\u2019t remember if that was how she sounded in the game sadly though, I don\u2019t remember any of their voices in the game. Although Naegi sounded like almost any other protagonist in an anime (sort of whiny in a way but also bland), I think it worked perfectly. In the game he was sort of a clean slate for people to put themselves into the game, an ordinary high school student with no exceptional talent to speak of. Big props go to Greg Ayres who gave a very awesome rendition of the voice for Monokuma. I do remember that in the game, his voice was a bit higher pitched then Greg\u2019s version but I seem to like Greg\u2019s better. He still kept the awesome feel of the character.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I think that the animation had much of the same spirit as the game (Again this is based to what I have seen of the game), its story sort of lost some appeal in how fast it went. I really felt we should take the time to get to know some of the characters so that their deaths were a bit more heartbreaking. Instead, I found myself thinking \u2018Ah\u2026 and another one bites the dust, who killed them this time\u2019 instead of having the emotion that you might have had in the game after getting to know them. It\u2019s still a very interesting show to watch, but I still think that it\u2019s no replacement to the game.\\n",

            "content": "P R E M I S E\r\nA friend recommended this to me back in early-mid August 2013, a month before I watched the anime. See, at the time I knew that \"The Animation\" meant that it's an adaption to a game. So playing the game is what I did, and well, I decided to spoil the anime for myself. Why? To put it simply, for an entire game to be adapted into 13 episodes, I just knew that the anime wouldn't cover everything the game had to offer.\r\nBecause of my experience with Danganronpa, I did not have high expectations for the anime. Knowing that animeadaptions hardly ever exceed its sources, I normally don't criticize it too harshly even now. However, this is a review on the anime adaption as a standalone, and I cannot give it good points all the time just because it has an excuse for being 13 episodes covering an entire game. Nonetheless, it keeps some things I wanted there and doesn't stray far off the plot; more of, it only hits the main plot points of the game.\\n\\n\r\nS H O R T C O M I N G S\\n\r\nFurthering what I briefly discussed in the premise, compressing an entire murder-mystery game into 13 episodes is a risky action - it's quite the \"make it or break it\" decision. In this case, it's not completely horrid, but it does make things seem rushed and sometimes nonsensical. In the game, there are so many opportunities to bond with the other characters, but the anime had to cut that out because the main plot points take a lot of screentime (a.k.a. the murder investigations and school trials). This causes a lack of a bond in characters for the viewer, and murders suddenly seem a whole lot less devastating. I'm not saying that this anime should've gotten 24 episodes or more, but it should've gotten possibly 15 episodes. Seriously, almost every episode seems rushed; too much is happening, and it's easy to dislike that, for the characters have no connection with me like they did with the game and the whole thing looks dramatic and ridiculous, as if the students don't put up a good fight to the enemy holding the murder rules until the very end, where it just looks stupid. The animation is mediocre, though not downright unbearable. \\n\\n\r\nP R O S\\n\r\nDespite my rant, there are some redeeming qualities in Danganronpa: The Animation. For one thing, the art is much more colorful in the anime than in the game, even though it can get disproportional. Danganronpa is very unique for the color of the blood, which is a neon, bright pink - I honestly think that's what viewers will remember the most. The executions are closely related to the game, which relieved me that that remained. The characters are unique too, as they have special talents and really cool character designs. The best part to me is the music though; it's slightly haunting, capable of picking up adrenaline whenever it wants, and it's the part that makes you suddenly feel like the next episode will be better. The OP features an English singer, which is always awesome for Japanese creators, and the ED is sung by soraru, one of my favorite utaites.\\n\\n\r\nC L O S U R E\\n\r\nThe game is much better in experience, for Danganronpa has a very amazing story and cast of characters, but if you'd like to save your time and not spend so much on it, then the anime doesn't do too bad of a job cutting your time down to about 6.5 hours if you watch it straight. Though, warning, your attachment to the characters will be considerably weak, and you might get outright confused at many points. To me, I feel like the anime adaption had a lack of proper effort put into it, but I don't think that many people will actually dislike it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall: 36/50 ~ 72% ~ 7/10",

            "content": "Danganronpa: The Animation (Spoiler Free Review)\r\nDanganronpa was produced by Geneon Universal Entertainment, Mainichi Broadcasting System, and Showgate. \r\nThe studio responsible was Lerche who are known for Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (Assassination Classroom) and Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou. \r\nDanganronpa: The Animation is an adaptation of the manga of the same name created by Spike Chunsoft.\r\nStep foot into Hope\u2019s Peak Academy where a survival game is taking place. Fifteen have entered and only one can leave victorious. Watch along as the students fight amongst themselves as well as the president in order to discover the true mystery of the academy. \r\nStory: The story takes place in Hope\u2019s PeakAcademy which is a school for students known as \u201celites\u201d such as the Baseball Elite or the Model Elite. 15 elites are enrolled in this school thinking that it\u2019s just a school for the most talented people in different fields. Unfortunately for the students it turns out to be a false paradise. The school principal, Monobear, begins a game in which the 15 students must kill each other with the last one standing being given the opportunity to leave. The difference between this show and other survival games is that after a person is murdered the survivors conduct investigations to find who the murderer was. Then a trial is held to decide who did the murder. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in this show were all modeled on different personalities common in high schoolers. The model, baseball player, biker, nerd, programmer, jock, etc. Each character had a pretty good design and from the get go I was already picking who was going to go far in this game and who wasn\u2019t. The main character, Naegi Makota was quite the surprise for me. I did not expect him to play the role he did and I was very happy with his personality. Most characters have decent motivations for their actions and most of the murders were justified which was good, it would have sucked if the whole show was people just randomly killing one another but then again that is the point of the game.\\n\\n\r\nMystery: The actual mysteries that the show has are fairly easy to pick up on and you\u2019ll probably figure out who committed the crime before the characters do. Where the anime thrives however is its ability to borrow the key elements from the video game adaptation which came before it and implement them into the show. The pieces of evidence and journals that the characters keep had a video game feel which was brilliant. It gives the viewer an easy to follow documentation of what it happening in the investigation.\\n\\n\r\nProblems: It was too easy to figure out who the murderer was in most cases. I prefer when I am surprised at who did it when it comes to mysteries and the difficulty of the cases wasn\u2019t too hard.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I thought that the animation was quite good. Every character came to life on screen and it for the most part was very enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I liked the opening theme song. Aside from that the music was unnoticeable, it wasn\u2019t great but didn\u2019t detract from the overall experience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Danganronpa: The Animation was a good experience. If you\u2019re looking for a different take on the \u201csurvival game\u201d plot then this is the anime for you. I would rate this as an anime that was worth the time.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m giving Danganronpa: The Animation a 7/10.\\n",

            "content": "\"What do you want to make us do?\"\r\n\"What I want to make you do? Well, I want to... make you all despair. That's all.\"\r\nNow that, that sent a chill down my spine as it was being said, just such a depressing thing to say, that's all.\r\nBecoming accepted into one of the most, if not the most prestigious high schools in the country by sheer luck, what could go wrong? Well, most likely everything, to be honest. So much for being classified as the Ultimate Lucky student, Makoto Naegi.\r\nAs I have been watching this anime, I have been playing the visual novel at the same time,mainly because I was very curious to see how each would compare with one another. However, the review here is for the anime and I will merely occasionally reference the visual novel here and there.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHere, in Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation, we have a group of high school students, supposedly the best of the best at what they do (e.g. ultimate swimmer, ultimate programmer, ultimate gambler, etc.), and are chosen to attend Hope Peak Academy, an academy that guarantees one success in the future if he/she can graduate. However, if only things were that peachy keen, no?  To graduate, one has to commit a murder and get away with said murder, something that is not exactly sane, nor something high school students should be participating in.\\n\\n\r\nNow the whole concept of murder mystery is nothing new, basically survival of the fittest and wittiest, so it all depends on the execution. What makes or break these type of series is the, so to say, execution of the series. In the case of the anime, we have a typical \"whodunit\"/courtroom drama plot as we experience the story mainly through the protagonist, Makoto Naegi, as he tries to figure out how to escape from hell without having other people try and kill each other.\\n\\n\r\n I think for me what makes this experience so special is the fact that we are dealing with potential high school students. Most other series usually deals with adults and whatnot, so it was definitely in a way refreshing, for a lack of better terms, to see how the ultimate high school students would be affected. Other than that, it is pretty much another murder mystery series, a series that I definitely do enjoy watching, but was nothing too different.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with the story was the pacing. I feel like it progressed way too quickly and because of this pace, it was difficult to set up an atmosphere of suspense and we were just barraged with a copious amount of information. However, take what I say with a grain of salt because for a good while, I played the visual novel first, so I kind of more or less already knew what was going to happen, but regardless, when the scenes presented themselves, I still enjoyed them very much. But the plot twists are real\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow regarding the art, the biggest difference I think I saw was that the anime was a tad bit brighter, though I will need to make that comparison again. Other than that, the anime stayed pretty faithful to the artwork of the visual novel and even recreates some of them using very similar if not the same art style. The artwork in general looked very crisp and clean when things were pretty happy and whatnot and then looked very grimy and dark and depressing when a murder did take place and not once was I not fascinated by what I was seeing. Such appropriate usage of different art styles when necessary definitely makes this one not an eyesore to see. However, I do question the usage of pink blood, that, I still do not why was used.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the artwork of the characters, they were very well done and it was definitely easy to distinguish one from another. Their designs are still deeply engraved in my head and hell, even characters who briefly show up are still fairly distinguishable and have somewhat unique design to them.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, you can tell, I am not very proficient in describing art, all I can say is it pays homage to the visual novel and that it is very nice to look at, very memorable and enjoyable to experience.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNow the music is what definitely, for me, brought the anime that one extra step. It definitely pays homage to the visual novel and in a way reminded me of the anime Persona 4 the Animation where sometimes remixes or direct renditions of songs from the source material were implemented. When nothing serious is going on and everyone is having a good time, very playful and calming music plays and when something terrible was going to or was happening, the music suddenly took a dip and was just depressing to listen to. However, the series took a turn sometimes and when something serious was happening,you would have somewhat cheerful and playful music, as if to mock what is really happening and that everything to the mastermind, otherwise known as Monokuma, who I will describe later, is having a great time and that all of it really is a game.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is so memorable as we have an English rap sung by actual Americans with lyrics that are actually referencing hope and whatnot despite the whole series focusing on despair and a lack of hope; not to mention, the opening is very similar to the opening of the visual novel, referencing all the characters and whatnot and scenes present in the series. The opening sounds like as if there is really hope, but is that true? Who knows, who knows.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the ending, I love how they decided to employ the utaite Soraru. For those who are fans of utaite, you will understand how amazing something like this is. An utaite is pretty much a person who covers songs, mainly, but not limited to, Vocaloid songs and post them on Nico Nico Douga, probably the most popular Japanese video sharing website, very similar to YouTube. But that aside, the ending is memorable in the sense that is has very retro theme to it, kind of like a very old video game in the 70s or 80s, and surprisingly fit the theme really well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, excellent music that definitely is very appropriate and memorable and even when not appropriate, just makes the situation that much creepier. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nOh boy, the characters. Now despite having a multitude of characters to focus and keep track of, many of them are pretty memorable. Each of them are definitely defined by their \"ultimate\" characteristics and with it, gives them their individual personalities. Every single one of them is very different from one another and it makes it very easy to keep track of who is who. While the anime does not go into detail as the visual novel does regarding each of the characters, obviously due to a lack of time, each one is still easily distinguishable and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nNow what makes these characters so special is the voice actors. They chose some of the best voice actors (e.g. Hikasa Yoko, Megumi Ogata, Nobuyo Ooyama, Chiwa Saito, Kousuke Toriumi, Kujira, Kazuya Nakai, Akira Ishida just to name a lot) and each one of them just absolutely brings their characters to life. It is just very difficult to describe in detail how the voice acting was done, but all I can say is that it is beyond excellent and is definitely one of the selling points of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, the character of interest, Monokuma. He is definitely what makes this show so special and quite interesting to watch. He is definitely by far one of the most evil characters of all time and I think is like another Jigsaw, someone who greatly takes pleasure in the suffering of others and a murder here and there just means more fun. I still have a hard time believing that voice actor for Monokuma, Nobuyo Ooyama,also did the voice of the lovable Doraemon, just let that sink in for a while.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime? Of course I did. Do I recommend others to watch it? If you like a pretty okay murder mystery, go for it. While I do not guarantee a completely in depth analysis and experience like that of Monster or the visual novel itself, it is still a relatively enjoying anime to watch. As I always tell people, I am quite easily entertained and something like a murder mystery, whether executed excellently well or not, is still a joy for me to watch. Even knowing what was going to happen, it was because of the excellent execution that made the series still quite enjoyable to experience a second time. The music is golden, the artwork is very appropriate, the characters are all memorable and distinct, and with a pretty entertaining story, I do think this is a series that the average user can enjoy; just look past the pretty fast story line and a bit lack of detail for every character and I do think this experience can be enjoyable.",

But if you play the game you will realize it' actually isn't rushed, but still has some holes. Now I'm gonna try to do this strictly anime.\r\nStory:9/10\r\nGroup of highschooler's forced to kill each other. Hell yeah! Story was pretty interesting for those who like mystery solving. Though the story telling in the anime itself was awful. Episode 1 nothing really happened while episode 2 too much happened. Pacing was poorly done. But sadly the problem is thisanime had a budget that they could pass, and with a slow beginning like that nobody was gonna watch it. I only watched it cause I saw someone die in the first five seconds, and I liked the opening song. It gets me motivated.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nA lot of people hate on the whole pink blood thing, but I don't actually. Dangan Ronpa isn't a happy go lucky thing. The whole thing is actually pretty dark if you know what all happened besides what the anime, and Dangan Ronpa 1 showed. I believe the pink blood was used to put a happy face on a darker subject. Kinda like joking about a friends puppy dying. Sad subject so you try to make light of it. Besides that whatever the exacutions, and stuff don't really matter. Kinda like the Persona games. Cut scene everyone is drawn differently, nobody says anything about that!\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nTooken directly from the game so yeah. Opening and ending though were both nice like I mentioned. I actually think this is the first time I mentioned opening and endings in my reviews. I usually only mention background music. I need to remember to do this. Anyway Soraru was awesome with the ending, and the full version of the opening is much better. Though I don't know why they decided on rap music in the opening. Like the ending was kinda 8-bit which the game has pixel character's quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:9/10\\n\r\nUnless you play the game, and have the abililty to truly appreciate someones quirks, and personality you probably would disagree with me. Kinda like SDR2 Koizumi how everyone hates her. I love her. Dangan Ronpa games have casts of truly interesting characters. Most of them are misunderstood by both the rest of the cast, and fans. Even Naegi is pretty interesting despite being a stock character. I can't show a example without spoiler's but there's several blogs based around character defense, and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:5/10\\n\r\nDangan Ronpa is my favorite game so far. So bluntly.... Screw the anime play the game.\\n\\n\r\n(Edit: When I say \"screw the anime\" I mean that if you have the means to obtain Dangan Ronpa by vita, or psp emulator don't watch the anime, unless you want to make a comparision. Since this was probably made just to get the game know if your already interested just play the game. Dangan Ronpa was one of the best selling games in Japan when it came out so they probably could have made a better one with the proceeds. The adaption is rushed and basically inferior to the original game in every way. Similar to how Persona 4 was turned into a 22 episode anime and all the social links were finished in a single episode. Each character has 3-6 events in Dangan Ronpa where none of them are shown in the anime. So the anime is the just the story, and nothing else, because of the time restraint it doesn't allow viewers to fully enjoy character and their relationships not only Naegi's but also others that develope over the course of the game. Also investigations are cut down dramatically not only murder investigations, but also exploring new areas. Without knowing all the clues it's impossible to solve the cases. So you won't fully be able to enjoy the mystery's of the game. Unlike how Umineko, had long periods of discussing a single subject covering only two subjects in a episode while Dangan Ronpa covers the whole case. So when I said \"screw the anime\" watching the anime is pointless unless you can obtain the game since you can't fully enjoy all that Dangan Ronpa has to offer.)\\n\\n\r\n(Edit: I mentioned that the anime wasn't rushed, however I never went into detail about why, so I'm making this edit to do so. The reason why I don't think Dangan Ronpa is rushed is because the original purpose wasn't to fully convey what Dangan Ronpa had to offer. Since the original Dangan Ronpa game was realized I think in 2009 and SDR2 was released in 2012 this anime was made in 2013. Inbetween the game and the anime is a full 4 years which is a rather big time gap. Around the time Dangan Ronpa finished airing Spike Chunsoft release a trailer for Dangan Ronpa Another Episode, and a teaser for Dangan Ronpa 3. Most likely the anime was made souly to bring in more people. Yeah the people who already knew of it hated it, but I found the anime first and didn't think it was bad until I played the game. Both Dangan Ronpa and it's sequal were high selling in each of their years so why couldn't they have made a full 22 episode+ anime? Because it was publicity to hype people up for Dangan Ronpa Another Episode. So if the original goal was to show minimal story then the animation isn't rushed. I'd say they did exactly what they wanted to do.)",

            "content": "My First Review, and can guys give me some advice if you think that i missed something. Arigatou\r\n\t\t\tDanganronpa The Animation: Review\r\nStory:\r\nThe story in Danganronpa begins with our main character Makoto Neagi, who is attending a academy called Hope's Peak Academy. He wakes up inside a classroom after getting unconscious and has no memory of what happened, the windows and doors are also closed so he can't escape, and he finds out that he is going to meet the rest of the characters inside a gym. After they resemble  they meet a mysteriouse half black white bear called Monokuma. \r\nMonokuma explains to them that theonly way to to graduate from the academy is to kill one of their classmate. But it is only if the killer doesn't get caught, and all happens in an debate inside a room called Classroom Trial. If they get the right person, he will be executed for disturbing the law, but if they get the wrong person, everyone besides the killer gets executed and the killer are free to graduate.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really like with this series is how mysterious it is. And it has a interesting concept to it, killing another classmate without getting caught by the others is so interesing. And it keeps you up to toes, because you might not know who killed that person, and its very interesing to find out who the killer is after revealing them, which most mystery anime isn't that good at, some are but not all. And you get attached to some of the characters throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I don't like however is that they keep mentioning hope and not to lose hope. We knew that since from the beginning, they don't need to mentioning it every single episode. Another thing that I didn't like is that it is rushed, the investigation is like 7 minutes long, and I don't even see the characters bond to each other, which I don't like that much. \\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nWhen it comes to art and animation, this get to the top. Because the characters doesn't look like each other like they are twins, many of the characters has an interesting art to them. And I love the art and animation style when they debate who the murderer is. And I love espasially the animation and art when a character gets executed. It goes from 2D to 3D art style in the execution, which I find very interesting. And the 3D art style fits the concept aswell.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I really like though is that whenever a person says a word, that specific word will pop on the screen, and later on the main character shoots the word, so you can see what flaw a person said.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters is probably one of the weakest parts in the anime. You don't see character bond with each other, the only characters I think you can see bonding a little is Naegi and Kirigiri. The characters has a title that they have which are called Super Duper High School Something, which is pretty interesting in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nAnd since it is to many characters in the anime and I can't talk about all of them, I will only talk about the important ones. The main character Makoto Neagi is the character that always knows the truth by the end of each debate, I know that the series is based on a game with the character you play as in the same game. \\n\\n\r\nNext up I think is important is Kirigiri Kyouko, Kirigiri is a mysterious girl that you don't know much about until atleast on later episodes, and I find her very interesting because of the mysteriousness, and she is a girl with a calm mind and doesn't panic like the rest of them.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is just your typical mystery kind of show, but the music that most stands out is the main opening, Never Say Never (No its not from \\n\r\nJustin Bieber). \\n\\n\r\nThe opening gets you pumped up to each and new episodes in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I really like the music when the character are debating and when they are investigating a crime scene.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Overall Results:\\n\r\nThe story is a bit rushed and that, but the concept is interesing which will give it a 6/10 points.\\n\r\nThe art/animation style is very cool and beautiful to look at, and each character has their own personality and art style, and the 3D art style fits the concept, which I will give it a 7/10 points.\\n\r\nThe characters is the weakest in the anime because you don't see any character bonding with each other, but you might like some characters like I do (Kirigiri), which I will give it a 4/10 points.\\n\r\nAnd last but not least the sound, the sound is you typical mystery show type of music, but you get pumped for each and new episodes because of the opening theme Never Say Never (no not from Justin Bieber again!), and the investigation and the debate musics and good, in my opinion, which I will give it a 6/10 points.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I begin my review, I want to say that I am not the most serious critic. I only state my opinions in my reviews, and I don't shove false facts down peoples throats saying the show is bad. With that out of the way, let me start the review.\r\nDanganronpa: The Animation is uh... quite interesting, IF it was done right. This was done absolutely horribly. First of all, this anime is THIRTEEN episodes. And the game has over 20 hours of gameplay. Now, 3 ep - 60, 13 ep, around 4 hour 20 minutes. 20 hours = 4 hours, 16 hours difference. You seewhere I'm getting at? Neither do I. But anyway, this would of been decent if it was at least longer than 13 episodes. It's absolutely garbage because of that reason.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually okay, I don't mind it, yet I've seen a couple of other circumstances like this one. Okay, you've arrived at school. Now, if you can kill someone without getting caught, you graduate, and it's only for my lulz purposes. A bear that runs the school says that. THAT is basically the story. The bear of the school makes an announcement once two or more people find the dead body and then everyone investigates and sees what they can find out.\\n\\n\r\nAfter they have done enough investigating, they eventually hold a Classroom Trial. If they can identify the killer, the killer is punished, also known as, killed. The killer will be killed if they are identified and if they cannot identify the killer, the killer graduates and everyone else dies instead, maybe, my memory is quite shit.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty good, I like how for every death scene they took it straight from the game.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's okay, but I wouldn't listen to the soundtrack if I was bored. I'd be better off watching Boku no Pico if I was THAT bored.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are only absolute garbage because of their non-existent development. In the games, the characters had awesome developments and had great contact with Naegi, in the anime, Naegi talks to the killers about two times before they kill someone and then they die. Well, every character would of been better if they had made the series longer and made them have more contact with Naegi.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite giving the story a decent rating, this anime wasn't... too great. No, in fact, it was absolutely horrible. I might rewatch it to remember some things that I forgot in this review, but not for fun. If I wanted to rewatch something for fun, I'd probably watch Lucky Star.",

There was much to explore in Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, but the anime left out some things in which should have been there.

The anime itself felt very rushed, and trying to fit the whole game into 13 episodes was a challenge in and of itself. I don't have much to say on the art, but it felt choppy paired with the executions, which came directly out of the game. The dubbed cast was mediocre, I was expecting a little more diversity, and maybe some not well known VA's? The characters were beautiful. Each one had a different personalities and I felt a deepconnection to all of them, no matter how much screen time they received. Overall, the characters were well rounded and well crafted. Besides the quality, the storyline matched that of the game. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and was suspenseful as ever. Overall, it's nowhere near the quality of the game. I'd only recommend it if you don't have the system required to play Dangan Ronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. I was expecting better, and hopefully the anime adaption of the second game (if made,) will be better.",

Danganronpa takes it to another level you have to vote the criminal and it has to be in a debate, this makes it more hardcore and more enjoyable but don\u00b4t expect to bite your nails with it. Great animation As reference to videogames because we don\u00b4t have to forget that this anime is an adaptation of a videogame, makes reference to the 8 bit videogames of the NES. And finallyand for me the most outstanding thing of this anime is MONOKUMA. Monokuma is a great character, in any time you expect a little kawaii teddy bear to be so sadistic and so frivolous, this anime gains a lot of points with Monokuma. This is the only great character the other ones are very... meh...  And finally the most horrible thing of this anime is the main character. Awful, AWFUL.",

The anime is basically about a school for elite high schoolers that enrolled based off of their skills and traits. \r\nArt 7:  Art was good and I love the fact that lerche changed the art style during the punishment round. The characters look like your typical anime character with huge hair and eyes and their clothes are crazy.\r\nSound 8: I didn't think the intro song was that great and the music stayed the same for the most part, but I did like the closingsong\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: The characters are fantastic, they are all so unique and they all have developed so nicely throughout the season.  I love the different kinds of people that are in this anime. Once again so many plot twists and unexpected moments that really got me saying, \"Wait what!? why that person!\" \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: Very fun anime and got me thinking a lot. You really have to pay attention to details and hints in this anime.  Lots of funny moments, I really did like the little bear [Monokuma] what an evil little plushy lol. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: I thought the anime was great, my only problem with it is the color blood they chose which made it look more funny than looking like blood. I do recommend for you guys to watch it if you are reading this. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading :)\\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BVBJEObBhsx/?taken-by=geek.workshop\\n",

            "content": "I'd like to say that this is my first review and I am not a good critiquer, but I hope this helps!\r\nFirst of all, if you didn't know, this anime is based off the Dangan Ronpa 1: Trigger Happy Havoc game, and is a faster version of what happens. I played the game some time before I watched the anime, and I was slightly satisfied.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story is pretty much the same as the game, which is about 15 students who are trapped in a school that they were invited to join and just step foot in, Hope's Peak Academy. A killing game starts andthe students have to find the killer of each case or all get killed, while the killer gets away. This could be kind of fun if you don't know what happens in the game, because you can try to figure out at least part of the mystery yourself. I quite liked the story, other than the fact that it was a bit fast-paced. There were quite a few twists to each murder case and made the story more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nBefore I watched the anime, I originally hated the art style, which differed from the art style of the game, which I liked a lot more. But as I watched the anime, I grew to accept it, and I guess it's not bad. It doesn't really stand out, nor is it really bad, so I consider it mediocre. I like the character designs, as all the characters look different and special in their own way. The animation was ok too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI liked the music in the anime, as most of it came from the game, and sets the mood well, especially when there's a lot of tension. The opening and ending songs are also rather memorable, but I didn't really like the opening song. I don't speak Japanese, but I think the voice acting was pretty good, especially how the seiyuus could portray their respective character's emotions very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nThere wasn't much room for actual character development in the anime as compared to the game where you could talk to them, but I think that's fine. I like the personalities of the characters, as they are quite unique and related to their talents, mostly. Many people have said this before, but in the anime we're not as connected to the characters compared to in the game, where we got to interact with them as Makoto, the main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nWell, since I played the game before I watched the anime, I already knew everything that happened, but I still rather enjoyed watching this. It was rather interesting to watch, to see how the anime would play out the events of the game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nPerhaps if there had been more episodes and longer investigations and class trials, it would be better. But I think this anime is still worth watching. If you can't play the game, then watching the anime wouldn't be very disappointing. But if you have played the game, then unless you want a recap, I suggest that maybe you shouldn't watch the anime.",

            "content": "It's Like Total Drama Island, but with Murder!\r\nThe show is only a quick 13 episodes. Besides the beginning and finale, most episodes form two-episode arcs. In the first episode the characters interact with each other and motives are established while subtly setting up potential clues, and at the end a body is found. The second episode picks up with the students searching the school for clues and meeting at the jury hall to discuss their findings and put someone to trial. I wish I did have a copy of the game, because the punishment sequences are all unique to the killer and their theme orplace in life in a way that\u2019s viciously ironic like something out of a Saw movie. The downside to this being adapted from a game is that whenever Naegi finds a clue it highlights it to the audience like Psyche. Plus before every trial he gets \"emotion bullets,\" a set amount of points he can make to show a fault in logic, shown by metaphorical bullets. It\u2019s clearly a game mechanic brought over to the show, and each time he does it, I expect him to shout \"Objection!\"\\n\\n\r\nNaegi is not much of a character sadly, in that he is just a generic main character. I guess his strongest defining characteristic is his powers of deduction and reason. The supporting cast is stronger. The 14 people Naegi is trapped in the school with are perfectly distinct in both design and character. Some of them are a little cliche in the talents they exhibit: the doujin artist is an overweight otaku and the business major is an elitist snob. But others are have completely unique talents and personalities, such as \"Hall Monitor\" Ishimaru, an eccentric stickler for rule following, and Fukawa the creative writer, who has a very dark surprise I won't spoil.\\n\\n\r\nThe overarching plot is Naegi trying to figure out what this bomb shelter of a school really is and why Monokuma is doing this to them. Monokuma has a bit of mystery about him as he is a talking bear plush subjecting the teens to these horrors. I found the reveal very disappointing, but oddly I wished the show would continue. Maybe I'm just a sucker for mystery thrillers, but I didn\u2019t want the murder mysteries to end because I enjoyed watching Naegi work his way through them and sometimes have to prove his innocence. There is talk of a sequel, so I am looking forward to what comes next, and I highly recommend you give this a watch.",

            "content": "Danganronpa is an exciting series - there are plot twists and turns lurking around every corner, and the anime preserves those. However, due to the shortness of this anime, the plot is quite compressed and there isn't as much time for the viewer to really theorize about how the story will turn out in the end (although that might be a side effect of binge-watching the whole show over a few days). The trials were also quite compressed and the evidence was only briefly looked at, so the viewer essentially has to wait for Naegi, Kirigiri, and Togami to solve the trial and explain whatthe evidence means. That being said, this adaptation is very faithful to the events of the game that it was based on and it was really cool to see everything all animated out. I think seeing everything animated really helped me understand where everyone was in relation to each other a little better, especially when it ended up being important in the trials.\\n\r\nI also really liked the voice acting in the dub. While there wasn't much time for character development, I still really felt for the characters because of how much emotion they showed (especially in Chapter 4, that made me cry!!!)\\n\r\nThe art and sound were also really good! I still have the opening theme stuck in my head and the music still created that creepy, tense atmosphere that really sets the mood.\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the show, but I would recommend watching it after playing the game or watching a let's play of the game, so you can see the plot unfold with better pacing and more character development.",

            "content": "Danganronpa: The Animation\r\nAmazing anime for anyone looking for a thriller but don't want the same cliches repeated over and over again. People who have played the game may disagree with my statement and they say that the animators butchered the game, so I guess just to make sure you should also play the game just for the experience (Game: Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc). The character development in this anime was not that great since it looked really rushed and some characters were just meh and looked like they didn't belong there but that is only the anime in the game their whole story was explainedwith thorough detail. If people don't like seeing blood but still crave for a thriller it's good for them too since the artist made the blood hot pink to keep the rating of the game away from mature but I guess they continued it one to the anime as well so it would be better on people who take a little violence. The storyline of the anime may seem confusing but the last episode brings the whole storyline together to help you understand. Warning beforehand you will crave for more after the anime ends since it leaves wondering and wondering about the mysterious ending and what actually happened to our main characters. If people like newer art styles in anime this one has a really interesting one it is called 2.5d drawing which combines 2d and 3d art style to make a unique pop art effects.\\n\\n\r\nNew Viewers\\n\r\nI won't recommend this anime to new viewers since it won't match their taste, my vision of new viewers is people who just got introduced to anime with Naruto or pokemon so I think this is not for them. If they want to watch thriller anime anyways they should watch something death note\\n\\n\r\nWho would like this\\n\r\nPeople who liked Ace attorney, Conan or any sort of detective anime would like this since it is basically the same. Light-Hearted people who watch anime for romance purposes etc. may not be interested in this since it is a way different idea. People that like to think will love this anime will probably like this anime more than all the other viewers.\\n\\n\r\nUnrelated Note\\n\r\nThis was my first time reviewing an anime so sorry if you think anything is wrong with I tried my best and hope to make a lot of new friends on this platform. Also sorry for the anime being outdated. \uff3c(^\u25bd^)/\\n\\n\r\nFinal Review:\\n\\n\r\nNoice",

If you truly want an unforgettable experience, I recommend that you buy it. \r\nWhen I first watched the Danganropa anime, I knew nothing about the games but that infamous bear-like plush of Monokuma left me no choice but to give it a try. It was a quite enjoyable series. Every episode was engaging and it took very little time to finish. The style was vibrant and unique but fit well within the story. At times,however, I felt it lacked something. I was often left amazed by the cunning writing, only to be betrayed by the brevity of explanation and lightning quick pacing. By the time I finished it, I thought \"this was bad yet so good\". \\n\\n\r\nAfter doing some research on the series I found out about the games and gave them a try. I was completely knocked off my feet with the brilliance of them. Whatever the anime lacked I found in them. The animation was superb, the use of sound was emotionally euphoric, the characters became my brothers, and the writing was inventive. With that said I am grateful to the anime for introducing me to such a great series. Should you watch it? Absolutely, it's an enjoyable series and even if you think the quality is poor you'll still love it for what it is. Should you play the games? Yes! Yes! Yes! The games are original, ingenious, and unlike the anime a production piece of the highest caliber. \\n\\n\r\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading :)",

The story can also be a little bit confusing if you are not paying attention (idk if that was just me though). \r\nWhat really made me like this anime is art style. Panning from traditional looking anime to 3D violent and I mean violent death scenes are amazing.I also thought it was interesting that the blood in this is purple/pink not red (obviously to keep a lower rating).\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is worth a watch it is interesting and sort of reminds me of the board game Clue.",

Love all of the characters in their own ways but the anime just felt rushed and there was no character development. I would say that it is a good stepping stone to get you into the games but do not rely on it for anything important character wise. \r\nThe story itself is so unique but the anime strips the excitement away. I feel like some things are meant to stay a game, it allows more character development and more interaction with the characters. For example, inthe game, there are report cards and you can interact with the characters to get to know a character more. I understand why they didn't include this in the anime because it would take away from the story. The anime cuts down the days that they are in the school, for example, in the game, there are three days between the first murder and one day in the game.\\n\r\nI would recommend playing the game first because watching the anime takes away the shock factor because it goes through the story so fast.",

Characters are flat and stupid which is the worst when you whant to put some drama by killing your characters and make them solve problems. Characters here just hide informations for no reason and the universe itself has no sence. The anime alwaise brake his own rules making the hole thing lacking of \"reality\" and most of all, the thematyc about hope is so damn clich\u00e9. You are not sad when a character dies, you are notimpressed when they solve a problem but you can't quit because you cant to know the end. I think there is way better anime to watch rather than this.

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: This is coming from someone who has played the game.\r\nDanganronpa is a very popular Visual Novel mixed with puzzle and adventure.\r\nBecause it was so popular, they thought they'd make an anime, so that you could watch Makoto solve the mysteries on your TV screen.\r\nToday I am going to review Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation, one of my most favorite game series and anime.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story follows Makoto Naegi, who gets chosen to attend the elite High School, Hopes Peak Academy, where only the people, who are the best in their field, for example cooking or swimming, are taken. Butall takes a turn to the bad, because the students have to kill each other to get outside. The story is very interesting and makes you want to know what's the purpose of the game.\\n\r\nThe only problem I can see in the story, is that it is too rushed. You don't get to see much of the investigations and there is not much character development, but I'll get to that later. But overall, I really enjoyed the story and how it turned out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the art. I have never seen an anime drawn like this.\\n\r\nIt had a very colorful style and the way they handled the blood was also really cool. I liked how they handled the class trial. they made it look a little like the game. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThis must be one of my most favorite soundtracks. It fits perfectly to the story and characters and gives you a mysterious feeling. \\n\r\nThe opening was OK, but I wouldn't want to listen to it again. It didn't fit very good to the theme the story was giving us.\\n\r\n The ending however, was extremely good and one of my most favorite ending songs. It fit perfectly to the story and gave you the feeling of wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nI think the biggest problem with this series are the characters. Not because their annoying or stupid or have no purpose, it's because they have no time to develop. In each episode (except episode 1 and a few others), they solve a crime where one or more characters are killed, leaving no time for plot development of the students in the episodes. But overall, the characters were very enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI literally couldn't stop watching this series. It got me hooked, even if I knew already how it ended.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nIt wasn't as good as the game, but it was enough to get me hooked. I really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nFor more recommendations, I point to:\\n\r\n-Akuma no Riddle, having the same theme, only that 12 killers are trying to kill one victim.\\n\r\n-Mirai Nikki, having a survival theme, but with more brutality.\\n\r\n-Another, going more in the horror genre, but has a small theme of survival.\\n\r\n-Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, more in the horror/gore genre, but goes into the survival theme in some arcs.\\n\r\n-Corpse Party, has a survival theme, but with much more gore/splatter.  \\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking your time and reading my review. ;)\\n\\n",

            "content": "When it comes to this anime/animation, one's enjoyment will likely depend on whether or not you have seen/played the original game and know the source material. The \"Animation\" part of the title is not a simple fluff piece of the name, but truly represents the purpose of this series as literally an animated form of the game that gives a certain life to things that were not possible in the source material. \r\nOne of the main issues that comes with that fact is that the show takes a story that could last dozens of hours and condenses it down to a generous estimate of 5.2hours. Because of this, MANY details and charming bits of the game are cut to save time and you rarely get to feel the actual mysteries that take place between each trial. Things happen so quickly that you barely have any time to actually feel a connection with any of the characters and their relationships end up feeling cheesy and fake.\\n\\n\r\nI personally watched the dubbed version and cannot comment on the original voice-acting, but if you have played the original game, you may find A LOT of the new voice-actors off-putting at best and a complete downgrade at worst. The music is also just... cringey. The popular game theme is included but feels like they literally ripped the file from a copy of the game with no remastering at all. The opening themes are also disgusting raps that sounds like somebody on staff was just thrown in the booth and told to improvise. It's just not very good music for a series known for some crazy tracks.\\n\\n\r\nTo cover some good things, the art is actually very appealing and does a good job of keeping key features that give that signature \"Danganronpa\" feel to everything. There are also at least a few voice-actors that sound decent or at least believable despite being different from the originals. If they just had another 12 episodes to work with, this one probably could've been one of the best adaptions out there. Sadly, that was not the case.",

            "content": "So, the thing about this anime is that the best way to enjoy it is to either not play the game at all or go into it after playing the game and looking at the '13 episode' length and take it that it's gonna be pretty rushed. Which it is. \r\nSound (7): OMG THE DUB IS ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS, this is one thing the anime has over the game. While in the game the only parts that are completely dubbed over are the trial sequences, the anime has all these amazing little bits of hilarious dialogue that honestly had me laughing out loud and yet neverfelt unnatural for the characters I knew from the game to be saying. Like one scene where Taka comes out of the sauna after his transformation and just screams out 'THIS SAUNA IS AMAZEBALLS!!' and the line itself is absolutely hysterical, as is its delivery, but it totally doesn't feel unnatural for Taka to say this. The actual soundtrack is also pretty great as most of it is just music taken right from the game and used in the same kinds of scenes. The opening is fun and the ending is pretty good foreshadowing if I do say so myself. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7): Studio Lerche clearly had a lot of respect for the game they were adapting. Even if the anime was too short to adapt the game perfectly, it was obvious they weren't phoning it in either. They pretty much recreated everyone's base expressions from the game perfectly as well as giving them each character designs that perfectly express their personalities and are also lifted straight from the game. They even took the promo art images from the game and used them in the opening to introduce the characters. They also used the different artstyle the game uses for the execution scenes. The execution scenes are the best animated scenes in the show and just overflow with personality (as each execution is unique and distinct and based on the character being executed's personality) especially the last one. \\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters (6): The game had a really interesting concept and executed it pretty much as well as they could have. Since the plot twist that comes in Chapter 6 of the game is pretty hard to buy into if you're a scientifically/logically minded person (like me), but it still managed to make me feel some level of loss along with the characters. The anime... doesn't have enough time. It doesn't really have enough time to get me invested in the characters again at all. The best example of this is Sayaka. Okay, so, in the game, you get the entire first chapter to get to know Sayaka and grow to like Sayaka. And it's made pretty clear that your character (Makoto Naegi) does have some level of a crush on her, and then (spoiler alert) she dies at the end of the 'daily life' segment of the chapter. After having had at least four in-game days for her to develop her emotions and so her resolve to escape seems perfectly legit. She almost has her own character arc in this chapter, but the anime kills her off in episode 2, pretty much skipping all of her emotional development and seeming like she just went crazy out of nowhere. Then pulling the 'she wanted to save Naegi' thing out of NOWHERE to make us feel bad since we only really saw a little bit of interaction between Sayaka and Makoto at all. And every death in the anime is like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6): This anime is really fun and really enjoyable, but if you've played the game you need to go in with slightly lowered expectations. It's not as good as the game, but that's to be expected. If I had been adapting it, I would've given the show 25 episodes. One episode for the prologue, then four for each chapter in which the characters, investigations, and trials would all have their necessary lengths to communicate the point. The epilogue is not long enough to require its own episode, so that would just be added to the end of the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you like the game, this is a fun time and you will probably enjoy it, even if you'll know it doesn't measure up. If you haven't played the game, go play the game. \\n\\n",

Every episode ends on a dramatic cliffhanger. \r\nDespite the fact there's a lot of central characters, the majority of them are interesting and engaging. With only 13 episodes, it could probably be quite a bit better if it was longer, but even so it's very enjoyable and has a good plot. \r\nThe animation style looks brilliant and both the opening and ending songs sound fantastic, with the lyrics perfectly matching the plot of the anime rather than being just random songs. \r\nI know it's based ona video game which has a great deal more content than the anime, and a lot of people who have played the game are unwilling to give the anime a shot. The twists and plot turns are unpredictable and shocking if your new to fandom, but of course you're going to see what's coming if you've already played the game. The anime is based on the game. What did you expect? \\n\\n\r\nI recommend you watch this anime if you love anime with interesting characters, lots of drama and suspense, and a bit of coemdy thrown in. \\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this if you're a close-minded person that's played the game first and have already decided you hate this anime without even watching it.",

If you go pass major cuts in some parts, they are just the same.I love how Danganronpa pulls that \"I wonder who's the murderer!!!\" thing so well, you always end up making yourown theories and you even stop trusting people, It really makes you feel like you're a part of this despair!... and lemme tell ya... It's a Super Duper Highschool Despair... wink wink.\\n\r\nIf you love mystery and you love detective work, watch this thing... or even play the VN! both of them are amazing!",

Knowingthat I am afraid to watch rated R horror anime, she said, \"Don't worry, the blood is pink.\" \\n\r\nSo knowing the new information about the pink blood, I decided to watch it. And lets just say, having pink blood is better than having dark red blood because many people die in many ways. \\n\r\nTo be honest, this was probably the first time I've enjoyed watching a rated R horror anime. It's all because of the pink blood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt was not as scary as I expected it to be. But it has a great mystery factor to it because you think that the killer might be one person but it's actually a different person. \\n\\n\r\nRecommended:\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to people who like mysteries and thrillers.\\n\r\nNot recommended for people who don't like the non-realistic parts of the anime, such as the pink blood.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Danganronpa, an anime adaptation of a video game. However, this anime would have had lots more potential if it was given more episodes.\r\nThe story is basically about a group of teens, with each of them unique in their own field, be it sports, from an outlaw biker gang leader to a swimmer and  programmer. They get locked up in an elite school with no possible way to escape, except one: To kill a fellow student and avoid getting caught. That being said, Dangan ronpa is a good mystery genre anime, including other genres such as light comedy. It is a psychological and criminological animeand if you want to be the new sherlock holmes of 2013, watch this because after watching this, i am very aware that my detective skills have improved significantly, once in a boys locker room in school, a locker was broken and things inside were stolen, i found the culprit in less than a day thanks to this.\\n\\n\r\nThe deductive skills involved in the class trials were brilliantly portrayed, determining the culprit after someone was killed involved all the students to participate into a discussion of finding the culprit with a list of evidence and hence using those evidence to deduce the criminal/culprit. If they were agreed by the majority vote to be the culprit, they would be punished severely, and often die. The beginning of the show's class trials had bad pacing and was rushed as everyone had to speak, while people die off, the trials at the end had less people and so the pacing towards the end was actually good compared to the start. Many of the killings were performed nicely and involved a list of evidence that were found by the other students in order to determine the culprit, every time a person died, there will be a class trials, both the killings and the trials were really intriguing and they psychologically develop your investigation skills. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was decent, clear and neat, weird character designs for some of the characters, however it does manage to easily make us distinguish between who is who due to the colors and their design. The animation was fine and neatly done, it was really clear and smooth. \\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing were the executions, each punishment was unique and leaves us with sympathy in the end. However, the drama was not delivered really well and was a bit weak at the start. Don't worry Dangan ronpa won't give you tears.\\n\\n\r\nOne of its best qualities is the music. The soundtrack composed by Takada Masafumi is very catchy and addicting, it also matches well with the atmosphere and mood in the majority of the scenes. All of the openings and endings were very good and catchy, although the monobear opening was really random and weird. All the characters had decent voice acting, especially Monkuma/monobear, one of the most interesting and plot-prominent characters in the show, without his seiyuu, he would not give off the same effect for sure. Also, im glad Naegi was not shipped up with the idol girl at the start, as i thought he would since it was obvious. \\n\r\nDangan ronpa is not predictable at all to be frank, it keeps you watching and interested, the mystery is so deep and psychologically, it digs into your brain.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are qualities that ruined the potential of this anime, they were the rushed pacing at the start as mentioned before if you were reading, WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH better with 24-26 episodes. It would also give more time for developing the characters, one of the parts the anime lacked was character background and development. It would make us feel more sympathetic and empathetic if the drama was done properly by inputting development and relationships between the characters. Only about 3 were developed more than the rest, the three being Naegi, Togami and Kirigiri. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many plot twists and it made the show even better, twisting what we thought into what we never thought. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough you might get pissed and beat up your screen, this anime is really worth watching, but remember the aim is to become the new badass detective of the century.\\n",

So check this out: in order to survive, you gotta kill one of your pals without anybody finding out you did it, how about that?\r\nThe story of this anime is really unique. I mean, mystery murders inside a mystery house, and all that in order to guarantee your survival? That is just downright interesting.\r\nOk, Ok, I know. \"This anime comes from a game\", and \"everybody says that the game is much better\" and all that. I think we should not trash the anime just 'cause it is short andnot as good as the game (which I never played).\\n\r\nIt is obvious that an anime that has only 13 episodes can't have as much character and story development as the game: as expected, the anime is very rushed, compared to the game, but I digress.\\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, I think that, in spite of a rushed story, this anime can still be very enjoyable. Actually, I think that for a 13 episode anime, it did pretty good. The character development is not that bad (well, for some characters it is pretty nonexistent), the art is cool and the story, as I've said already, is very, very solid and mysterious.\\n\r\nI don't regret one bit watching the anime.",

Daganronpa is a psychological crime anime done very well. Let's start with the intro. The animation for the intro fits it very well but the song doesn't what so ever. It's some random rap song which through me way off and didn't really get me hyped to watch the anime. Character wise it the MC is very interesting but he starts off as the typical weak and kinda useless atfirst character but grows to be strong. Even though he is the typical kind of hero you still grow attached to him and want him to stay safe and survive. The side characters are great (that's a first). Each character is a token character (if you don't know what this means look it up) but even if all of these side characters are general token character each of them bring something original to the table. The plot is super intriguing and it's a multiple case anime so you'll have fun trying to make your own assumptions and trying to figure out the case yourself. Also this anime is like a M. Night Shyamalan movie where there is twist after twist but the thing is most of the twists actually fit in the anime or at least make since. All in all Daganronpa is a very well made and intriguing anime and I defiantly suggest if you have the time to check it out.",

But unfortunatly, not many are done right. On top of my head the only three I can think of are Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star), Helsing and this: Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc!\r\nDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (or in Japan Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei...not saying that again) is a dystopian thriller with lolicon, horror and even shonen elements added into it.It is probably one of the only visual novel adaptions I quite like, and joins the hall of the honoured like Fate/Stay Night UBW and Persona. It is grim, it is dark, it is grimy but on the flip side it is funny, enjoyable, and it speaks to some of our darkest desires.\\n\\n\r\nWait, what? I am about to explain myself! Danganronpa is about 16 students trapped in a school by the headmaster, Monokuma (a half-black half-white robot  who (and I quote) is your headmaster and not a bear) and the only way to escape is by killing everybody else. But get found out during a 'class trial' you get executed in the most inventive executions I have ever seen along with some of the best animation to acompany that.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Mokoto Naegi, and together with the mysterious Kyoko Kirigiri, the stubborn schoolboy Byakuya Togami, the shy, but cold Toko and her murderous other-half Genocide Jill, the fortune teller Yasuhiro and the swimmer Hina try to uncover all the secrets in the school to find out who is the mastermind.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the series, we see other character like Junko Enoshima and Mondo Owada who we all think might be the mastermind. I won't spoil who it is, but the brain f*** at the end will leave you itching...that is my ONLY complaint. The rest is very well packed; great characters including an anti-hero, a cold killer (who kills nobody...), a perv and a robot bear, what more could you ask for?\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it very much, and I can't say that I did not! The only thing was that clusterf*** right at the end...I mean, come on! And now...the pros and cons!\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Original, stunning artwork (especially the executions)\\n\r\n- A great cast of characters, who are more fleshed out in the game, but are great nevertheless\\n\r\n- Each episode leaves you gripping the edge of your seat...you really want to know what happens next!\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-You should really start on the game(s)\\n\r\n- WHAT THE F*** WAS THAT ENDING???\\n\r\n- It is over? :(\\n\\n\r\nApproval:\\n\r\n - Over the categories of Story, Art, Sound, Character, and my overall Enjoyment factor, I will give it a skip, stream, buy or ++ rating.\\n\\n\r\nMy approval for Danganronpa is BUY. It is a great lil story, but it lacks that X-Factor to make it into the best of the best...not to mention that horrible ending. \\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa is available for streaming in the US and UK or at least was late 2015. It may be worth checking Daisuki and Crunchyroll to see if they stream it, if not you can always purchase the series! I don't condone other methods, but if you really want to watch this...then, go ahead.\\n\\n\r\nRecomendations:\\n\\n\r\nHigh School of the Dead\\n\\n\r\nFist of the North Star\\n\\n\r\nHelsing\\n\\n",

The anime wasn't bad, it was a little too fast-paced, in my opinion. I had to re-watch the ending a couple of times to really get it, although that could have just been the translation. I really liked the parts where its obviously a \"cut-scene\" from the game. The art was pretty cool, and I found those were the most entertaining parts. Following the story and trying to figure out what happened before they tell you, was a lot of fun.But if youre doing that, you might as well just play the game. The characters were interesting, and there was a few surprises. So basically, it's like most other game-to-anime adaptions, where you really should just play the game because the story is so much better that way.",

This anime took all of the aspects of the game including the truth bullets, trial, and investigations, and condensed them into a quick episode for each trial that did no justice to any of the murder mysteries. I get that you just cannot put that much information into a short anime, but to butcher the plot and detective aspect of the story...it's just too disappointing. You cannot really get to know the characters at all like this, especially when it comes to the first death. It was too rushed; too manythings left out. I don't mind the minor changes; that is expected, but there was more focus on the deaths and the trial than the actual characters. It's like taking Battle Royale the novel and turning it into the movie. It just becomes mindless killing.\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was not really enjoyable. It felt too rushed and there was no way to really get to know the characters at all. You just kind of jumped straight into what aspect was important to the trial and that was it. It was frustrating. Still, the animation holds true to the video games, which I enjoyed, and for the most part, everything was very much the same it's just stripped down too much to be anything but mindless killing.",

Feel free to have a rebuttal for this review by simply visiting the user\u2019s page and pressing, \u201cSubmit Comment\u201d, but beware of sudden accidentals such as improper spelling and grammar mistakes as that could result in a null comment, decreasing the power of persuasion.\r\nThe rule of thumb is, whenever an anime is based off of a well-known game and if one completely finishes that game prior to the anime adaptation, DON\u2019T WATCH IT! The exception of course applies to mebecause I have had read the online, \u201cLP\u2019s\u201d (Let\u2019s Play) up to Chapter 2 only via Youtube so, I haven\u2019t had the full experience of actually playing the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime adaptation of the game starts off with the average joe, Naegi who starts his, \u201cfirst day\u201d in Hope Academy, \u201choping\u201d to have a great start to a school year. Unfortunately, this is never going to happen and it ends up with having a circle of other high school students, each having a high caliber of a specific talent (e.g. singing, baseball, gambling, etc), who have to, under specific circumstances, kill each other and execute the murderer in order to succeed. This is one dangerous game that they are playing, my friends.\\n\\n\r\nI will admit that the first 2 episodes had a promising start since it gives the viewers the full story of what is supposed to happen, but this is where I ran into problems when it comes to staying true to the game version. Despite how the anime tries to keep the intent of the game such as relatively maintain the format of the actual trial run (e.g. Naegi actually objecting his friends through the power of words just like how Ace Attorney would say, \u201cObjection\u201d), it falls flat with character development and is very plot driven. In other words, it\u2019s too structured and it lacks a SERIOUS WOW factor especially as it nears towards the end. There were some moments in terms of character development (such as Ishimaru after realizing who the culprit was for the 2nd murder and his reactions afterwards), but unfortunately, those characters end up either dead or executed and it completely destroys the intent of what these characters could be capable of in the anime. In other words, we get to see those most affected by the execution, in despair for a split second and then, they attempt to change themselves and try to seek a greater good (like a form of vengeance or perseverance to keep on fighting), but as mentioned, literally seconds in the execution aftermath, they\u2019re either dead or executed, themselves\u2014a TOTAL waste of a good character! Overall, extremely plot driven and only touches upon the surface of each character with the exception of the protagonist and antagonist anchoring the, \u201cside characters,\u201d to make the plot advance.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that quite irks me about this anime adaptation is the execution scenes. After re-watching most and comparing them to the game, I totally understand that the anime wants to keep the integrity of this game, which has a high reputation for sad/awkward execution scenes, the anime didn\u2019t even come close to creating some sort of different perspective for each execution. They could\u2019ve made the same type of execution for each murderer, yet make it distinguishable so that it can stand out from the game version. Unfortunately, the producers ended up making a carbon copy except with some rough animation, which really brought down the quality of, what could have been, a good anime adaption to the game. Long story short: LAZY animation!\\n\\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong. The game itself is AMAZING and has a great plot that closely resembles Ace Attorney (i.e. Objection!) and Mirai Nikki (12 people who have to kill each other) having a love child, but unfortunately, the anime adaptation doesn't live up to the expectations to the game. As mentioned before, the anime adaptation is too structured and the characters lack any personality or some sort of development and are pretty much used for plot advancement. \\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, PLEASE play the game instead of watching this adaption UNLESS you haven't heard of this game before OR are looking for something that has a bit of thriller/mystery to pass the time.\\n\\n\r\nMy actual rating for this anime: 7.3/10. \\n",

            "content": "The survival genre is famous for piquing viewer\u2019s interest. It is a cheesy way to keep the audience wanting more. Though, some might say that survival genres use the same tactics in order grasp the reader\u2019s attention. It is possible that survival genre is scaling off since the last couple of survival genre wasn\u2019t appealing towards the anime industry. The problem is that the main character throughout have an unbelievable amount of plot armor. An example of this would be Btooom!, Sword Art Online and Mirai Nikki. It is good to have plot armor, but not to abuse it.\r\nSurvival anime would be characterized by plot,setting, and pacing. Plot is definitely important because there has to be tension built up in order to create a good survival anime. Without a good plot, the story would be unoriginal and the anime would be compared with. This will definitely dissuade viewers and cause the viewers to the \u2018better\u2019 anime. Each person has their own interpretation of \u2018good\u2019 and people respect that. Setting is also a huge factor in a survival anime. Having a closed setting can create quickly pace events, while having a vast setting can create a wide range of events. There has to be a rising action in order to build up the plot. This is why pacing is also important. If the pacing is slow, most viewers would get bored. If the pacing is too fast, most viewers would be left with questions unanswered. Therefore, plot, setting and pacing work hand in hand to build a great survival anime.\\n\\n\r\nDangan Ronpa made its debut when the visual novel was released. The visual novel got quite popular considering it was fun, interesting and unique. There were many options given in the visual novel. As the visual novel grew interest, an anime adaption was made by Geneon Universal Entertainment. Dangan Ronpa\u2019s genre are action, thriller, horror, mystery and psychological. These genres are quite popular in most survival anime. It may be a problem that poses on Dangan Ronpa. There have been many forms of media showing these genres in a survival anime. One can say that it is using the plot and creates a new setting. Will Dangan Ronpa be good or suffer in disappointment?\\n\\n\r\nWhat is Dangan Ronpa? Dangan Ronpa is a survival game where 15 high school students are chosen to compete in. The goal is to kill or be killed. That phrase is inevitably common. The twist is that only one can graduate and the game only bring despair to others. The players can choose to either adapt to the lifestyle or murder their way out. The school is cut off by the outside world and some people would miss their lifestyle outside of school. This aspect is pretty good considering the plot will rise no matter what. In reality, people would succumb to fear and will risk it all to survive. In Dangan Ronpa, there has to be a killer and the killer has to get away with the murder within a certain time limit. It goes through a process known as the court. This sounds pretty ironic because there is a need to keep \u2018order\u2019 when a bizarre situation happens. There are always people who break down when they witness shattering event. The court system in Dangan Ronpa is pretty much a jury system. Though, the punishment for getting the case solved wrong is huge. The court system works by the groups\u2019 decision. If the people decide that the person was the murderer correct, the person is executed. If the person is proven the murderer, but wrong, all of the innocent students get executed. This punishment is pretty hefty and most would try their best.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching Dangan Ronpa, the anime adaption of the game was moderate. Turning a game into an anime takes time and effort. When it was decided that Dangan Ronpa will be a 13 episode type anime, it was easy to conclude that the anime will be rushed. There are decent anime adaptions of games out there. Decent anime adaptions of games are Amagami SS, Pokemon, Fate Stay Night, EF \u2013 A Fairy Tale of Memories, and Steins Gate. There are more out there, but these anime are quite popular considering how well the anime turned out to be. What is shared throughout these anime is that they have more than 13 episodes. The pacing for these anime is great and thus leads to a good adaption. With Dangan Ronpa, there is much information being disclosed in the game rather than the anime. Most anime adaptions from games focus on the true ends. There are certain routes and ending where viewers won\u2019t be able to see. Normally there would be an OVA to view the story in a different perspective or another scenario. For those who want to watch Dangan Ronpa, it is best to try the game first and then watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite clear. The transition from game to anime is about right. It is excellent, but it is not extremely detailed. The colors are also amazing. It uses beautiful colors as you can see from the characters. Art now have to be appealing to the eye. If it appeals to the audience, then the audience would be interested in the art style. The drawings of Dangan Ronpa are clean and usual. Though, the setting is not as detailed as the characters. The characters have their own type of fashion styles that seems to attract viewers. Their style of fashion can range from gothic Lolita to school uniforms. Also, cinematic plays a big role in a survival anime. It is pretty symbolic due to the fact that it emphasizes on the main point. Cinematic also add more tension to the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio are about average. It doesn\u2019t seem very fancy and appealing. It doesn\u2019t give off an eerie feel, but makes the viewers curious. The audio should have been more dark and gloomy. Throughout the anime, sounds are specific though. The sounds made are there to appeal towards the audience and senses that something drastic happened. The voice actors and actress did an awesome job in conveying the characters during certain events. What is also interesting was that the Monobear\u2019s voice actor is the voice actor of Doraemon. He is Nobuyo Ooyama. Although this anime is categorized as a horror anime, most would say that it is not frightfully shocking.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters made in Dangan Ronpa were plain. These characters have famous tropes that allow the author to easily write the storyboard. Although the characters were generic, they have a huge impact on the storyboard. Since it is a survival genre, some people tend to favor a character throughout the story. The ability of making a character based on popular trends makes it easier for the audience to enjoy these characters. The character development throughout the story is alright. The game was to adapt living without the \u2018outside world\u2019 or murder and get out of the school. Those two options are difficult because both of options leave the characters with guilt.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime, Dangan Ronpa was rushed and could have been better. The anime focused on the true ends (best ending that the game offered) and missed out on many information. Although Dangan Ronpa was rushed, it is possible that the visual novel grew more sales considering that the game was better. Dangan Ronpa is a survival anime, but it did not fit the role perfectly. There are unanswered questions throughout the anime. The fact that it was rushed ruins the pacing. Since the pacing was ruined, the setting and plot couldn\u2019t comprehend well. In the end, Dangan Ronpa could appeal neither the survival genre nor the anime industry.\\n",

Instead, I'm doing most of this review separate from the game version. After having played the game and watched the anime, I know there's going to be a lot of similarities between the two.\r\nSTORY:\r\n The story wasn't what I was expecting, after hearing my 12-year-old step-brother obsess with it! However, even though I'm not a fan of most murder mystery shows, this intrigued me a lot.\r\nART:\r\n There's a huge contrast in art from the main parts and the executions. It doesn't do much to deter from thestory. The blood is pink, supposedly for censorship reasons (I have no idea why), but that just makes it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\n I do love the soundtrack to this anime. And the opening themes are catchy as hell - yes, including the Monokuma one.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\n With it only being 13 episodes, of course you're not going to get a whole lot of character development in that short time. However, going over the top with character development, especially early on, is kinda annoying.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\n I did enjoy this quite a bit. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now to compare it with the game: of course it isn't going to be as good. A lot of character development has gone, and certain things were done at different times. But that doesn't make it a bad anime! What else can you do with 13 episodes?",

Its one of those series that will always make you go like: Oh i understand now :D And then 2 sec later: i don't get it ;-; It always got this weird feeling that makes you wanna watch more. You always wanna know whats gonna happend, who is gonna what? The reason to why i loved this anime is simple. Every single little thing was made with precision to make it even more mysterious. The anime is full of things that will make you think that you understand when you trully have no idea of what ishappening. The way this season got me into the entire thing is by having nice and funny characters while being a very serious and intense anime. The story is kind of complexe to understand because to get a full view at it well you gotta know bout everything really. This anime is unlike others because its based around games and not a manga making the story even better. I actually went and bought the games just because i wanted to discover more then they showed us. In the end, this anime was really good in my opinion and i think that the sequel is even better so yeah... hope you guys like it as much as I liked it :P",

            "content": "\u3010 The following is a review of : Danganronpa: The Animation, Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Mirai-hen, Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Zetsubou-hen, and Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Kibou-hen \u3011\r\nWarning: this review is written by a person who has not played the games, these opinions are purely based on the  anime alone! So, to begin with, Danganronpa is a very fascinating idea and the characters are written in a very unique way. I have read online that the characters are expressed better in the game than in the series, but from I\u2019ve seen, thedesigns and the character\u2019s personalities and motives are very distinct.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I have had no interest in playing video games, other than visual novels, for a long time, but Danganronpa piqued my interest. There\u2019s something strange and unique about the atmosphere and the uncanny valley that is somewhat reminiscent of Twin Peaks. The first anime series was very enjoyable, but Danganronpa 3 was a different story. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The first series was more or less a locked room mystery with a twist at the end. My biggest criticism was that some of the murders were very predictable and could have been less obvious, but perhaps the game has a different effect with the pacing, since it is much longer. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The execution animations were very entertaining to look at, they were like Madoka Magica\u2019s avant-garde portrayal of witches, or to be more specific, they were like experimental British animations from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. That type of look, along with the pink blood, gives a certain artistic strangeness to the series. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I liked most of the characters in the first season, like: Togami Byakuya, Sakura Oogami, Celestia Ludenberg, as well as many other interesting characters AND the main antagonist. The antagonist in the first series is maniacally evil and you want to know more about her when the series ends, but Danganronpa 3 makes you wish that you had never even asked about her. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I never understood the obsession with Kyouko Kirigiri. In the anime version, she\u2019s a pretty plain character that doesn\u2019t get much development, even in the Danganronpa 3\u30fcwhen her father\u2019s backstory is fleshed out. I don\u2019t know if she has more of a personality in the game, but I felt really disconnected from her in both anime series, but yet there\u2019s a sense that you need to care about her. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The events of the first series are followed by a story that seemed to have promise at the beginning. There\u2019s a gang of villains that have High-School Level abilities like the first group of characters, even Nagito, that acts as the main character\u2019s insane foil and has a similar ability. There is much that could have been explored in this series, but instead we get Studio Lerche shorting out on the budget to a degree that felt insulting to the viewer and lots of shock effect, plus bullshit logic.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Let me preface this by saying that Danganronpa 3 is split into two parts, the Future arc, which is the present story, and the Despair arc, which is the backstory of all of the new characters. I have to say, the way that these two arcs are, while watched simultaneously adds breadth to the series and I really enjoyed how well they commingled.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Nearly all of the new characters are very interesting to watch, but everything in the story feels incredibly rushed because, as most of you have seen from visual novel adaptations and the like, there\u2019s no possible way to fit all of the moments in a gameplay in an anime series, unless it exceeds a hundred or more episodes, and Lerche barely had the budget to do twenty-four episodes. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The Despair arc is fun at first and gives insight into the caste system of the school and all of the character\u2019s personalities, prior to the antagonist\u2019s meddling, but then the series gets into weird, rushed, torture porn aspects that make the entire thing incredibly empty. It doesn\u2019t help that, in this series, if a female is brutally murdered or tortured, the series seems to take artistic liberties in making it look as sexual as possible. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I get that this arc is supposed to not make you feel good in the least, except for the classroom\u2019s fleeting moments of happiness, but it just seemed like over-the-top, shock-effect shlock that had gratuitous plot holes and little actual seriousness, with the constant silly debacles of despair versus hope, as well as the Blood-C level amounts of violence. The ending of the Future arc is even worse, officially labeled as a special called the Hope arc, in which all of the bad guys come together to help the protagonists and save their lives. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 And then they randomly decide to become bad guys again, because the world needs despair? What the fuck? And there\u2019s a character death that is as bullshit as Kyoukai no Kanata. Overall, I\u2019m not sure if the games did it better but the anime really fell from grace. The first series ended in fairly satisfying way, but I\u2019m not sure whether Danganronpa 3 should have ever existed at all. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 It feels like there were legitimately interesting characters and concepts that got butchered along the way, the best part of the sequel was the obscure otaku humor, like the scene where it happens to reference Revolutionary Girl Utena and Chibi Maruko-chan at the same time! I rate the first season of the anime a 5/10, the Despair arc of Danganronpa 3 a 3/10, and the Future and Hope arcs a 2/10 collectively.",

            "content": "I have played few visual novels, due to my bad internet that its difficult for me to download a few gigs in order to play a visual novel of X hours. In this case, I had the opportunity to know its animated version that its version in visual novel; Sincerely, I felt very excited to see characters with different designs and personalities, taken out of the stereotypes, as well as the brief emotion of the Class Trials and the pink blood that is one of the most known characteristics in this work. In fact, this anime I've seen a lot of times and I continuedto like ... until I read the visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nI dont have much experience with animes that are adapted directly from visual novels. But it seems that it has certain complications to have to know how to adapt the actions of the characters taken purely from texts, such as knowing how to do some scenes present at certain key moments. A clear contrast with the manga, in which the predetermined actions are already taken on each page, and its only a question of writers and cartoonists having to adapt them in caricature; Even so, its not simple and depends on the ability of the company to do its best.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, I'll talk about Danganronpa.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Naegi Makoto, an ordinary student who doesnt have a relevant talent, is bad at sports and just wants to have a normal future with a stable job and a family. However, he receives a message in which he was selected to enter: He chooses only those young people who have a special talent and, as I said before, Naegi doesnt have a talent. However, he entered that academy into a survey, getting the title of \"Super High School-Level Luck\". Although this, in some way, demotivates the protagonist, he decides to maintain an optimistic thought and decides to enter the academy. Just one day, he seems to feel dizzy and all his vision becomes totally black.\\n\\n\r\nIt is there when he wakes up and enters the famous Survival Game along with fourteen other students.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nCertainly, its not a completely original story talking about it being a Survival Game, and that there is a host behind all this. In many Western films we have seen this cliche, as well as in manga works like Mirai Nikki, for example. However, Danganronpa is known for his art and the Class Trials which, personally, is very entertaining to play.\\n\\n\r\nWithin the anime, certain problems arise. First, the story is summarized in only 13 episodes. The visual novel, approximately, takes a full day to complete. This detail seems irrelevant to those people who know Danganronpa for the first time, but if you've played the visual novel, you'll clearly notice that detail. Some details may be omitted, for example, some unlockable events to place the most linear story without deviations. But another problem arises: In Danganronpa, there are 5 Class Trials, each one longer than the previous one. Being limited to 13 episodes, this important event has to be briefly summarized.\\n\\n\r\nAnd most worrying, is when the characters are previously in the Research Phase, since there both Naegi and the rest of the cast find different clues and essential tests before the Class Trials; which is omitted terribly and leaves with holes in the plot. Therefore, within the anime, these tests come to the light of nothing, which makes you wonder where all of that had come from.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, 16 stereotypes exist within 16 characters. According to what I heard out there, it was made exaggeratedly on purpose as an experiment for Danganronpa himself. However, its very obvious that its to attract easy audience that commonly consumes this. In the visual novel, these stereotypes intersect with the development of each character, their origin and why they are inside the Hope's Peak Academy. This development is available talking and going out with these characters, who at some point will tell you anecdotes and unlock certain useful skills both in the Exhibition Stage, as in the Research, as in the Class Trials. Also, this unlocks some events depending on the answers you give them as the objects that you give them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in its anime version, these characteristics decay towards the lowest.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we've the Trinity: The Good (Naegi Makoto), who will be aware of convincing everyone what really happened in the murders; The Bad (Togami Byakuya), who will be aware of obstructing the protagonist's investigation; and the Detective (Kirigiri Kyouko), who will be helping the protagonist and supporting him in the investigation. Above all its Kirigiri who receives greater development, although in the visual novel, she's also the one who has more development in Dangaronpa. I, really, cant deny the good development that these three characters have. But this unbalances the equity between the Trinity and the rest of the 13 students present in this Survival Game; especially when the rest have a very important contribution within the Hope's Peak Academy, although its the least bit.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the rest of the cast. Its protagonism only happens at convenient moments within the anime. For example, when Fujisaki creates the ID \"Alter Ego\", or Yamada revealing the true name of Celestia. These details are of great value within the anime, and when these characters come to take that role, after a while they end up in oblivion. Of the rest, there's no personal development of each character, and they are only there for the convenience of the plot; a contrast with the visual novel that, including Hagakure, you can know a lot of them. In the anime, everyone is like that idiot.\\n\\n\r\nThird, these ups and downs are trying to disguise the ability of the seiyuus. One of the most important is Ooyama Nobuyo, who was the one who gave voice to Monokuma, making this character the same bear tenderly terrifying and with an ironic humor.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is really poor, despite being colorful and relatively attractive. On many occasions, you can see common errors of the animation, such as strange disproportions when drawing the characters up close, and it is very remarkable if you compare the size of the eyes with the rest of the body. However, we can highlight the scenes of the characters being executed, almost faithful to the original; likewise, the animation used in both the ED and the OP are well complemented with the music used, which I'll talk about in the next section. For the rest, its very poor and it makes me ask why this quality and care wasnt also done in the rest of the plot?\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\\n\r\nAs for music, this point is probably the strongest of Danganronpa. The soundtrack of the visual novel is preserved almost in its entirety, being implemented in the necessary moments of the anime. As for the OP and ED, the first is, for the most part, \"Never Say Never\" composed by Masafumi Takada, the person in charge of all the Soundtracks of Danganronpa, both in the visual novel and in the anime; and interpreted by TKDz2b. The style of Gangster Rap plus the female voices in the chorus without really triumphant and give you the feeling of suspense to be a series of school murders and investigations. The only exception is the first chapter in which \"DANGARONPA\" is used, one of the original OST of the visual novel and composed by the same Masafumi Takada; and the fourth chapter, in which \"Monomuka Ondo\" is composed by Sachiko Kobayashi with the voice of Monokuma (Ooyama Nobuyo) being the protagonist of this \"Extra\".\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ED, one can say that it is the best thing that the anime has, being titled Zetsubousei: Hero Chiryouyaku, interpreted by Soraru, whose quiet voice happens to be calmly aggressive in the choir; An attractive feature for those who are fans of their music. The simple 8-bit used within this song is catchy and is complemented by the 8-bit style animation that gives tribute to the sprites of the characters that recurrently appear in the visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT AND OVERALL\\n\\n\r\nSumming up all this, Danganronpa was adapted in a hasty and mediocre way. If you never saw the visual novel, its easy for you to enjoy this anime without knowing the holes in the plot within the characters and small but important details that are omitted within this animation. Its not simply to present the characters and then kill them to quickly say who murdered them, its also to know them and feel compassion for them when a tragic event happens. True, there are open holes in the plot made on purpose to make way for the light and visual novels that would later be published later (There is even a manga that explains how each murder of the original Dangaronpa happened from the perspective of the one who committed it). But there are others that are unjustifiable and, if you were the lucky one to see the visual novel before the anime, you'll share the same opinion that I presented in this review. Otherwise, it will happen to you in the same way as it happened to me, at the same time as with Overlord.\\n\\n\r\nSincerely, Dangaronpa presents almost the same problem as with another adaptation, but in manga, from an Indie game that I reviewed a long time ago.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had seen the visual novel before the anime, this review and score was much worse. But I can't be hypocritical when I say that the anime I originally liked.",

            "content": "Boy oh boy. It's been a while since I've watched such a controversial anime...\r\nDanganronpa! An anime about mysteries, high school murders, and more mysteries. The story follows Naegi, a high schooler who wakes up in a place unknown to him. Later on he finds out that he's trapped in a high school with 15 other classmates, and the only way out is to kill each other, but without getting caught. \r\nThe premise is very intriguing, and it had me guessing for quite a while. But I can't help but wonder why they made Naegi so OP. He seems to solve almost every mystery by himselfwith ease, while under a tremendous amount of stress. That for me was a major issue with this anime and really want to put that first. Aside from that, the characters are all very interesting and there's definitely a wide variety here. But, I really do wish that some of them were introduced better.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound sound is pretty good. The OP is catchy but the male vocals are kinda cringy. As for the art, I really enjoyed it. Some scenes were animated in such an interesting way (without really giving away any spoilers) that I was kinda thrown off at first, but I still really found those scenes to be cool.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is not for everyone. If you can tolerate a MC who is kinda OP, then I think you'll be fine. There's a lot to like here, and a lot to take in. If you've seen Assassination Classroom, think of that, but the complete opposite.",

            "content": "I've watched this anime twice now - once before playing the game at all and once after completing the game.\r\nThe first and biggest problem with the anime that I have is that it's rushed. The first time I watched it there were parts where I was confused, and as I was playing the game there were lots of \"oh, that makes sense now\" moments, and that really shouldn't be the case. The anime should have encompassed everything important and not left out any of the details it did. It definitely needed to be a 24-episode series. The class trials and investigations were rushed, as werethe scenes between them where in the game you get to know the characters better. I really wish the anime had focused more on the characters because it would have been nice if the first time I'd watched it I'd been as attached to them as I was when I played the game. It gives the deaths more impact and makes the betrayals hurt more. This anime lacked the emotional impact the game had because of the fast pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the anime is what got me into Danganronpa in the first place, so it's not entirely terrible. My overall rating would be 7.5/10 but I rounded up my overall rating to an 8 because the franchise in general has quickly become one of my favourites. It's definitely worth watching, but I would recommend playing the game first to experience it fully. I enjoyed the anime more the second time around because it made more sense.\\n\\n\r\nPacing aside, I loved how faithful it was to the game. The art style, the execution scenes, and the music were all amazingly well done. I'm so glad they kept the stylistic choices from the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well thought out and diverse. I ended up loving characters I never expected I would (Sakura, Asahina, Hagakure) while still loving all my 'usual' favourite character types (Celeste, Chihiro, Kirigiri). As I said before, I do wish the anime had fleshed them out like the game does, but even so the characters are what made me fall in love with the franchise in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIf you happen to be reading this review while not having seen or played Danganronpa, I would definitely recommend playing the game before you watch this, because I wish I had. I'm not usually one for games, but Danganronpa managed to suck me in. The anime is worth watching, but please please please play the game first.\\n\\n\r\n[NEXT PARAGRAPH CONTAINS MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS]\\n\\n\r\nI feel as though the anime could have done the 'big reveal' of the mastermind at the end better. In the game Junko is done amazingly well, so much so that I fell in love with her character during the last class trial alone. But in the anime she's kind of... forgettable. Even as the mastermind, it feels as though her 'craziness' was played down, and this was mostly due to how rushed it was. The switches between her personalities were too quick. The first time I watched the anime I didn't even really pay attention to it because it didn't seem important, but in the game that's a huge part of who her character is. The quick changes did make her seem crazy, sure, but in the game the fact she monologues for a while before changing to another one of her personalities is even more unsettling. Maybe it helped that the game uses sprites instead of animation, so the differences are easier to show, but I feel as thought the anime could have done a better job with them. Her line where she says she even gets bored of her own personalities is treated like a throwaway line in the anime, and is said at the same time another character is speaking so it's easy to miss. This is a huge part of her character in the game and part of what makes her such a good villain, so I'm disappointed the anime didn't use it well.",

            "content": "Now it has been awhile since i watched a horror themed anime. I believe the\r\nlast one I watched was Shiki. Now Danganronpa has been getting a lot of\r\nattention over the years and i have noticed its spark in popularity. I see\r\nit all over social media, Reddit, Yahoo Answers, but mostly on\r\nwatt-pad.(Author Wannabe) So I finally decided to sit down and give it a\r\nshot and i have to say its not that bad. Danganronpa has a very simplistic and unoriginal yet original story(\r\nI don't know if that made any sense.) I'm a huge fan of murder mystery's so\r\nwhen I found out this show was a battleroyal type murder mystery I was\\n\r\npretty excited to dive in. Not to mention the saw like atmosphere. Now I have to say the first three to four\\n\r\nepisodes were really good with capturing that suspenseful and psychological\\n\r\natmosphere. However after that the atmosphere completely becomes dull. No\\n\r\nsuspense, nothing. Just a bunch of teenagers who have Sherlock Holmes\\n\r\ndetective skills solving murders. The main theme of this anime is supposed\\n\r\nto be a fight between hope and despair. Now this concept\\n\r\nwas pretty stupid,I got extremely annoyed with the way they were just shoving it in the\\n\r\nviewers faces. \\n\\n\r\nYes i know your not supposed to lose hope and if you work\\n\r\ntogether you can overcome despair stop repeating it in every episode.\\n\r\nSpeaking of despair, none of the characters faced any psychological\\n\r\nobstacles throughout the entire show. The suspense and drama just felt\\n\r\nforced. (excluding the first four episodes) And it bothered me because, if\\n\r\nthis anime is supposed to be about the characters plunging into despair why\\n\r\nnot show that. They all remained calm and collected throughout all 13\\n\r\nepisodes. Also I have to say that the reasons why some of the characters\\n\r\ncommitted murder were flat out fucking stupid. They were all for petty and\\n\r\nstupid reasons. \\n\\n\\n\r\n The only person in this entire anime who had a solid reason\\n\r\nfor killing anyone was Leon. The execution scenes were just terrible and stupid the only one that was actually brutal was leons. Now lets talk about this fucking pink blood.\\n\r\nGod i hated this with a passion yet loved it because it was different. The characters were extremely shallow and boring no character development at all. The only four  characters I liked were  Sakura, Byakuya, MonoBear(fucking hilarious)and Toko. That's it, our main character is a generic goody two shoes shounen protagonist who wants to save everyone.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art was fairly mediocre and the only thing that stood out was the pink blood. Wrapping this horrible review up I have to say that I was kind of surprised by the ending I was not expecting that plot twist at all and it was well executed. In the end this anime brings nothing new to the table except evil bears and pink blood. Don't waste your time on it. You can do something more valuable with your time like watching a better anime or reading a book. \\n",

I will not be reviewing this as an adaptation of another version, but solely as an anime of its own merit and nothing else.\r\n-Story\r\nThe actual plot wasn't anything special. (Baseline: 5/10)\r\nHowever, although the overarching story proceeded very slowly, it went into great detail at every step, and the episodes weren't lacking in content despite the lack of plot progression. (+1)\r\nAdditionally, I couldn't find any holes in the story; if it were an average anime, there would be something that I didn't like. (+1)\r\nTotal: 7 points\r\n-Art\r\nThe animationstyle for most of the scenes was neither better nor worse than average. (Baseline: 5/10)\\n\r\nThe special effects used in the trial scenes were unique and very effective at adding to the experience rather than just being distracting. (+2)\\n\r\nHowever, the clunky CGI in the transition scenes detracted a bit from this. Thankfully, it was used very sparingly. (-1)\\n\r\nThe art style used in the punishment scenes was also unique and very different from the rest of the anime. Although it didn't necessarily complement anything else going on, it wasn't distracting from the content, and just added another element to this anime. (+2)\\n\r\nTotal: 8 points\\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nThe music took a backstage to the rest of the content in most scenes. For this anime, I think that was the right choice, as adding a constant orchestral backdrop would just be distracting, and keeping a quiet-ish background made the music that did play and the sound effects really stand out.(Baseline: 6/10)\\n\r\nThe intro music was terrible. (-1)\\n\r\nThe sound effects were pretty spot on. (+1)\\n\r\nTotal: 6 points\\n\\n\r\n-Character\\n\r\nThe minimal greater plot of this anime meant that much of the material would be dependent on good character design. They didn't blow my mind with perfection, but they were solid and were able to fulfill this purpose. (Baseline: 6/10)\\n\r\nSome of the character tropes could have been more exaggerated to add to this, in particular the yandere character who was barely so. (-1)\\n\r\nAlthough the tropes might be lacking, a handful of the characters had unique quirks that went beyond convention, and there was good diversity within the anime. (+1)\\n\r\nRomance is the most ubiquitous theme in anime, with almost every anime having at least one romantic relationship. In this anime, overt romance was carefully and wisely omitted, which was a very good choice as it would only have detracted from the content. (+1)\\n\r\nTotal: 7 points\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\nWhile this anime didn't draw me into complete obsession and compel me to binge through it in one sitting, I was never bored and never lost interest. \\n\r\nScore: 7 points\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

Years later I played the games after several recomendations. The games are the best thing ever. If I were rating the game this would be a 10.\r\nSo basically what I'm trying to say is: Don't watch this and play the games. The anime is mediocre, don't make a 10 out of 10 experience to be a 5 out of 10 experience.\r\nI ppl always say \"game is better anime sucks\", but inthis case it REALLY is on another level. I watched the anime 1st and for years it was just an OK anime on my mind. So it's not like I hate/think the anime is bad cause I played the game. It's just the anime is... just fine.",

But the delivery of the suspense for the upcoming scenes are done just right.\r\nArt\r\nArtistically speaking even though I am not an artist myself the art style was not a masterpiece but it just gives the atmosphere of the story. Although they did some changes in the presentation in order to accommodate a general audience.\r\nSound\r\nThe voice actors/actresses portrayed the character as somewhat lackluster.Maybe in the sense that it was just a conversion of the game itself into a series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization was lacking because they did not give the audience a background for each characters(interest, fears, etc.). To me that has a heavy role on the story on why they would do somethings in order to achieve their goals.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I said so many negative comments above, for me I enjoyed the series. Maybe the story was lacking but the thrill for each scene kinda pumped me up for what is going to happen next. Maybe they hit my soft spot for thrillers and detective stuff for me to enjoy the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI felt that what happens in the future maybe they would deliver much better version of what they were lacking in this series.",

ESPECIALLY with the main character. who in his first monologue states that he is nothing special doesn't really have much brains or athletic ability and only got into the school by luck they back this up by making him the only person with normal character art, standard color pallets and nothing outrageous. however throughout the entire show he is the most smart and most useful fucking person and he basically carries every his class by solving every murder him self even though there in another character whose specific trope is that she is a detective and she basically did fuck all but complain about her dad. she was the smart detective but she did little to no detecting and the stupid lucky kid ended up being a literal light yagami it was beyond retarded\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment\\n\r\nconstantly seeing the same episode structure followed up by the same character contradictions killed this show for me. it had no flow and was only consistent at being a fucking joke of an anime.\\n\\n\r\ni would have rather run 300km than watch this hunk of shit \\n\\n\r\ndont waste your time its piss and youll regret it",

Books on the other hand need to be long unless it's a short story,child's book, ect.)  The art style wow I was amazed how spike and their collab partner worked togather to make the characters from flat 2-D to 3-D can we give them a round of applause because this was amazinghow it turned out. Sound well I just give it a 8 since sound depends on your device. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOk I need a breather before I start with the next one....\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters ok ok... The characters where Man... I love the depth that went into making the characters and how they reacted into everything. Game transition to anime it just fit. You could see more emotion and exactly what they where doing instead of just sprites so dang I love it \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc. Also  in the anime you can actually feel more then in the game so it built the character more then in the game...I still love both though.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it very much to be honet I watch it over and over, I recommend it to plenty of people and yes I hope they make a adaption for the newest crew(If you haven't seen it go check it out I am not spoiling anything)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8 \\n\r\nYup 8's get ya a 8",

The sound was well done, eerie music and sounds came in haunting moments, and glorious music in good times. The mystery behind everything really boosted the enjoyment, and every episode was fulfilling yet you can't help to binge watchthe whole season.\\n\\n\r\nNow I also do understand that those who played the game first are dissatisfied because the anime wasn't able to cover each character's depth as well it should have been, but since I am not a gamer this didn't concern me too much.

            "content": "Dangan Ronpa makes a great original start for a very deep, large and obscure story.\r\nThis is the review of someone who, by seeing the anime, got to know the game, thinking the anime was so great. And to my surprise when I played the game and came back to the animation, I felt fairly dissapointed. \r\nThe anime has some hits and misses and here's what I want to point out:\r\n1)DANGAN RONPA HAS SUCH AN AMAZING SETTING It's a story about 15 greatly gifted students that made it to  the most prestigious institutes. Thanks to their talents, they are \"the hope\" of our next generation.After entering the school, they find out they have been locked in there and the only way to get out is to kill somebody forced by \"motives\" that the headmaster gives them.\\n\r\nAnd I think this was ONE OF THE HITS of the anime, since they can explain the premise really well and work with it. Making it into a great mistery/detective anime.\\n\\n\r\n2) THE CHARACTERS: While playing the game, you get to know each one of the characters when they introduce themselves, getting a bit of their personalities and their motives and aspirations, which makes you undersstand their actions later in the game.\\n\r\nEach charater is so unique and with a total different personality, making it my favorite part of Dangan Ronpa.\\n\r\nThe animeDOES NOT DO THIS, every introduction is rushed, and you only get to see the superficial part of them. So later in the anime their actions can seem  pretty dull.\\n\\n\r\n3)SO MUCH STORY SO LITTLE TIME:\\n\r\nThe game is pretty exptensive, since in them you got your epiloge, six chapters and the ending. Every chapter has three really well done parts to it.\\n\r\nYou do a pretty exptensive investigation, get to know the characters in different situations. And a deductive part of it.\\n\r\nThe anime, having only 13 episodes makes the plot-line of the story hard to understand at a time, cause a lot of details are omitted and it gets rushed, and I rememeber getting lost at some point.\\n\r\nI think that, a anime of 25 episodes would have been more aproppiate.\\n\\n\r\n4) ARTSTYLE, ANIMATION AND SOUNDTRACK:\\n\r\nDangan Ronpa has such a peculiar artstyle to it, gorgeous colors and the cutscene animations are stunning to see. The music of the game is pretty average and \"backgroundish\" but enjoyable.\\n\r\nTHE ANIME DID SO GOOD ADAPTATING THIS: Since the artsyle is left the same as the game, it's not a piece of art, but it's so peculiar, different, colorful and refreshing. \\n\r\nI can say that the soundtrack of the anime is way better and a little bit more remarkable than the one in the game.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nDangan Ronpa is a great mistery/murder series, that is close to my heart. The setting and the plot of it leaves you by the edge of your seat and it's a great door for a more deep plot to it (that I hope it gets reflected on Dangan Ronpa 3) \\n\r\nBut the anime was a rushed mess of a good story, that takes a lot of good writting and details out of it.\\n\\n\r\nHope you find this helpful!\\n\r\n(sorry for the grammar mistakes ^^)\\n\\n",

But yeah, for those of you who follow my reviews, just know that I may not always reviews the sequels to the show. Without further ado, let's get into it!)\r\nStory 6/10\r\nSo, Dangaronpa is based off the games. Now, I have played the games before watching the anime. And I'll say, I do feel like they rushed the storya bit. Like, I really wanted them to take their time explaining each case, but it felt like they just rushed right through the entire case. What they should've done is do more episodes and really take their time explaining each case/class trial.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I really can't say much about the story 'cause that would spoil one of the special parts about Dangaronpa.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is nicely done. They did seem to make it look like the game, like I didn't really appreciate that they added a bit of gaming style to it. It's an anime, just stick with an anime style. The gaming bits weren't necessary.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are very nice. I just wish they used a different soundtrack instead of the game.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nDangaronpa is known for having different characters. Honestly, it's a question of taste. I liked some characters and some characters I really didn't care much. Not gonna say anything more 'cause that would really spoil what makes Dangaronpa special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nDespite the story flaws, I ended up quite enjoying the anime. I felt like it was a very nice homage to the games.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nThis is not a perfect first anime adaptation, but the sequels were so amazing that I'm actually glad and enjoyed watching this series. I honestly love the Dangaronpa games. But yeah, I really recommend checking out Dangaronpa. It's got a unique premise and interesting story. I recommend starting with the games first, then watch the anime. This anime may not sastify you, but it is worth the watch so that you understand the sequels and I promise the sequels are better! Play the games first that way you know what you're getting into. But, overall, I really recommend Dangaronpa to anyone who likes dark and gritty animes.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. Let me know your thoughts on this review and any feedback you may have for me. Until next time!",

            "content": "When I first heard about this anime, I had no idea it was an adaptation of a videogame. I watched it, therefore, as an anime, and not as a videogame. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I can't quite say that I think most of the negative reviews are fair, since a lot of them revolve around how well it matches up to the game. Therefore, I want to provide a review based on the anime alone, and what it does, rather than based on the anime as a game, and what it doesn't do.\r\nThe first thing I noticed in this anime (and thus, the firstthing that I'll rate) was the characterization. In the very first episode, we are rapidly introduced to a fairly large number of characters. One of the primary issues I have, in any manga, anime, movie, etc., is telling characters apart. So I was pleased to see that the characters were so diverse, and that it wouldn't be difficult at all to remember which character was which. And yet, the characters weren't empty shells. Even in the short time that we had to get to know them, we saw them form attachments, develop as characters, and grow as people.\\n\\n\r\nThe next thing I noticed ended up being my primary issue with the series (and it's a small issue at that,) which was an animation sequence in the trial scenes. The \"bullet\" animation when we hear \"you've got that wrong!\" was cool, but it seemed to get used a lot, and I started to want a little more diversity. However, other than that, I had no issues with the animation. Admittedly, I'm not one to focus a lot on how something is animated unless it's brilliant, or terrible, but it wasn't terrible, so I had no problems there.\\n\\n\r\nBranching off of that, I'd like to note that the blood was pink. While some find this annoying, I actually thought it made the show better. Why? Because gore isn't meant to be the focus. I can handle a bit of blood, but I prefer to do without it. This way of coloring the blood, in a color next to red but not directly there, made it easier to handle the intense scenes without (in my opinion) compromising the effect of the scene. And considering how exaggerated the characters look to begin with, it didn't even strike me as unusual except for a moment when I first saw it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good in my opinion, but like animation, it's not something I put a whole lot of focus on, so I'll move onto what was my favorite part of the anime, and why I enjoyed it so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was, in my opinion, fabulous. I've seen people complain, in particular, that it moves too quickly, but I think that the speed actually aids it as a show. Is it a mystery? In part, yes, but not one that we're meant to solve. The game (which I would be interested to play, but haven't yet) may likely put more emphasis on the mystery aspect, but I don't think that's what the anime was going for. I saw not a mystery show, or some drama show where we want to learn every little detail about the characters' backstories, but rather, a story about despair. The mystery and the characters were used as tools and, I believe, used very effectively.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the story moves so quickly makes us fear that our favorite character, whoever it may be, could be dead any minute. The way that we don't have enough time to put all the clues together causes us to feel the pressure of the characters as Monokuma sets time limits on them as well. The way that the characters never get a fully developed backstory shows us what strangers these people really are. And while deep characterization, mystery, and plenty of time may have been valuable assets in the game, in the anime, the quick pacing was what made it work. The characters and mystery were well done, but weren't the point of the story.\\n\\n\r\nNo story does everything. Some stories may use plot as a tool to help us get to know the characters, and others may use characters as a tool to advance the plot. Both are valid methods of storytelling, though individuals may prefer one or the other. Some stories may even use different methods all together.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: if you're looking to find the game in anime form, you will likely be disappointed. But as an anime, (regardless of the game, because it puts emphasis on different areas,) I believe that this was a show worth watching.",

            "content": "Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is an amazing story.\r\nOh, no, I'm not referring to the anime. I'm referring to the original game this anime tries and fails to capture.\r\nDanganronpa isn't much of a 'game' in the general sense; it's more like a video novel with timing minigames. Meaning most of the appeal of the gameplay is exploring and reading text, both on story, setting, and most importantly, character details, which then plays out as a large murder mystery each time.\r\nBecause this is that type of game, attention to detail is critical. You have to feel like you're immersed in the game with the main character. Youwant to get to know the other students you are trapped with, and it goes beyond mere want, you NEED to. It's the feeling of hopelessness the game is about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo why is this anime adaptation so bad? Sounds great, right? At first glance, yes. The anime looks great and sounds exactly like the game. So far, it's everything you could want out of seeing Danganronpa in an anime, right?\\n\\n\r\nWrong. And here comes the biggest misstep of all: Condensing a 50+ hour, detail heavy game into a paltry 13 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even exaggerating when I say that literally the first 5 hours of gameplay are condensed into just the first episode alone.\\n\r\nI didn't know what was happening in it, and I've beaten the original game, so I was struggling to grasp how anyone new could possibly find enjoyment in it.\\n\\n\r\nWho was it made for? Newbies who wouldn't understand anything at that pace, or fans of the franchise who will loathe it for being so rushed?\\n\r\nI don't think it appeals to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the first episode, all you're saying is \"WHAT? WHY? WHO?\" because unless you pause for the fraction of a second they show character names via on screen name tags, you'll never learn who anyone is, even by the end.\\n\r\nCharacters start dying by episode 2, and while both suspect and victim were set up properly in the game, in the anime, it's like \"Who were they? Why should I care?\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's the fatal flaw. You don't care, because nothing is set up. You don't know the characters, the setting, so you don't feel anything; and THE biggest aspect of a murder mystery, the setting and details, are glossed over as well. It's not a character drama or even a mystery show. It fails on both accounts.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime can be described simply as this: They wanted to get to the murder trials above all else.\\n\r\nThis is extremely apparent given that, despite the extreme time crunch of adapting the story, almost every execution (including the one that has no relevance to the plot, that starts off the series) are included in full, while abridging most  story elements. It's to such a degree that even details in the trials themselves are sometimes pulled straight out of nowhere. A character suddenly knows something they shouldn't, without any setup whatsoever just so the trial can continue.\\n\r\nThat is the definition of a flawed adaptation, when they can't even prioritize what prior details to include or exclude beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn't already apparent, this anime was simply a cash-in, made by a group of people who did not understand the appeal of what they were adapting. It seems they went out of their way to try and make Danganronpa appear as a style-over-substance anime. But  I implore you, if Danganronpa as a concept interests you, play the games instead. You'll quickly find out it excels at both style AND substance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say avoid watching this anime entirely. There is nothing of value here worth your time.\\n",

            "content": "Danganronpa: The Animation was one of the first series I watched weekly as it aired. I had been excited for it many weeks in advance, despite never having played the game. I just found the plot itself very intriguing. And now, after 13 weeks of watching, the series has come to an end. How did it fare overall?\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nDanganronpa was based on a visual novel that I, unfortunately, have not had the opportunity to play. Despite that, I was pulled in by the story very early on. There were so many questions I had about what was going on at Hope\u2019s Peak Academy. So eachweek, I would tune back in in the hope of finding more answers. For the majority of the show, the pattern of classmate killed, investigation commences, classroom trial, classmate voted guilty seemed fairly inevitable, and became quite trite and worn after only a few episodes. However, I started to get a bit more hopeful towards the end of the series. But without spoiling anything, I feel that it just fell flat. The last two episodes were rushed and even confusing at times. The situation changed so quickly in such a short amount of time. Answers were being spewed out at me one by one, yet there was no satisfaction.\\n\r\nThere were a few other things that bothered me, mostly involving the pacing of the story. I wish that the investigations could have gone more in-depth, as opposed to having clues handed to us and drawing the connections with seemingly no time to think. As I mentioned before, I haven\u2019t played the original VN, so this is just my take on the series as an anime alone. But my guess is that trying to fit an entire VN into a single, 13 episode series will leave much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nOverall, the characters as a whole were not much to speak of. However, had they had the opportunity to develop further, they would\u2019ve all had a lot more potential. Makoto Naegi, although being the main character, seemed to be used as a plot device much of the time, used only to correct others in class trials and advance the story. It\u2019s sad, because had he been further developed, he may have had more appeal. Kirigiri Kyouko could\u2019ve shined as well, but much of her personality is kept hidden from the viewers. From early on, she was a favorite of mine, but again, just fell short of my expectations. There is quite a large cast here, and the majority of them fell flat as well. But there were two that I felt were at least worthy of a mention. I really enjoyed Fukawa Touko and her split personality (I won\u2019t say anymore because of spoilers). I found myself laughing every time she was involved. Maybe that was just me, but I thought it was worth mentioning. The other honorable mention is Monobear/Monokuma. Everything he did just threw me for a loop. I never knew what would happen next, and Monobear was one of the main reasons I kept coming back each week. But, despite all of this, the overall cast was quite bland and uninteresting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Sound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation itself wasn\u2019t phenomenal, but the chosen style fit very well with the mood of the series. After each classroom trial, after a classmate was voted guilty, the style of the animation would take a very different turn, something that I can only describe as eerie. It worked very well to set the atmosphere for the scene. The OP was very catchy as well, and I found myself listening to it fully each week. Otherwise, there isn\u2019t much to speak of.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nDespite all of its flaws, Danganronpa held my attention throughout. I was able to think about the true meaning behind Hope\u2019s Peak Academy and draw my own conclusions (before they were handed to me, of course), and the show had its moments in which I would catch myself laughing, or with my mouth agape. It was a show I was able to look forward to with each passing week, and I do not regret sticking around.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is a show that can be enjoyable if you take it at face value. While it had potential as a mystery, it didn\u2019t reach that potential by any means. But by just accepting it for what it is, it\u2019s not a bad watch. If you enjoy seeing the reactions of a bunch of high schoolers in a fight to the death, then you\u2019ll probably enjoy Danganronpa, too.\\n",

            "content": "I could\u2019ve written this review without watching the anime. For all its twists and turns, Danganropa works like you\u2019d expect it to. Even the claim that it\u2019s not as in-depth as the game doesn\u2019t feel relevant. It\u2019s a darkly humorous anime filled with hilarious characters. There isn\u2019t much psychological depth, but everyone is memorable and no one gets demonized.\r\nDanganronpa understands why Death Game scenarios work, and what are its strengths and weaknesses. These scenarios rely on a fairly unpredictable out come. We know the main character wins, but not always who will be his final match. The most important part is the characters. Their personalitymodify their interactions, the methods they use and how the \u2018matches\u2019 go.\\n\\n\r\nBy abandoning any characterization, you\u2019re left with emptiness. All you will have is a show of violence, which can only be entertaining for so long. Thankfully this isn\u2019t BTOOOM!. You can tell by just looking at the brilliant character design.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character has a distinct look. No character is allowed to look like another. I haven\u2019t seen a cast with this much effort put into the design. Everyone sports different hairstyles, outfits and even shapes of the eyes. The differences are more than just to tell apart the character. Each detail helps to point to the personality of the character. This is how character design should be \u2013 expressing the character using the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThey are not psychological portraits. They are a collection of quirks, but these quirks never point to some realistic personality. The characters are, after all, chosen more for their skills rather than their personality. Normally this would lead to perfect, boring characters. In this guys, the talent points more towards some personality that\u2019s exaggerated and made to feel alive, if not realistic.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not that these are shallow without hope. There is hope for some depth and the show occasionally taps into it, but that\u2019s not how we get to know the characters. We know them like we know our classmates \u2013 we know their patterns and learn to laugh about it. Even without the psychological aspect, it\u2019s a vivid, entertaining cast.\\n\\n\r\nThey\u2019re so entertaining that even the dullest characters (Who are for some reason the main ones. Someone was taking crazy pills) are entertaining. Neagi and Kirigiri are archetypes without much blood in them. The former is normal and means well. The other is a cold girl who always runs off to the writers, who tell her how to solve the mysteries. They never reach the heights of Fukawa or Junko or pretty much anyone, but they\u2019re a cut above characters in the same style.\\n\\n\r\nThe best of them all is Monokuma. He\u2019s the embodiment of the series and why it works. If the premise and the characters don\u2019t look weird enough, we also get a talking teddy bear that runs the school. He treats the violence and absurdity flippantly, as if it\u2019s normal.\\n\\n\r\nIsn\u2019t this how comedy works? It presents an absurd situation where no one recognizes the absurdity. Although Danganronpa\u2018s story is a mystery, all the techniques are comic. It puts more emphasis on weird situations than a coherent puzzle. The mysteries aren\u2019t exactly cleverly built. They\u2019re messy and require some leap of faith, especially as the series goes on. The final twist is pure comedy.\\n\\n\r\nGood mysteries are more than just predictable. They have an interesting structure and don\u2019t rely just on the outcome. Absurdity is one way to do it. Even if Danganronpa\u2018s structure is fuzzy, it\u2019s never boring. Every mystery is unique and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy also works because of its darkness. This is another case where darkness isn\u2019t used to minimize the horror but amplify it. The bear is cute and the academy looks pretty, but it\u2019s a cruel way of life. There seems to be no other solution than dying or killing, and yet the series knows this isn\u2019t a good reason to sacrifice absurdity or characters. Just because a situation is harsh doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t have a funny side to it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is almost something meta about Monokuma. That route is never explored, which is a shame. It could\u2019ve lifted the anime a little higher. Monokuma keeps telling the students to kill each other so he won\u2019t get bored watching them. Isn\u2019t this why you watch the anime? You watch it to see them kill each other. Wouldn\u2019t be boring if the students decided not to kill each other, but just to kill time with each other?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime explores this question a bit, but not enough. Extending the time where the characters just being themselves could\u2019ve put these two next to each other \u2013 School Life and Mystery \u2013 and we\u2019ll have to ask ourselves what we prefer and why.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t suffer from the over-abundance of ideas like its sister anime, Future Diary. In that one, ideas came and went. There were a lot of hints they could be explored but then they were dropped. While Danganronpa has these routes, it knows it can\u2019t explore all of them in 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe few themes that appear \u2013 despair, violence, friendship \u2013 are used to spice up the story. The story is slightly shallower, but it\u2019s also more organized and better paced. I\u2019m sure the visual novel has more ideas, but in 12 Danganronpa manages to tell a hilarious mystery and not get sidetracked.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s in no way just advertisement for the visual novel. It\u2019s a very entertaining anime filled with vivid characters, weird situations and a funny mystery. The approach to the genre is different, but better than the common one. It may lack substance, but it makes up for it in being entertaining. You don\u2019t need a lot of episodes and fights that last for hours to be entertaining. You just need characters and situations that are odd enough to be memorable. You don\u2019t need punchlines to be funny, you just to find the funny in already existing situations/characters.\\n\\n\r\n3.5 upupupupupu out of 5 upupupupupupu",

Danganronpa definitely fails in its character development department, compared to a lot of the top animes, and the story was pretty weak by the end. However, the first episode bursts straight out of the gates, and hooks you into a fun little (lowish quality) entertaining world of stupid deaths, stupider characters, and a surprisingly light attitude. I had a fun timewatching it, and i think most people will enjoy it, but i must admit it was far from the highest quality anime i have seen.",

Also (SPOILER) i dont understand why they still left the school when Junko said the air was bad, i'd rather just stay in the school if that was the case. Also the trial scenes were pretty repetitive. \r\nart  8/10\r\nThe artwas different and had unique character designs but i could not take the anime seriously with it's pink blood -_-  also i liked the execution scenes. \\n\\n\r\nsound 6/10\\n\r\nI liked the background music and the monobear song XD \\n\r\nbut i wasnt fond of the opening all that much it sounded like something you'd find in an american cartoon. voice acting was decent except monobear that voice was annoying. Ending i never stuck around for \\n\\n\r\ncharacter 4/10 \\n\r\nThe characters where pretty unique but we didnt really get much development with some and tbh none really stood out to me and i didnt really care for their deaths but kyoko (i think thats her name) was probs my fave. but i wanted to see a hint of romance between her and that guy but whatever. \\n\\n\r\n4/10 \\n\r\ni only stuck around cause i was super curious about the school and stuff \\n\\n\r\noverall 5/10 \\n\r\ni'd rather have just seen them kill each other and reallly play the game instead of \"Oh i wont kill any of you, you're all my friends even thought we just met\" i'd like to see them all die and have a winner (Which would most likely be the MC) but if i was in their situation i'd actually do what they did so yeah. and i almost forgot my least fave thing was the whole amnesia thing and the reality show like that just ruined it. \\n\\n\r\nthis was my first review",

            "content": "I have never played the game so I'll simply judge this show on its own merits.\r\nWith that said, I don't need to play the game to know that this simply isn't very good. It's fun to watch in its own right, and fans of the genre should still check it out because it's short any way but...\r\nFirst I'll talk about one of the most obvious things about this show, the art style. It's... unique to say the least. All of the characters have very expressive and exaggerated designs, and many of the backgrounds are very stylized. This is especially true when the \"punishments\" are shown.This gives the show a very artificial look, and whether that's a good or a bad thing is up to you. On one side the art is the thing that REALLY makes the show feel unique, on the other side well... it makes it very hard for this show to be taken seriously. For a show about people dying one by one and central themes of hope vs. despair... the tone's a lot lighter than it should be. I'm fine with a show that seems sort of light on the outside but very dark and gruesome at its core but this show does not pull that off well. Frankly, it's harder to care when people die when the blood is fucking PURPLE.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the problem with the show, its plot isn't too bad in theory but it rushes through everything so much that absolutely nothing has the weight that it should. None of the characters are that interesting because barely any of them get much development, and the development they do get is either A. rushed or B. just used as a plot device. So the characters are basically just a collection of cardboard cut out tropes that you barely end up caring about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the story itself was... OK. It got kind of convoluted towards the end, some of it didn't make all that much sense, and it was pretty rushed the whole way through. But at the very least it held your attention.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the show, it's the kind of show where you keep watching because you want to see what happens next but never actually get that much satisfaction from the results. The art style is very unique but its over the top when something more subtle might have been more effective. it can be fun to watch at times, especially with the main villain's antics, but if you're expecting good mystery, good characters, good depth... quite frankly you're looking in the wrong place. I think the show had potential to be a deep and gratifying experience, something that seems colorful on the outside but is actually quite grim and thought provoking when you actually think about it. That's what this show completely failed to be. But if there's one thing I can say about it, it was never boring. So give it a watch if you want, but don't expect too much out of it.",

Well, I haven't played the game, and I found it extremely easy to follow. I didn't get confused AT ALL, even the more complex crimes made sense. \r\nIn my opinion, the only bad thing about this anime is the lack ofcharacter development. I really wish they had included some more episodes just for viewers to get to know the characters. Especially the characters who die near the start. \\n\r\nAll in all, a must watch for anyone who likes battle royale or hunger games sort of stuff. Also comes with some great music and characters.",

            "content": "So to start off, I have not played any of the games/read any of the manga, I have only seen the anime adaptation so this is my view of the anime as a newcomer to Danganronpa.\r\nI will cover some spoilers so you have been warned(although by the time I've seen the anime is already long past the hype and relevance so lol).\r\nI also like to start ratings at 5/10 and either increase or decrease from there.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nI liked the premise of the high school students all trapped with no previous recollections and suddenly being told to get out they have to murder a classmate andget away with it. I thought it was original enough. With the amount of students and episodes it felt fairly predictable, like you could tell there was going to be at least one death per episode, and the episodes delivered. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was pretty good although it felt pretty rushed in spots such as the investigation scenes, (like others commented) and I wish we would have actually gotten to see more details of the investigation. It would have been nice to see how Kirigiri actually got all the answers/evidence/deductions she did? Like I get she's supposed to be mysterious and super skilled but dang you can let the audience know a little bit more from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nIt definitely felt a bit like \"just waiting for the next death\" but I never got bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe part that annoyed me the most and felt was the lowest part of the story was the ending. There was a major plot twist and whatnot (oh snap apocalypse of despair?? what did that mean? I didn't know until watching all the other Danganronpa animes), but I honestly had a super hard time figuring out what they even meant and wasn't able to comprehend it until after I spent roughly half an hour going through the Danganronpa wiki to get a basic idea. Like I didn't understand all the talk about \"despair\" or grasp how serious it was?? It made little sense to me.\\n\r\nI am not great at seeing plot twists in advance but this one was a huge amount of information in the last...2 episodes I think?? It definitely felt rushed. \\n\\n\r\nArt:  7/10\\n\\n\r\nThought it was fine, I'm not really fussy with animation styles unless its something like random 3d animation that looks really awkward and stuff although the style they used for the executions was certainly different...I think it was effective though how it managed to freak me out more then if the style had stayed the same.\\n\\n\r\nThere were bits where mouths opening seemed really stiff etc?? but I guess you gotta budget lol\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI actually really liked the first opening, \"Never Say Never\" it was really fun to hear and the mixture of rap and singing worked well. The second opening, \"Monokuma Ondo\" I didn't really care for the style of, I guess I just don't really like hearing him sing lol \\n\\n\r\nThe ending, \"Zetsub\u014dsei: Hero Chiry\u014dyaku\" was also pretty good, I like how high paced it became. \\n\r\nNothing super memorable, although I liked the first opening pretty good.\\n\r\nI've heard worse and more boring openings and endings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm definitely not the first(or even in the first hundred I'm sure) to comment on how in such a short anime with so many characters, theres not going to be enough time to develop them. \\n\\n\r\nEven Naegi felt pretty basic \"super optimistic protagonist\" and I didn't feel he ever got much motive nor did his attachment to some character that we never saw him interact with much or at all. I've since read on how in the games the majority of gameplay involves interacting with fellow students and that would make sense for Naegi to feel attached...but I guess it was doomed to be hard to execute in this format and it shows.\\n\\n\r\nJust...it wasn't horrible but not good either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nPremise was interesting enough to keep me watching to the end, characters were just average, art wasn't bad nor great, I liked the pink blood and thought it was a nice choice, the story was fine till the end in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot the best anime or the worst, I did enjoy it fairly well until the end. Worth a watch if you like the premise and don't mind a story that totally twists and become hard to understand at the end.",

            "content": "Fifteen students, each with different skills, are trapped in a killing game at their school, Hope\u2019s Peak Academy. To escape the game, one is supposed to kill one or two of their fellow students and get away with it. Things will not be so easy though, as sometime after a murder, there will be a class trial. If everyone deduces the culprit\u2019s identity correctly, only the culprit will die and the game continues. Otherwise, they all die except for the culprit and the culprit wins.\r\nThe concept of a killing game with a trial (thanks Ace Attorney for getting me hooked into trials) system was reallyexecuted well. The drawback to DR: The Animation was that it was adapted from a game, hence quite a significant amount of content was cut out, though they have most of the points down but just quite summarized. I loved how Kirigiri Kyouko was at first introduced as \u201cSuper Duper High School ???\u201d, since it served as a hook for me because I had hoped that they would tell us what ??? was. They did at the end, but not going to say what it is. Each character was also very different and unique in their own way. I could go on but there are so many characters to cover. Yet it was quite surprising for me to see that they could interact quite well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, great show but considerably bad adaptation. I would recommend playing Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, the game that this was adapted from. But I had started with the anime first and imo it also served as a good experience, just that starting with the game might give you the best experience.",

It featured cool, creative animated scenes when ever some one was on the \"Chopping Block\". The characters were crazy, you had your typical nice kid who was against the killing, and some kids who were all for it. The drama and betrayal were interesting to watch. With twists along the way, this show managed to make me interested enough tobinge the entire thing in a day or two. I really recommend it! I still get goosebumps thinking about it!",

If the producers wanted to pace this properly, they would have extended the show's run to 18episodes, with the extra time devoted to exploring the characters and their interactions (utilizing notable \"free time\" material from the game) and the investigations, giving the viewer greater access to the vital evidence beforehand in order to begin puzzling out the mysteries for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nEven being rushed, however, the story watches like a fairly gripping crime drama on TV, and there are enough well played twists to keep you guessing. The writers seem to revel in subverting traditional tropes and cliches, and what happens is often not at all what you'd expect. Also, the music is excellent, with a great opening and ending, as well as fantastic atmospheric music in the background. That one opening with the \"Monokuma Song\" was rather odd though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys crime/mystery shows, but with the caveat that they play the game first so that they have a more in depth experience to begin with, and also so they don't know the \"whodunnit\" beforehand.",

            "content": "I enjoyed the anime and somewhat enjoyed the game, if you are, for lack of a better word, triggered by that statement, please stop reading this.\r\nNow that's out of the way, let's continue.\r\nLet's talk about how I got to the anime anyway. I heard about the game and actually began to watch a playthrough of the game, however I just grew bored because of how much pretty much every single thing was dragged out. Because of this, I took the easy way out and watch the anime instead. However I'm sure the game was great, it's just a bit too wordy and slow-paced than Iprefer.\\n\\n\r\nI think one of the reasons this anime gets so much criticism is just because it's an adaptation of the game. It's not 100% accurate, go figure, but think of it this way, if the anime kept every single little thing it had in the game, then the anime would be 50+ episodes long. That's probably an exaggeration, but please bear with me. This is a turn-off for a lot of people, including myself. Remember how I said this was the easy way out? Some people prefer their anime around ten or twenty episodes, mainly because they either have busy lives, short attention spans, or just prefer things go straight to the point. Because of this, the creators would loose a good bit of potential customers just because of that. So I'm glad they shortened it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's also a few cons to shortening it. There isn't as much character development or any time to get to know the characters. This I don't really like, I feel like they could've extended the episodes to maybe 24 episodes if they showed more interactions with the characters from the game, so I agree with most criticism there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was gorgeous, however I HATED that they simply reused the execution scenes from the game. It was such a cheap copout. I thought they were going to do their own adaptation of the infamous scenes, but they decided not to. I'd rather not think it was laziness because if the creators were truly lazy, they wouldn't have made the anime anyway. Maybe it was for budget problems or they just didn't think it was necessary? I don't know. Other than that, the art was great.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were either intriguing, annoying, or uninteresting altogether. I didn't really find an in between. Because of this, I found it a bit difficult to care for characters that either got executed or murdered. In fact, I only truly liked about four characters. Again, I think if the anime extended a bit, I think I would've gotten a better understanding of the characters and liked them a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was actually quite nice, I don't think there was much room, if any, for improvement there.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I enjoyed this anime very much. It may not be in my top five of all time, but I would definitely recommend it if you want a dark story full of action, betrayal, and, most of all, bloody demises. However, if you're a huge fan of the game, I'd definitely either keep an open mind or skip this anime altogether.",

Playing with his puppets, the master sure has whipped up a sick fancy to gore!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Think of this anime as the cop show NCIS, except animated with fifteen-year-old \"students\" as the suspects and investigators\u2014even the victims. This series is most definitely \"mystery\" and \"horror\" at it's clear finest, and even finding the opportunities to throw in a little comedy to lift the spirits after a gruesome execution. Though,if you fancy romance and fantasy more than being neutral when it comes to genre, walk away\u2014this is filled with teenagers who're on edge backstabbing one another; literally.\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, about the backstabbing; Sayaka Maizono attempts to trick her friend from middle school, Makoto Naegi, into being blamed into murder which after she horrifically failed to act upon, which later was hypothesized to \"save him\" from having to live out the nightmarish murder party, which, as said, is only a theory to what her true intentions were... Y'know, because she died. Nevertheless, after that, killing after killing occurred, friend going against friend in a ruthless attempt to escape from Hell on Earth. (Again, terribly sorry for including a spoiler. I was only looking for one example!)\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reason I liked this anime was because it wasn't clich\u00e9 like a lot of other anime are in some sense, and it's unique way of getting the viewer engaged in the investigations that commence after a murder\u2014not just the characters. The writer of the original manga did an excellent job in executing that; making the viewers/readers of the anime/manga think instead of just watching/reading. Not only that, but it also has a deep depth of detail that is also commendable. The story is very original, as said, and the way the characters act upon are also unique. And for Christ's sake, it even has it's own intro and outro songs! Some other anime have this, but most of them don't. The song's themselves are also very rememberable! \\n\\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In all review, everything about this anime is great to me. Everyone has their own tastes in anime, and though this one lacks fantasy, or other desired genre types, Danganronpa can be very addicting to watch after a couple of episodes! Overall, in every aspect, I give this anime a straight \"10\" for it's excellence!",

And the story was great, but unfortunately it had more plot twists for me than the game.\r\nComparing to the game, the art and animation is really bad, I honestly think the art is a little lazy-made and the animation is more lazy-made.\r\nThe voices and characters were reallygood, the background music is very awesome, also only a little of the voices sound annoying at times, or even usually. Talking about the characters, it's really fun to make fanart since the designs are unique and the colors are good chosen. The personalities and backstories are also good, except that some of the backstories are either rushed up or the ideas in them are overused.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this anime, mainly because of the game. All the reasons above might explain why i give this anime a 9/10.",

            "content": "***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***\r\nDanganronpa Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation (holy fu@# what a mouthful of a title) was a wildcard anime for me this past season. When I watched the first episode I had no idea if I was going to end up liking my investment. I am pleased to announce that I did end up enjoying the show even if the ending was pretty boring.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nSo the plot was pretty intriguing in the beginning. The anime follows the main protagonist Naegi as he and the other highschool students struggle to survive in the crazy dog eat dog worldthey find themselves in. Every episode follows a monster of the week type format where there is a murder each episode that the students have to solve and vote on. I rather enjoyed this aspect of the plot; to see what alliances formed between the cast and how each one responded to being called guilty. I would say that the one thing that really hurts this anime is how predictable the future events are to see coming. It was quite obvious to me who killed each person in each episode (except for the last one). Even though it was predictable, I still ended up enjoying most of the show. The ending however really let me down; don\u2019t want to spoil it so all I\u2019ll say is that it felt very melodramatic and rushed. I have heard that the anime was very faithful to the game it was based on so props for that.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLOVED THE EYES IN THIS ANIME. Yeah the animation was very spot on in every episode as the character models were very defined and seemed quite unique compared to any other anime I have seen. If I had to complain about anything it would be how a lot of the miscellaneous objects off camera center seemed very undefined.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nLiked the soundtrack and thought the voice actors did a great job. Shout out to the voices of Togami and Kirigiri. Not so much Naegi he just came off pretty pathetic for most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, every character in this anime is some stereotype of another show already out. You have the super shy, sportsy tomboy, larger nerd type person, ext. There are some good moments between the characters but the only developing friendship you become aware of is between Naegi and Kirigiri. The cast did work well with each other though so some points have to be given there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show was pretty enjoyable. It had an interesting start and went off like a rocket. It did start to lose some steam once people started dying off and I still think it could have ended better but that is just my opinion. I recommend this if you like detective style anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

Character design is unique also. \r\nThe story is interesting, however, it leaves you with a few questions which I think will be answered in the sequel. The mystery side and the trials are interesting to watch, but youcan't figure out the solution on your own since you don't have all the clues.  Sometimes it feels rushed (especially when presenting clues) that you need to go back and re-watch to understand. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters as I said are unique in design, however from a psychological point of view (since it's rated as a psychological anime) do not really make sense. Some aspects are taken to lightly (like betrayals, friendship) and characters recover easily without caring about what psychological torment they went through. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is not that good, however the Japanese voice acting is good, I really liked some of the characters voices. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed watching this, the only problem is the shallow character development and the static art at certain points.",

Even if the plot is not extraordinary, the way it is written achieved to make this series very interesting and worth seeing. The soudtrack behind this gives goosebumps and I think that it is one of the strengths of this series. The characters are very differents one fromanother, each with their own capacities, specialities and personality, which make the anime very rich and keeps it from being redundant and boring. The main character, Naegi, is the most interesting because the way he evolves and finds himself some talents through the series is very interesting. The animation is good, but isn't extraordinary.

After each murder, a trial is held where the students try to find the killer. If the killer is found, he/she is executed, however if the killer isn't, all other students are executed instead.\r\nThe soundtrack and artstyle are definitely the anime's strengthpoints; the music especially does an omega good job at setting the tone for the situation and the artstyle is distinguishable from every other anime. The characters have great personalities, some way more generic than the others, but you'll find yourself picking favorites. On the other hand, what holds the anime back is that everything seems rushed; the investigations are super short and not in depth and the characters aren't explored enough, which I'm sure isn't the case in the original game.\\n\r\nAll in all; Dangan Ronpa would've been way better if the anime was 24 episodes instead of 13, however it's still a super fun experience.\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 78%\\n\r\nMy anime reviewing blog: 300wordsanimereviews.blogspot.com",

I hadn't really researched it before hand, and I didn't know it would take the same twist it did. As soon as the plot was revealed, I was drawn in immediately.If you read my review on Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, you would know that I quite like anime that take a turn in the opposite direction of how you first imagine it. The premise of the story is quite interesting, and the idea isn't an overused trope like other anime of the same genre. However, when I reached a certain point closer to the end of the anime, I realised that there wasn't enough time to finish the story in a way that I had hoped it would and I found the ending very disappointing. I am a big fan of revisiting anime that I have previously watched and enjoyed, but with an ending like this one I can't see myself doing that. I cannot delve into what disappointed me most about the ending without spoiling things, so I will leave it with this. I felt the conclusion wasn't as thought out as the rest of the story, and I felt like there was far more room for improvement and suspense in the ending.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the art. I was absolutely blown away with the use of mixed styles in the anime. I fell in love with the use of almost paper-like animation in some of the execution scenes. Absolutely brilliant! The style in the rest of the anime I found a little bit average, nothing really jumped out at me like in others I have watched. However, that being said, I adored the design of the characters. They were all very unique and I quite enjoyed all their little details that belonged only to them. I liked how the designer branched into all different ideas, like the super muscly girl or the sexy goth. The use of the varying designs also helped mask whom the murdered was every episode. You couldn't use any stereotypes to help you figure it out, because there were too many to analyse. I was surprised every time!\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, there isn't much to talk about in regards to the sound. The opening of the anime, Never Say Never, was very catchy and hip. The ending, Zetsubousei: Hero Chiryouyaku, I felt was a little dull.\\n\r\nThe music used in investigations and punishments didn't stand out to me especially, probably because I was too busy trying to figure out who was the murderer then trying to recover after realising I was wrong. \\n\r\nOkay, that's probably a lie. I personally don't have too much of an opinion on the music. It was...alright. I wish I could say more.\\n\\n\r\nNow I stated earlier that I loved the character design in this anime, but as far as character personalities and development I found it bone dry. I understand that the intent wasn't for the students to get close and become buddies, but I found the characters quite boring without any kind of real development. I like to relate to my characters in some way, whether it's because Tsukino Usagi (Sailor Moon) is a big crybaby like me, or because all Kaneki Ken (Tokyo Ghoul) wants is to fit in somewhere like me, or because Izumi Konata (Lucky Star) has itty bitty boobies just like yours truly - I still have one aspect that I share with a character and it helps me to almost connect with the mangaka and share how they feel about their character. Relating to a character I think is an important aspect of any story telling. The characters in this anime were all very boring to me and it made their deaths a little less intense for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did like the anime. But there were particular aspects that made the whole weekend I spent binging it seem a little less exciting. If even a few of these aspects were met, I think that this anime could have been in my top 10 favourite. Again, if you read my other review, you would know I am a bit of a hard judge when it comes to my favourite anime.\\n\r\nIt's hard for me to recommend this anime, but if you're the kind of person that likes horror but have a bit of a weak stomach, the horror is mellowed out by the use of discolouration of the blood. If you're also like me and enjoy unexpected twists, this would meet your criteria.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this anime a bit more than I did. Sadly, I have to rate this at a 4 sakura flowers out of 10.",

            "content": "This is an anime adaptation of a game that has been squashed into 13 episodes which I will admit was quite disappointing. This story is about special high school students that are the best in their niche. The range and diversity of talents that these kids have has been quite entertaining. We've got: super duper scion, super duper swimmer, super duper baseball star, super duper gang leader etc. The character design is both intriguing and cute, if you're looking for a gory anime because the synopsis is about murder then I hope you don't mind pink blood. (It was to keep the ratings down, don'thate the awesome producers :3) \\n\\n\r\nKomaeda Naegi has been chosen by 'chance' to enter Danganronpa high school, little did he know the good ratings were all propaganda... he is thrust into a dark room and is awoken naturally by his conscience. He then somehow (lol) makes his way to the gym where all the super dupers are to meet. A lot of friendly and unfriendly characters greet him. Head of the school is a black and white bear (Monobear) Who tells them that they'll be trapped in this school forever and if they want to graduate then they must murder someone. LET THE PSYCHOLOGICAL GAME COMMENCE!!! This story is not super dark though I'd say give it to kids over 8 so they'll be able to mentally prepare for a few twists and surprises here and their. \\n\\n\r\nI like the anime because it's what I've been searching for ever since I found anime <333",

            "content": "In light of Danganronpa 3 anime coming out (and before anyone ask, no you did miss a 2 cause there wasn't one...don't ask please) I decided to review danganronpa the anime because it (and I need to get some reviews for anime I like) Let's do this.\r\nStory- \r\nThe story is decently adapted which I am happy about because if they didn't adapt this atleast decently I would be pissed to no end. But in the end it was decently adapted. Granted it suffered from being rushed especially with investigations and trials (which improved going to the end due to less people being alive at thetrials as the show goes to a close). I normally don't care about amount of episodes but this was a case where in could have at least used about 20+ episodes instead of just 13 and it would be a little better.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue this adaption suffers from is character development in the story. Because of the short length, unlike the game where you could hang out and talk with the characters to know them better, here...not so much. I mean that is probably an issue to be expected especially when they are adapting a game that can take up to hours and days to complete depending on how you play video games. It didn't help that the episode amount was short. The characters developed but not like in the game because when characters died in the anime it not like you have a huge attachment to them or anything and it is easy to shrug off.\\n\\n\r\nDue to pacing issues and mediocre to subpar character development I have to give the story a 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art is fine. Pretty much match up the character designs to the game which I am happy about and I have really no major complaints about it minus how it could look stilted sometimes to be honest. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- The highest point for me. I loved the opening to this anime. I just do. The ending is fine and seeing that I watched both sub and dub I honestly liked both. Granted the english dub sounded weird to me at times, it was good. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Sadly unlike the Persona 4 anime, I didn't care as much for these characters unlike I did in the game. My favorites by far is Junko and Monokuma, especially Monokuma though granted his voice annoyed me in the English dub to the point of almost urging me to mute my tv while I watched it. Overall the characters get a 7/10 which is really me just being generous and a little bias cause this show gave me a new favorite in the villains category in anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I enjoyed myself with this anime and had a real good time watching it despite its issues.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Danganronpa isn't the best adaption of a video game but it is one of the better one. It obviously has the pacing issues which doesn't help with it short length and it probably could have benefited being longer then it was. Overall I really did enjoy myself watching this so I am going to give this anime an 7.5/10. If your looking to watch a video game adaption. This is one I recommend \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, peace people",

The game was able to display the story a lot better than the anime was, I think this is due to the fact that it was shortened. I think that there wasn't alot of character growth and that it would probably have been a bit harder to follow if I hadn't played the game. I think that the anime itself would have been much better if they had stuck in 6 or so more episodes that way the characters would have been able to develop and each event would have had more time to unfoldbefore the next one came along. Overall it was still nice to watch and I still love the art style's unique twist. \\n\\n\r\n(please note this is my first review I'm so sorry if this is awful)\\n\\n\r\n    Overall thoughts: It was okay. \\n\r\n    Constructive Criticism: Could have used more episodes.",

            "content": "Where do I even begin with this anime?\r\nI think I'll start off by saying, this anime is really only for people who are fans of the game.  If you don't play the game or at least read/watch a walkthrough then you will be generally clueless to the characters or the way that gather evidence go.  The anime skips a lot of key points when it comes to gathering the evidence.\r\nSixteen characters and thirteen episodes was never a good idea, giving each character a three episode arc, and then boom, they are dead.  It is hardly enough time to characterize them. This leavesthe watcher apathetic and noncaring towards most of them because we simply don't know much about them beyond the scope of what the anime entails.\\n\r\nThe prime example is Leon Kuwata.  There is a lot of characterization in the game that is missed in the anime.  For instance, while he is the super high school level baseball player/all star, he desired to change his super high school title to rock star, and thus his appearance changed greatly.\\n\\n\r\n  This isn't even explained in the anime, and you get two different renders of his character.  If you watch the first episode you merely think it's a generic baseball player even though the other characters are shown as they currently look.  Nothing about Leon's character was explained.  Instead of the character talking about his hopes and dreams and conflicting feelings between his super high school levels, he's delivered generic lines.  When his trial comes (it being two of the most emotional trials in the game/anime in my opinion) the character has a mental break down, but we do not feel the same as watchers as we would playing the game because this information is left out.  The delivery of emotion is simply not the same and the character looses value.\\n\\n\r\nNo one can feel sorry for characters they don't get attached to, no matter how emotionally impacting a trial is supposed to be.\\n",

            "content": "Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei - The Animation.\r\nWhich can only mean it is..a game adaptation. Now, I have NOT played the game. So, I will be reviewing it just for the anime.\r\nBy the way, this is my first review. So, yeah.\r\nStory [8/10]\r\n     I'm going to be honest, I loved how fast paced this was. It was what I was looking for for a while now. For every episode, there is either a new murder case or another of the infamous Classroom Trial. New mysteries lead to more questions and sometimes make me wonderwhat could happen next or how could this lead to that, making that mysterious atmosphere. Then, the Classroom Trial comes and after figuring out all the clues and missing pieces, someone still had to die in the end. All because of a teddy bear. (This anime or the game is not recommended for the little of age.)\\n\\n\r\n    But, if there is one negative thing I have to say about the story, it is that it felt rushed to me(will be discussed in the enjoyment section).\\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]\\n\r\n     Switching from 2-D to 3-D and back again was definitely news to me and though the 2-D aspect was not the best-looking, the 3-D part of it stood out to me, sort of. For the most part, the art is solid and the animation is smooth but it is not always constant, being that it is not clear sometimes. The characters are quite solid and a little simplistic(how I like it), but, again, is not always constant. (By the way, the fact that the blood is pink in this anime made the victims look awkward.)\\n\\n\r\nSound [6/10]  \\n\r\n      For the sound and music aspect of this anime, it is not anything particularly special. Certain music would play at the right time sometimes, and sometimes, not so much. The sound, to me, were more average than good. \\n\\n\r\n     The opening and the ending wasn't anything that stood out to me either.  Although, the opening did surprise me with it's English lyrics and it sounded decent so, it was not all bad. Overall, it isn't very memorable for me in any way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [7/10]\\n\r\n     Being introduced to 16? characters of the anime right off the bat was a bit overwhelming for me and trying to remember every single name so I don't get confused was a bit of a chore at first. However, as I got to know characters like the optimistic Naegi Makoto or the ever-so-mysterious Kyouko Kirigiri, it turned out to be less confusing than I first thought. From average people like Sayaka Maizono and Leon Kuwata to people who have...other agendas like Monokuma him?self made it interesting for me.\\n\\n\r\n     Now, the main problem with this anime is that there isn't enough character development. Most characters either don't change or hardly change at all. The reason lies within the fact that there just isn't enough 'space' to put in that character development(which I will discuss in the next section).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [7/10]\\n\r\n     Alright, I'm at the bottom of the bucket and I have but 3 words. Not. Enough. Episodes. This is where the problem of the anime lies. The plot definitely felt rushed to a point where I don't even get what I'm trying to figure out from the story and,  since they are following a game, even just putting the plot into 13 episodes seems to leave, literally, no room for a filler episode or even some decent character development. Just saying.\\n\\n\r\n     I'm not saying it's all bad since this was the kind of thing I was looking for in a long time. A good fast-paced anime with some sort of mystery aspect to it. The whole thing about hope and despair was cheesy, but I was okay with it. Survival was also a big concept considering there's lots of blood(pink) in this...and lots of dying too, which I also enjoy in a show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [8/10]\\n\r\n     I don't exactly have much complaints over this anime except that there isn't enough episodes to go around. But, overall, the thirteen weeks I spent to watch this anime was, more or less worth it in my opinion. So, if there will be an anime adaptation for the sequel of the first game this was adapted from, I am definitely hoping it will be better than this one...and more episodes. DEFINITELY more episodes.\\n\\n",

Alot of things were either left out or put in with little effort.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10 You can tell instantly that it was rushed. Certain scenes are almost laughable how rushed they are! It still shines in other areas however, so once you get away from the awkward in betweens you'll notice a lot of well executed scenes (pun intended).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 The original sound is most likely my favorite soundtrack of all time. A lot of the tracks for this have been slightly altered, but not too much to ruin any enjoyment. In addition to this, the end theme is a great song alone as well being completely fitting (lyrics wise).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10 Obviously with 13 episodes they couldn't pack a lot of character development into this. Coming out of the series someone could completely misinterpret the characters as a whole. They get the main point across but forget the rest most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 As I mentioned before I personally think of it more as an 'add on'. That being said it's wonderful to watch! However its almost laughable how fast the trials go. The days of screaming at your PSP to get the characters to understand the situation is far behind us, but instead we have a bunch of genius' figuring everything out faster than the original investigation! Other than that, it's always a pleasure to see our favorite scenes animated.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Don't watch this unless you've played the game.",

As the students are explained the rules and regulations of the school by a bear named Monukuma, he explains that there is only one way to graduate at this school and that is that you have to kill one of your classmate and make sure you don't get exposed. The other students have toguess who the killer is and if they guess right then the killer is executed but if they guess wrong then everyone except the killer will get executed while the kilker graduates.Genuinely i'm quite biased towads this series because I highly enjoy survival horror series but this series even added the whodunit element which made me enjoy this series a lot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 - The art was quite unique which some people bashed because they think it was one of the things that ruined this adaption while some people praised the art style for its creativity. Though I do think this anime was trying too hard but this art style is befitting for the theme despair.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 - To be honest I felt like the soundtrack was literally screaming out despair because it held that type of feeling whenever you hear something but its a good quality as it represents the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 - The characters were done well as their clashing personalities lead to different suspects but from time to time I did think that 'are they stupid' because they done some... idiotic stuff I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 - I enjoyed this series highly as it held a lot of my favoured catagories.

            "content": "Dangan Ronpa is a surreal mystery-series, one with a premise and presentation that most audience-members will either accept or reject on sight. \r\nThe design and animation is filled with high contrasts and exaggerated ideas bordering on the cartoonish, pink-colored blood and extravagant execution-scenes being two examples. Being based on a visual novel game, the show borrows visuals from the source-material diligently to the point where you\u2019re looking at bits of gameplay in certain parts. In that sense Dangan Ronpa can look like a jarring mess, or like a buffet of intersting visual choices.\r\nThe soundtrack is as varied and random as the gallery of characters andtheir personalities. Relentless rock n\u2019 roll and erratic electrical instruments play up the quirky and unstable atmosphere, somber tunes from pianos and keyboards lend themselves to some sadder moments as well as the almost dream-like setting.\\n\\n\r\nAs a detective-story surrounding a death-tournament, one should go in expecting numerous character-deaths. Combine this with the fact that the series is only thirteen episodes long, and it becomes apparent that very little time is spent on character-development and fleshing out. Thankfully the many quirks and the style of the show make every character distinctive. In the show's defense, if you have more than a dozen characters to play detective with, and an equal number of episodes to do it with, then making the cast into caricatures is the best approach. There simply is no time to develop them beyond a few bonding scenes. Despite not having deep characters, their personalities are entertaining, and more often than not the show is self-aware of the clich\u00e9s it uses.\\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries are truly the main focus and the greatest selling-point of Dangan Ronpa. An episode will usually start off by showing a murder and the clues left behind, and then have the mystery solved in the next episode. The show succeeds on this point by giving the audience time to think for themselves about each murder-case, giving a fair chance to untie the knots of an eccentric world, some solutions being simple while others are more far-fetched.\\n\\n\r\nDangan Ronpa's greatest strengths and flaws are in its contrasting presentation and premise. It is a series that most will either love or hate while watching it. Recommended to fans of murder-mysteries who also enjoy the crazier and more chaotic side of anime.",

            "content": "For the record, i have not played the game and therefore speak for the anime only. \r\nStory: 3/10: There are two types of mytery: the one that gives the clues necessary for the audience to put the pieces together and the danganronpa mystery, which involves hiding those clues to the audience so they wont figure things out.\r\n A good mystery would provide those clues in a discrete way so when the mystery is revealed you would look back at it in surprise and ask yourself why you could not figure it out sooner, because the clues were there. Instead, Danganronpa decides to show us onlythe irrelevant, and instead of giving us a hint of anything before the trial they leave it to the characters to narrate us all their discoverings instead of letting the audience figure them out for itself, thus creating 0 interest in me while watching it. In other words: Danganronpa is not unpredictable, it\u00b4s just impossible to predict and therefore fails as a mystery. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10: the character designs are nice and i think the animation is pretty nice, especially the way the punishment scenes where animated which i though it was an artistic and very creative way to not make them so graphic and bloody.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10: i think the music fits well in the scenes, but i cant recall almost nothing of it so it's not so memorable. The ending song though, it\u00b4s awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10: unfortunately, good character design does not mean good character development. There is only so much it can be told from the appearance, the rest is up to how the characters are portrayed and how much of their personality can be seen through their actions. The only thing i can say for them can be summarized in one word: shallow. Having a bg cast and considering the first ones to die did not have enough time to shine, i expected to have some lack of characterisation, but even the main characters where shallow. Though some of their past was revealed, it meant nothing becaus i still felt i was looking at the surface of what could have been deep characters. Nothing of the way they feel is mentioned,  most of them faced death so calmly it was obvious they were not real. If they tried at least to make them react to the dangerous situation they were in as a normal human being, the series could have been so great even with it's shitty mystery. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10: honestly, i only kept up with the series for two reasons: to see the punishment scenes and to find out who would die next at the hands of whom, and because a friend of mine was pushing me. Everything apart from death and torture scenes was a blurr to me, none of the \"content\" the series was trying to offer sticked into my head, so this is for me just and empty series with some cool killing scenes and nothing else. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10: i would only recommend it if you are so bored out of your mind, sooooooo bored, you are willing to stand it for some 2 minutes of tortures with great animation style.",

            "content": "This is...an interesting one.\r\nThis is Danganrompa.\r\nLet me preface this by saying that, like the average viewer, it seems, I've never played the game. From my understanding, however, this anime is modeled by a perfect runthrough of the game, which is way longer than the 13-episode long anime. It's best that we look at this on a more surface level.\r\nAnd there's a lot on the surface, but barely anything underneath.\r\nSTORY: 6/10\r\nBoy goes to new school he's never heard of. Boy meets girl from his past. Boy and girl find out that the school is far more sinister than they one percieved, so boy and girl teamup to fight against potential evil while forming alliances with side characters that are as terrifed as them. A simple premise done fairly, but is still lacking.\\n\\n\r\nI will give props to the anime for being not-so predictable. As the summary states, it's a murder mystery, and like any good mystery, it's difficult to tell who actually committed said murder/s. You don't know these character's origins or reasoning until it becomes important. The school is so vast, like a perilous chasm. The anime does a really good job extending themselves from the Scooby Doo level of storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, like Scooby Doo, it's still basic.\\n\\n\r\nLet me explain.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated, this anime follows a perfect run of the game, which seems to be one of the many common complaints of the show. That's understandable. The main character, (the Pheonix Wright or Professor Layton problem solver, if you will,) knows exactly on cue when a character is lying during a \"trial,\" where the characters present must crack down on who murdered the victim of the week. He barely needs any hints and minimal assistance from other characters, basically ceasing any tension during the actual trial. It doesn't leave the viewer much time to participate, like a classic mystery should. Rather, it's like we're witnessing the trial, more like a speedrun, which frankly sucks as the strongsuit of the anime is its build-up.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, it's fantastic. The show is very stylized, and the character designs were so bright and expressive. It has this very \"The World Ends With You\" vibe, where each character looks urbanized and exaggerated.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this show is really good at displaying emotions and making the viewer feel certain ways from color schemes and certain aspects of scenery. The trial room is intimidating. The punishment scenes make you feel this air of hopelessness for the character facing execution, no matter how much you may have hated them previously.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid and its aesthetic is rather distinct. Not many complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOne common praise behind this anime is the music. Intro, outro, interludes. All wonderful, and I don't have much to say besides it does truly match the thematics of the show with this techno-rock vibe that's somehow chaotic and rhythmic at the same time...much like the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I watched the dubbed version of this anime, so I can't say much of the sub. Will note, however, that the dub is astonishingly good.  It was very well casted, with some interesting choices for particular parts. You know that annoying blonde kid in Clannad? His voice actor voices the evil bear guy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd he's damn GOOD.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we're getting to that right now.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMonokuma is perfect. Amazing. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else? Eh.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow our main character, Naegi, who is generic anime boy who is moving into a new school where he will learn the importance of self-determinism and making sugoi-desu best friends. You should have stopped me if you've heard that one before.\\n\\n\r\nWe are also introduced to FIFTEEN new characters, (red flag,) whose number slowly goes down as students are killed and Monokuma, our main antagonist who moderates the murders, laughs at their plight. Very, very few of these fifteen are well-developed and interesting, and even so I can't remember the names of nearly any of them. Even by the final episode I was getting names mixed up; the only way I could remember who or what a character was was by appearance and trope. One could argue that's the point, but a problem while watching is still a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some characters you learn literally NOTHING about, hence the problem behind this show being merely thirteen episodes; less than one episode per character. At times a murder feels more like an excuse to not give a character more screentime; soap opera ex machina, if you will. Only expressions and actions make them likable or memorable, but not quotable.\\n\\n\r\nExcept Monokuma. Shit, yo. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI am so behind on my work because of this stupid show. I binge-watched over the course of two days, which was something I truly didn't expect. A friend introduced me to this show after she won a Monokuma plush from a grab-bag at a con and wanted to find its origins. It was really fun for me to watch with friends, and I observed more when I watched alone. I feel that, maybe if I watched the entire series with friends, I would have enjoyed the show much more.\\n\\n\r\nIt's humorous, if anything. I laughed a lot, and I felt the minimal amount of sympathy I was supposed to for those who were murdered or executed. I would feel much better if this show was more of a satire than a \"horror mystery psychological thriller.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, when I watched the rest of this show by myself, I realized this show was Phoenix Wright that tried too hard to be Professor Layton.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was surely one of the most dubious opinions I've ever had about an anime. Brilliant in some ways, desperately lacking in others. Perfect buildup, plenty anticlimaxes. Funny but not suspenseful like it really wanted to be. Needed more evil death bear.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at these reviews, the opinions are completely polar: either the community thinks this is the worst thing to come out of the industry in this decade, or it's a godsend that leaves everyone on their toes. Personally, yeah, I thought this was good on a surface level. There were a lot of things I enjoyed, but what was missing was highly noticeable: an interesting protagonist, true conflict, true development that doesn't feel forced.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, all I can say is this: go in with low expectations. And have fun.\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever had an anime that you had such high hopes for that almost no matter what you just have to rate it high? Yeah, this is that anime for me. Was it as good as I hoped it would be? No. Did the ending disappoint me? Yes. So why did I rate it a 9 and even thought about rating it a 10? Because I loved the idea of this anime and the video game so much that I just had to.\r\nThe story is this anime's selling point. I mean 15 high school students trapped in an academy where they have to killeach other to get out? Who wouldn't find that interesting? The first episodes really had me going. I was always dying to know what would happen next. But then it turned into a pattern, someone dies, trial. Someone dies, trial. Even though trying to find out who the culprit was was exciting, I was like come on, more story, more plot! Then the last few episodes they gave me just that, rushing all the way, I mean why on earth did they try to cram everything into 13 episodes? 26 would be so much better! \\n\r\nThe art was annoyingly meh. I mean they completely depended on the video game for everything, especially the deaths. I mean I can get how they can follow the video game but gosh it has no anime features, everything is from the video game.\\n\r\nThe opening was strange, I didn't really like it and the ending was okay, video game like I suppose. I liked the voice actors so I that's why it gets an 8, oh and the soundtrack was good too.\\n\r\nThe characters were the other selling point of this anime. I really love them all. It was so sad seeing them die one by one every week. They all had unique personalities and I found them very enjoyable. Especially the mastermind, which I won't say who. Oh and Monobear is adorable in an evil way. Great villain. \\n\r\nSo despite the many setbacks I loved this anime anyways. Maybe it's because I had my heart set on wanting to like it so I just did. I am excited for the next season and will probably watch it and fans of the dangan ronpa video game should definitely watch the anime, it's worth it, not perfect at all, but worth it.",

            "content": "(Don't worry, this is spoiler free)\r\nStory 9/10: Personally after finishing the entire Danganronpa franchise the story is absolutely brilliant. At the beginning it seems like an anime version of the Hunger games but there is so much more to it and all the games and anime seasons fit together like a puzzle pieces. \r\nArt 8/10: Out of every anime series I've seen and every manga series I've ever read, I've never seen such an art style ever before. Although there's not too much to it, it most certainly stands out.\r\nSound 9/10: Something I love about this series is the soundtrack. AND DAT OPENING AND ENDING!I think there was most certainly thought put into it, but I guess the credit shouldn't go to the anime makers because it is from the game. So it only gets a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10: Every single one of the characters have very unique personalities causing them all to be memorable. It clearly took a lot of thought to be able to make such a creative cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment five/10: The biggest disappointment in the Danganronpa anime is the fact that they ignored so much character development, and as someone who watched the anime first and then played the game, I couldn't remember anyone's name. A huge problem was they tried to fit about 2 hours of game play into just 12 episodes, causing so much information to be left in the dirt. \\n\\n\r\nOverall six/10: Danganronpa is a wonderful series, but not as an anime. If you are going to do anything towards this series, play the game. Because Danganronpa The Animation is a perfect example of a bad anime adaptation. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This came from an amazing visual novel and it was great from start to finish, though the problem is this adaptation. First lets talk about how this show was not nearly as long as it should have been. The trials alone took around 2 and a half to around 3 hours in the visual novel, yet in the anime here their impact, emotions, and stress the characters felt, all were almost nonexistent in this adaptation. While the story was roughly the same the characters did not get development at allpretty much as well as many other things were cut out as well. This should have been at least 26 to around 40 eps at least. The visual novel is great and definitely worth reading before this. I definitely would recommend that before this adaptation and if you still wanted to watch an anime version after then I would rec to watch this but only like that, otherwise this show just ruins the entire visual novels plot and cases. So in conclusion this should only be watched if you have completed the visual novel.",

After each murder or set of murders, the students are forced to gather and present evidence to determine who the murderer is and the murderers are putto some strange executions. The name of the anime means \"To win (a debate/argument) with a bullet\", which is in reference to the symbolic \"bullets\" or argumentative statements made by the main character in solving the cases. It's very well written and has a great plot and some genuine mystery that keeps you guessing. The art style is interesting and unique and most likely based on the video game and the characters are quite diverse in personality and appearance.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who likes a good mystery and a unique story set, I definitely recommend this, though people who've played the game don't seem to favor it.",

Then you get ripped out of that idea and thrown into a world where 15 top students in there fields, locked up in the school they had tried to get in. Theysoon find out that they have no memory of what happened except the day they came to the school. Held captive by a mysterious figure who tells them \"inorder to survive you have to kill your classmates and get away with it.\" \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to compare this to anything its like Phoenix Wright meets Battle Royal. It also has this feel of a great crime investigation anime. In every episode it had me guessing on what the hell just happened, who killed who, and how are they going to find a way out of this. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great as a group, but on there own they are weak, but thank god they are stuck together. I would complain more on how they call them Super Dooper so and so, yet it fits in within the show. The whole factor of you can't trust anyone has you at the edge of your seat. The music within the show makes it pulse bounding when the situation gets heated, but the opening theme is kind of weird like it tried to be like James Bond in the worst way and the ending theme is kind of okay the first time, but it is really catchy after the fifth time you hear it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story could have gone on to full 26 episodes, yet it feels right that its short and sweet. Hardly no filler and gets straight to the point. I love this anime and glad to say that its a Masterpiece.",

            "content": "Well, this is, literally, the first anime I ever considered watching. My friends had been talking about Dangan Ronpa for a while, and it sounded like it was really very good. So I decided to try it for myself when the anime came out. And at first, I just pretty much watched the Anime. And I thought it was actually, really good. I had never watched anime before so I didn't know what to expect.\r\nSo the story was good, I thought the art was very cute, and the sound could've been better. Maybe it was just the streaming mirror I had decided to watch. Itprobably was. But I fell in LOVE with the characters. It was really nice and enjoyable, I liked it my first time watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThen my friends had linked me to Oren's Let's Play. I didn't know Dangan Ronpa had started out as a game, but they told me that reading the Let's Play would probably end up being better than watching just the anime, and they were absolutely right. Don't get me wrong, the anime was still good! But reading the Let's Play and then watching the Anime, I realized they had left out quite a few of the pieces of the story. Like evidence, character backstory, and such.\\n\\n\r\nI know it's the anime, and you can't spend a lot of time going around and talking to characters. And if you pick out certain characters, then some people may get angry. But comparing the game to the anime, the anime was more surface leveled than the game which you could really go in depth with.\\n\\n\r\nSo having that experience from reading the Let's Play (and soon, owning the game myself when it comes out!) the story had taken a little bit of a downfall. Especially since one of my favorite parts had been completely left out of the anime. Which also meant I enjoyed it less, but it was only a little bit less. It was still really fun to see how they had animated it, especially certain characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's definitely something you should watch. But, if you have the chance, please please PLEASE go read Oren's Let's Play, because it makes it so much better and explains everything very well. It's a really good read and Oren actually has some notes on it that can help you better understand Japanese culture, save to mention actually getting to go through all the character's free-time events and get to know their character a little bit more.\\n\\n\r\n(Let's Play is here: http://lparchive.org/Dangan-Ronpa/ )",

            "content": "Remember my review for Baysona 4 the Cash-grab animation where I mentioned that many adaptations are very rushed and characters seem bland due to skipping major character development? Well, Danganronpa The Animation falls into that category of video game adaptations. The difference? It actually has an interesting, original concept and it is ambitious. Nonetheless, it falters a lot on all possible levels.\r\nMichael Bay-sama would use an interesting concept and find as many ways as possible to milk everyone's money untill it runs dry and then move on to other concepts. To be honest, the producers tried to avoid this technique and seemed to care aboutthe source material since various mechanics from the original game are present. But, having to squeeze hours of content into a 1 cour series is a Herculean task and usually, despite the ambition behind a project, things go downhill as fast as    Hollywood producing shitty cliched romances, low-brow, unfunny comedies that people will overpraise more than they deserve and schlock action films. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the show starts, it is a classical \"Whodunnit\", Cluedo mime where everyone has to find the person who was murdered. But the interesting part starts when the classic Cluedo ends up being a battle royal of high schoolers organized by an anthropomorphic teddy bear whose merchandise you already have, but you will never admit it. And if this is not enough, the characters are all trapped in a high school for talented students where each one has their own unique talent/skill and the only way out is by killing each other. This already makes it stand out from your typical caliber of psychological, mystery anime and you have a promising start. So what went wrong?\\n\\n\r\nWell, after a person is murdered, a trial is held after a specific time given for the students to search for clues where the students have to decide who is the murderer. The first ones were a delight to watch but later on they became very repetitive and the main protagonist is the only one who can figure everything out because everyone else is denser than Ichika in reasoning. To their credit, they kept trying to make each trial unique but this is how each one went: People suspect an innocent, Sherlock-kun (Naegi) thinks about it, the rest talk about bullshit, then Sherlock-kun guesses everything correctly and murderer gets executed in horrific ways. I am not joking. This is the formula that is repeated every time and the executions were good but later on they lacked the same punch they had as in the first few because characters are not developed properly ending up giving no shit about them. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, we all have to acknowledge the elephant in the room. The main protagonist, Sherlock-kun, is a scaredy character-less Macguffin who is the only one with actual brain cells in the whole show just because the plot demands it. White hair emotionless waifu (Kirigiri) is also smart but she is mostly useless and does nothing in the show to help. The rest range from ok to cringey. But, I really liked that they each represented a specific stereotype of a person and their appearance helped us understand more or less their main trait. I.e. Hifumi is an eroge-crazed otaku, Junko is your typical, spoiled, diva-esque model, Togami is your typical rich preppy brat that you want to kick his balls etc.\\n\r\nAlthough the characters are not terrible per se, they are very poorly used in the story and you feel absolutely nothing about most of the cast because the show does not give enough time to connect with them. \\n\\n\r\nThe visual department is ok. The only thing I have to say is that the characters look weird and the producers pay great hommage to the game by adding mechanics present in the game and the executions look really creepy and horrific in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the auditory department, it was average. OST and ED were decent but the OP is terrible and irritating.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion you have an average anime that could have been better if handled with more care and it lasted longer. It is exactly like the first dish you cook in your life. It is not that bad but you could have done it better if you avoided some beginner traps and mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.58/10\\n\\n\r\nAlternative recommendations:\\n\r\n-Mirai Nikki: Same mistakes but with less good visuals and better music.\\n\r\n-Death Parade: Instead of a battle royale, it has games where you risk your life and whoever loses will \"die\". Fate of the losers and winners is decided by a third person known as an arbiter. Great audiovisual experience although it falters a bit in the story and characters aspect in a similar manner as Danganronpa did.",
