            "content": "Only rarely does a series break the mold its genre has cast for it and even more uncommonly does it set itself apart from all others.  Such is the case with Kimi ni Todake.  It takes all the classic shoujo romance stereotypes and plot devices and flips them on its head leaving us with a thoroughly rewarding and groundbreaking romance.\r\nAt first, Kimi ni Todake drew me in before I saw its first frame of film with its story concept.  Our heroine is Sawako, a sweet and gentle girl with an awkward personality and an uncanny resemblance to Sadako from The Ring.Desperately wanting others to understand her she is instead shunned and feared by her classmates.  This all changes when she meets a boy named Kazehaya who is the first to truly see her and slowly she begins to draw herself out of her shell.  The remaining story is one of self discovery as Sawako experiences the first feelings of love and friendship she has ever felt.  While her situation is a bit contrived and not overly realistic, the way it is presented is so wonderfully sweet and beautiful that it is impossible not to love.\\n\\n\r\nI firmly believe that in order to really fully appreciate just how special Kimi ni Todake is, you have to already be a veteran of at least a dozen or more of its shoujo peers.  There are none of the usual tired clich\u00e9s.  Sawako isn\u2019t the plain and perky heroine determined to get a man to fall for her who ignores her or treats her horribly.  She isn\u2019t out for revenge nor is she being pursued by a harem of bishounens with a desperate struggle to choose between them.   Kazehaya isn\u2019t a dick, for lack of a better term.  He\u2019s a guy who will be loved by viewers not because he\u2019s hot, but because he\u2019s just a really nice guy any girl would want to fall in love with and guys would want as a friend.\\n\\n\r\nThe feelings and situations presented to us are real and powerful but not in an overly dramatic way.  Nobody has torturous family lives or tragic pasts or other situations that always feel forced in a way to create drama that could be better achieved with fantastic characters and storytelling.  The concepts are simple, the pacing slow, and full of the required blushes and aw shucks moments.  Much like its soft artwork and color palette, Kimi ni Todake is the kind of show you will sit back and relax too, forgetting about all the problems of your day.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that it doesn\u2019t have its faults.  While just about every aspect of the series was wonderful to behold, the series already slow pace comes to an even greater crawl over the last 8-10 episodes.  While I still enjoyed them immensely, I suspect some viewers will likely begin to lose patience at the lack of progress or action in the story.  And while perhaps we are also being setup for a continuation at some point, since the manga is still ongoing, the ending was also not particularly ideal.\\n\\n\r\nSawako herself goes down as one of my all-time favorite characters.  She is so completely earnest and innocent that she is impossible not to love.  While her character concept is initially not all that unique she becomes so much more than just a socially awkward, shy, and moe girl.  Everyone can find something to relate with her over and from a character development standpoint, the person she becomes by the end of the series is so remarkably different from her beginning that it\u2019s truly amazing.  Yet despite this enormous change she never deep down changes from what she really is at her core.  Her closing monologue at the end of the show is a prime example of just how much she has grown.\\n\\n\r\nKazehaya is a rare breed for a romance series.  First he is the one and only love interest.  No reverse harems of bishies here to waste story time or antagonize the heroine.  He is also unique in that outside series such as Kanon or Clannad, he is one of the only leads that looks and feels like a real person.  He is never made out to be a caricature of the fantasies and dreams of young girls.  He is not super wealthy, nor is he a famous athlete, or come from a notorious family.  Sure he is really good looking, popular with the girls and the guys, and good at baseball but you never feel like these are things that he didn\u2019t earn with his own merits.  Unlike most of his anime contemporaries who have abrasive or aloof personalities but are still enormously popular because well they are supposed to be.  They\u2019re perfect men after all!  His personality is the kind that draws people to him and his popularity is not just because he\u2019s handsome.   People like him because he's nice to them.  What a novel idea!\\n\\n\r\nWhile on the surface, Kazehaya and Sawako seem to be completely different people, deep down they both share the same confusing emotions and fears about the feelings each has for the other.  The interaction between the two is truly special and lovely.  Amazingly I never really lost my patience with them either or yell at the screen, \u201cOh come on just kiss her already!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nKimi\u2019s supporting cast is also quite remarkable.  This is nowhere more evident than with Sawako\u2019s new best friends, Ayane and Chizu.   From the start of the story you never would have though these girls would have become her friends.  They had almost written on their faces \u201cvillainess\u201d and it was such a pleasant surprise to see these two develop into perhaps the best shoujo best friends I have seen yet.  They are so completely different from one another that it is a bit surprising they are friends.  Ayane is the beautiful, fashionable temptress, while Chizu is the butch and athletic type.  Their reactions to Sawako kind of mirror the way the audience will perceive her.  There bonds grow stronger as they experience things together, and overcome some adversity.  They were truly a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters come and go but are no less impactful to the story.  The only real rival, Kurumi, who appears in the middle portions of the story never, outstays her welcome and while she would technically serve as the series villainess, she never really feels to me like a villain.   Shockingly Sawako\u2019s family life is also quite normal, she neither has a tragic home situation or a perverted father, and they are both loving and normal parents (both to her and to each other). \\n\\n\r\nArtistically Kimi really shines.  Its soft colors and artwork just match the beauty and sweetness in the story perfectly.  It does a good job of mixing in comedic art along with its beautiful scenery to make every episode visually appealing and smile inducing.  This is even more brought out with the spectacular musical score and cast.  Mamiko Noto seems to have been born to play this role.  It\u2019s a typical character type for her, one that we have heard from her many times, but this will be one that fans will remember for years and years to come.  I can\u2019t say enough about the OP theme, I was instantly in love with from the first chorus and its animation is tremendous.  I also found the ED to be equally perfect, though I suspect Chara\u2019s gravelly voice to be unappealing to some.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kimi ni Todake is easily a top 5 series for me and one of the best shows of the decade.  It was immediately appealing to me from the first episode and I am extremely sad to see it end.  This is how more romance shows should be done and is not to be missed by anyone who likes the genre in even the slightest bit.  It really doesn\u2019t get much better than this one.\\n",

            "content": "How do you recognize that you\u2019ve watched a great show? Do you wake up the next morning and think about it the whole day? Do you talk to people full enthusiasm and passion about the show? Or did you just get that feeling that makes your heart ache and feel all good and warm inside? Kimi ni Todoke manages to do all this.\r\nKimi ni Todoke starts off as an anime that could make you wonder if you\u2019re actually watching said series. The very first scene is practically a half-horror scene attempted by the animators to make you understand in a snap what kind of personthe main character is. Kuronuma Sawako: a girl who looks a bit gloomy and scares away most of the people she\u2019s nearby to. The reason because of that is a simple one: she\u2019s very easily misunderstood. The tone of her voice sounds like a ghost that waited a thousand years in a closet and finally sees someone to scare away. Sawako may not have waited a thousand years but she does scare away people with her awkward attempt to greet someone, which earned her the nickname ''Sadako'' (the ghost from the movie ''The Ring''). \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s natural that any person watching until now will get a feeling of sympathy. We see and hear things that play in Sawako\u2019s mind, and in Sawako\u2019s mind only. She doesn\u2019t mean to scare anyone away. She doesn\u2019t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. Even her life motto (''A good deed a day'') sounds like it\u2019s something made up by a loving person who likes to help. This is by far the biggest message the story is trying to convey: no matter how good your intentions are deep inside, if it\u2019s not coming out in the proper way, nobody will see it on the outside. Sawako is struggling with this harsh truth that tackles her every single day. She has no real friends, feels very lonely at times and has a hard time understanding social situations not knowing how to react. It all feels very sad for Sawako and she is just trying to fit in and help people. But she can\u2019t because of her way of conveying a message to another person; she hasn\u2019t learned to do that properly.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a second message this anime tries to portray, it has to be the message of hope. Because even for Sawako, light in the dark tunnel of social situations can be seen. You could say that Sawako actually is a clean slate of life that hasn\u2019t been written on. The good things and the bad. Because that slate is almost empty, she\u2019s never learned to interact, to recognize backstabbers and to clear up a misunderstanding. But also, she\u2019s never learned to talk behind someone\u2019s back, to steal anything or even to spread rumors. \\n\r\nSawako is unique. An empty book that can be written in with all the things that life teaches us. That is one of the most brilliant ways to begin a story about an individual that grows up and steadily learns new things.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s actually unusual to write so much about a character in a show, even if it\u2019s one of the most complex main characters. The story and the thought behind the story is what should be elaborately written about. But here, the character IS actually the story. Of course it\u2019s possible to name all the events that happened in the show and write a bunch of thoughts about that. The truth is however that the story itself is very thin. And the best thing about that: it does not matter at all. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to my next point. To understand why the story doesn\u2019t matter, we have to look at the pacing of the show. Most stories tend to start off with a bang. Then there are some small events that explain all the things about that big happening and move the story forward. Then there is another peak in the story and the cycle repeats itself.\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is nothing like that. You must realize that the pacing is extremely slow in this show. But the joke is that you must ask yourself the question if it matters to you. The story is about Sawako experiencing all the things in life that almost anyone can relate to. From your first classmate ever sitting next to you, to your first love in high school. It\u2019s that emotional ride that makes this anime so darn special. And the pacing has a very, very important role in delivering those emotions. Basically, it actually makes it possible to notice all the small talk that the characters are having, the fun moments that they\u2019re experiencing, the flowing rivers of sadness that are shown and even the growing love between characters. And most importantly: it\u2019s possible to notice Sawako coming out of her shell. It\u2019s because the pacing is that slow, you can notice and appreciate those things that come by in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, it\u2019s really crucial that you watch this show with an open mind without prejudices. Keep in mind that this is a ''shoujo''. This means that it\u2019s a story with the point of view of a girl and most likely with some ''girly'' elements. But if you manage to overcome these things (or are a girl yourself), Kimi ni Todoke is a breath of fresh air to watch. While the animation may not be the greatest you will ever see, the art is amazing. It\u2019s one of those anime which captures the feel of the manga almost perfectly. The scenery is beautiful and everything has this ''fresh'' feel, as if you\u2019re diving in a nice cold bath after sweating.\\n\r\nMost of the time in animated shows, either the characters are well drawn or the backgrounds are. Kimi ni Todoke does both well with maybe the backgrounds being a tiny bit better drawn than the characters. Cute bubbles and sparkles pop up randomly in many scenes but actually fit very snuggly in the story strangely enough. And the people who composed the musical score deserve applause. The music captures those emotions portrayed beautifully and manages to play as a nice ear massage if listened to.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s too bad that Kimi ni Todoke has one of the most banal summaries you will ever see. Ever. Anyone who decides to watch an anime based on the summary he or she has read will most likely miss this gem of a show. If one day someone will invent a way to include snippets of emotions in a summary, Kimi ni Todoke will stand at the top of the charts and that inventor will hopefully be rich and famous. It\u2019s also too bad that the anime is over. The manga is still going strong so there is hope for a second season; there are literally many who are begging for one. It\u2019s not possible to fully share in words what this anime makes so special, it\u2019s an experience you\u2019ll have to call your own. And because you can relate to almost anyone in the show, it will give you that honest feeling. That feeling which makes you believe that life has more in store, that you CAN move forward and change things. Sawako manages to do it, and so does everyone.",

            "content": "This anime left a bad taste in my mouth. Before watching I read some of the previous reviews and was spurred to watch it after many comments stating how original it was. It's not. There are certain aspects of the anime that differ from the usual but really it was just another shy girl meets popular boy type of anime.\r\nThe first few episodes were definitely enjoyable, the back story to why Sawako is an outcast is different and interesting and so is how she begins to make friends. Unfortunately after about episode 6 or 7 you are wasting your time. This anime should have beenshorter as it moves at an incredible slow pace. Honestly it began to become a mission to sit through another episode. Not only were the episodes repetitive (never has a character cried so much before this) but you can pretty much guess what is going to happen in each episode after the first minute. Unfortunately there is no great ending to uplift the series, it just sort of flattens out part way through and never gets any momentum back.\\n\\n\r\nI think was really annoyed me the most is the lack of development with the characters. There were so many beginnings of side stories and other love interests in this anime that never really developed. At least these could have livened up the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nA few good things about this anime were the art, I thoroughly enjoyed the almost water colour style. The opening track is lovely to listen to as well and suits the anime perfectly. Kazehaya was actually quite a good character and was probably the most original out of all of them with his glass half full attitude that never wavered. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I am giving this a 5/10 as although the first half was enjoyable the second half nearly put me into a coma.",

I got hooked up since episode one because this Anime looks like it's real, and by real, I mean no swords, magics, etc. It portrays love and friendship as you can see these elements in every episodes. Also, I love where this Anime is going. It might get cheesy sometimes, but they did it so well, that you have no choice but to go with the flow and be affectionate.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nThe Art/Animation was outstanding. I loved everything. It was welldrawn/animated. Every detail and objects stood up, even the surroundings, and the characters. Also, adding a chibi form of every characters made it more enjoyable. You can't help it but laugh after seeing their chibi forms.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was perfect. I loved the OP/ ED songs. It fits perfectly with the Anime. Also, everytime something happens, the background music/sound always fits into it, and because of that, it emphasizes the event even more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYou can't help it but love our main girl, Sawako, and others. There's nothing to hate. Everyone has their own emotions, characteristics, which made everyone unique and be part of the Anime. They also give spotlight to Supporting Characters, which is good, in my opinion. They don't focus on 2 characters, but everyone, which is great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI was really entertained while watching this. I didn't get bored at all. This Anime is one of the Anime that I've seen that made a good job combining the elements (Comedy, Drama, and Romance). They didn't fail in doing that. You can find those elements in each episode. Some episodes are really relaxing, which can make you smile or laugh the entire time, while some episodes are really touching that you can't help it but eith cry or be teary.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this Anime to everyone. Guys, don't be scared to watch this. I'm a guy and I find this Anime incredible. I'm 100% straight, don't worry. I've only seen 8 episodes but I can tell that it's going to be awesome from beginning to end. It's a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this is my first review, so please bear with my mistakes. :3",

            "content": "I couldn't help but share my thoughts on this wonderful show with others =)\r\nAt first glance, it may seem like a typical shoujo, boy-meets-girl kind of series.  That's what I thought when I first read the synopsis, so I was kind of reluctant to watch it.  But now...am I glad I did!\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nWhile not the most exciting or original plot line, it's simplicity charms me.  It has a rather slow flow, but it doesn't bore, rather it helps emphasize the special moments that Sawako experiences in her school life.  The process of growing up, feeling love for the first time, makingfriends, and even enemies are all so amazingly portrayed through this show.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, I've never liked a female lead this much before.  Sawako is just too cute.  She's innocent to the point of being humorous, but she's not stupid or weak.  Quite the contrary actually (I was pleasantly surprised by how she interacted with Kurumi).  She's always being positive, always trying to help others, and always being true to herself.  You can't help but be moved by her.  For the male lead, you've got the 100% refreshing Kazehaya who is actually not your typical male lead.  At first glance, he's Mr.Perfect who everyone admires, but after a while you learn that he's just like any other guy.  He gets flustered, nervous, angry and embarrassed like all of us do. And in my opinion, that just makes him more endearingly cute and charming.  \\n\r\nAlso, this show's supporting characters are some of the best I've seen in shoujo anime! They really define the true meaning of friendship :)  Heck, even the antagonist is pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork might not be considered the best out there, but it does the story justice (and then some).  It's bright, simple and cute.  There were certain times when I would think \"wow, the colours look amazing here\" (you gotta pay attention to sunset scenes!). They also did a good job with the characters, I think they purposely made them look plain so that it helps contrast times when they stand out (like when Sawako smiles!). So overall, they did a lovely job. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the opening song and I think it fits the series perfectly.  Can't say much about the background music though because I haven't paid much attention to it...too busy enjoying the dialogue =)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI wish I can give this a higher rating than 10.  I was pretty much smiling like an idiot throughout the first few episodes.  The interaction between Sawako and Kazehaya are too cute for words, I felt much warm and fuzzy feelings when watching them. It makes me wish I could go back in time to experience high school romance like they did.  But then again...who can find someone like Kazehaya.  \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, this show has really grown on me.  I will definitely keep watching and rooting for Sawako.  If this review or the ratings hasn't helped convince you to watch it, please seriously reconsider.  Don't pass this up!\\n\\n",

            "content": "The holidays had just begun when I chose to crack open this anime, the summary sounding cute enough and the reviews close to overflowing with greatness and I was looking into the fall anime which I had neglected.\r\nBut little did I expect to be sorely disappointed.\r\nStory:\r\nThis anime isn't terrible persay, though I would say that it has been greatly overestimated. The story is unrelatable and unrealistic and I don't mean this in the \"GIANT MECHA AND SPARKLY COLOURS\" way, but in the \"There is no way this could be seen as a real life situation, it's just so silly\" way.\r\nNow, a quick overview of thestory's good parts. Ahem.....uh....err.....oh yeah, THIS ANIME DOESN'T HAVE A STORY! Girl meets boy, girl is stupid, boy is also stupid, girls life changes for the better, maybe throw a rival in there. The end. This is hardly a story and I've been far to generous with my rating.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is decent, it's nothing spectacular though, the style has been used a hundred times before; more effectively and even in a way that would make the anime seem to have a little more depth, but it would appear this anime didn't really try, relying alot on still frames rather than trying something different or even having consistent movement.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWell, I won't complain, it has a fair opening and ending theme and they include basic intrumental and background noises that are a staple for any anime but, again, it would appear that this anime hasn't even tried at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are flat in terms of personality, though they do provide some sorely need comic relief at times, particularly the women the main character adopts as her friends and their homeroom teacher, but everyone else is just placid. The love interest is nice enough though the girl does nothing but angst then smile, angst then smile, etc. and becomes one of those people that makes you want to punch a wall because she's so ignorant; even if you were completely isolated from people, you don't lose common sense as a result, either that or she suffers from severe brain damage, though that isn't covered in the anime so I'll just resign myself to believing that she's just stupid.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really can't say much, I wasn't necessarily suffering, but alot of the time I found myself banging my head against my desk because every decision made by the characters were so stupid, obvious and often dragged out with scenes of the main character blushing while giving dialogue that's been heard hundreds of times by her before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI understand that this anime has earnt many fans and I can understand this, I enjoy seeing some clumsy shoujo anime every now and again, because clumsy is cute and even heartwarming, but this anime has been given far too much credit when there are anime out there with far more innovative stories, characters, art, etc.\\n\\n\r\nBy all means watch it, but don't take it seriously, it's just a \"something to do\" anime.",

            "content": "Tales of romance never fail to tug at our heartstrings and entrance our species with a commanding power. Witnessing the innocuous meeting of two unsuspecting individuals struck by an incomprehensible tempest, finding themselves in a whirlwind of chaos and feeling, just piques our imaginative fancies. Thus,  Love and all its related counterparts feel universal and evident in stories unfazed by time or land. It\u2019s the one subject that transcends language barriers into a collective realm of human dreams. Why? It\u2019s simply the unequivocal remedy to longing, to despair, to emptiness; a cure for an incurable illness. It fills voids that can\u2019t be explained. Asfantastical and idealistic as this outlined notion of love is there has to be some hint of truth in it, as what else can explain this obsession with love and its inherent reflection in almost every facet of Art and story-telling (which echoes the deepest, most visceral part of human creation).\\n\\n\r\nOne form of this universally-binding phenomenon is brought forth in the series Kimi ni Todoke, adapted from the manga by Karuho Shiina. Within the medium, there are only a few other titles that can create a truly pure romance as the one portrayed in Kimi ni Todoke. Yes, it falls within the shoujo realm, which would imply a certain degree of fantasy (if not entirely) romances, naivety, and even immaturity. Kimi ni Todoke has all of this and probably to an uncomfortable degree for some viewers, but as with any tale of romance, it requires a willingness to believe; the rest is up to the work \u2013 whether to protect that faith or smash it, and Kimi ni Todoke falls gracefully within the former camp.\\n\\n\r\nThe 25 episode series follows a misunderstood, isolated high school girl Kuronama Sawako who due to her somewhat gloomy appearance and aloof nature has been branded as \u201cSadako\u201d \u2013 the creepy ghost girl from the Japanese horror film Ringu \u2013 and her transformative journey through finding love, friendship, and herself. Along with Sawako\u2019s love interest Kazehaya Shota and an entirely beguiling cast, Kimi ni Todoke excels in almost every single element of its ambitions and of its genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple and relishes in its simplicity. There are no contrived melodramatic shticks , or unnecessary drama to test one\u2019s patience, or any other kind of forced devices creators use to plod the plot along. This series has a focus and sticks to it. This doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not slow however. The pacing is relaxed; giving time to the characters to fully explore the situations, themselves, and each other. Many have complained about the gradual nature of its progression, but it\u2019s undoubtedly one of its strength.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, there are many kinds of implicit love envisioned in this series \u2013 love of friends, romantic love, and love of self. The process that one goes through \u2013 from recognizing the existence of these feelings to actually feeling them to acknowledging them and finally acting on them \u2013 isn\u2019t a quantifiable ordeal; but it can probably be inferred that such a definitive undertaking is gradual. This is why Kimi ni Todoke truly shines: its able to understand that process whether it\u2019s in relation to loving somebody or loving themselves and realizing, that it takes time, especially first loves \u2013 a completely foreign territory for all. A worthy love story will try and present its notion of love as complete as possible, and the show definitely develops that with great care. This is evident through how much the of the content is focused on reveling in each and every step/phase that the characters go through. This not only refines the holistic love story, but also the characters; transforming them into vivid, dynamic personalities with purpose and charisma.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the strongest point of the series. The coupling of awkward girl with popular boy is overtly clich\u00e9d at this point, but it all becomes irrelevant in Kimi ni Todoke, because of how carefully it manages to add dimension to each trait; keeping the characters genuine to their core and albeit archetypical of the genre, giving them the ability to step beyond the clich\u00e9s attached to them. The main characters \u2013 Sawako and Kazehaya \u2013 deliver this wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nSawako is breath of fresh air amongst the littered trash of static shoujo protagonists. Having been alone most of her life, she is completely unaware of what social activities are and oblivious to the meaning of friends or boyfriends. Yet, the work doesn\u2019t go for the angst-y, edgy teen-in-purgatory approach demanding pity and remorse. Rather, the series takes a much more light-hearted tone and creates one of the best shoujo heroines I\u2019ve encountered. Sawako\u2019s demure nature, unfiltered innocence and naivety, and fundamental goodness just radiates throughout, despite her initial appearance and reception.  Best of all, she isn\u2019t depicted as an idiotic, weak individual who can\u2019t stand up for herself or what she wants. She is perfectly balanced which keeps her grounded, but also extremely lovable. Of course, some of her traits are exaggerated, but it does not detract from her character at all. I also have to applaud at how nuanced her development is even though the show narrates her every thought explicitly. It\u2019s like reading a diary, and then finding yourself at the end of it, unknowingly standing with the same person.\\n\\n\r\nKazehaya is sublime. Following suit of the popular, cute, nice boy but stepping away from the trope to be something more. Kazehaya\u2019s character is examined as deeply as Sawako, even though it\u2019s often through Sawako. There is a definite reliability in her narration since a complete picture of Kazehaya is formed as a product. Like Sawako, Kazehaya is genuinely a good person. His kindness is infectious and it is through that kindness that he brings Sawako out of her isolation. Yet, he isn\u2019t perfect and he isn\u2019t detached from the narrative, existing only to be a fantasy achievement for the girl; instead he exists in her world, with her, with all of his feelings, vulnerabilities, and flaws laid right out in plain sight. Essentially, he feels as real as Sawako.\\n\\n\r\nBoth characters find themselves at the same crossroad trying to comprehend and deliver their feelings. It\u2019s a pleasure to see how these characters overcome their internal turbulences, and grow. I cannot stress how happy I was to NOT see any trite misunderstandings or random trust issues. The show definitely has its share of drama, but it\u2019s well-conceived and integrated smoothly into the progression without being imposing which is partly why development of these characters seems so effective. As much as this is a tale of love, it\u2019s equally focused on growth and the latter is illuminated at every turn.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are also well done. Everyone has their own distinctive traits, issues, weaknesses and the show does a great job managing them while giving them some room to be people beyond \u201cthe friends\u201d or devices for the main characters. I came to love Ayano, Chizu, and Ryu as much as Sawako and Kazehaya, because of how finely the work asserted their importance \u2013 as individuals. Having a dynamic cast means more possibilities. One possibility is being able to keep the consistency throughout the series without compromising quality. Often times, romantic comedies feel like two separate things, rather than a cohesive narrating intertwining both. The comedy in the show is fantastic and befitting. It\u2019s not added to act as filler or to make up for awkward static characters who exist solely to be comedic reliefs.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to bring this sweet tale together is the art, tone, and music. The tone is always light, yet manages to convey the more serious situations with equal impact. This is mostly attributed to the art style and color scheme. A pure pastel palette is used; softened colors that keep the atmosphere consistently warm and inviting. The frames are often inked with white, garnered with flower stamps and filled with dreamy bubbles, allowing the fantastical spirit of romance to blossom endlessly. The sugary, wistful art and animation perfectly accompanies the tone and nature of the series. Yet it wouldn\u2019t be complete without melody and song. The music in this series is also quite pleasant. Comprised of upbeat vocals, soft piano, gentle choruses, and simple music-box-ish tunes, the entire soundtrack supplements the show very well. Overall, all of these elements tie seamlessly together to elevate the series into the spotlight it so rightfully deserves.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is and should be the quintessential love story within the medium. It is the idyllic feel-good work that proudly shows why tales of romance will never fail to tug at our heartstrings. Storytellers will continue to tell age-old stories written with some cosmic force that involuntarily rev our own hearts. It\u2019s through these variations of love, can we vicariously experience it too (or at least dream). To feel the stars fall down from the skies in to our eyes and color the world with a rosy tint, oh what a feeling it must be!  And that is indeed the type of unadulterated love you will see, feel, and experience with Sawako and Kazehaya as they walk under the star-crusted skies in Kimi ni Todoke.\\n",

            "content": "Quickly: I've watched 47 anime shows and this is the second that I am writing a review for. I really just got into this and I hope my review is helpful to you. \r\n~Story~ 10/10 \r\n          I hate complex storylines. I will watch shows like that but very rarely, and only if it has enough promise. Kimi Ni Todoke was my absolute favourite anime because they kept it real and they kept it simple. I was giggling at cute moments between the couple of Kazehaya and Sawako and rolling over laughing at funny moments. I crieda bit at some parts (I'm so emotional T.T) but only because the story had me so caught in it. I loved how they made a big deal of little things and how they were all encouraging to one another. Even Sawako's rival, Kurumi(zawa) encouraged her at the end. A girl who went from feared and thought as creepy went to loved with many friends and an outstandingly caring boyfriend. It deserves a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 7/10.\\n\\n\r\n          For backgrounds, they kept things real. For the inside of the school it wasn't marble white. It looked like I could reach out, feel my computer screen and I would feel the texture of the wall or the window. The same can't be said for the characters. I love the way they drew them and the cute way they drew them when they were joking around and it was a light-hearted moment. At times I felt they were lacking in effort slightly. Be it for the shape of their mouths or their hands. (Or maybe that was just me too used to the perfect animation of today with shimmering eyes and perfect hair.) Here they kept it real and no unnecessary features were added. \\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ 8/10\\n\\n\r\n              Honestly? I was humming the opening song for weeks after I finished the show. I loved it. Background music? Perfect. Just at times I felt they repeated parts of the music and I didn't like it there. I know it takes a lot of time and effort to put together those pieces but even so. The show deserved better. Other then that it was fabulous!\\n\\n\r\n~Character~ 10/10\\n\\n\r\n          In many shows today, the main characters are snotty and have egos. As I said, I hate complex storylines and characters who they could really do without. I'm glad that Sawako and Kazehaya weren't like that. Sawako was kind and considerate all the way through. She was self conscious and reminded me a lot of myself. Kazehaya (let's be honest here) I fell head over heels for. He was so kind to Sawako and did EXACTLY what I would want a guy to do for me in situations for Sawako. He was protective and even a bit jealous near the end. Kurumi(zawa) was a perfect rival because she wasn't snotty, she was cunning. She had her ways and although she was selfish in the start, she really grew on you at the end. She was determined and took the competition fairly afterwards. When she couldn't compete anymore, she let her rival, Sawako take the lead and helped her. I felt that near the end, Sawako and Kurumi(zawa) were like sisters. They supported one another and I loved that because Sawako would ask Kurumi for advice and vice versa. Sawako's friends were also so supportive. They always backed away and let love blossom on it's own between Kazehaya and Sawako. They pushed them together at times but they meant well and it turned out well. I found myself thinking at times how much I wanted to be Sawako because she really had it all. \\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 10/10\\n\\n\r\n          I love side characters. Be it their teacher Pin or Sawako's parents. They also grew on me and I adored them for that. The story was beautiful and I enjoyed it. Chances are high that in a few years I will forget about this show. Only to rewatch it and fall in love all over again. \\n\\n\r\n~Overall~ 9/10. \\n\\n\r\n          Mathematically, there's 5 categories and out of fifty. It scored a 45 meaning 90% and 9/10. By my heart, it deserves a 10/10 but a 9 is just as fair. If you love romance, comedy and a simple yet pleasing storyline, I recommend Kimi Ni Todoke to you. Be sure to watch the second season!",

It's very funny, very cute and you just fall in love with all the characters in it. Especially Sawako.\r\nThe characters in the anime look just like they do in the manga, and I know the art might not be everyones cup of tea, but it is VERY similar to the mangakas style, wich I think is great. Backgrounds instuff are really deatailed and beautiful too!\\n\r\nI love the opening and ending themes and I think the voices suit the characters really well so I give it a 10 for sound!\\n\r\nI'm more of a manga lover, but I must say this anime gets an overall 10 from me!",

            "content": "After reading some positive reviews on the internet, I decided to watch Kimi ni Todoke, thinking that the storyline may be similar to Nadeshiko Shichi Henge, which is very fun and entertaining. However, after watching the first episode I was disappointed by the fact that Kimi ni Todoke holds totally different story than Nadeshiko Shichi Henge. For a moment I thought that it was way too girly for me to watch (of course, it's a shoujo but some shoujo really does attract male audience these days), and the animation looks a bit uncommon (not the characters ,but the colorful painted background which seems surreal atfirst).\\n\\n\r\nSo, despite the fact that I am not suited for this anime, I continued to the 2nd and 3rd episode anyway out of curiosity on what this anime had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd before I realized it, I couldn't bring myself to stop watching this anime...!\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke really changed my view on shoujo romance. \\n\\n\r\nThe heroine, Kuronuma Sawako is the most kind-hearted,  soft-mannered heroine you'll ever see in the entire anime universe. Not because she is stunningly beautiful, not because she is wealthy, not because she is very popular in school either. The fact is, she is an ordinary high school girl who lives in a very normal environment.\\n\r\nWhat makes her special is her personality. She is the type that would never wish for someone else's misery. Being a hard-working student, family-loving daughter, and caring friend, none of us would dislike her. Her true happiness is to be useful to her friends and family. Even her motto is \"Do a good deed everyday\". Despite that, she is not a typical weak kind of girl you usually see in another shoujo anime. At times she can stand for herself without depending on anyone. And she will never, ever tell a lie even if it's to save her own skin. She will cheer her friends at times of need, and will cry for someone else's sadness.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, our male main character is Kazehaya Shouta, the most popular guy in school. He is very lively and willing to talk to anyone, though deep inside he is quite soft, shy, and hard to understand. From the outside, he may looks very cheerful and happy, but even himself has his own weaknesses and flaws which is very normal for a human to have.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no one in this anime which is too perfect or too evil by all means. They're all normal humans,  each with their own flaws and emotions, which is interesting because it often allows us to reflect ourselves in them.\\n\\n\r\nFor the story, contrary to what most people say about this anime, It is NOT a typical shoujo romance story about popular guy who falls for the unpopular heroine at first sight. Yes, those elements do appear inside this anime, but in totally different pace. Unlike other fairy-tale like stories, Kimi ni Todoke is not in a rush. It seems rather slow, but it isn't. When you start to think that an episode seems too slow (some people states that the winter episodes seems rather mellow, just like what a winter should be), try to review what has happened in that episode. You will realize that there's already much information flowing through your head without you realizing it.\\n\\n\r\nYes, Kimi ni Todoke isn't as typical and slow as they say. \\n\r\nIts seems as it is saying to us, \"Love is not a rush. Just take it slow and enjoy the bitter-sweet moments of love\".",

            "content": "The romance genre is one of my favourites of this medium. Even though it's hard to come up with an original story or setting in this genre, I find it is the one of, if not the best way to explore characters, their relationships, and get some decent development out of them. Kimi ni Todoke is no exception, for the most part anyways.\r\nTo pay homage to the innocence and optimism this show radiates, I'll get the most and pretty much only big negative I have out of the way first. The last little bit of the second arc focusing on \"the main antagonist\" (AKA secondarylove interest that has no chance in hell) was very jarring. They tried to justify this characters extremely mean-spirited and plentiful actions to no real effect. To have a character that tries to cause so much damage only to try and justify it all feels pointless. Also, Sawako's (the MC) innocence at the climax of this arc was too much for me to handle. It makes sense in the context of her character, but I felt they blew it a little out of proportion.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there isn't much negative to say about Kimi ni Todoke. It used the right amount of drama to create some interesting character interactions and character development, but never to the point where it feels melodramatic. \\n\\n\r\nThat's the best part of Kimi ni Todoke as a whole really. Nothing ever outstays it's welcome. It gets it's point across in a timely and effective fashion, and then moves away so that the next big point has it's time to shine. This keeps everything fresh. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I will say about the story is the love triangles. While I normally don't like love triangles in romance anime (which is sad for me since most anime have them), this show handles it almost perfectly. This because of two things. First off, it goes off the thing I said earlier in that it doesn't outstay it's welcome. Secondly, the love triangles never include  3 main characters. It is always 2 mains and 1 supporting. With these things in place, the love triangles add to the drama quite nicely, and then they fade away after that arc they are in is finished. \\n\\n\r\nBut of course, none of these things matter if you don't have good characters and good bonds between said characters, which is especially important for romance anime. Kimi ni Todoke delivers this, with all the main characters being very likeable and not distinctly falling into archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nKuronuma Sawako is a very good lead (except for the part I mentioned earlier). Her optimism and positive attitude to almost everything makes it hard not to like her, and her development early on was very well done. Whenever she's happy or tries to make others happy, you can't help but be happy for her. Also, her relationship with the main love interest, Kazehaya Shouta, was handled well. Each had something to gain from their relationship. It just felt very balanced, as one never outshadowed the other.\\n\r\nAlso, she's like the cutest thing ever. \\n\\n\r\nThe secondary romance between Sanada Ryu and Yoshida Chizu was great as well. The anime spent a decent chunk of episodes developing them, making their relationship a lot more 3-dimensional than most secondary romances. The two characters by themselves were nice too. Chizu brought a great energy to every scene she was in, and Ryu's honest and \"lazy\" take on everything was a breath of fresh air. Their contrasting personalities is what made them stand up to the primary romance in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we Ayane Yano. Although we didn't get a proper arc with her this season, she was no less of a presence throughout the entire show. She brought a lot with her perceptive eye. She is always the character that knows what's actually going on, and does her best to help her friends get to the desired conclusion.  When her and Chizu got introduced in the first episode, you get the feeling that they are going to be a thorn in Sawako's side, but I was pleasantly surprised when they both turned out to be amazing friends and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are no less interesting. Pin brings a lot to the comedy, and Kurumizawa is a character you love to hate. I also really like how Ryuu's older brother looks like a delinquent, but is actually a very nice guy. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, this show looks extremely shoujo, which is not a bad thing. It looks very nice, it's easy to look at, and it fits the overall tone of the show well. The animation is fairly limited, but you come to expect that with these types of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis soundtrack stood out to me far more than most in the genre do. It fits the tone well, and it's something I feel I could listen to outside of the show. There is just this nice calm feel to a lot of the soundtrack, and the one track that is played in the dramatically intensified parts of the show is brilliant. The OP was also fantastic. The ED slightly less so.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Kimi ni Todoke doesn't really break the mold of it's genre, it elevates what it is given a great deal. Each arc tackled something different, which made it easy to just keep watching without stopping. Save for the last bit of the second arc, I thoroughly enjoyed all of Kimi ni Todoke. It has what I like in a shoujo romance anime. A great main lead and romance, heartfelt dramatic moments, comedy that doesn't feel out of place, and most of all, extremely cheesy and cute moments that you can't help but go \"awww!\" every time one of them pops up. I highly recommend Kimi ni Todoke to any fans of romance anime, especially if you like shoujo romance. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, so hopefully this will go over well. ^_^ I haven't seen the series in a while, so I'll try to accurately try to portray how I felt when I watched it the first time.\r\nStory:6/10\r\nIndeed, the story summary was what pulled me in. It sounded like and interesting spin on a old storyline, and it was a bit. It certainly was interesting to see the interactions of he characters of Sawako since so many were afraid of her. But when you really get down to it, this is a lot like other high school romances. Outcast girl likes most popular guy,they get close, and fall in love. And of course, there's high school drama along the way and plenty of morals and such. This definitely isn't something you haven't seen before if you've been a long time anime fan. Still, it's at least worth a look if you're interested.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime get's the highest score from me. It was certainly amazing and breathtaking in quite a few places. The artist of the anime definitely took the time to add every detail, sparkle, and breath correctly. It was really great to look at. Of course though, there were a few parts that had not so great animations. It was few and not too bad, but still there and prominent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending song was fantastic. The opening especially caught my eye. It really captured the essence of a slice of life romance. It fit perfectly. The ending was also quite good, although I didn't like it as much as the opening. That's probably more of a personal taste, so you should definitely give it a listen. Other music throughout the anime was quite good and done well, too. The opening and ending definitely stand out, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nNow here is where the anime started to go a bit downhill for me. At first I wast entranced by the characters and thought they were all great, and for some that is indeed true. Others... Not so much. This wouldn't be as bad of a problem if it wasn't the main characters who were the not so great ones. Sawako and Kazehaya didn't get very much development throughout the series; It was very, very little. Kazehaya remained pretty much the same through the whole thing, and after a while you just get kind of tired/used to it. Sawako is the biggest example though, since she is the main character you follow. She's decent I suppose, but not really main character material. She got very little if any character development. For example, even after she's had friends for a long time, she still cried her eyes out every time they did something nice for her. I believe this series would be a lot more heartwarming if you actually got to see her get used to these things; That way you could know she truly has made good friends. The side characters of Ryuu, Ayane, and Chizu on the other hand were fantastic. They did a great job with these characters, and went in a really good direction with them. I was happy with them for sure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nDuring the first half of the series, I did enjoy watching it. It was interesting, and seemed like a pretty good anime. Towards the middle though, the series slammed on the breaks. Kazehaya and Sawako went nowhere in their relationship all of a sudden, and the story just started to seem all the same. I would sometimes find myself watching the clock to see how long the rest of the episode was because I wanted it to end. That's not to say it was bad; Just decent. Taking a look back on it I realize it wasn't all that fantastic, but it is enjoyable when watching it the first time. It's gets a solid 7 from me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime is worth the watch of a few episodes if you're interested, and you can see how you feel about it from there. I would recommend it mostly to anime fans who love the slice of life romance genre, because this is the anime for you. Personally though, I just can't give this anime a score higher then seven. Hope this review helped to people who were considering watching, and thanks for reading!",

            "content": "There's a rather irksome trend in anime that I've noticed as I got older: romances are less about actual romance and are more about a so-called \"couple\" locked in a perpetual dance of will they/won't they. As much as I love the anticipation and that sweet sense of satisfaction when I see my ship finally set sail, it just feels like it amounts to nothing when the series just ends right then and there. You can only imagine my frustration when I come across a much-lauded title that I eagerly look forward to watching and then I find out that it leaves me completely andtotally blue-balled. To get a good idea of what I'm talking about, let's look at Kimi ni Todoke: a much-lauded \"romance\" that I did enjoy watching but it ended up leaving a somewhat sour taste in my mouth by the time I finished.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole plot of Kimi ni Todoke revolves around an endearing yet misunderstood introvert named Sawako Kuronoma and her growing affections for Shota Kazehaya, the most popular guy in class who has a crush on her but can't bring himself to spit it out. Along the way, we're accompanied by their three friends: Yano (a smart girl who wears too much make-up), Chizuru (a slightly dim jock with a heart of gold), and Ryu (a jock with short-term memory loss who's also Chizuru's childhood friend). As far as characters are concerned, Kimi ni Todoke has it down-pat. Everyone in our leading quintet are likeable and endearing individuals and I can safely say that most of them change and grow as individuals throughout the course of the series. MOST of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I liked Kazehaya, he was well... boring. Don't get me wrong, I really do appreciate the fact that he's the complete antithesis of Naoki Irie from Itazura na Kiss and actually treats Sawako with respect. What I don't particularly care much for is the fact that throughout the entire run, I know next-to-nothing about this guy. Sure, there are some details that pop up here and there but there's almost nothing else to this guy outside of his feelings for Sawako (which to be fair, do actually seem genuine). That actually struck me as bizarre, to say the least since Kazehaya says that he's not as good a person as Sawako thinks he is in a couple of episodes (if I recall correctly). \\n\\n\r\nWhat I fail to understand is why Production I.G didn't elaborate on this apparent fault of his more. What is it about Kazehaya that makes him a flawed individual? Is it a nasty temper, a broken home, codependency problems, or what? To be fair, Kimi ni Todoke only covers around the first ~26 chapters of the manga and I'm guessing that the manga actually elaborates more on Kazehaya's flaws as an individual. I can't really recall if it actually DOES do that though since it's been a while since I last read some Kimi ni Todoke on KissManga (that's what happens when you're sidetracked by Kamisama Hajimemashita and IRL stuffs), but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nKazehaya aside, there was another problem that irked me whilst I was watching the show and that was just how slow it actually is. Don't get me wrong: I don't expect my ship to sail within the first four episodes, but the latter half of the show felt overextended to say the least. A lot of the stuff that these episodes covered could've been condensed without missing out on much of anything. There were points during those episodes where it just got kinda tedious and I was flipping back and forth between Tumblr on my phone and Crunchyroll on my laptop. For the record, if I actually get bored enough to the point where I take out my phone and start perusing through Facebook or Tumblr or whatever, your show done fucked up BIG TIME.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's the ending that just made me furrow my brow in annoyance. KnT reached a fair enough conclusion, don't get me wrong. At the same time, it just left me completely and totally blue-balled in that by the time the show actually went somewhere with the romance, it just ended. Yeah, there's a second season but the second season shouldn't have existed in the first place. All of the content that the second season covered could've easily been in this season had Production I.G decided to actually condense the latter half of the show so that these episodes could've fit into the overall story. Hindsight's a bitch, ain't it? Does this mean that everything that came before was just pointless? NO!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is that Kimi ni Todoke isn't just Sawako and Kazehaya's story. It's also Yano, Chizu, and Ryu's story as well. We had various episodes focusing on them so that we could get a better idea of who they are as individuals. Not only that, but we had various \"arcs\" that focused on these people and some challenges that they needed to overcome. Sure, the whole thing surrounding Sawako and Kazehaya might've been a little anticlimactic but you can count on Yano, Chizu, Ryu, Pin, and even Kazehaya's puppy to bring a smile to your face with their exploits.\\n\\n\r\nOn the aesthetic side of things, Kimi ni Todoke is very well... bubbly and sparkly. I'm pretty sure that's the most succinct way to describe it. I don't want to say that thsi is typical of shojo romances in general, but the usage of bubble and sparkle effects throughout the entire show remind me of shows like Ouran HSHC and Kamisama Hajimemashita. It looks nice, so I'm not complaining but others will because they suck so what can you do there? Backgrounds are quite lovely to look at and the character designs are pretty damn good... for the most part. My only gripe with the character designs is the fact that Sawako is drawn in chibi style way more than I'd like to see. Guys at Production I.G: Chibi Sawako is also cute, but proper human Sawako is even cuter. Let's see more of her and less of chibi Sawako please. Thank you.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, I have no complaints. The OST works for what it does, the voice-acting is quite nice (well, in Sawako's case at least), so what more could I want? Well... there is one thing I want and that would be an English dub. You see, this show is licensed by NIS America, a company that rarely dubs anything and when they do, it's not for a show that I was expecting to get dubbed. You see, whilst I was watching Kimi ni Todoke, I couldn't help but imagine what these characters would sound like if they were in English. Emily Neves would voice Sawako, David Matranga would voice Kazehaya, Crispin Freeman would voice Ryu, and so on and so forth. Enough about my own delusions though, because it's time to wrap this review up.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is definitely one of the better shojo romances out there on the market as it currently stands. Whilst it's certainly not as entertaining as the likes of say Ouran HSHC, Maid-Sama!, or Kamisama Hajimemashita, I like to imagine that Kimi ni Todoke stands alongside Fruits Basket's adaptation in that they're both really sweet and endearing shows that are just too slow for their own good. If you're in the mood for an endearing slice-of-life show featuring likeable characters, Kimi ni Todoke definitely fits the bill there and then some. However, you'd better look elsewhere if you want a compelling romance (i.e. Maison Ikkoku, Nana, Solanin) otherwise you'll be saltier than I am whenever I lose to Evilswarm. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)",

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke is a heartwarming story about a girl named Sawako navigating the awkward and uncertain path of high school and the important relationships she makes along the way. Sawako has been socially shunned by all of her classmates because they believe that she is creepy and has the ability to make contact with the supernatural. Sawako is a sweet and thoughtful girl; however her awkwardness and inability to explain situations only furthers rumors of her \"weirdness\" and provides great comedic moments. \r\nSawako's story changes dramatically when she is befriended by Kazehaya, a kind boy who sees her for who she truly is. Kazehaya'sacts of kindness completely surprise Sawako, who is used to being ignored, and it is beautiful to watch her become more comfortable with him. Sawako also becomes great friends with Ayane and Chizuru, two girls who initially use Sawako to scare people for their own amusement. However, after both girls get to know Sawako, they see her kind and helpful personality.\\n\r\nThe show is able to find a great balance between truly sad moments and the funny and fickle nature of human beings. It is a slow, easy watch with heartwarming moments and funny situations that accurately reflect first love in high school and the desire to be liked.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very enjoyable because of its characters, simple, well-paced plot and pretty artwork. I really, really, really recommend this anime and believe that it can be enjoyed and appreciated by anyone. WATCH IT NOW!! :)",

            "content": "There is such an amount of stupid in this anime it goes quite simply beyond words, so I will stick to the basics:\r\nStory:\r\nif I thought that romantic animes tend to make everything that happens to those lame drama queen teenagers a matter or life or death, Kimi ni Todoke has gone overboard. \r\nWhat story, by the way? Is this a story about autism? If it was so at least it would have a purpose and it would be promoting something serious. \r\nKeyword: Misunderstanding that could have easily been avoided and even more easily been cleared from the beginning.\r\nArt is OK, Sountrack was a bit toosimplicistic and childish but pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nShould I laught or cry? There are two characters who are savable and they are Ryu and Yano. Kazehaya is only half savable. The rest is trash.\\n\r\nSawako isn't just shy, she has problems. She has hallucinations. She lives in a weird limbo, I don't know. We've all had our problems when we were an awkard mess in middle school, some dealt with it better and some just couldn't cope with school mates, but when you finally emerge from the darkness and people come at you with outstretched hands, ready to start fresh like normal people, you don't just stick to your conviction that everyone hates you in face of all the evidence of the contrary. \\n\r\nThat only means being stubborn, and Sawako is probably 99% stubborn and 150% stupid (yes I suck at math).\\n\r\nOh, and another 50% tears, because there seems to be no end to the amount she can shed for no reason at all. And in the beginning? Was the start of a new friendship supposed to be this tragic? Who in the world has cried so much and reached such depths of despair for one single rumour and two people who are willing to give you the time of day? I mean, if that is how she goes about getting friends I'm curious to know how's the rest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNO, I haven't enjoyed myself, and Sawako wouldn't have enjoyed herself either if I'd had the chance to put my hands round her neck at some points of the story. At MANY points of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I have just seen a bunch of cliches stuffed together and pushed to the tenth power. Or maybe maybe maybe! Maybe this is actually the birth place of many of the cliches that you see in anime these days, the source of all evil. Maybe this is the reason Japanese people think that love is so much of a bothersome burden that if you're not driven by the most powerful and pure emotions you're not even qualified to try. \\n\r\nThis is what I call non-educational.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: the second season is just as useless as the first one and although it LOOKS like it provides closure, it's just another one of Sawako's pointless tiny steps toward finally becoming a normal person, and I can only pity her because if that's how she goes about things then her life will just a nerve-wrecking chain of events that she can barely deal with without crying or passing out or giving herself stress-induced gastritis.",

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke, one of the most famous shojos lately. I don't understand the cause of the high score on this, but let's go to what matters.\r\nKuronuma Sawako, a student with a sweet and adorable look... not for her classmates. She gained the nickname Sadako (from the cursed girl of the \"The Ring\" movies) thanks to the way everyone sees her, besides her antisocial style and the difficulty of making friends. Only until she mets Kazehaya (her big romance partner of the show), Ryuu (Kazehaya's friend) and her new friends, Ayane and Chizuru. They then try to show everyone the real Sawako: sweet and shy.\r\nTheart is great, the color choice is good and that makes it nice to watch. Perfect for a shojo/school comedy (the OP and ED are extremely beautiful). What to say about the sound... the voices are great and all of them fits perfectly in their respectives characters, as expected of the nice dub make it by the japanese.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters are side-shows, like Sawako, Ayane and Chizuru, the powerful trio that steals the scene. The various situations they go through are real funny, like trying to \"fix\" Sawako or even interacting with all the supporting characters, the three girls are the strong point of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a romance anime, I recommend looking for another one, but if you want a SAPPY romance anime + school comedy, you can try Kimi ni Todoke. Don't expect a single kiss here and even less an end, since Kimi ni Todoke don't have it, just like a lot of animes that continues on the manga version.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is a good show to start if you want to follow with the manga after, but if you don't, it is not. If you don't have the patience, just start with the manga and simply skip the anime like if it doesn't even exist.",

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke: From Me To You, is one of the better known shojo mangas in Japan, but not to the extreme fangirl level of something like Fruits Basket.\r\nOne of my female friends had been bugging me to start watching this series -- and I'll admit, I actually did watch most of it, and then start to read the manga once the episodes were caught up with. If you're a romantic person, or like the silly girl-meets-boy-girl-falls-in-love-girl-is-happy-forever-after, you'll enjoy Kimi ni Todoke. I personally loved the series.\r\nStory -- 6\r\nThe story of Kimi ni Todoke isn't hard to understand. Sadako/Sawako is a shy, antisocial (not bychoice) girl who is disliked by her classmates due to rumors she has nothing to do with. They immediately set you up to pity her, and want to like her. She's cute, innocent, and very shojo-y. In fact, I bet any person with a soul would liken to Sadako. She then somehow starts to catch the eye of the super-nice, very-popular Kazehaya, which creates drama, since him, being the ever-popular guy, has droves of girls worshiping him. These droves notice he's being nice to the antisocial girl, and start to hate on her. No surprise there.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is rudimentary at best, and something you would except out of a crappy author like Stephanie Meyer. It's basic, simplistic, but easy to follow. Sadako, thanks to her savior Kazehaya, suddenly is able to have friends, and lead a somewhat normal life, though her maturity level is stunted due to her years of antisocialism due to the malicious rumors other have about her. Most of the situations the poor girl is put in are incredibly awkward, more awkward than any normal person should be subject to -- and the anime uses this moments to have Sadako learn how to mature quickly. However, such a plot is unrealistic and almost fairy tale ish, having the awkward girl no body likes suddenly be rescued by the prince -- actually, it is fairly similar to the plot of our beloved fairy tales of prince and princesses, but also of over-done stories like Twilight.\\n\\n\r\nThe slight saving factor in this is the fact that the story is just so damned cute. It helps obscure the fact it's a Princess Cinderella sort of story, given the sweetness, gooey-ness, and cuteness that is Kimi ni Todoke.\\n\\n\r\nArt -- 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent. It has the low quality, silly expression, water-drop-on-back-of-forehead moments quite often, but you can't really blame a show like Kimi ni Todoke for having that. Overall, the art is consistent so far and doesn't seem like it'll be dropping. It's detailed, shiny, and very shojo-y in style (see:Code Geass art). From an anime in 2009/2010, this sort of art is what you should be expecting when you watch an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound -- 6\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Kimi ni Todoke isn't memorable so far. It isn't bad -- it has fitting music, the appropriate queues, etc. -- but it isn't exactly stellar, either (see:Lena Park's rendition of \"You Raise Me Up\" in both English and Japanese, in Romeo X Juliet). For a big budget shojo anime, Kimi ni Todoke's soundtrack is pretty much standard, though a very nice and memorable theme would be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -- 9\\n\\n\r\nThe saving grace of Kimi ni Todoke. The character development. Given that it has such a limited selection of characters -- only a dozen or so, compared to the hundreds found in a show like Naruto -- it is no surprise the characters are very well done. Over the first dozen episodes so far, most of the characters have shown real personality and diversity. Sadako, the main character, has, with babying from her awesome Kazehaya and newfound friends Chizuru and Ayane, she manages to learn the basics of social interaction and how cruel people can be. Likewise, the supporting characters of Chizuru and Ayane show character in being able to accurately show jealousy, rage, loyalty, bravery, courage, and other emotions fairly well and believably.  The characters look promising and are probably going to have to be what keeps this anime with a lackluster plot afloat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of Kimi ni Todoke is basically completely up to you. If you dislike awkward situations, unrealistic plots, or fairy tale like occurrences, this may not be the best anime for you. But if you really enjoy romance, and sappy love stories, then give Kimi ni Todoke a try -- it may not disappoint you. I find the rewatch-ability not too low or high, given that there are some very sappy and sweet parts in most of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall  -- 7\\n\\n\r\nI'd personally give this an 8 or a 9, but this isn't a personal review. It's one from a normal look on the anime. For most people, this will fall under a 6 or 7. It has lackluster and boring plot, cliched occurrences with fairy tale like situations, but it is an incredibly sweet and romantic anime with a lot going for it in the character development department. In fact, the popular manga streaming site MangaFox even has this manga listed as a \"Cinderella Story,\" which applies to the anime as well. If you enjoy shojo, you probably will like this. If not...don't waste your time.",

            "content": "Here's a review on Kimi ni Todoke from a male who enjoys a good romance.\r\nKimi ni Todoke is based off a manga of the same name and is for the most part incredibly light-hearted, and there are a few scenes that really get to your core and make you feel some powerful emotions. The aforementioned is the number one reason why I liked this anime, the second would be Sawako.\r\nThe story is told in almost first person perspective by Kuronuma Sawako, a girl who although lacking friends, isn't lonely. Throughout the story she makes many friends that help her realize what it means to havecompanionship.\\n\\n\r\nKuronuma Sawako as the lead character is an incredibly unorthodox and brilliant idea and the best parts of the anime all come from her. She is as already mentioned, the narrator most of the time and most events are explained through her point of view (that is until the story later stems onto side characters). What the writer, Shiina Karuho, has done would be that he wrote a beautiful girl who breaks the current dates standards of moe~moe~kyunnn and TITTY MONSTER. Not only is Sawako naturally goregous, Sawako is a naturally beautiful girl on the inside too - she's helpful and compassionate and truly cares about her friends and family. Sawako is just likable! Sawako at first is incredibly shy and can only try to make friends from afar because of her scary looks. She doesn't directly approach people and ask for their friendship because she really isn't all that confident in herself. One of my favorite parts about her throughout the story is that she is a character that really grows over time but at the same time keeps all the parts that symbolize her - such as the creepiness and the friendliness. One of the traits that Sawako has that I think is often overlooked would be one much like Kamina's ability to transform others into heroes. Instead of heroes though, she transforms the people around her into more of a community and you could say that her niceness rubs off onto other people. The only thing that she doesn't have going for her is that shes often too ditsy for her own good, due to the fact that she hasn't had a huge amount of human contact before in her life, so sadly a lot of the jokes of the series are at her expense.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are where I had to mark down the series. Sure they all have very different traits and characteristics that add variety to the show, but a lot of the characters are one joke characters that try to become full-fledged leads (Chizuru). Chizuru is a tomboy, and doesn't get any deeper than that, even with five or so episodes that revolve around her (that I would like to say is the least redeeming part of the series). But the main male lead, Kazehaya, does absolutely nothing and has almost no personality at all. In fact most of Kazehaya's traits that are positive are only spoken of by Sawako and Ume. He is the definition of \"pretty boy\" and solely exists to be the love object for Sawako. Yes I know characters don't always need to be really impressive to be good, but I was waiting for Kazehaya to do something that gave him some character! He was just a mary-sue who was liked by all in the end and doesn't progress any further than that. Ayane is a would be interesting character that barely develops further than \"a nice person but looks like a skank\" and plot around her even develops at one point later in the series, but is completely over-shadowed by Chizuru and Ryu's \"relationship\". Pin is a downright awful character who I'm pretty sure was just inserted to make everyone else look good. He's the one-dimensional teacher that thinks he's a stud (seriously) and it's frustrating to see him on-screen. Other characters like Ume, Joe (although cliched, I found him very funny) and Sawako's parents are really good too though and always supply a hardy laugh or a sad smile. Actually, I think Sawako's dad has more character development than Chizuru does.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough having many different faces and varied personalities the actual story struggles with excessive drama. Now drama and romance are nearly inseparable, and having lots of it isn't a problem. The problem is when people go out of their way to make things seems more dramatic, which happens a lot in Kimi ni Todoke. Unnecessary and unclear events happen that could be easily solved with a bit of common sense but the unhappy occurrences drag on for three or more episodes. Let me rant for a bit; What I'm referring to exactly would be the Rumor arc that circulated around episode four, right from the get-go might I add, in which Sawako hears some gossip that she is getting Ayane and Chizuru, her two new friends, to back her up and that Sawako is saying nasty things about them behind their back. Sawako suddenly decides to distance herself from the two, complicating the matter. This problem can easily be solved by approaching the two and telling them the rumors are false, but instead the arc which has no real impact on the overall story continues on and eventually the dramatic scenes become so outrageous that the friends get into a fight and have to wallop some people spreading the rumors. I understand that the arc was used to subtly introduce Ume and to show that Sawako has made real friends but the show which is comedic and light most of the time didn't need to suddenly get dark.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, the romantic comedic feel is sometimes interrupted by suddenly depressing and unnecessary bouts of drama. The rest of the story is very fun though and I know it's hard to sound positive after that last paragraph but the mashed up bits of drama doesn't take a whole lot away from the story and I still advise you to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Kimi ni Todoke can really be defined in one phrase: Sparkles and Bubbles. Well, if you have already seen this anime you should know what I'm talking about, the iconic 'close up on the characters face, big smile, pink or other bright colored background, and then a lot of bubbles/sparkles pop up on the side'. I think every time this happened, regardless of the character who did it, I smiled. All the characters are very expressive, and you can easily hear a conversation going on between characters just by what their faces look like alone. Unlike other anime these facial expressions enhance the atmosphere of what the scene is trying to convey be it dramatic, romantic, or comedic. Oh, and you know when some characters are farther away from others and then the foreground characters look normal and the ones farther away look like they have seven eyes? Yeah, that NEVER happens in Kimi ni Todoke. Each character looks as detailed far away as up close and you can tell a lot of time and effort was put into doing so. The chibi's that appear throughout the series are a lot of fun too! They're all so so cute you can't help but to be amused. The opening animation is very silly and colorful and definitely reflects the anime well, while the ending is very serene and the uses mainly yellows and pinks that make it feel like you're reading an old picture book.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the OP matches the animation, fun and upbeat, but I didn't find it incredibly memorable. The ED on the other hand was really great and personally, I think it was one of the best endings of Fall '09. The melancholic tone hits you at the end of each episode, which is good because most episodes end bitter-sweet and the art matches the noise very well. The character voices were made up of five distinct voice actors - Daisuke Namikawa, Mamiko Noto, Yuuichi Namakura, Miyuki Sawashiro, and Hirano Aya (who all played main characters) but all the other voices weren't anything extraordinary and can easily be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is at times, one of the best shoujo I've ever seen, and then at times falls victim to the troupes of today's romance. Kimi ni Todoke is a fantastic anime that had everything going for it, except that it didn't scope in on what it wanted to do. For the first fifteen episodes it focused on Sawako, and it was great! The revelation of a girl who doesn't know shes in love slowly becomes more apparent and right when you think something important is about to happen the story skips to a mid-season filler re-caping the first fifteen episodes and then takes a new route onto Chizuru's love life, who up until this point in the story, was just a comic-relief character. Luckily though, the story moves back to Sawako in the last few episodes but I didn't feel it made up for the six episodes of nothingness that just conspired. It's not that I didn't like the character or didn't want Chizuru and Ryu to be in the spotlight, it's just that the timing didn't really work and when their story was over, nothing had changed and six episodes of a great anime had been wasted.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Kimi ni Todoke is a must-see for all, even if you don't like romances. The wonderful moments that take place throughout the series will be setting an example for romance anime to come for the next ten years. There are moments that made me feel like I wanted to jump up and shout for joy, but there were a fair amount of moments that made me disappointed. Kimi ni Todoke is a very good shoujo romance, but it doesn't really have a full line-up for anything ground-breaking. I recommend giving it a try, and if you aren't hooked by the end of episode two then this series might not be for you. If you liked other anime Prodcution I.G. has made, such as Honey and Clover and Nodame Cantabile, then this anime is right up your alley.",

            "content": "Only rarely does a series break the mold its genre has cast for it and even more uncommonly does it set itself apart from all others.  Such is the case with Kimi ni Todake.  It takes all the classic shoujo romance stereotypes and plot devices and flips them on its head leaving us with a thoroughly rewarding and groundbreaking romance.\r\nAt first, Kimi ni Todake drew me in before I saw its first frame of film with its story concept.  Our heroine is Sawako, a sweet and gentle girl with an awkward personality and an uncanny resemblance to Sadako from The Ring.Desperately wanting others to understand her she is instead shunned and feared by her classmates.  This all changes when she meets a boy named Kazehaya who is the first to truly see her and slowly she begins to draw herself out of her shell.  The remaining story is one of self discovery as Sawako experiences the first feelings of love and friendship she has ever felt.  While her situation is a bit contrived and not overly realistic, the way it is presented is so wonderfully sweet and beautiful that it is impossible not to love.\\n\\n\r\nI firmly believe that in order to really fully appreciate just how special Kimi ni Todake is, you have to already be a veteran of at least a dozen or more of its shoujo peers.  There are none of the usual tired clich\u00e9s.  Sawako isn\u2019t the plain and perky heroine determined to get a man to fall for her who ignores her or treats her horribly.  She isn\u2019t out for revenge nor is she being pursued by a harem of bishounens with a desperate struggle to choose between them.   Kazehaya isn\u2019t a dick, for lack of a better term.  He\u2019s a guy who will be loved by viewers not because he\u2019s hot, but because he\u2019s just a really nice guy any girl would want to fall in love with and guys would want as a friend.\\n\\n\r\nThe feelings and situations presented to us are real and powerful but not in an overly dramatic way.  Nobody has torturous family lives or tragic pasts or other situations that always feel forced in a way to create drama that could be better achieved with fantastic characters and storytelling.  The concepts are simple, the pacing slow, and full of the required blushes and aw shucks moments.  Much like its soft artwork and color palette, Kimi ni Todake is the kind of show you will sit back and relax too, forgetting about all the problems of your day.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that it doesn\u2019t have its faults.  While just about every aspect of the series was wonderful to behold, the series already slow pace comes to an even greater crawl over the last 8-10 episodes.  While I still enjoyed them immensely, I suspect some viewers will likely begin to lose patience at the lack of progress or action in the story.  And while perhaps we are also being setup for a continuation at some point, since the manga is still ongoing, the ending was also not particularly ideal.\\n\\n\r\nSawako herself goes down as one of my all-time favorite characters.  She is so completely earnest and innocent that she is impossible not to love.  While her character concept is initially not all that unique she becomes so much more than just a socially awkward, shy, and moe girl.  Everyone can find something to relate with her over and from a character development standpoint, the person she becomes by the end of the series is so remarkably different from her beginning that it\u2019s truly amazing.  Yet despite this enormous change she never deep down changes from what she really is at her core.  Her closing monologue at the end of the show is a prime example of just how much she has grown.\\n\\n\r\nKazehaya is a rare breed for a romance series.  First he is the one and only love interest.  No reverse harems of bishies here to waste story time or antagonize the heroine.  He is also unique in that outside series such as Kanon or Clannad, he is one of the only leads that looks and feels like a real person.  He is never made out to be a caricature of the fantasies and dreams of young girls.  He is not super wealthy, nor is he a famous athlete, or come from a notorious family.  Sure he is really good looking, popular with the girls and the guys, and good at baseball but you never feel like these are things that he didn\u2019t earn with his own merits.  Unlike most of his anime contemporaries who have abrasive or aloof personalities but are still enormously popular because well they are supposed to be.  They\u2019re perfect men after all!  His personality is the kind that draws people to him and his popularity is not just because he\u2019s handsome.   People like him because he's nice to them.  What a novel idea!\\n\\n\r\nWhile on the surface, Kazehaya and Sawako seem to be completely different people, deep down they both share the same confusing emotions and fears about the feelings each has for the other.  The interaction between the two is truly special and lovely.  Amazingly I never really lost my patience with them either or yell at the screen, \u201cOh come on just kiss her already!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nKimi\u2019s supporting cast is also quite remarkable.  This is nowhere more evident than with Sawako\u2019s new best friends, Ayane and Chizu.   From the start of the story you never would have though these girls would have become her friends.  They had almost written on their faces \u201cvillainess\u201d and it was such a pleasant surprise to see these two develop into perhaps the best shoujo best friends I have seen yet.  They are so completely different from one another that it is a bit surprising they are friends.  Ayane is the beautiful, fashionable temptress, while Chizu is the butch and athletic type.  Their reactions to Sawako kind of mirror the way the audience will perceive her.  There bonds grow stronger as they experience things together, and overcome some adversity.  They were truly a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters come and go but are no less impactful to the story.  The only real rival, Kurumi, who appears in the middle portions of the story never, outstays her welcome and while she would technically serve as the series villainess, she never really feels to me like a villain.   Shockingly Sawako\u2019s family life is also quite normal, she neither has a tragic home situation or a perverted father, and they are both loving and normal parents (both to her and to each other). \\n\\n\r\nArtistically Kimi really shines.  Its soft colors and artwork just match the beauty and sweetness in the story perfectly.  It does a good job of mixing in comedic art along with its beautiful scenery to make every episode visually appealing and smile inducing.  This is even more brought out with the spectacular musical score and cast.  Mamiko Noto seems to have been born to play this role.  It\u2019s a typical character type for her, one that we have heard from her many times, but this will be one that fans will remember for years and years to come.  I can\u2019t say enough about the OP theme, I was instantly in love with from the first chorus and its animation is tremendous.  I also found the ED to be equally perfect, though I suspect Chara\u2019s gravelly voice to be unappealing to some.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kimi ni Todake is easily a top 5 series for me and one of the best shows of the decade.  It was immediately appealing to me from the first episode and I am extremely sad to see it end.  This is how more romance shows should be done and is not to be missed by anyone who likes the genre in even the slightest bit.  It really doesn\u2019t get much better than this one.\\n",

            "content": "How do you recognize that you\u2019ve watched a great show? Do you wake up the next morning and think about it the whole day? Do you talk to people full enthusiasm and passion about the show? Or did you just get that feeling that makes your heart ache and feel all good and warm inside? Kimi ni Todoke manages to do all this.\r\nKimi ni Todoke starts off as an anime that could make you wonder if you\u2019re actually watching said series. The very first scene is practically a half-horror scene attempted by the animators to make you understand in a snap what kind of personthe main character is. Kuronuma Sawako: a girl who looks a bit gloomy and scares away most of the people she\u2019s nearby to. The reason because of that is a simple one: she\u2019s very easily misunderstood. The tone of her voice sounds like a ghost that waited a thousand years in a closet and finally sees someone to scare away. Sawako may not have waited a thousand years but she does scare away people with her awkward attempt to greet someone, which earned her the nickname ''Sadako'' (the ghost from the movie ''The Ring''). \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s natural that any person watching until now will get a feeling of sympathy. We see and hear things that play in Sawako\u2019s mind, and in Sawako\u2019s mind only. She doesn\u2019t mean to scare anyone away. She doesn\u2019t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. Even her life motto (''A good deed a day'') sounds like it\u2019s something made up by a loving person who likes to help. This is by far the biggest message the story is trying to convey: no matter how good your intentions are deep inside, if it\u2019s not coming out in the proper way, nobody will see it on the outside. Sawako is struggling with this harsh truth that tackles her every single day. She has no real friends, feels very lonely at times and has a hard time understanding social situations not knowing how to react. It all feels very sad for Sawako and she is just trying to fit in and help people. But she can\u2019t because of her way of conveying a message to another person; she hasn\u2019t learned to do that properly.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a second message this anime tries to portray, it has to be the message of hope. Because even for Sawako, light in the dark tunnel of social situations can be seen. You could say that Sawako actually is a clean slate of life that hasn\u2019t been written on. The good things and the bad. Because that slate is almost empty, she\u2019s never learned to interact, to recognize backstabbers and to clear up a misunderstanding. But also, she\u2019s never learned to talk behind someone\u2019s back, to steal anything or even to spread rumors. \\n\r\nSawako is unique. An empty book that can be written in with all the things that life teaches us. That is one of the most brilliant ways to begin a story about an individual that grows up and steadily learns new things.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s actually unusual to write so much about a character in a show, even if it\u2019s one of the most complex main characters. The story and the thought behind the story is what should be elaborately written about. But here, the character IS actually the story. Of course it\u2019s possible to name all the events that happened in the show and write a bunch of thoughts about that. The truth is however that the story itself is very thin. And the best thing about that: it does not matter at all. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to my next point. To understand why the story doesn\u2019t matter, we have to look at the pacing of the show. Most stories tend to start off with a bang. Then there are some small events that explain all the things about that big happening and move the story forward. Then there is another peak in the story and the cycle repeats itself.\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is nothing like that. You must realize that the pacing is extremely slow in this show. But the joke is that you must ask yourself the question if it matters to you. The story is about Sawako experiencing all the things in life that almost anyone can relate to. From your first classmate ever sitting next to you, to your first love in high school. It\u2019s that emotional ride that makes this anime so darn special. And the pacing has a very, very important role in delivering those emotions. Basically, it actually makes it possible to notice all the small talk that the characters are having, the fun moments that they\u2019re experiencing, the flowing rivers of sadness that are shown and even the growing love between characters. And most importantly: it\u2019s possible to notice Sawako coming out of her shell. It\u2019s because the pacing is that slow, you can notice and appreciate those things that come by in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, it\u2019s really crucial that you watch this show with an open mind without prejudices. Keep in mind that this is a ''shoujo''. This means that it\u2019s a story with the point of view of a girl and most likely with some ''girly'' elements. But if you manage to overcome these things (or are a girl yourself), Kimi ni Todoke is a breath of fresh air to watch. While the animation may not be the greatest you will ever see, the art is amazing. It\u2019s one of those anime which captures the feel of the manga almost perfectly. The scenery is beautiful and everything has this ''fresh'' feel, as if you\u2019re diving in a nice cold bath after sweating.\\n\r\nMost of the time in animated shows, either the characters are well drawn or the backgrounds are. Kimi ni Todoke does both well with maybe the backgrounds being a tiny bit better drawn than the characters. Cute bubbles and sparkles pop up randomly in many scenes but actually fit very snuggly in the story strangely enough. And the people who composed the musical score deserve applause. The music captures those emotions portrayed beautifully and manages to play as a nice ear massage if listened to.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s too bad that Kimi ni Todoke has one of the most banal summaries you will ever see. Ever. Anyone who decides to watch an anime based on the summary he or she has read will most likely miss this gem of a show. If one day someone will invent a way to include snippets of emotions in a summary, Kimi ni Todoke will stand at the top of the charts and that inventor will hopefully be rich and famous. It\u2019s also too bad that the anime is over. The manga is still going strong so there is hope for a second season; there are literally many who are begging for one. It\u2019s not possible to fully share in words what this anime makes so special, it\u2019s an experience you\u2019ll have to call your own. And because you can relate to almost anyone in the show, it will give you that honest feeling. That feeling which makes you believe that life has more in store, that you CAN move forward and change things. Sawako manages to do it, and so does everyone.",

            "content": "This anime left a bad taste in my mouth. Before watching I read some of the previous reviews and was spurred to watch it after many comments stating how original it was. It's not. There are certain aspects of the anime that differ from the usual but really it was just another shy girl meets popular boy type of anime.\r\nThe first few episodes were definitely enjoyable, the back story to why Sawako is an outcast is different and interesting and so is how she begins to make friends. Unfortunately after about episode 6 or 7 you are wasting your time. This anime should have beenshorter as it moves at an incredible slow pace. Honestly it began to become a mission to sit through another episode. Not only were the episodes repetitive (never has a character cried so much before this) but you can pretty much guess what is going to happen in each episode after the first minute. Unfortunately there is no great ending to uplift the series, it just sort of flattens out part way through and never gets any momentum back.\\n\\n\r\nI think was really annoyed me the most is the lack of development with the characters. There were so many beginnings of side stories and other love interests in this anime that never really developed. At least these could have livened up the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nA few good things about this anime were the art, I thoroughly enjoyed the almost water colour style. The opening track is lovely to listen to as well and suits the anime perfectly. Kazehaya was actually quite a good character and was probably the most original out of all of them with his glass half full attitude that never wavered. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I am giving this a 5/10 as although the first half was enjoyable the second half nearly put me into a coma.",

I got hooked up since episode one because this Anime looks like it's real, and by real, I mean no swords, magics, etc. It portrays love and friendship as you can see these elements in every episodes. Also, I love where this Anime is going. It might get cheesy sometimes, but they did it so well, that you have no choice but to go with the flow and be affectionate.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nThe Art/Animation was outstanding. I loved everything. It was welldrawn/animated. Every detail and objects stood up, even the surroundings, and the characters. Also, adding a chibi form of every characters made it more enjoyable. You can't help it but laugh after seeing their chibi forms.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was perfect. I loved the OP/ ED songs. It fits perfectly with the Anime. Also, everytime something happens, the background music/sound always fits into it, and because of that, it emphasizes the event even more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYou can't help it but love our main girl, Sawako, and others. There's nothing to hate. Everyone has their own emotions, characteristics, which made everyone unique and be part of the Anime. They also give spotlight to Supporting Characters, which is good, in my opinion. They don't focus on 2 characters, but everyone, which is great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI was really entertained while watching this. I didn't get bored at all. This Anime is one of the Anime that I've seen that made a good job combining the elements (Comedy, Drama, and Romance). They didn't fail in doing that. You can find those elements in each episode. Some episodes are really relaxing, which can make you smile or laugh the entire time, while some episodes are really touching that you can't help it but eith cry or be teary.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this Anime to everyone. Guys, don't be scared to watch this. I'm a guy and I find this Anime incredible. I'm 100% straight, don't worry. I've only seen 8 episodes but I can tell that it's going to be awesome from beginning to end. It's a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this is my first review, so please bear with my mistakes. :3",

            "content": "I couldn't help but share my thoughts on this wonderful show with others =)\r\nAt first glance, it may seem like a typical shoujo, boy-meets-girl kind of series.  That's what I thought when I first read the synopsis, so I was kind of reluctant to watch it.  But now...am I glad I did!\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nWhile not the most exciting or original plot line, it's simplicity charms me.  It has a rather slow flow, but it doesn't bore, rather it helps emphasize the special moments that Sawako experiences in her school life.  The process of growing up, feeling love for the first time, makingfriends, and even enemies are all so amazingly portrayed through this show.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, I've never liked a female lead this much before.  Sawako is just too cute.  She's innocent to the point of being humorous, but she's not stupid or weak.  Quite the contrary actually (I was pleasantly surprised by how she interacted with Kurumi).  She's always being positive, always trying to help others, and always being true to herself.  You can't help but be moved by her.  For the male lead, you've got the 100% refreshing Kazehaya who is actually not your typical male lead.  At first glance, he's Mr.Perfect who everyone admires, but after a while you learn that he's just like any other guy.  He gets flustered, nervous, angry and embarrassed like all of us do. And in my opinion, that just makes him more endearingly cute and charming.  \\n\r\nAlso, this show's supporting characters are some of the best I've seen in shoujo anime! They really define the true meaning of friendship :)  Heck, even the antagonist is pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork might not be considered the best out there, but it does the story justice (and then some).  It's bright, simple and cute.  There were certain times when I would think \"wow, the colours look amazing here\" (you gotta pay attention to sunset scenes!). They also did a good job with the characters, I think they purposely made them look plain so that it helps contrast times when they stand out (like when Sawako smiles!). So overall, they did a lovely job. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the opening song and I think it fits the series perfectly.  Can't say much about the background music though because I haven't paid much attention to it...too busy enjoying the dialogue =)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI wish I can give this a higher rating than 10.  I was pretty much smiling like an idiot throughout the first few episodes.  The interaction between Sawako and Kazehaya are too cute for words, I felt much warm and fuzzy feelings when watching them. It makes me wish I could go back in time to experience high school romance like they did.  But then again...who can find someone like Kazehaya.  \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, this show has really grown on me.  I will definitely keep watching and rooting for Sawako.  If this review or the ratings hasn't helped convince you to watch it, please seriously reconsider.  Don't pass this up!\\n\\n",

            "content": "The holidays had just begun when I chose to crack open this anime, the summary sounding cute enough and the reviews close to overflowing with greatness and I was looking into the fall anime which I had neglected.\r\nBut little did I expect to be sorely disappointed.\r\nStory:\r\nThis anime isn't terrible persay, though I would say that it has been greatly overestimated. The story is unrelatable and unrealistic and I don't mean this in the \"GIANT MECHA AND SPARKLY COLOURS\" way, but in the \"There is no way this could be seen as a real life situation, it's just so silly\" way.\r\nNow, a quick overview of thestory's good parts. Ahem.....uh....err.....oh yeah, THIS ANIME DOESN'T HAVE A STORY! Girl meets boy, girl is stupid, boy is also stupid, girls life changes for the better, maybe throw a rival in there. The end. This is hardly a story and I've been far to generous with my rating.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is decent, it's nothing spectacular though, the style has been used a hundred times before; more effectively and even in a way that would make the anime seem to have a little more depth, but it would appear this anime didn't really try, relying alot on still frames rather than trying something different or even having consistent movement.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWell, I won't complain, it has a fair opening and ending theme and they include basic intrumental and background noises that are a staple for any anime but, again, it would appear that this anime hasn't even tried at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are flat in terms of personality, though they do provide some sorely need comic relief at times, particularly the women the main character adopts as her friends and their homeroom teacher, but everyone else is just placid. The love interest is nice enough though the girl does nothing but angst then smile, angst then smile, etc. and becomes one of those people that makes you want to punch a wall because she's so ignorant; even if you were completely isolated from people, you don't lose common sense as a result, either that or she suffers from severe brain damage, though that isn't covered in the anime so I'll just resign myself to believing that she's just stupid.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really can't say much, I wasn't necessarily suffering, but alot of the time I found myself banging my head against my desk because every decision made by the characters were so stupid, obvious and often dragged out with scenes of the main character blushing while giving dialogue that's been heard hundreds of times by her before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI understand that this anime has earnt many fans and I can understand this, I enjoy seeing some clumsy shoujo anime every now and again, because clumsy is cute and even heartwarming, but this anime has been given far too much credit when there are anime out there with far more innovative stories, characters, art, etc.\\n\\n\r\nBy all means watch it, but don't take it seriously, it's just a \"something to do\" anime.",

            "content": "Tales of romance never fail to tug at our heartstrings and entrance our species with a commanding power. Witnessing the innocuous meeting of two unsuspecting individuals struck by an incomprehensible tempest, finding themselves in a whirlwind of chaos and feeling, just piques our imaginative fancies. Thus,  Love and all its related counterparts feel universal and evident in stories unfazed by time or land. It\u2019s the one subject that transcends language barriers into a collective realm of human dreams. Why? It\u2019s simply the unequivocal remedy to longing, to despair, to emptiness; a cure for an incurable illness. It fills voids that can\u2019t be explained. Asfantastical and idealistic as this outlined notion of love is there has to be some hint of truth in it, as what else can explain this obsession with love and its inherent reflection in almost every facet of Art and story-telling (which echoes the deepest, most visceral part of human creation).\\n\\n\r\nOne form of this universally-binding phenomenon is brought forth in the series Kimi ni Todoke, adapted from the manga by Karuho Shiina. Within the medium, there are only a few other titles that can create a truly pure romance as the one portrayed in Kimi ni Todoke. Yes, it falls within the shoujo realm, which would imply a certain degree of fantasy (if not entirely) romances, naivety, and even immaturity. Kimi ni Todoke has all of this and probably to an uncomfortable degree for some viewers, but as with any tale of romance, it requires a willingness to believe; the rest is up to the work \u2013 whether to protect that faith or smash it, and Kimi ni Todoke falls gracefully within the former camp.\\n\\n\r\nThe 25 episode series follows a misunderstood, isolated high school girl Kuronama Sawako who due to her somewhat gloomy appearance and aloof nature has been branded as \u201cSadako\u201d \u2013 the creepy ghost girl from the Japanese horror film Ringu \u2013 and her transformative journey through finding love, friendship, and herself. Along with Sawako\u2019s love interest Kazehaya Shota and an entirely beguiling cast, Kimi ni Todoke excels in almost every single element of its ambitions and of its genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple and relishes in its simplicity. There are no contrived melodramatic shticks , or unnecessary drama to test one\u2019s patience, or any other kind of forced devices creators use to plod the plot along. This series has a focus and sticks to it. This doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not slow however. The pacing is relaxed; giving time to the characters to fully explore the situations, themselves, and each other. Many have complained about the gradual nature of its progression, but it\u2019s undoubtedly one of its strength.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, there are many kinds of implicit love envisioned in this series \u2013 love of friends, romantic love, and love of self. The process that one goes through \u2013 from recognizing the existence of these feelings to actually feeling them to acknowledging them and finally acting on them \u2013 isn\u2019t a quantifiable ordeal; but it can probably be inferred that such a definitive undertaking is gradual. This is why Kimi ni Todoke truly shines: its able to understand that process whether it\u2019s in relation to loving somebody or loving themselves and realizing, that it takes time, especially first loves \u2013 a completely foreign territory for all. A worthy love story will try and present its notion of love as complete as possible, and the show definitely develops that with great care. This is evident through how much the of the content is focused on reveling in each and every step/phase that the characters go through. This not only refines the holistic love story, but also the characters; transforming them into vivid, dynamic personalities with purpose and charisma.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the strongest point of the series. The coupling of awkward girl with popular boy is overtly clich\u00e9d at this point, but it all becomes irrelevant in Kimi ni Todoke, because of how carefully it manages to add dimension to each trait; keeping the characters genuine to their core and albeit archetypical of the genre, giving them the ability to step beyond the clich\u00e9s attached to them. The main characters \u2013 Sawako and Kazehaya \u2013 deliver this wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nSawako is breath of fresh air amongst the littered trash of static shoujo protagonists. Having been alone most of her life, she is completely unaware of what social activities are and oblivious to the meaning of friends or boyfriends. Yet, the work doesn\u2019t go for the angst-y, edgy teen-in-purgatory approach demanding pity and remorse. Rather, the series takes a much more light-hearted tone and creates one of the best shoujo heroines I\u2019ve encountered. Sawako\u2019s demure nature, unfiltered innocence and naivety, and fundamental goodness just radiates throughout, despite her initial appearance and reception.  Best of all, she isn\u2019t depicted as an idiotic, weak individual who can\u2019t stand up for herself or what she wants. She is perfectly balanced which keeps her grounded, but also extremely lovable. Of course, some of her traits are exaggerated, but it does not detract from her character at all. I also have to applaud at how nuanced her development is even though the show narrates her every thought explicitly. It\u2019s like reading a diary, and then finding yourself at the end of it, unknowingly standing with the same person.\\n\\n\r\nKazehaya is sublime. Following suit of the popular, cute, nice boy but stepping away from the trope to be something more. Kazehaya\u2019s character is examined as deeply as Sawako, even though it\u2019s often through Sawako. There is a definite reliability in her narration since a complete picture of Kazehaya is formed as a product. Like Sawako, Kazehaya is genuinely a good person. His kindness is infectious and it is through that kindness that he brings Sawako out of her isolation. Yet, he isn\u2019t perfect and he isn\u2019t detached from the narrative, existing only to be a fantasy achievement for the girl; instead he exists in her world, with her, with all of his feelings, vulnerabilities, and flaws laid right out in plain sight. Essentially, he feels as real as Sawako.\\n\\n\r\nBoth characters find themselves at the same crossroad trying to comprehend and deliver their feelings. It\u2019s a pleasure to see how these characters overcome their internal turbulences, and grow. I cannot stress how happy I was to NOT see any trite misunderstandings or random trust issues. The show definitely has its share of drama, but it\u2019s well-conceived and integrated smoothly into the progression without being imposing which is partly why development of these characters seems so effective. As much as this is a tale of love, it\u2019s equally focused on growth and the latter is illuminated at every turn.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are also well done. Everyone has their own distinctive traits, issues, weaknesses and the show does a great job managing them while giving them some room to be people beyond \u201cthe friends\u201d or devices for the main characters. I came to love Ayano, Chizu, and Ryu as much as Sawako and Kazehaya, because of how finely the work asserted their importance \u2013 as individuals. Having a dynamic cast means more possibilities. One possibility is being able to keep the consistency throughout the series without compromising quality. Often times, romantic comedies feel like two separate things, rather than a cohesive narrating intertwining both. The comedy in the show is fantastic and befitting. It\u2019s not added to act as filler or to make up for awkward static characters who exist solely to be comedic reliefs.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to bring this sweet tale together is the art, tone, and music. The tone is always light, yet manages to convey the more serious situations with equal impact. This is mostly attributed to the art style and color scheme. A pure pastel palette is used; softened colors that keep the atmosphere consistently warm and inviting. The frames are often inked with white, garnered with flower stamps and filled with dreamy bubbles, allowing the fantastical spirit of romance to blossom endlessly. The sugary, wistful art and animation perfectly accompanies the tone and nature of the series. Yet it wouldn\u2019t be complete without melody and song. The music in this series is also quite pleasant. Comprised of upbeat vocals, soft piano, gentle choruses, and simple music-box-ish tunes, the entire soundtrack supplements the show very well. Overall, all of these elements tie seamlessly together to elevate the series into the spotlight it so rightfully deserves.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is and should be the quintessential love story within the medium. It is the idyllic feel-good work that proudly shows why tales of romance will never fail to tug at our heartstrings. Storytellers will continue to tell age-old stories written with some cosmic force that involuntarily rev our own hearts. It\u2019s through these variations of love, can we vicariously experience it too (or at least dream). To feel the stars fall down from the skies in to our eyes and color the world with a rosy tint, oh what a feeling it must be!  And that is indeed the type of unadulterated love you will see, feel, and experience with Sawako and Kazehaya as they walk under the star-crusted skies in Kimi ni Todoke.\\n",

            "content": "Quickly: I've watched 47 anime shows and this is the second that I am writing a review for. I really just got into this and I hope my review is helpful to you. \r\n~Story~ 10/10 \r\n          I hate complex storylines. I will watch shows like that but very rarely, and only if it has enough promise. Kimi Ni Todoke was my absolute favourite anime because they kept it real and they kept it simple. I was giggling at cute moments between the couple of Kazehaya and Sawako and rolling over laughing at funny moments. I crieda bit at some parts (I'm so emotional T.T) but only because the story had me so caught in it. I loved how they made a big deal of little things and how they were all encouraging to one another. Even Sawako's rival, Kurumi(zawa) encouraged her at the end. A girl who went from feared and thought as creepy went to loved with many friends and an outstandingly caring boyfriend. It deserves a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 7/10.\\n\\n\r\n          For backgrounds, they kept things real. For the inside of the school it wasn't marble white. It looked like I could reach out, feel my computer screen and I would feel the texture of the wall or the window. The same can't be said for the characters. I love the way they drew them and the cute way they drew them when they were joking around and it was a light-hearted moment. At times I felt they were lacking in effort slightly. Be it for the shape of their mouths or their hands. (Or maybe that was just me too used to the perfect animation of today with shimmering eyes and perfect hair.) Here they kept it real and no unnecessary features were added. \\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ 8/10\\n\\n\r\n              Honestly? I was humming the opening song for weeks after I finished the show. I loved it. Background music? Perfect. Just at times I felt they repeated parts of the music and I didn't like it there. I know it takes a lot of time and effort to put together those pieces but even so. The show deserved better. Other then that it was fabulous!\\n\\n\r\n~Character~ 10/10\\n\\n\r\n          In many shows today, the main characters are snotty and have egos. As I said, I hate complex storylines and characters who they could really do without. I'm glad that Sawako and Kazehaya weren't like that. Sawako was kind and considerate all the way through. She was self conscious and reminded me a lot of myself. Kazehaya (let's be honest here) I fell head over heels for. He was so kind to Sawako and did EXACTLY what I would want a guy to do for me in situations for Sawako. He was protective and even a bit jealous near the end. Kurumi(zawa) was a perfect rival because she wasn't snotty, she was cunning. She had her ways and although she was selfish in the start, she really grew on you at the end. She was determined and took the competition fairly afterwards. When she couldn't compete anymore, she let her rival, Sawako take the lead and helped her. I felt that near the end, Sawako and Kurumi(zawa) were like sisters. They supported one another and I loved that because Sawako would ask Kurumi for advice and vice versa. Sawako's friends were also so supportive. They always backed away and let love blossom on it's own between Kazehaya and Sawako. They pushed them together at times but they meant well and it turned out well. I found myself thinking at times how much I wanted to be Sawako because she really had it all. \\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 10/10\\n\\n\r\n          I love side characters. Be it their teacher Pin or Sawako's parents. They also grew on me and I adored them for that. The story was beautiful and I enjoyed it. Chances are high that in a few years I will forget about this show. Only to rewatch it and fall in love all over again. \\n\\n\r\n~Overall~ 9/10. \\n\\n\r\n          Mathematically, there's 5 categories and out of fifty. It scored a 45 meaning 90% and 9/10. By my heart, it deserves a 10/10 but a 9 is just as fair. If you love romance, comedy and a simple yet pleasing storyline, I recommend Kimi Ni Todoke to you. Be sure to watch the second season!",

It's very funny, very cute and you just fall in love with all the characters in it. Especially Sawako.\r\nThe characters in the anime look just like they do in the manga, and I know the art might not be everyones cup of tea, but it is VERY similar to the mangakas style, wich I think is great. Backgrounds instuff are really deatailed and beautiful too!\\n\r\nI love the opening and ending themes and I think the voices suit the characters really well so I give it a 10 for sound!\\n\r\nI'm more of a manga lover, but I must say this anime gets an overall 10 from me!",

            "content": "After reading some positive reviews on the internet, I decided to watch Kimi ni Todoke, thinking that the storyline may be similar to Nadeshiko Shichi Henge, which is very fun and entertaining. However, after watching the first episode I was disappointed by the fact that Kimi ni Todoke holds totally different story than Nadeshiko Shichi Henge. For a moment I thought that it was way too girly for me to watch (of course, it's a shoujo but some shoujo really does attract male audience these days), and the animation looks a bit uncommon (not the characters ,but the colorful painted background which seems surreal atfirst).\\n\\n\r\nSo, despite the fact that I am not suited for this anime, I continued to the 2nd and 3rd episode anyway out of curiosity on what this anime had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd before I realized it, I couldn't bring myself to stop watching this anime...!\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke really changed my view on shoujo romance. \\n\\n\r\nThe heroine, Kuronuma Sawako is the most kind-hearted,  soft-mannered heroine you'll ever see in the entire anime universe. Not because she is stunningly beautiful, not because she is wealthy, not because she is very popular in school either. The fact is, she is an ordinary high school girl who lives in a very normal environment.\\n\r\nWhat makes her special is her personality. She is the type that would never wish for someone else's misery. Being a hard-working student, family-loving daughter, and caring friend, none of us would dislike her. Her true happiness is to be useful to her friends and family. Even her motto is \"Do a good deed everyday\". Despite that, she is not a typical weak kind of girl you usually see in another shoujo anime. At times she can stand for herself without depending on anyone. And she will never, ever tell a lie even if it's to save her own skin. She will cheer her friends at times of need, and will cry for someone else's sadness.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, our male main character is Kazehaya Shouta, the most popular guy in school. He is very lively and willing to talk to anyone, though deep inside he is quite soft, shy, and hard to understand. From the outside, he may looks very cheerful and happy, but even himself has his own weaknesses and flaws which is very normal for a human to have.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no one in this anime which is too perfect or too evil by all means. They're all normal humans,  each with their own flaws and emotions, which is interesting because it often allows us to reflect ourselves in them.\\n\\n\r\nFor the story, contrary to what most people say about this anime, It is NOT a typical shoujo romance story about popular guy who falls for the unpopular heroine at first sight. Yes, those elements do appear inside this anime, but in totally different pace. Unlike other fairy-tale like stories, Kimi ni Todoke is not in a rush. It seems rather slow, but it isn't. When you start to think that an episode seems too slow (some people states that the winter episodes seems rather mellow, just like what a winter should be), try to review what has happened in that episode. You will realize that there's already much information flowing through your head without you realizing it.\\n\\n\r\nYes, Kimi ni Todoke isn't as typical and slow as they say. \\n\r\nIts seems as it is saying to us, \"Love is not a rush. Just take it slow and enjoy the bitter-sweet moments of love\".",

            "content": "The romance genre is one of my favourites of this medium. Even though it's hard to come up with an original story or setting in this genre, I find it is the one of, if not the best way to explore characters, their relationships, and get some decent development out of them. Kimi ni Todoke is no exception, for the most part anyways.\r\nTo pay homage to the innocence and optimism this show radiates, I'll get the most and pretty much only big negative I have out of the way first. The last little bit of the second arc focusing on \"the main antagonist\" (AKA secondarylove interest that has no chance in hell) was very jarring. They tried to justify this characters extremely mean-spirited and plentiful actions to no real effect. To have a character that tries to cause so much damage only to try and justify it all feels pointless. Also, Sawako's (the MC) innocence at the climax of this arc was too much for me to handle. It makes sense in the context of her character, but I felt they blew it a little out of proportion.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there isn't much negative to say about Kimi ni Todoke. It used the right amount of drama to create some interesting character interactions and character development, but never to the point where it feels melodramatic. \\n\\n\r\nThat's the best part of Kimi ni Todoke as a whole really. Nothing ever outstays it's welcome. It gets it's point across in a timely and effective fashion, and then moves away so that the next big point has it's time to shine. This keeps everything fresh. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I will say about the story is the love triangles. While I normally don't like love triangles in romance anime (which is sad for me since most anime have them), this show handles it almost perfectly. This because of two things. First off, it goes off the thing I said earlier in that it doesn't outstay it's welcome. Secondly, the love triangles never include  3 main characters. It is always 2 mains and 1 supporting. With these things in place, the love triangles add to the drama quite nicely, and then they fade away after that arc they are in is finished. \\n\\n\r\nBut of course, none of these things matter if you don't have good characters and good bonds between said characters, which is especially important for romance anime. Kimi ni Todoke delivers this, with all the main characters being very likeable and not distinctly falling into archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nKuronuma Sawako is a very good lead (except for the part I mentioned earlier). Her optimism and positive attitude to almost everything makes it hard not to like her, and her development early on was very well done. Whenever she's happy or tries to make others happy, you can't help but be happy for her. Also, her relationship with the main love interest, Kazehaya Shouta, was handled well. Each had something to gain from their relationship. It just felt very balanced, as one never outshadowed the other.\\n\r\nAlso, she's like the cutest thing ever. \\n\\n\r\nThe secondary romance between Sanada Ryu and Yoshida Chizu was great as well. The anime spent a decent chunk of episodes developing them, making their relationship a lot more 3-dimensional than most secondary romances. The two characters by themselves were nice too. Chizu brought a great energy to every scene she was in, and Ryu's honest and \"lazy\" take on everything was a breath of fresh air. Their contrasting personalities is what made them stand up to the primary romance in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we Ayane Yano. Although we didn't get a proper arc with her this season, she was no less of a presence throughout the entire show. She brought a lot with her perceptive eye. She is always the character that knows what's actually going on, and does her best to help her friends get to the desired conclusion.  When her and Chizu got introduced in the first episode, you get the feeling that they are going to be a thorn in Sawako's side, but I was pleasantly surprised when they both turned out to be amazing friends and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are no less interesting. Pin brings a lot to the comedy, and Kurumizawa is a character you love to hate. I also really like how Ryuu's older brother looks like a delinquent, but is actually a very nice guy. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, this show looks extremely shoujo, which is not a bad thing. It looks very nice, it's easy to look at, and it fits the overall tone of the show well. The animation is fairly limited, but you come to expect that with these types of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis soundtrack stood out to me far more than most in the genre do. It fits the tone well, and it's something I feel I could listen to outside of the show. There is just this nice calm feel to a lot of the soundtrack, and the one track that is played in the dramatically intensified parts of the show is brilliant. The OP was also fantastic. The ED slightly less so.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Kimi ni Todoke doesn't really break the mold of it's genre, it elevates what it is given a great deal. Each arc tackled something different, which made it easy to just keep watching without stopping. Save for the last bit of the second arc, I thoroughly enjoyed all of Kimi ni Todoke. It has what I like in a shoujo romance anime. A great main lead and romance, heartfelt dramatic moments, comedy that doesn't feel out of place, and most of all, extremely cheesy and cute moments that you can't help but go \"awww!\" every time one of them pops up. I highly recommend Kimi ni Todoke to any fans of romance anime, especially if you like shoujo romance. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, so hopefully this will go over well. ^_^ I haven't seen the series in a while, so I'll try to accurately try to portray how I felt when I watched it the first time.\r\nStory:6/10\r\nIndeed, the story summary was what pulled me in. It sounded like and interesting spin on a old storyline, and it was a bit. It certainly was interesting to see the interactions of he characters of Sawako since so many were afraid of her. But when you really get down to it, this is a lot like other high school romances. Outcast girl likes most popular guy,they get close, and fall in love. And of course, there's high school drama along the way and plenty of morals and such. This definitely isn't something you haven't seen before if you've been a long time anime fan. Still, it's at least worth a look if you're interested.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime get's the highest score from me. It was certainly amazing and breathtaking in quite a few places. The artist of the anime definitely took the time to add every detail, sparkle, and breath correctly. It was really great to look at. Of course though, there were a few parts that had not so great animations. It was few and not too bad, but still there and prominent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending song was fantastic. The opening especially caught my eye. It really captured the essence of a slice of life romance. It fit perfectly. The ending was also quite good, although I didn't like it as much as the opening. That's probably more of a personal taste, so you should definitely give it a listen. Other music throughout the anime was quite good and done well, too. The opening and ending definitely stand out, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nNow here is where the anime started to go a bit downhill for me. At first I wast entranced by the characters and thought they were all great, and for some that is indeed true. Others... Not so much. This wouldn't be as bad of a problem if it wasn't the main characters who were the not so great ones. Sawako and Kazehaya didn't get very much development throughout the series; It was very, very little. Kazehaya remained pretty much the same through the whole thing, and after a while you just get kind of tired/used to it. Sawako is the biggest example though, since she is the main character you follow. She's decent I suppose, but not really main character material. She got very little if any character development. For example, even after she's had friends for a long time, she still cried her eyes out every time they did something nice for her. I believe this series would be a lot more heartwarming if you actually got to see her get used to these things; That way you could know she truly has made good friends. The side characters of Ryuu, Ayane, and Chizu on the other hand were fantastic. They did a great job with these characters, and went in a really good direction with them. I was happy with them for sure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nDuring the first half of the series, I did enjoy watching it. It was interesting, and seemed like a pretty good anime. Towards the middle though, the series slammed on the breaks. Kazehaya and Sawako went nowhere in their relationship all of a sudden, and the story just started to seem all the same. I would sometimes find myself watching the clock to see how long the rest of the episode was because I wanted it to end. That's not to say it was bad; Just decent. Taking a look back on it I realize it wasn't all that fantastic, but it is enjoyable when watching it the first time. It's gets a solid 7 from me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime is worth the watch of a few episodes if you're interested, and you can see how you feel about it from there. I would recommend it mostly to anime fans who love the slice of life romance genre, because this is the anime for you. Personally though, I just can't give this anime a score higher then seven. Hope this review helped to people who were considering watching, and thanks for reading!",

            "content": "There's a rather irksome trend in anime that I've noticed as I got older: romances are less about actual romance and are more about a so-called \"couple\" locked in a perpetual dance of will they/won't they. As much as I love the anticipation and that sweet sense of satisfaction when I see my ship finally set sail, it just feels like it amounts to nothing when the series just ends right then and there. You can only imagine my frustration when I come across a much-lauded title that I eagerly look forward to watching and then I find out that it leaves me completely andtotally blue-balled. To get a good idea of what I'm talking about, let's look at Kimi ni Todoke: a much-lauded \"romance\" that I did enjoy watching but it ended up leaving a somewhat sour taste in my mouth by the time I finished.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole plot of Kimi ni Todoke revolves around an endearing yet misunderstood introvert named Sawako Kuronoma and her growing affections for Shota Kazehaya, the most popular guy in class who has a crush on her but can't bring himself to spit it out. Along the way, we're accompanied by their three friends: Yano (a smart girl who wears too much make-up), Chizuru (a slightly dim jock with a heart of gold), and Ryu (a jock with short-term memory loss who's also Chizuru's childhood friend). As far as characters are concerned, Kimi ni Todoke has it down-pat. Everyone in our leading quintet are likeable and endearing individuals and I can safely say that most of them change and grow as individuals throughout the course of the series. MOST of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I liked Kazehaya, he was well... boring. Don't get me wrong, I really do appreciate the fact that he's the complete antithesis of Naoki Irie from Itazura na Kiss and actually treats Sawako with respect. What I don't particularly care much for is the fact that throughout the entire run, I know next-to-nothing about this guy. Sure, there are some details that pop up here and there but there's almost nothing else to this guy outside of his feelings for Sawako (which to be fair, do actually seem genuine). That actually struck me as bizarre, to say the least since Kazehaya says that he's not as good a person as Sawako thinks he is in a couple of episodes (if I recall correctly). \\n\\n\r\nWhat I fail to understand is why Production I.G didn't elaborate on this apparent fault of his more. What is it about Kazehaya that makes him a flawed individual? Is it a nasty temper, a broken home, codependency problems, or what? To be fair, Kimi ni Todoke only covers around the first ~26 chapters of the manga and I'm guessing that the manga actually elaborates more on Kazehaya's flaws as an individual. I can't really recall if it actually DOES do that though since it's been a while since I last read some Kimi ni Todoke on KissManga (that's what happens when you're sidetracked by Kamisama Hajimemashita and IRL stuffs), but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nKazehaya aside, there was another problem that irked me whilst I was watching the show and that was just how slow it actually is. Don't get me wrong: I don't expect my ship to sail within the first four episodes, but the latter half of the show felt overextended to say the least. A lot of the stuff that these episodes covered could've been condensed without missing out on much of anything. There were points during those episodes where it just got kinda tedious and I was flipping back and forth between Tumblr on my phone and Crunchyroll on my laptop. For the record, if I actually get bored enough to the point where I take out my phone and start perusing through Facebook or Tumblr or whatever, your show done fucked up BIG TIME.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's the ending that just made me furrow my brow in annoyance. KnT reached a fair enough conclusion, don't get me wrong. At the same time, it just left me completely and totally blue-balled in that by the time the show actually went somewhere with the romance, it just ended. Yeah, there's a second season but the second season shouldn't have existed in the first place. All of the content that the second season covered could've easily been in this season had Production I.G decided to actually condense the latter half of the show so that these episodes could've fit into the overall story. Hindsight's a bitch, ain't it? Does this mean that everything that came before was just pointless? NO!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is that Kimi ni Todoke isn't just Sawako and Kazehaya's story. It's also Yano, Chizu, and Ryu's story as well. We had various episodes focusing on them so that we could get a better idea of who they are as individuals. Not only that, but we had various \"arcs\" that focused on these people and some challenges that they needed to overcome. Sure, the whole thing surrounding Sawako and Kazehaya might've been a little anticlimactic but you can count on Yano, Chizu, Ryu, Pin, and even Kazehaya's puppy to bring a smile to your face with their exploits.\\n\\n\r\nOn the aesthetic side of things, Kimi ni Todoke is very well... bubbly and sparkly. I'm pretty sure that's the most succinct way to describe it. I don't want to say that thsi is typical of shojo romances in general, but the usage of bubble and sparkle effects throughout the entire show remind me of shows like Ouran HSHC and Kamisama Hajimemashita. It looks nice, so I'm not complaining but others will because they suck so what can you do there? Backgrounds are quite lovely to look at and the character designs are pretty damn good... for the most part. My only gripe with the character designs is the fact that Sawako is drawn in chibi style way more than I'd like to see. Guys at Production I.G: Chibi Sawako is also cute, but proper human Sawako is even cuter. Let's see more of her and less of chibi Sawako please. Thank you.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, I have no complaints. The OST works for what it does, the voice-acting is quite nice (well, in Sawako's case at least), so what more could I want? Well... there is one thing I want and that would be an English dub. You see, this show is licensed by NIS America, a company that rarely dubs anything and when they do, it's not for a show that I was expecting to get dubbed. You see, whilst I was watching Kimi ni Todoke, I couldn't help but imagine what these characters would sound like if they were in English. Emily Neves would voice Sawako, David Matranga would voice Kazehaya, Crispin Freeman would voice Ryu, and so on and so forth. Enough about my own delusions though, because it's time to wrap this review up.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is definitely one of the better shojo romances out there on the market as it currently stands. Whilst it's certainly not as entertaining as the likes of say Ouran HSHC, Maid-Sama!, or Kamisama Hajimemashita, I like to imagine that Kimi ni Todoke stands alongside Fruits Basket's adaptation in that they're both really sweet and endearing shows that are just too slow for their own good. If you're in the mood for an endearing slice-of-life show featuring likeable characters, Kimi ni Todoke definitely fits the bill there and then some. However, you'd better look elsewhere if you want a compelling romance (i.e. Maison Ikkoku, Nana, Solanin) otherwise you'll be saltier than I am whenever I lose to Evilswarm. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)",

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke is a heartwarming story about a girl named Sawako navigating the awkward and uncertain path of high school and the important relationships she makes along the way. Sawako has been socially shunned by all of her classmates because they believe that she is creepy and has the ability to make contact with the supernatural. Sawako is a sweet and thoughtful girl; however her awkwardness and inability to explain situations only furthers rumors of her \"weirdness\" and provides great comedic moments. \r\nSawako's story changes dramatically when she is befriended by Kazehaya, a kind boy who sees her for who she truly is. Kazehaya'sacts of kindness completely surprise Sawako, who is used to being ignored, and it is beautiful to watch her become more comfortable with him. Sawako also becomes great friends with Ayane and Chizuru, two girls who initially use Sawako to scare people for their own amusement. However, after both girls get to know Sawako, they see her kind and helpful personality.\\n\r\nThe show is able to find a great balance between truly sad moments and the funny and fickle nature of human beings. It is a slow, easy watch with heartwarming moments and funny situations that accurately reflect first love in high school and the desire to be liked.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very enjoyable because of its characters, simple, well-paced plot and pretty artwork. I really, really, really recommend this anime and believe that it can be enjoyed and appreciated by anyone. WATCH IT NOW!! :)",

            "content": "There is such an amount of stupid in this anime it goes quite simply beyond words, so I will stick to the basics:\r\nStory:\r\nif I thought that romantic animes tend to make everything that happens to those lame drama queen teenagers a matter or life or death, Kimi ni Todoke has gone overboard. \r\nWhat story, by the way? Is this a story about autism? If it was so at least it would have a purpose and it would be promoting something serious. \r\nKeyword: Misunderstanding that could have easily been avoided and even more easily been cleared from the beginning.\r\nArt is OK, Sountrack was a bit toosimplicistic and childish but pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nShould I laught or cry? There are two characters who are savable and they are Ryu and Yano. Kazehaya is only half savable. The rest is trash.\\n\r\nSawako isn't just shy, she has problems. She has hallucinations. She lives in a weird limbo, I don't know. We've all had our problems when we were an awkard mess in middle school, some dealt with it better and some just couldn't cope with school mates, but when you finally emerge from the darkness and people come at you with outstretched hands, ready to start fresh like normal people, you don't just stick to your conviction that everyone hates you in face of all the evidence of the contrary. \\n\r\nThat only means being stubborn, and Sawako is probably 99% stubborn and 150% stupid (yes I suck at math).\\n\r\nOh, and another 50% tears, because there seems to be no end to the amount she can shed for no reason at all. And in the beginning? Was the start of a new friendship supposed to be this tragic? Who in the world has cried so much and reached such depths of despair for one single rumour and two people who are willing to give you the time of day? I mean, if that is how she goes about getting friends I'm curious to know how's the rest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNO, I haven't enjoyed myself, and Sawako wouldn't have enjoyed herself either if I'd had the chance to put my hands round her neck at some points of the story. At MANY points of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I have just seen a bunch of cliches stuffed together and pushed to the tenth power. Or maybe maybe maybe! Maybe this is actually the birth place of many of the cliches that you see in anime these days, the source of all evil. Maybe this is the reason Japanese people think that love is so much of a bothersome burden that if you're not driven by the most powerful and pure emotions you're not even qualified to try. \\n\r\nThis is what I call non-educational.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: the second season is just as useless as the first one and although it LOOKS like it provides closure, it's just another one of Sawako's pointless tiny steps toward finally becoming a normal person, and I can only pity her because if that's how she goes about things then her life will just a nerve-wrecking chain of events that she can barely deal with without crying or passing out or giving herself stress-induced gastritis.",

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke, one of the most famous shojos lately. I don't understand the cause of the high score on this, but let's go to what matters.\r\nKuronuma Sawako, a student with a sweet and adorable look... not for her classmates. She gained the nickname Sadako (from the cursed girl of the \"The Ring\" movies) thanks to the way everyone sees her, besides her antisocial style and the difficulty of making friends. Only until she mets Kazehaya (her big romance partner of the show), Ryuu (Kazehaya's friend) and her new friends, Ayane and Chizuru. They then try to show everyone the real Sawako: sweet and shy.\r\nTheart is great, the color choice is good and that makes it nice to watch. Perfect for a shojo/school comedy (the OP and ED are extremely beautiful). What to say about the sound... the voices are great and all of them fits perfectly in their respectives characters, as expected of the nice dub make it by the japanese.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters are side-shows, like Sawako, Ayane and Chizuru, the powerful trio that steals the scene. The various situations they go through are real funny, like trying to \"fix\" Sawako or even interacting with all the supporting characters, the three girls are the strong point of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a romance anime, I recommend looking for another one, but if you want a SAPPY romance anime + school comedy, you can try Kimi ni Todoke. Don't expect a single kiss here and even less an end, since Kimi ni Todoke don't have it, just like a lot of animes that continues on the manga version.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is a good show to start if you want to follow with the manga after, but if you don't, it is not. If you don't have the patience, just start with the manga and simply skip the anime like if it doesn't even exist.",

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke: From Me To You, is one of the better known shojo mangas in Japan, but not to the extreme fangirl level of something like Fruits Basket.\r\nOne of my female friends had been bugging me to start watching this series -- and I'll admit, I actually did watch most of it, and then start to read the manga once the episodes were caught up with. If you're a romantic person, or like the silly girl-meets-boy-girl-falls-in-love-girl-is-happy-forever-after, you'll enjoy Kimi ni Todoke. I personally loved the series.\r\nStory -- 6\r\nThe story of Kimi ni Todoke isn't hard to understand. Sadako/Sawako is a shy, antisocial (not bychoice) girl who is disliked by her classmates due to rumors she has nothing to do with. They immediately set you up to pity her, and want to like her. She's cute, innocent, and very shojo-y. In fact, I bet any person with a soul would liken to Sadako. She then somehow starts to catch the eye of the super-nice, very-popular Kazehaya, which creates drama, since him, being the ever-popular guy, has droves of girls worshiping him. These droves notice he's being nice to the antisocial girl, and start to hate on her. No surprise there.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is rudimentary at best, and something you would except out of a crappy author like Stephanie Meyer. It's basic, simplistic, but easy to follow. Sadako, thanks to her savior Kazehaya, suddenly is able to have friends, and lead a somewhat normal life, though her maturity level is stunted due to her years of antisocialism due to the malicious rumors other have about her. Most of the situations the poor girl is put in are incredibly awkward, more awkward than any normal person should be subject to -- and the anime uses this moments to have Sadako learn how to mature quickly. However, such a plot is unrealistic and almost fairy tale ish, having the awkward girl no body likes suddenly be rescued by the prince -- actually, it is fairly similar to the plot of our beloved fairy tales of prince and princesses, but also of over-done stories like Twilight.\\n\\n\r\nThe slight saving factor in this is the fact that the story is just so damned cute. It helps obscure the fact it's a Princess Cinderella sort of story, given the sweetness, gooey-ness, and cuteness that is Kimi ni Todoke.\\n\\n\r\nArt -- 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent. It has the low quality, silly expression, water-drop-on-back-of-forehead moments quite often, but you can't really blame a show like Kimi ni Todoke for having that. Overall, the art is consistent so far and doesn't seem like it'll be dropping. It's detailed, shiny, and very shojo-y in style (see:Code Geass art). From an anime in 2009/2010, this sort of art is what you should be expecting when you watch an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound -- 6\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Kimi ni Todoke isn't memorable so far. It isn't bad -- it has fitting music, the appropriate queues, etc. -- but it isn't exactly stellar, either (see:Lena Park's rendition of \"You Raise Me Up\" in both English and Japanese, in Romeo X Juliet). For a big budget shojo anime, Kimi ni Todoke's soundtrack is pretty much standard, though a very nice and memorable theme would be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -- 9\\n\\n\r\nThe saving grace of Kimi ni Todoke. The character development. Given that it has such a limited selection of characters -- only a dozen or so, compared to the hundreds found in a show like Naruto -- it is no surprise the characters are very well done. Over the first dozen episodes so far, most of the characters have shown real personality and diversity. Sadako, the main character, has, with babying from her awesome Kazehaya and newfound friends Chizuru and Ayane, she manages to learn the basics of social interaction and how cruel people can be. Likewise, the supporting characters of Chizuru and Ayane show character in being able to accurately show jealousy, rage, loyalty, bravery, courage, and other emotions fairly well and believably.  The characters look promising and are probably going to have to be what keeps this anime with a lackluster plot afloat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of Kimi ni Todoke is basically completely up to you. If you dislike awkward situations, unrealistic plots, or fairy tale like occurrences, this may not be the best anime for you. But if you really enjoy romance, and sappy love stories, then give Kimi ni Todoke a try -- it may not disappoint you. I find the rewatch-ability not too low or high, given that there are some very sappy and sweet parts in most of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall  -- 7\\n\\n\r\nI'd personally give this an 8 or a 9, but this isn't a personal review. It's one from a normal look on the anime. For most people, this will fall under a 6 or 7. It has lackluster and boring plot, cliched occurrences with fairy tale like situations, but it is an incredibly sweet and romantic anime with a lot going for it in the character development department. In fact, the popular manga streaming site MangaFox even has this manga listed as a \"Cinderella Story,\" which applies to the anime as well. If you enjoy shojo, you probably will like this. If not...don't waste your time.",

            "content": "Here's a review on Kimi ni Todoke from a male who enjoys a good romance.\r\nKimi ni Todoke is based off a manga of the same name and is for the most part incredibly light-hearted, and there are a few scenes that really get to your core and make you feel some powerful emotions. The aforementioned is the number one reason why I liked this anime, the second would be Sawako.\r\nThe story is told in almost first person perspective by Kuronuma Sawako, a girl who although lacking friends, isn't lonely. Throughout the story she makes many friends that help her realize what it means to havecompanionship.\\n\\n\r\nKuronuma Sawako as the lead character is an incredibly unorthodox and brilliant idea and the best parts of the anime all come from her. She is as already mentioned, the narrator most of the time and most events are explained through her point of view (that is until the story later stems onto side characters). What the writer, Shiina Karuho, has done would be that he wrote a beautiful girl who breaks the current dates standards of moe~moe~kyunnn and TITTY MONSTER. Not only is Sawako naturally goregous, Sawako is a naturally beautiful girl on the inside too - she's helpful and compassionate and truly cares about her friends and family. Sawako is just likable! Sawako at first is incredibly shy and can only try to make friends from afar because of her scary looks. She doesn't directly approach people and ask for their friendship because she really isn't all that confident in herself. One of my favorite parts about her throughout the story is that she is a character that really grows over time but at the same time keeps all the parts that symbolize her - such as the creepiness and the friendliness. One of the traits that Sawako has that I think is often overlooked would be one much like Kamina's ability to transform others into heroes. Instead of heroes though, she transforms the people around her into more of a community and you could say that her niceness rubs off onto other people. The only thing that she doesn't have going for her is that shes often too ditsy for her own good, due to the fact that she hasn't had a huge amount of human contact before in her life, so sadly a lot of the jokes of the series are at her expense.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are where I had to mark down the series. Sure they all have very different traits and characteristics that add variety to the show, but a lot of the characters are one joke characters that try to become full-fledged leads (Chizuru). Chizuru is a tomboy, and doesn't get any deeper than that, even with five or so episodes that revolve around her (that I would like to say is the least redeeming part of the series). But the main male lead, Kazehaya, does absolutely nothing and has almost no personality at all. In fact most of Kazehaya's traits that are positive are only spoken of by Sawako and Ume. He is the definition of \"pretty boy\" and solely exists to be the love object for Sawako. Yes I know characters don't always need to be really impressive to be good, but I was waiting for Kazehaya to do something that gave him some character! He was just a mary-sue who was liked by all in the end and doesn't progress any further than that. Ayane is a would be interesting character that barely develops further than \"a nice person but looks like a skank\" and plot around her even develops at one point later in the series, but is completely over-shadowed by Chizuru and Ryu's \"relationship\". Pin is a downright awful character who I'm pretty sure was just inserted to make everyone else look good. He's the one-dimensional teacher that thinks he's a stud (seriously) and it's frustrating to see him on-screen. Other characters like Ume, Joe (although cliched, I found him very funny) and Sawako's parents are really good too though and always supply a hardy laugh or a sad smile. Actually, I think Sawako's dad has more character development than Chizuru does.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough having many different faces and varied personalities the actual story struggles with excessive drama. Now drama and romance are nearly inseparable, and having lots of it isn't a problem. The problem is when people go out of their way to make things seems more dramatic, which happens a lot in Kimi ni Todoke. Unnecessary and unclear events happen that could be easily solved with a bit of common sense but the unhappy occurrences drag on for three or more episodes. Let me rant for a bit; What I'm referring to exactly would be the Rumor arc that circulated around episode four, right from the get-go might I add, in which Sawako hears some gossip that she is getting Ayane and Chizuru, her two new friends, to back her up and that Sawako is saying nasty things about them behind their back. Sawako suddenly decides to distance herself from the two, complicating the matter. This problem can easily be solved by approaching the two and telling them the rumors are false, but instead the arc which has no real impact on the overall story continues on and eventually the dramatic scenes become so outrageous that the friends get into a fight and have to wallop some people spreading the rumors. I understand that the arc was used to subtly introduce Ume and to show that Sawako has made real friends but the show which is comedic and light most of the time didn't need to suddenly get dark.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, the romantic comedic feel is sometimes interrupted by suddenly depressing and unnecessary bouts of drama. The rest of the story is very fun though and I know it's hard to sound positive after that last paragraph but the mashed up bits of drama doesn't take a whole lot away from the story and I still advise you to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Kimi ni Todoke can really be defined in one phrase: Sparkles and Bubbles. Well, if you have already seen this anime you should know what I'm talking about, the iconic 'close up on the characters face, big smile, pink or other bright colored background, and then a lot of bubbles/sparkles pop up on the side'. I think every time this happened, regardless of the character who did it, I smiled. All the characters are very expressive, and you can easily hear a conversation going on between characters just by what their faces look like alone. Unlike other anime these facial expressions enhance the atmosphere of what the scene is trying to convey be it dramatic, romantic, or comedic. Oh, and you know when some characters are farther away from others and then the foreground characters look normal and the ones farther away look like they have seven eyes? Yeah, that NEVER happens in Kimi ni Todoke. Each character looks as detailed far away as up close and you can tell a lot of time and effort was put into doing so. The chibi's that appear throughout the series are a lot of fun too! They're all so so cute you can't help but to be amused. The opening animation is very silly and colorful and definitely reflects the anime well, while the ending is very serene and the uses mainly yellows and pinks that make it feel like you're reading an old picture book.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the OP matches the animation, fun and upbeat, but I didn't find it incredibly memorable. The ED on the other hand was really great and personally, I think it was one of the best endings of Fall '09. The melancholic tone hits you at the end of each episode, which is good because most episodes end bitter-sweet and the art matches the noise very well. The character voices were made up of five distinct voice actors - Daisuke Namikawa, Mamiko Noto, Yuuichi Namakura, Miyuki Sawashiro, and Hirano Aya (who all played main characters) but all the other voices weren't anything extraordinary and can easily be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is at times, one of the best shoujo I've ever seen, and then at times falls victim to the troupes of today's romance. Kimi ni Todoke is a fantastic anime that had everything going for it, except that it didn't scope in on what it wanted to do. For the first fifteen episodes it focused on Sawako, and it was great! The revelation of a girl who doesn't know shes in love slowly becomes more apparent and right when you think something important is about to happen the story skips to a mid-season filler re-caping the first fifteen episodes and then takes a new route onto Chizuru's love life, who up until this point in the story, was just a comic-relief character. Luckily though, the story moves back to Sawako in the last few episodes but I didn't feel it made up for the six episodes of nothingness that just conspired. It's not that I didn't like the character or didn't want Chizuru and Ryu to be in the spotlight, it's just that the timing didn't really work and when their story was over, nothing had changed and six episodes of a great anime had been wasted.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Kimi ni Todoke is a must-see for all, even if you don't like romances. The wonderful moments that take place throughout the series will be setting an example for romance anime to come for the next ten years. There are moments that made me feel like I wanted to jump up and shout for joy, but there were a fair amount of moments that made me disappointed. Kimi ni Todoke is a very good shoujo romance, but it doesn't really have a full line-up for anything ground-breaking. I recommend giving it a try, and if you aren't hooked by the end of episode two then this series might not be for you. If you liked other anime Prodcution I.G. has made, such as Honey and Clover and Nodame Cantabile, then this anime is right up your alley.",

            "content": "What was your first impression of Kimi ni Todoke? It is a shoujo anime about a girl, shy and timid, who gets into a relationship with some guy.\r\nWell, it is that in all its essence.\r\nThe thing is that this show presents itself in a very unique perspective, one which amplifies and embellishes little elements that are usually overlooked in a typical anime of its genre. What's special about this show is the experience one gets from watching it. \r\nThe story is told mainly through the eyes of Kuronuma Sawako, the main character. She's a shy little girl having a ghostly guise, constantly feared or misunderstoodby many people because she resembles Sadako (her nickname) from a movie called The Ring. Being told in her perspective, we get to see first-hand of all the happenings in her life in perfect detail, her social transformation as she opens herself out to the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I found interesting about the story is that how the season changes correspondingly with its progress. Everything starts off in spring where Sawako first met Kazehaya, the male lead. As spring is the season for new things to happen, this fateful event marks the starting point where wonderful things such as friendship, start revealing themselves to Sawako one by one. It's rather like planting a seed in the lushness of spring. Then things begin to peak in summer. Autumn doesn't seem to last long here. The last season, winter, is where all things are brought to an end at the start of a new year. In my opinion, I think this is an orderly display of plot and we can sense that time goes on with a change in season.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is set at a slow speed. No, it doesn't mean you will find fillers and the likes, this is because the show really needs that much time for it to deliver this natural feeling. All episodes link to one another smoothly except for one recap episode where I find it highly unnecessary for it to be included.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also includes a short arc with Sawako's friend, Chizuru getting the limelight. And it packs quite the punch for its size.\\n\\n\r\nIt's sad to see the end of the series, what with the sudden bringing down to a close type of ending. Though it would be satisfying hear a second season coming along.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis simple storyline is complemented with crisp, clear and vivid art which go extremely well together. Starting from the background, done with bright and lively hues of watercolor, the skies in day or night, rain or shine, blending in so well with the scene and season. The lighting is also a job well done especially on the characters and for once you don't see them pasted with the background.\\n\r\nAnd I must comment on how they pay attention to the little details. Flowers aside, they animated ladybugs and birds in the backyard, something that we rarely see in shows these days.\\n\\n\r\nThe character drawing is not much to brag about, it is consistent, they are drawn in such a simple manner that it is pleasing to the eyes, with modest blushes, and their eyes and facial expressions portrayed accurately as well. The chibi forms of the characters are what that made my day, literally. They are an excellent source for making a few laughs and make things look plain cute, I'm talking about Sawako with a twinkling star beside her face, and Ayane with flabby lips. Sometimes, the characters tend to swap from normal to chibi mode too much, but for me it's all right, they still maintain a fair balance of the two. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the environment, this is, I believe, what made the art attractive. Throughout the spring and summer seasons, you can regularly see bubbles and pentagons appearing in emotional scenes dancing about that really adds humidity and that almost visible sense of freshness you find in morning gardens with glistening dewdrops. It really amplifies the overall feel of the picture.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound is yet another treat in Kimi ni Todoke. The seiyuus all did a very good job to bring out the characters, all befit their roles superbly, Sawako sounds kinda eerie at the beginning, but her normal soft and shy voice can at times make your ears melt out of sheer pleasure. Her short little gasps can very well put her in the moe category. Even Pin's annoying laughing and jeering is pleasing to hear sometimes too.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack came out to be fine, and it really enhances the mood of the environment. These quiet tones bring out the sentiments of the characters, some support a romantic or sad scene, and there are one or two that fit in just fine with the comedy. Oh and there was this particular track that made me feel like a was watching while floating in midair.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence, Kimi ni Todoke is the best. It's like a blast of emotion that made my feelings erupt the first time I saw it. This piece has a guitar and piano version which can be heard in the anime, and believe me, the piano solo is no less than perfect in my view. The ending theme, Kataomoi is fine to the extent of ending the episode. It slowly brings you to a smooth landing after being up in the air watching for so long.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHere is the part that shines in this show, the characters. Is is also the most important aspect of the show. In Kimi ni Todoke, we have Sawako who has all the qualities of a quiet and reserved individual who, through meeting Kazehaya, gains two close friends, a rival, a lover, and her Zashiki Warashi (a spirit which brings luck) status among her classmates.\\n\r\nThis show focuses on the various interactions between the characters and the outcome and does it masterfully. As aforementioned, they wanted to show what other shows normally avoid, which is the feelings we all have deep down inside.\\n\r\nThe show speaks of inner sincerity, not the hard outer shells one has, and Sawako, with little experience of socializing, is a prime example of someone who exhibits pure innocence and sincerity.\\n\r\nJust look at her speech, albeit a little over the top and effusively grateful, she has in herself courage to stand up and speak for herself, and for others. And she really tries to do her best at that, as she kept struggling all the time to keep up with the norms of her peers.\\n\r\nThis sense of trust and mutual affection can even stretch to the supporting cast, and this goes to show that no matter what kind of person you are, down at the core we pretty much are the same.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is, we see ourselves in Sawako that's a fact. No matter who you are and how you came to know what life is, you can always relate and see Sawako living through a similar situation as you did, because what they focus here is a general field of life's good and bad stuffs.\\n\r\nBut as we watch this show, we can't help but feel that familiar warmth we know or used to know so well before. It's like, hey, I remember doing that or having that experience. And some of you will get a sense of relief or assurance that you are not so alone in this world, and what happened to you happens to others. For one thing Sawako here has been through the trials, got her first times, her first crush, her first real friends, her first sleepover and late night parties.\\n\\n\r\nIf you give your compassion knowing Sawako's tears, if you share your delight with her cheers, if you are envious for all those treasures being heaped upon her, or just shed tears with no particular reason, by all means continue to do so and let your emotions to be in sync with her. I'll be frank, I did cry while watching the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that requires patience, you need to entrust your time into its care, and what you receive in return is a wonderful experience you will remember for some time to come. You will be transported to another world, as simple and little as it is, and there you can feel at ease, and forget your worries, soaking in the subtle bits of details the show has to offer. Well maybe that's a bit exaggerated, but it's what I feel at least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a show that is not quite the ordinary shoujo romance anime as some might expect. I think it's safe to say that the enjoyability of this anime varies according to each person. It has none of the mushy romance stuff, so no lip contact. You can even learn something from this show and recall some sweet memories from before. To put it simply, Kimi ni Todoke is an animated storybook narrated by Kuronuma Sawako, where we see and hear the story of her social transformation, a little girl stepping into society with a will to change for the better, and that has made all the difference.\\n\\n\r\nIt really is a special show, a show that reaches out to you.",

            "content": "Whatever you do, don't be put off by Kimi ni Todoke's unassuming summary. The premise of this wonderful anime starts off very simply and it starts off that way too. However, this anime is so unbelievably authentic and distinct in how it portrays the feelings and personalities of the main characters.\r\nI found myself liking and relating to each and every character in this series, Sawako and Kazehaya especially. In a romance series like this one, the story is 100% reliant upon the characterization. It works because each character's personality comes out so earnestly throughout the series. We get to watch their interactions with each otherand the emotions and actions that arise as a result. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Sawako (the titular Sadako) really is a diamond in the rough. At the beginning there is not a single person who understands and sympathizes with her internal struggles. She is alone and devoid of friends thanks in part to her creepy facade. It is Kazehaya and his non-judgmental character who initiates the first tidbits of change into Sawako's life, and he does this with nothing more than his trademark sparkling smile. From that point on, Sawako makes her first (and best) friends in Chizuru and Ayane, finds a love rival in Kurumi, and witnesses many of Kazahaya's 'firsts'.\\n\\n\r\nWith the progression of the series, Sawako comes to realize that life's struggles should never be confronted alone and that with just a few good friends by your side, the world becomes a much brighter and happier place. This realization obliterates the mystique and obscurity surrounding her and she emerges as the beautiful gem that she is, much to Kazehaya's chagrin. \\n\\n\r\nI never once got bored with Kimi ni Todoke's relatively slow pacing and overall lack of angst and drama. Many romance series are similarly paced after all, so for those who are romance veterans, boredom should not be an issue in the least. Sawako's meek nature and nervousness in most situations culminates in quite a few comedic moments. Chizuru too, with her tomboy antics, is another source or laughter. Though the supporting cast fall into generic archetypes, it is their interactions with Sawako, who does not fall into any known archetypes, that make this series so enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of Kimi ni Todoke suits the show perfectly. Its sparse style and colors lend beauty to the scenery and characters during those moments when it reaches an emotional climax, such as when Kazehaya smiles. The background music serves the same purpose and serves it well, though the aren't exactly memorable. The OP and ED themes are, however. Personally, OP and ED themes take a bit of acclimation on my part for them to grow on me (I don't skip OPs and EDs EVAR). Kimi ni Todoke's OP hooked me almost instantly, a feat that is not achieved often. Once I adjusted to the vocals of the ED's performer, it also became a well-loved contribution to the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can really find fault with Kimi ni Todoke is its ending. If the second season wasn't in the works, it would be totally inexcusable, but since the first episode is airing TOMORROW (so stoked), I was able to overlook it.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the second season!",

            "content": "Ok, I might have no right to be writing a disparaging review on a series I've watched a quarter of, but this is less of a review and more of a warning: THIS ANIME IS FOR SHOUJO FANS/EXPERIENCED SHOUJO WATCHERS. Don't let the top reviews fool you. The only way in which this series differs from the typical romance formula is the premise. Otherwise, the way events develop all scream textbook shoujo.\r\nI would have tried to finish this anime, but after reading a few other comments about how the second half is even worse, I decidedly gave up after only having watched the first majorarc: the \"rumours\" arc, which, basically, is a story only made possible because stupid people do stupid things. Or rather, they don't do the things which normal, rationally functioning human beings would (i.e. communicate). As a result, events move at an excruciatingly slow pace, wherein the long drag could have been resolved within 24 minutes. Since any high school romance anime's core is its characters, you can already see my main beef with this show.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have Sawako, a girl who is introduced as a ghostly figure that scares people away, but then we have to quickly believe is also simultaneously pretty. Did you catch from the synopsis that despite her appearance, she is actually a mild-mannered and well-meaning girl? No? Well don't worry, because all the anime does is remind you how mild-mannered and well-meaning she is. It wouldn't be as frustrating if she just did nice things \u2013 that would be endearing. Instead Kimi has to hold your head, direct your eyes toward the nice things that she does and scream in your ear, \"DO YOU SEE SAWAKO DOING THE THING? IT IS NICE THING! SAWAKO IS NICE GIRL!\" And all while the series is busy fellating Sawako, her only job is to fellate Kazehaya, the cheerful, magnetic God among men. Only this time it is even more obvious, because instead of visual cues metaphorically pointing it out and screaming in your ear, you have a character actually, literally pointing it out and screaming in your ear. Neither of these protagonists are even that bad, character-wise, but the show is so insistent on shoving their qualities in your face, that it becomes suffocatingly irritating, and any chance of depth or development is gone.\\n\\n\r\nNext, let's focus on the infinitely more interesting side characters: a sentence that has probably never come up when discussing ideas for the storywriting process of this series. Because their only job is to, you guessed it, fellate the two main characters. Apparently they get their own little romances, but I'd have to imagine it's a ridiculously minor bump amidst the chaotic gravel pit of \"look-at-Sawako-and-Kazehaya-do-absolutely-nothing-for-much-longer-than-you-need-to\" that is Kimi Ni Todoke.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can endure the line-a-minute pace of the show, and you love being continually reminded about why you have to like characters, then this is the show for you. Otherwise, don't bother. That refers to the entire genre, by the way.",

            "content": "Well, here we are... just before the last episode releases.  Now, I can pretty much guess what's going to happen from this point on, but I could still be surprised.  I still felt inclined to tell all of you what I thought about this show and why I'm still watching it and (somewhat) eagerly awaiting the final episode.  \r\nThere are times where you begin to watch an anime and you know deep down in your gut that you could never finish consuming such crap.  Other times, you can't wait to see the next episode, wondering what's going to happen next.For me, Kimi ni Todoke falls somewhere between those two extremes, only closer to the latter.  There are quite a few things that make this anime really shine above all the other slice-of-life school romance animes out there... that mainly being the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom the get-go,  you immediately fall in love with Sawako, not Sadako, and Kazehaya.  These two characters are the main focus of the story and are detailed enough that you feel like you know them personally.  Each character (including the sides, Ayane, Chizuru, Ryuu, heck, even Pin, are all given enough screen time to really feel like they belong in the story.  Names aside, what I am trying to say is that the character development is done extremely well and gives you just enough detail but doesn't bore you to death with each character's complete background and past.  \\n\\n\r\nOne other thing that stood out to me was the story itself.  Imagine an extremely shy girl (Sawako) whose name is extremely close to the girl from The Ring (Sadako), also looks somewhat like the girl from The Ring, and whose personality isn't exactly saving her from the Sadako label.  Now, set into motion the events that could possibly change this girls life as all her good qualities are brought to light by meeting a male character who can see past all the rumors and falsities of that Sadako label.  (C'mon, it's obvious from day 1 that Kazehaya has fallen for Sawako, and shortly after, vice versa)  Ok, so the story sounds cheesy as hell and lame too.  And, for the most part, it is.  But, it's told in such a manner that you feel sucked into the events and a part of everything.  As each character is developed more, relationships and interrelations fleshed out, you find yourself wanting more... addicted to the charming qualities of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there are a few minor weak points I noticed, those of which I can't really describe in detail without spoiling the story.  What I can say, is that there are times I felt as if this anime dragged on relentlessly, beating the same hum-drum monotony into my brain.  \"Oh come on!  Just say it already!\" were words often heard out of my mouth in several of the middle episodes.  It's obvious to you as the viewer, but of course, the characters are oblivious and clueless.  Which, I suppose adds to the charm and humor of the story, but for 25 episodes?  Really?  I think this story could have been told successfully in 12.  Maybe a little rushed, not giving you that in-depth connection with a character...\\n\\n\r\nStill, would I recommend this anime to a friend?  Absolutely.  Would that friend slap me across the face?  ...depends upon which friend I recommend this to.  \\n\r\nBe prepared for a story that is light-hearted, feel-good, and overall, fun to watch.",

Something must be up and it's my fault~~waa,waa, waa*** lets spend 5 episodes on it!!!\" That's basically the jist of the story alright. \r\n About the characters\r\nThe main female has a running joke on her.

I seriously binge watched this anime and I decided to ignore all my chores, and oh boy.. the regrets I'm feeling right now. This anime just reminded me on how I loathe romantic movie/anime/show.\r\nStory: 4\r\nIt says dreadful because yes it is dreadful, thoug it deserved a 1! I expected so much more since a lot of my tomodachi recommended this show to me after I asked them to recommend an anime like Ore Monogatari since I really loved Ore Monogatari even though I'm not a big romance/shoujo fan, so I reallyhad a very high expectations when it comes to this anime. I was so disappointed. The story was so sloooooow. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that I've read a lot of good reviews for this show, I am so utterly and high-key disappointed with the story. It's just your another typical cliche romance.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nProbably the one I loved the most in this anime is its art since it reminded me of a ol' Studio Ghibli art. But sometimes it seems off, but I still loved it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nWell, I kinda liked the music of this anime, but I always skipped the OP and the ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nOh boy the characters. Why is it always have to a weird girl and a popular and handsome guy? Ugh. I expected so much more from Kazehaya and Sawako's character development (I'm not saying there's no character development), but I need more especially from Sawako. \\n\\n\r\nMy fave character in the anime are obviously Chizu and Ayane. I just enjoyed these two a lot. I love their character developments and what else.. uhhh yes their reactions, their faces, their love for Sawako. That's it, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nI really appreciate the humor, the reason why I decided to finish this anime because of the comedy, but when I think about the romance I just ugh. Yes, I know it's a romantic anime, but this anime was recommended a lot by the people who loved Ore Monogatari since I really loved and enjoyed Ore Monogatari. Welp. Yet again, I was so disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely not gonna rewatch this and the 2nd season, I reckon I'm just going to spoil myself by asking the people who watched it on what's going to happen to Kazehaya and Sawako just to save myself from the pain.",

            "content": "I'm not a big Shoujo girl, and that became increasingly obvious the longer I watched this series. \r\nI will say, several of the first episodes brought me to sappy weepy tears. The main character, Sawako, is a lonely girl whose attempts to make friends routinely fail due to her outwardly intimidating appearance. The tried and true \"don't judge a book by its cover\" will be shoved in your face for multiple episodes as you learn Sawako is actually very sweet, and she usually interprets the horrible treatment she receives from her peers as other people being cooler than her. \r\nThose were the moments that reallygot to me in the beginning - I haven't seen a whole lot of slice of life anime that's dealt with bullying, and I felt like it was done very well here.\\n\\n\r\nI will be honest, past that, this show became more of a guilty pleasure for me (as it is with most Shoujo. Why can't I just embrace my femininity??) and I felt embarrassed to be watching it the more I saw. Kimi ni Todoke suffers from the run-of-the-mill Shoujo traits that can be extremely jarring for someone who may have difficulty getting into it.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, people will have VERY bland conversations, but the characters involved will feel the need to gasp with widened eyes after every line the other speaks. \\n\r\nA: Hi B-chan\\n\r\n*animators zoom in dramatically on B-chan's mouth/eyes*\\n\r\nB: A-kun, I-I-I like your pickles. *blush*\\n\r\nA: *small gasp, animators draw hair-shadow in replacement of eyes*\\n\r\nEtc.\\n\\n\r\nIn all seriousness, this show is good fun: it doesn't take itself too seriously, there's plenty of humour, and it's quite cute. I'll be following up with the manga to see where it goes after the second season, but I didn't feel like this one left a huge impact on my soul that will influence my cognitive functioning for the next 12 years. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like most of the Shoujos you've seen, I'd say check it out. If you don't, don't.",

It' one of the shows anime's that I just couldn't bare to watch anymore so I dropped it.\r\n The story is not really original as everyone says it is. It is the classic tale of a unpopular, misunderstood girl gaining friends and becoming liked by everyone, experiencing love and yada yada yada. We can see a story like this in... well basically most of the school life shoujo's. Some might say that Kimi ni Todoke is not like those because ithas a similarity to the real life more then those. Well if you are looking for realistic stuff then I guess anime is not really your type is it? Try watching a reality show.\\n\\n\r\n The art is nothing special either. The characters are drawn without much details and it's really simple. I can't really praise the sound either because...well Sawako's voice is so damn annoying, really!\\n\\n\r\n I can't say that there is poor character development because both in anime and manga the character development takes so long that you are bored out of your mind after some point.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Overall if you have nothing else to do just go ahead and watch it but it's nothing special unless it is your first time watching a shoujo anime.\\n",

            "content": "Kimi Ni Todoke is by far one of the most original and purest forms of a romance and high school anime. I instantly fell in love with the two main characters, both as a couple and as individuals.\r\nSawako is the ideal pure girl, whose story of overcoming social barriers is truly uplifting and relatable. Kazehaya is an admirable, outgoing yet has an inner shell of insecurity like most teenagers. Seeing them freak out, laugh, smile, and cry gives the viewer an emotional connection with the characters.\r\nThe art diverges between comical and \"normal\", which I enjoyed though others may want more of the normal art style.However, they choose the right moments for each. The soundtrack for the show was very well done in the sense that it gave me goosebumps for each emotional scene. The plot develops phenomenally as far as romance animes are concern.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally: I could relate to Sawako's social development and I love how pure she is. I could also relate to being outgoing like Kazehaya, yet being nervous around the one you like. The only thing that could make it better is including more seasons. I prefer it over toradora and lovely complex because it is more believable and they develop the characters better in my opinion. It is the best romance anime I have ever seen.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The first season of Kimi ni Todoke is really something special. To put it briefly, it is a show that simultaneously both rejects and indulges in the structure of its genre. It defines many of the core aspects and tropes of its genre, while demonstrating why they are relevant and valid. At the same time it also casts out many tropes and clich\u00e9s that distract from the main driving focus of the show. Even when the show is dead set on incorporating some tired plot contrivance, it manages to execute it with tact and finesse. It's show that knows what it is, what it's doing,and why it exists in the first place. Coupled with Production I.G.'s distinctive aesthetics, and direction, Kimi ni Todoke is a show with an air of absolute confidence. It has a goal, and achieves it flawlessly.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is a Shoujo in the purest sense of the word. To call it anything else not only sells the show itself short, but whatever genre it gets lumped in with as well. Its foundation is so concrete, and unabashedly in love with its forefathers, that it's almost not even a point of discussion. It does everything a typical Shoujo should do. Timid, loner, socially awkward female protagonist? Check. Said protagonist falling in love with the most popular boy in her school/class? Check. A token bitch girl who is also in love with the protagonists boyfriend? Check. Said bitch hatching an elaborate scheme to win over the protagonists boyfriend? Check. Side characters that exist for comic relief, with only one real, major, subplot? Check. Christmas episode? Check. Cultural Festival? Well no, but there is a sports festival that's used in much the same way. Small, multi-episode, arcs that are only tangentially related to one another? Check. I could go on all day about this stuff, but I think the point is fairly self-evident: Todoke has no real aspirations to dramatically alter the formulas or structures of its genre. Instead, more often than not (which we will get to later), it seeks to validate these tropes and give them the credit they deserve. The protagonist Sawako herself is a great example of this. She fits the shy, introverted, Shoujo protagonist mold to a \"t\" (or rather a \"d\"). While she does have unique, defining, traits that do make her stand out from the horde of other shy, and introverted, Shoujo protagonists, these differences do not define her as a character. Everything from her appearance (save perhaps the excessive hair length) to her personality is still firmly rooted in that proverbial mold. The only difference is that she is fleshed out just enough, such that she could pass off as a truly authentic human being. Her actions are always, and I repeat ALWAYS, within her character. The subtle embellishments made to her character just allow her to never have to break character. The amount of flexibility added from the changes to her mold, as well as the characters around her, make it so the work can remain as true to its archetypes as possible, while maintaining a distinct presence and letting the plot flow as naturally as possible. In short it made a necessary sacrifice in order to improve upon its foundation. This goes for almost every trope in the show. From the rest of the cast, to the events that take place, everything (for the most part) is only slightly altered from the blueprints of the genre. Beyond giving the work a slightly more distinct style, these alterations also draw attention to the tropes in the first place. I can't even begin to count the number of times I saw something happen, made a prediction, was either right or wrong (it usually didn't really matter), and then reflected on what I had just watched. The scene where Chizuru went on a walk with Ryuu's brother is a prime example of this. I was waiting for the moment where he would do something bad, or at least morally ambiguous, because, you know, that's just the thing that happens in Shoujos. It gives a reason for the protagonist in question to give up on their idol. However, throughout the scene, as well as the show, he doesn't really do anything but good for Chizuru, instead acknowledging Chizuru as somewhat of a spiritual sister. I actually had to take a minute, pause the episode, and digest exactly what had happened. After a few, quiet, minutes of thought I came to the conclusion that the scene actually still had the same desired effect, and outcome, as the run of the mill, predatorial meetings that are so commonplace in the genre. It both created, and resolved, drama, and gave the protagonist a legitimate call to action. Throughout the scene I was fully aware of the trope being used in the moment, as made obvious by my premonitions, however the work managed to somewhat trick me into thinking that something else had actually happened after the fact. It wasn't until I actually sat down (or rather stayed sitting) are really thought about what was taking place, that I saw the scene for what it was. It was exactly what I thought it was, just turned on its head. It was a clever little trick that really got me to think about that that scene was meant to do not only in Todoke itself, but in Shoujos in general. By repurposing the plot point to fit the story, it offered a valid case for its possible effectiveness when executed correctly. A trope that I had initially thought was played out, now seems to have just a little more life thanks to this show.\\n\\n\r\nWith that portion of the gushing out of the way, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the other side of the coin. Just because Todoke is so in love with the Shoujo archetype, does not mean that it doesn't see the general shortcomings of some of its most popular tropes. The show will disown a trope just as quickly as it embraces one. One of the most notable examples of this, as well as the first time I noticed it myself, was with the conflict that many Shoujos spend a loin's share of their runtime resolving: rumors. Yes Todoke does in fact have a typical \"Shoijo Bitch\", and yes one of the early conflicts in the show does revolve around lies she is spreading about the Sawako's friends in order to break up their friendship because it's getting in between her and her future boyfriend. The blame for starting these rumors obviously falls on Sawako, because obviously nobody has the mental capacity to remember who actually told them the story, and her friends catch wind of it. Through a few misunderstandings, and awkward conversations, the trust of Sawako's friends start to wane as the suspect that she might have possibly been involved in this. At this point most shows would devote the next three to five episodes playing this drama out before the protagonist was eventually exonerated. It's generally a tedious process that is what turns most anime fans I know away from Shoujo in the first place. However the way Todoke handles this conflict is remarkable to say the least. Instead of having the friends wildly jump to conclusions in order to force some drama out of the show, they instead simply have them do what any logical sane person would do from the start: they simply ask Sawako, who has been nothing but 100% honest with them up until that point, if she started the rumors. Sawako says no, and that's good enough for them, and the viewer. While the trope itself isn't dumb, they did include it in the show after all, its execution does bring up an obvious point. Most of the time this trope is simply misused, and just thrown in to cover up whatever deep seeded issue a show has. Most of the time it only adds superficial drama when used, and is constantly dragged out for far to long. Just as I reflected of the scene with Ryuu's brother, this moment made me give another long hard mental deconstruction of this trope. The small amount of payoff, solving the superficial problem of the group being split up, for the amount of time it takes makes a fairly obvious statement about the writers disposition about the trope. It's elegant, while still being obvious. While Todoke only does this kind of thing from time to time, it helps reinforce the structural aspects of its genre does embrace. It lets the viewer know that while Todoke does love being a Shoujo, it is still cautious in its decisions of what to accept whole-heartedly.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real, serious, issue I had with this show was pacing. If I am being completely honest with myself the show does sag a little bit around the Sports Festival arc. When I actually watched this show, I put it on the back-burner around episode 12 or so because I felt that the show was just kind of treading water. In this arc, the token bitch character is given her chance to grow and evolve, but despite that she stays fairly stagnant over the five or so episode arc. It's the same arc we've all seen a million times, and Todoke really didn't really do much different. Stop me if you heard this one before, but, one of the most popular girls in the school has really been masking her abusive personality all along. To make matters worse Todoke pops the true personality card early in the arc, and all that's really left to see is her plan fall apart. It wouldn't be so awkward if it wasn't so obvious she was going to fail. Much like the fools gold arc in the second season of Spice and Wolf, there is really no reason to think that the cannon pairing will be split apart for any reason. The buildup is bland, and the payoff is also lacking. They even go as far as to make a big deal out of establishing the bitch as a token rival, but then never do anything with her again (within the season, calm down). This coupled with the awkwardly placed recap episode make the second quarter of this show a little bit of a drag compared to the rest of the content.\\n\\n\r\nI could mention the art by Production I.G. or the fantastic voice work, but I don't really think those points need to be discussed, so I'll just close out. The simple fact is that Kimi ni Todoke does far to many things extremely well to really level any just criticism at it. The sag I mentioned was really only a sag in comparison to the rest of the show, and by general Shoujo standards it was by no means bad. On the flipside the show redefined what it really means to be a Shoujo. It deconstructs the very structure of the genre, offering its own criticism, while offering an enjoyable ride on the surface. To top it all off it executes everything with such sincerity it's hard not to fall in love. Even though this show takes a bit of prior knowledge to truly appreciate, it is still one of the ideal entry points to the genre as well. It is truly a must watch in every aspect of the word, and has set a standard for the shows that came after it. If for some reason you haven't seen it, and are digging deep enough for this review, just watch it, it's probably not worse than anything else you're gonna watch this season.",

I love you\u2026 I love you\u2026 I love you\u2026\"\r\nLove is a pretty powerful thing, isn't it? I've been in love before, and for those of you who haven't experienced love first-hand, I can honestly say that it changes you. There are a lot of romance animes out there, but very, VERY few of them have actually given me a good idea of what love is really like. We have shows like Date A Live, LoveHina, and Shuffle! All of those are classified as \"Romance\", but do any of them actually tell you what love really means? Now, we take a look at shows like Clannad and Kanon. Those are also classified as \"Romance\", and they give you a good idea of what love is like. Kimi ni Todoke is one of those animes, and in my opinion, it's one of the best romance animes of all time. So, without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nEnter Sawako, your residential ghost... well, sort of. Her classmates misunderstand her. They think she's the type of person that performs rituals and can speak to ghosts. Well, she's not. She's a sweet, shy, kind-hearted girl that everyone just needs to get to know in order to understand her better. Now, enter Kazehaya, one of the most popular boys in school, and also one of the nicest people you could meet in your life. He treats everyone fairly, and he's always looking to make friends. On the day of the high school entrance exams, the two meet. Ever since then, Sawako has been drawn to him, hoping to one day become his friend. Over time, the two gradually become closer, as well as the rest of her class and her. She starts making friends, and people start liking her a lot more. Of course, there are always challenges along the way, ranging from lies, rivals of love, and heartbreak. At first glance, it might not seem like the most original anime out there. Trust me when I say this, it honestly is, and I enjoyed all of it.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke was brought to you by Studio I.G, and was directed by Hiro Kaburaki. You might recognize Studio I.G from other pieces of work such as Appleseed XIII, FLCL, and the ever so popular Ghost in a Shell series, and if you've seen Zenryoku Usagi, Hiro Kaburaki directed it. Anyways, the artwork was great. I liked all the character designs and the animations were good. That's one of the things I like about Shoujo animes, they give a realistic feel to the art style.\\n\\n\r\nAs most of you know, Kimi ni Todoke does not have an English Dub... yet. Due to it's popularity in the Animeverse, the hopes of a Dub may be answered someday, but for now, all we have, are these awesome Subs. Yes, awesome. All of the voice acting was done professionally, and it was filled with passion and an overall likableness. The first voice actress I immediately recognized was Mamiko Noto, who had voiced Kotomi in Clannad and Nodoka in the Negima! series. She played the role of Sawako perfectly. Fit her personality and everything. I can also say the same thing about the rest of the cast. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters... characters, characters, characters... I liked a lot of them... but there was one character... that one character that killed my soul every time she showed her ugly face. So, let's start off with Sawako. She was perfect in a lot of ways. She was pretty, funny, and I'd honestly love to be her friend. Now, she's not exactly the brightest person in the world... she doesn't really know when she's being teased, which in my opinion could have been the only thing they could have changed, but, then again, it was one of the things I loved about her at the same time. Next is Kazehaya. He is, awesome. Super nice, friendly, and I love how red his face gets whenever he thinks about Sawako, it's super entertaining to watch. Then there's Ryuu. He was probably the funniest character in this show. I know that's saying a lot since he has the fewest lines in the show, despite being one of the main characters, but he is honestly hilarious. Might have actually been my favorite character in the series now that I think about it... Ayane and Chizuru were awesome friends, and I really loved how they were there for Sawako for most of the show. Lastly... Kurumi... ugh. Everyone hates her. No joke. She is the most annoying character in this entire series, and I really want to STRANGLE HER. I find myself yelling at my screen whenever she comes into the scene, and more than once someone has come in to see why I was yelling for no reason at 2:00 A.M. Overall, it was a really good selection of characters, despite the one who shows up in over half the episodes...\\n\\n\r\nLoved it. I loved it a lot. I can't describe how much I loved this series. There were few flaws in this anime, and most of them were very small, except for the one flaw called Kurumi. That was a pretty big one, but either way, it was vital to the story to have her in it. But if you are waiting for me to tell you if I recommend this anime to you or not, you should have figured it out in the first paragraph of this review. Of course I recommend it. It's one of those animes that you need to watch, especially if you want to know the true meaning of love. Even if you don't want to know, watch it anyways. It was entertaining and overall beautiful.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhen it comes to relationships, we normally take what we have for granted. Friends, family, lovers; there are many types, but each is a precious thing. I certainly don't think about the many different relationships I have because to me they have come quite naturally and easily. However, for Sawako in Kimi ni Todoke, it is the nurturing and development of these relationships that define the show and what make it so good to watch.\r\nSTORY\r\nTo give a basic rundown, Kimi ni Todoke stars Kuronuma Sawako, a high school girl who, due to her appearance, has a slightly difficulttime making friends. As such, she is usually alone. However, when she meets the boy Kazehaya Shouta, she finds that her life is given a breath of fresh air.\\n\r\nSomething that the show does incredibly well, and that I allude to in my preview, is the development of relationships. It focuses heavily on what it means to be a friend, rival, or loved one. In order to do this properly, the show presents many scenarios in which the characters get to experience the many sides to these relationships. Sadness, happiness, frustration, jealousy, anger; they are all present and treated equally.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, while the show is technically a romance show, the romance portion doesn't truly kick in until the second half. The first half deals mostly with friends and friendship. Sawako learns what it means to have friends (and to not have them, too) and how to interact with them on a daily basis. Kimi ni Todoke does a wonderful job in building up Sawako's confidence and demeanor towards those around her. She starts off being rather shy and submissive. But as the show progresses, the relationships she shares with her friends and Kazehaya allows her to mature and grow.\\n\\n\r\nFriendship gives way to romance during the second half. It's at this point, however, that the show switches the point of view for a bit towards one of the other characters, Chizu. While I still enjoyed the arc in which her type of relationship was explored, I would have preferred the show to have stuck with Sawako. However, even then, the show uses this opportunity to demonstrate again how relationships are handled, both by the main party and by those outside of it.\\n\\n\r\nNarratively speaking, the ending is not that good. It leaves you with a lot to be desired, and as such, the second season was almost mandatory.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is hard to describe artistically. On the one hand, it utilizes what Nisikoi loved to do, and that is bringing in the \"sparkle\" effects every chance they could get. On top of that, the show looks rather soft in appearance; the colors are vibrant yet not loud. The softness of the show reminded me of those from the 90s or early 2000s even though it was made in 2010/2011. This isn't a bad thing per se, but if you are looking for art styles that are more \"modern\" (Aldnoah.Zero, Chuunibyou, etc.) then it may turn you off.\\n\\n\r\nThe show follows Nisekoi once again in the way it exaggerates the characters faces and animations. Constantly (and almost always for comedic effect), Sawako is depicted more \"roundly\" than usual. As an example, here she is normally and here she is when she is reacting to a situation. For me, I really enjoy \"reaction faces\" during anime, so I would always find myself laughing at Sawako and the others when they used this effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were actually nice because they seemed appropriate for the seriousness of the show. The characters look slightly older than their age would dictate, but I enjoyed seeing such characters. Many shows have their characters look younger or high school aged, but throughout Kimi ni Todoke I never really viewed them as looking like high schoolers, but college students or something similar.\\n\\n\r\nAs for actual animation, there really isn't much to be seen. A lot of what goes on in Kimi ni Todoke is dialogue. As such, there are a lot of face shots and single character moments on-screen. In this context, this doesn't really bother me since the writing was always nicely done and captured my interest.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is anything wrong with the animation/art, it is the use of the \"one-eyed\" face shots. Similar to the \"no-eyed\" face shots, they were used in situations where the character was feeling sadness or some form of embarrassment. Again, here is a really relevant example (and probably the worst offender). I understand what they were trying to do with these types of shots, but when they happened (and thankfully not too often), it was slightly off-putting.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI liked the characters in Kimi ni Todoke. I don't think I loved any of them but each one is more or less nicely written.\\n\\n\r\nSawako, our main lead and narrator, starts off by herself and content with the world she has. But as her number of friends grows from zero, she begins to learn about the things she had so desperately wanted. From having normal \"girl talk\" to hanging out after school, she realizes that the time she has spent with everyone during the year is more precious to her than anything that came before it. Besides her budding relationships, she is extremely kind to others but prone to gullibility and misunderstandings. She has a difficult time dealing with the feelings she has, especially those for Kazehaya, but the other characters help her out in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nAyane and Chizu, Sawako's first friends, are also good characters. The former is a \"pretty girl\" who enjoys make-up while the latter is your typical \"tomboy\". Early on, you don't think that they will have such prominent roles in the story but they later on get a considerable amount of screen-time each. As I have said, there main purpose is to help Sawako to build the relationships that she has, both with them, with Kazehaya, and with everyone else. Ayane and Chizu both care deeply about Sawako and her well-being, and it was always joyful to see them going out of their way for their dear friend.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I want to talk about two more characters, Kazehaya and Kurumi. Kazehaya is the main male lead and subsequently the love interest. Throughout most of the show, he is Sawako's idol; she wishes she could be just as popular and as easy-going as he is. But what she learns from him is that it is not about emulating others, but it is best to just be yourself. He exemplifies kindness, happiness, and relaxation. At the same time, he explains how he is actually slightly selfish and easily embarrassed. While he maintains these traits throughout the show, I wish they would have explored his character a bit more deeply, instead of focusing on Chizu during the middle of the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThe other character, Kurumi, gets a special nod because of how much they made me hate her. Not wanting to spoil anything, Kimi ni Todoke does a fantastic job of creating this perfect rival that you love to hate. Unfortunately, and uncharacteristically of the show, after her arc's climax and resolution, she was pretty much forgotten about. Perhaps the writers had nothing more to say with her in mind, but I felt that such a good character had gone to waste.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps because the show is designated as shoujo, the OP is sung by a male artist. I thought this to be interesting because the majority of OPs and EDs are sung by women. I thought that was an appropriate choice for the show and fit it nicely. As for the OP itself, I thought it was fine but nothing amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said for the ED. It isn't generic and I like it somewhat, but it is nothing stellar. It does, however, evoke feelings of longing and togetherness that I quite enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself uses many piano melodies and quiet tracks that set the mood for the scenes. The pieces that are played were always nice to hear and never seemed out of place within the show. Also of note was the shows lack of music in certain situations that accentuated those scenes. It made them stand out significantly due to your only sense being your eyes. Meaning, in those situations, you are truly fixated on what is happening on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, I thought it was done nicely. Ryu's VA less so than the others (I thought he sounded slightly too old for his character) but Sawako's VA more so than the others (she does a fantastic job switching between serious/sweet and funny/rough).\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI say this all the time here on the subreddit (and will continue to say it!), but I am a big romantic at heart. So it should come as no surprise that I absolutely loved this show. The show, like Clannad, is surprisingly more funny than it lets on. Most of this comes from the \"rounder\" art styling that I mentioned previously. Sawako especially has very interesting reactions to the things that go on simply because she has never experienced them before.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance elements are very nicely done as well. What I liked the most is the gradual build-up. Sawako and Kazehaya don't just immediately fall in love because they happened to look at one another. Instead, it is the way in which they act around each other and what they do for one another that sets up the feelings that they share.\\n\\n\r\nKazehaya himself is a true gentleman, always saying the right lines at the right times (I am jealous of this power!). Sawako's smile makes you smile. Chizu's soft side makes you laugh while Ayane's sadistic nature makes you scared. Pin is a big goofball while Kurumi is a grade-A bitch. Simply put, I enjoyed all of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kimi ni Todoke gives you a wonderful look into how important relationships can be. They are powerful tools that make you laugh due to happiness, make you angry due to misplaced trust, or even make you cry due to unrequited feelings. The show explores all of these possibilities and more, and because of this, I really liked this show.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, Sawako's journey to make friends and foes alike is pleasing to watch\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, soft on the eye mixed with \"rounder\" animation is a fun combination\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, most are explored greatly while others are sadly forgotten\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, OP and ED are okay but the soundtrack makes up for them\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, smiles throughout with realistic romantic development\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Do you recall the time where you did not fit in at a new school and had no friends at all? Did you recall the time where you made your true and real friend? Did you remember the time you fell in love or like someone?\r\nWell, Kimi Ni Todoke is all of the above. It doesn't really have a storyline but it is still a very, very good romance anime. I loved it very much. If you experienced all of the above + watched Kimi Ni Todoke and not like it - you must be insane. \r\nOkay, that's quite rude, isn't it? But then -Kimi Ni Todoke is more of a \"slice of life\" movie + \"girl\" yes, definitely a girl romance anime but this doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed by males!\\n\\n\r\nIt shows the life of Kuronuma Sawako who is trying her best to make friends but finds it hard because of a rumor started in the school about her having the same resemblance to Sadako's \"The Ring\" + her being a witch and all...\\n\\n\r\nPlus, it doesn't help that she's shy and acts weirdly each time someone tries to talk to her. But thanks to a boy...a very friendly and popular boy who is well liked by everyone - Kazehaya, who said \"Hi\" to her...and maybe, just maybe, her life would be different - for once.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's just my \"lame\" plot but yeah...I tried my best. hehe.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the story a lot. I'm not sure if it's original or not since I'm kinda sick of all those \"Lots of guys fall in love with this girl\" thing or \"Dumb girl falls in love with ridiculously handsome boy and tries her best\" plot so to me, this plot was refreshingly new and different.\\n\\n\r\nMany people may dislike it because of the slow-pacing of the romance but for someone like me - I really really dislike slow paced movies - especially fillers episodes, they get on my nerves - really, but this series - wow oh wow...each episode makes me CRAVE FOR MORE!!\\n\\n\r\nIt's slow but it shows us how the romance between Kazehaya and Kuronuma slowly bloomed...it's so sweet it makes me squeal with glee just to see them acting awkwardly in front of each other. Because, like I said, it's more of a \"slice of life\" romance anime and tells us how a girl falls in love and make friends for the first time. It's definitely a refreshing concept. \\n\\n\r\nKuronuma making friends for the first time and making a new rival - it is so interesting to watch because it's not new to us but it's new - to her. To watch it from her view is superb interesting cause we all know how it feels to make a new rival or a new true friend. \\n\\n\r\nWhilst I watch this, I thought of the first time I liked someone and the first time, I found my true friends...it was so memorable and being able to \"be in\" Kuronuma's point of view made it even cooler.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nAt first, I didn't like the characters design which is why I never thought of watching it till I heard about all the good reviews about it so I decided to give it a try - and heck, I'm glad I did! Because sometimes, I hear good reviews about a particular movie and they end up disappointing me so I'm really glad Kimi Ni Todoke didn't!\\n\\n\r\nHow wrong I am. The characters looked more like \"real\" people and they aren't TOO hot to begin with. I'm so scared of hot bishies because seriously, people have a knack for drawing beautiful male characters and that would make me lose control. Ha ha. ha. Just kidding but yeah. They look real and it's neat. :)\\n\\n\r\nThe background was oh-so-pretty and detailed. Yes. Detailed. It isn't some scribble form of buildings/doodles but instead, I get to see detailed background. The bubbles add a nice and soft romantic touch to it as well. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation was um...alright. It wasn't that great because sometimes, it looks a little fake but oh well, with such a great story to boot, who cares about the little animation fault? :D\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI love love love love love the sound that I downloaded both the OP and the ED song. Very, very nice :) Plus, the songs have nice meanings - go google them and you will see what I mean! Of course I didn't forget about the background music! That's what made the music more \"enjoyable\"! I could say that...the background music was appropriate - when it's sad - sad music comes up and so on...\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED song was the one that gave me a huge impact - background music was ok although I didn't take notice of it much. When I don't take notice of a background music, it's either\\n\\n\r\n1) It' fits the mood perfectly so I have no questions about it\\n\\n\r\n2) Not much of a huge impact for me to remember it\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to character :)\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSawako's demure personality is so lovable. She's so pure and so...innocent and is friendly with almost everyone. It's so sad that she appears so scary outside when she's trying to interact with someone just because she doesn't know how to. But inside, she's just a normal girl like everyone else. It's cute how she experiences new things and you know - her chibi \"OMG\" self appears each time she experiences something new. Very cute.\\n\\n\r\nKazehaya is really oh wow different from male leads. He's not incredibly smart but he's very popular. To me, he looks quite average and is different from all those male leads - hot, handsome, smart, the Mr \"I'm perfect and you know it - be jealous, bitches\" HAHAHAHA. Ok, I'm exaggerating but yeah, you got my point. He's pretty much shy and has some flaws as well. \\n\\n\r\nIt's interesting to see how shy he gets + blushes whenever Kuronuma stares at him for too long.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters definitely gets a THUMB UP as well! I loved Ayane and Chizu - could you believe they actually became Sawako's close friends? Best friends maybe? :) I never expected them to be Sawako's best friends at first because of their personalities but they did :\") And they were so nice as well.\\n\\n\r\nChizuru - very cute and boyish! She's the highlight of the supporting characters - to me. She cries at the littlest things and is so tomboy-ish that it's cute. But inside, she's girly. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are not just \"stand-by\" or \"fillers\" if you get what I mean. They are here for a purpose and they are here to make a difference in Kuronuma's life and they DID.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it and you will know why. Supporting characters = the BOMB.\\n\\n\r\nOh. And as much as I hate Arai sensei, I must admit, he makes the series more interesting *evil laughter* watch it and you will know what I mean >:)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was very very enjoyable from the first episode up till the very end. But towards the end, I must admit - it does get a little boring. Character developments were there - Kuronuma changes to a more friendly behaviour and she's more open to new things and experiences so many new things in life but the romance between her and Kazehaya was disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nThe pace remained the same and there weren't any development in their romance. It was the same from the middle....which is why I rated it a 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to be honest, I think the Chizuru arc was just a filler story...but it is indeed an interesting filler story :) I laughed + cried a little when I watched it. It's sweet but what does it do for the couple? Nothing, right? So that's why I find it the filler a little useless but oh well..\\n\\n\r\nI did love the series a lot and constantly smile till my cheeks hurts + \"AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW\" like crazy and blush as well because let's face it girls, we've all been there - done it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I rate it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't mean that just cause I rate it a 10/10 - it has to be perfect.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just thoroughly enjoyable to me and it's one of the best romance anime I have ever watched. Very sweet and slow but still very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a series that reminds you of your old high-school days (I just graduated T_T i miss high school now) + makes you go \"awwwwwwwwwww\" + blush + feel your \"firsts\" experiences, then this series is definitely for you.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, I'd encourage everyone to watch it. It was a pleasant experience for me. I'm now on Season 2. Cheers :) \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading ^_^",

            "content": "KnT is a  school-time romantic comedy. Romantic school comedy. Ah, screw it you already know the drill. There is only about a million school-related anime out there.\r\nHopelessly naive and socially awkward Sawako is rescued by Prince Charming Kazehaya and is given friends for the first time in her life. Agonisingly slow emotional development follows. \r\nStory:\r\nThis story is pretty basic. What you see is what you get: namely, an uber-shy girl trying to outgrow her kindergarten personality, finding friends and love and not knowing either even if they smack her on the head. It is an underdog story and as such, it resonates with alot of audiences. But it is a very slow paced story and by the time it's over you realise that not much has actually happened. Every event is milked for all its worth and then some. I felt rather hoodwinked (like my awesome vocabulary power, eh?) by the whole thing but I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSawako is a girl who has never had any friends because everybody thought her creepy despite her being very beautiful and sweet (hey, don't laugh, this concept has worked very well for Hollywood where taking off your glasses makes you beautiful). Sawako is suspiciously similar (re: blatant copy) to Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge\u2019s Sunako (who is also friendless, creepy but beautiful and has the same haircut, like, the exact same haircut as well as a similar name). But anyway, this is shojo, a lot of recycling goes on in this genre. Sawako is at first shy and then becomes a little less shy. She is not very interesting because she doesn't do much, everything is pretty much happening to her instead of because of her efforts but she never really crosses the line to annoying moe. That is quite an achievement.\\n\r\nKazehaya is Prince Charming and has every good quality under the sun. He's popular, kind, helpful, handsome, understanding and sweet. Yeah, your typical sixteen year old teenage male. I was not put out by this perfection thing because frankly I hate the \u201carrogant asshole\u201d shojo archetype and I prefer watching types like Kazehaya immensely. \\n\r\nYoshida & Yano are Sawako\u2019s new friends. They are the sporty and the sexy respectively. These two feel very alive and are great fun to watch. I would say they and their relationships are much more interesting than the main couple. \\n\r\nKurumi is the sneaky rival. She is beautiful and popular and is fixated on getting Kazehaya. At some point I was feeling rather sorry for her because here she is, thinking up scheme after scheme like a mastermind and yet Sawako is doing nothing and still wins points. Sad panda.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are charming enough and make for nice comedy here and there. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIf you are familiar with shojo then you know that it has a pretty standard animation type. There are clear lines, rather blocky colours, a distinctive lack of backgrounds and once every five minutes the world stops and we enter the sparkly dimension. I am happy to say that KnT is very pretty, animation-wise. There is a watercolour-y feeling to it all, everything is bright and beautiful and full of sunlight. The studio put a lot of effort into this even if at first it seems simple. But you cannot escape the sparkly dimension.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP and ED songs are very sweet and beautifully matched the animation. Basically, the soundtrack has no need to be anything elaborate. It follows the mood and does not annoy when it's there. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nI've actually kept this one though I don't expect to watch it again very soon. I think I'll pull it out when I've forgotten how slow it goes and when I need something to pamper me into thinking that everything works out in the end. \\n",

            "content": "Kimi Ni Todoke Season 1 and 2 Review\r\nThis review is going to span both seasons of Kimi Ni Todoke, since I feel it is the best way to review the series. \r\nKimi Ni Todoke was produced by \u201cProduction I.G\u201d and is by far their best anime series production in my opinion. That\u2019s more so because most of Production I.Gs work isn\u2019t all that great to be honest-luckily Kimi Ni Todoke is an exception. The whole show aired between October 2009 and March 2011, with 25 episodes for season 1 and 12 episodes for season 2, making a grand total of 37 episodes. The show fallsunder the romance, school and shoujo categories and as a whole has been well received by the general public. \\n\r\nThis was a show that I had been constantly putting on hold, despite the various number of people telling me to watch it, but when I did eventually get round to watching it, I was pleasantly surprised. My perception had been that this would be yet another typical and very flat romance show which would just grab onto all the usual stereotypes that the majority of shows like this do tend to. To what extent this show conforms to that idea varies throughout, however more times than not, it seems to veer onto the positive side- not totally without its faults.\\n\r\nSeason 1 opens with the main character, Sadako, although virtually everyone in her high school calls her Sawako, due to misunderstandings from the past that are explained as the show goes on. Sadako is basically a feared figure, everyone believes she is a bringer of bad omens and do everything they can to avoid her so understandably she has no actual friends. Since this had been going on from an early age, Sadako gets accustomed to the treatment and for her it is part of daily life. In actuality, Sadako is a very nice and gentle person, however her extreme lack of social skills and various scary facial expressions seem to give everyone the wrong idea, her-what can be called aloofness- doesn\u2019t help her case either.  In this sense, I actually found Sadako\u2019s character to be a refreshing change from the general stereotype that I had been expecting and hence her character was definitely a big plus for the show, both as a concept and a driving force to give the show a solid platform from which to develop. Quite early on, she seems to make two new \u201cfriends\u201d, however she isn\u2019t too sure of what to call the connection since she\u2019s never actually had any friends. She feels like she\u2019s a drag on the two other girls and is very apologetic for everything she does initially and throughout. \\n\r\nA bit later on, we are introduced to the other protagonist, Kazehaya. Where Sawako was against the norm, Kazehaya most certainly isn\u2019t, not to say that\u2019s a bad thing. Kazehaya is the kind of person who appeals to all kinds of people and as he states himself, he \u201ccan\u2019t leave those who are lonely alone\u201d. It is down to this reason that he really notices Sawako initially and challenges the idea that people must avoid her. He also makes Sawako a friend and Sawako, taken aback by all these new, nice people, looks at Kazehaya with admiration. \\n\r\nThe rest of the season 1 is really just the story of how Sawako grows out of her own shell and starts to experience a host of new events, both bad and good. The events are can be fairly standard, ranging from friendship problems, rumours to straight out bullying. Although while the situations that are thrown up are fairly standard, the realistic way that they are dealt with is very appealing, it really helps to empathise with the characters and the situation at hand. \\n\r\nNow let me get on to what really made this one of those shows that made were extremely satisfying. While Kimi ni Todoke is a pure romance, drama show, the underlying themes are actually very well explored and executed to the same degree, even if expected. The ideas of friendship, socialising but also the friction, misunderstandings and rougher times are presented in a realistic way. Especially for a character for Sawako, it can be pleasing to see how much progress she makes. Her extremely point blank honesty can even land her in trouble and her inability to say the right things to convey her feelings put her in a few sticky positions- but the way she slowly battles her own insecurities and develops over the course of the show really helps you connect and feel for her. In this sense the show focuses less on the romance and more upon these other themes of friendship, social dynamic and just growing up through ones teens and such. \\n\r\nIt is clear that Sawako likes Kazehaya and this idea is slowly built up throughout the show-it is also fairly understandable just how worried Sawako is at dealing with the awkward situations that their interactions throw up-but at times I felt these were overdone and over-exaggerated, almost to the extent it was annoying and slowed down the show. \\n\r\nThere were a few things however that did not appeal to me so much, for one, the character design and the artwork was frankly not very good. At times I felt it really did detract from the overall experience of the show, sometimes even seeming to be a little bit rushed. It\u2019s the finer details that matter sometimes, but in terms of artwork, I feel Kimi ni Tokode across both seasons, kind of missed the mark. The OP and ED were good in my opinion, it sort of grew on you as the show continued.\\n\r\nSo season 1 in a nutshell was a great show, it really made me care for the characters and it was more or less engaging throughout the entire length of the show. Despite a few annoyances that we can gloss over, the show really stuck in my mind well after finishing it and more importantly it really made me want to jump straight into season 2. \\n\r\nSeason 2 sadly, did not quite live up to my expectations, it couldn\u2019t quite reach the heights that season 1 had managed to reach. The bar, I felt, had been set too high. \\n\r\nSeason 2 had a distinct focus on the romance but in my opinion it did not execute it well enough and the story progression was just too slow, tedious and frustrating for me. It was just too much of an annoyance to watch the most ridiculous situations get thrown up and the way the characters sometimes seem to go about it all. Sawako and Kazehaya took one step forwards and two steps backwards. Sawako\u2019s inability to speak and just convey her feelings across were just so frustrating- even if it were awkward she would seemingly stumble at every block.\\n\r\nThe characters are also presented in a slightly different manner- I will not say how so- however this sudden change just seems a little too rushed and feels all too forced. All in all season 2 doesn\u2019t give the full sense of closure that the show would need and just seems a little too slow.\\n\r\nThat is not to say that the second half is entirely bad, it does have some very nice moments nearer the end and interspersed in between every now and then. In the end it\u2019s just the inconsistency that kills it off. \\n\r\nSo in the end the whole show is still a treat to watch, just a shame they couldn\u2019t quite keep the momentum going right through to the end. It\u2019s a tale that can really suck you in emotionally and keep you interested and is certainly a show I would recommend to those interested in the genre. \\n\r\nMy final score would be a 9.0 for Season 1 and a 7.0 for season 2, giving an overall average of 8.0 across both seasons of the shows. \\n\r\nRecommendation wise, I would recommend \u201cKaichou Wa Maid Sama\u201d as I feel there a few similarities in the story and \u201cByousoku No Centimeter\u201d which a series of 3 episodes which has a very interesting take on life in general. It may not be similar, but it\u2019s a show that springs to mind when I think of Kimi ni Todoke. \\n\r\nEnjoy =)\\n\r\nTukky12\\n",

            "content": "Reaching You is smarter than it looks. It's a story disguised as a low-budget shoujo romance anime, but its script is cleverly crafted in the spirit of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. The narrative plays out typical to the T, featuring a socially awkward female as the main character that somehow becomes entangled with the school's most popular guy.\r\nThe main girl is named Sawako. Although the story makes you feel like you're watching Sawako live out her high school years, in reality she's actually dead - and  no, that's not a spoiler.\r\nThe story makes it very clear early on that everything that's happening around Sawakois inside her own head, or more specifically, her soul.  Despite Sawako's complete inability to understand people and their emotions, everyone in her school starts to gradually treat her like a saint. Her new-found friends are completely obsessed with her and whenever they're apart, they talk about Sawako incessantly. At first you may pass their dialogue as completely normal, but when these scenes keep repeating, the positive emotions begin waning. As you start paying closer attention, the heartwarming scenes begin to feel awkward, like the author is trying to drill a message into your lazy brain.\\n\\n\r\nReaching You's story takes place in a high school. Sawako doesn't have a single friend there. People actively call her Sadako instead of Sawako, it's a joke based on her creepy resemblance to the ghost from Ring, the famous Japanese horror movie. The first scene of the series is in a bathroom, a classic stage for horror. Later in the season we return to this place to find clues on how Sawako actually died. Despite this and other blatantly anvilicious clues, one could still be easily swayed to think Reaching You is just a cheaply produced romance anime - one would be wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest indication of the author's intent is the abundantly utilized bubble-effect. I dub this effect \"emo bubbles\", because the bubble backgrounds appear every time when Sawako feels strong positive emotions. Though \"emo bubbles\" are a common cost-cutting trick in romantic anime (artists can skip painting backgrounds when there's bubbles), their frequency in Reaching You is extraordinary. Instead of making the viewer feel happy and connected to Sawako's character on her important moments, the constant usage of the bubble effect actually starts to feel grating. One particular episode featured over thirty bubble effects, and during some of its scenes you would see this effect every second shot. This is when I started feeling unexpectedly uneasy in the stomach, like my subconscious self was noticing something was off. It was only after watching near the entire first season that I realized what was happening: Reaching You is designed to feel uncomfortable on purpose. The authors intentionally try to strike a stark, yet subtle contrast which challenges most people's perception of reality. The bubbles are symbolic of the metaphorical bubble Sawako is living inside, they indicate the delusions her ghostly being is experiencing during her crossing to the afterlife.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a scene in the middle episodes of season 1 where Sawako is cornered by a group of gangster girls. Once again, she's alone in the restroom against a hoard of bitches. Miraculously, she is saved by her friends without any violence, but the emotional release fails to materialize. At first I thought this crucial scene, this big turning point in Sawako's life, was dragged out needlessly, as it took an entire episode to finish the climax - with the minutes rolling and close to nothing happening, the climax didn't happen for me. This scene took so much more time than necessary and it felt so watered down in the end that there was no payoff. Even the dialogue felt odd and hollow, like there was no drama, like there was no struggle. In fact, not a single punch was thrown, even though the emotional dynamic in the scene seemed built on the anticipation of violence erupting. Sawako defies her bullies who completely outnumber her, yet nobody gets hurt, not even when the cavalry arrives.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the hints on the table, it's not even a challenge to decipher the meta narrative: Sawako died in this restroom. Everything that happens in the scene is the exact reverse; the big crowd waiting outside the toilet, Sawako's love interest showing up to reconcile with her, her friends coming to the rescue - they're Sawako's dream of what should've happened, but didn't.\\n\\n\r\nI would've passed this off as just a mediocre romance anime, were it not for the symbolic \"emo bubbles\" tipping me off about the story within the story. Instead of making me feel warm and fuzzy, like a good romance anime usually does, Reaching You made me feel anxious, pained and emotionally hollow. I can absolutely respect the series' artistic merits, even though I couldn't bring myself to enjoy it.",

She's bad at making friends: when she tries to talk to people, they always run away in fear. She doesn't know by herself, but when she tries to talk she always has an expression of a ghost. That's the reason she gets the nickname: Sadako (from the ring). Sawako's wish is to make friends, but that's very hard as you can see. She admires her classmate, Kazehaya-kun, who is populair and very nice to everyone, even with her.\r\nI think Kimi Ni Todoke is such a great story.I really like the fact that the main character, Kuronuma Sawako, is a girl who isn't perfect in all ways like maincharacters in most romance animes do. I also love the fact that the drawing style in the anime is similiar to the drawing style in the manga.",

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke is about friendship and love. It joins breathtaking art with original characters and plausible story development, and it really does not require of you to look the other way in order to believe the story.  \r\nWhen you start watching Kimi ni Todoke you will probably think that Sawako Kuronuma is just another passive high school girl in love with the beautiful and popular dark boy from her class. But she is not. Sure, she is shy and insecure, but she also takes charge when it's needed, and she never allows for misunderstandings to develop into something worse. She is naive attimes, but she isn't stupid and ignorant.\\n\r\nOne of the most refreshing traits of the series are definitely the male characters. They are not larger-than-life, 16-going-on-40 guys. They are as insecure and shy as the girls, and they get embarrassed, and have troubles expressing their feelings. \\n\r\nI loved the fact that love is not unnaturally forced onto the characters, it doesn't just spring up all of a sudden; it develops, and we actually see why someone is in love and how this happened. \\n\r\nThe naivety of the story and character portrayal comes from youth and inexperience, and not from the story itself. I found this very refreshing and quite nostalgic because Kimi ni Todoke reminded me of how my friends and I have gone through some similar experiences and troubles.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kimi ni Todoke is clever, beautiful, cute and different. I recommend watching it, and I am certain you will enjoy it at least as much as I did.\\n",

The mix of romance, comedy and drama, very common in shoujos is poorly done here. The characters have unbelievable reactions in the situations they are exposed, a single smile is enough to be head over heels with someone and the whole series drags on how none of them will do absolutelynothing to try getting some development on the romance component of this show. \\n\r\nThe comedy is often out of place, just as a relief more than anything else. The comic expressions are amusing in the beginning of the show, but later on they feel totally unnecessary.\\n\r\nThe drama... what drama? Some silly conflicts due to the lack of attitude or unbelievable reactions is what they call drama in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I liked in this series is the art. The sceneries are beautifully portrayed, the characters design is also really nice and the whole shoujo atmosphere is satisfactorily enhanced.\\n\\n\r\nIt's been a week or two since I watched Kimi ni Todoke and I can't remember anything about the soundtrack. In my case, this means the soundtrack had absolutely nothing special. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're a fan of romances with no development and want to waste precious time of your life, go for it!=D Go watch Nana or Honey & Clover instead...XP",

Now heres the bad part, not only was it really slow-paced, but it was like both turtles decided to go home before getting to the finish line of this perverbial event.\r\nI suppose now is the time that I ought to justify my remarks so I dont sound like im trolling the show. \r\nThe story as you've probably read by now is about a girl named sawako as she wanders through her lonely life. As a sidenote, almost every anime out there has that lonely shy girl in it, but this is the first that i've seen where the show is about the shy girl, and that was quite refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the show, she meets and falls in love with a cool-ass dude by the name of kazehaya and well it sorta seems mutual. At this point it becomes that turtle race to see who realizes it first, but you cant make a show around that right? Well, it seems they didnt need to, as in the show it also follows sawakos efforts to make friends, participate in events, and basiaclly just get a social life (which can be quite difficult, l speak from experience). \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was somehting that I wont soon forget. It wasnt super-amazing or anything like that, but it was different. I say this because the animators could make sawako look extremely beautiful, or so scarry that my bowels just released... At first l felt like the animators just didnt care, but eventually l realized that it was probalby the most appropriate animation possible in this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a little generic, as l said earlier the only thing thats really different in the character department is that the shy girl is the main character rather than the supporting role. Other than her though, you have the steriotypical nice guy, that guy who just doesnt give a shit, some girl who would wreck most guys in a brawl, a couple plotters, and the ever present crew of goofy-asses which are there to make the main characters all the more appealing.\\n\\n\r\nl enjoyed the concept of the polar-opposites falling in love, and as it progressed I really got excited for them. The problem that I had is really just the less-than-stellar ending. The way I see it, if you make me sit around for a 25 episode show, you better give me a reason to come back for season two, and as it stands im not sure if they have.",

            "content": "Just watched the first season of Kimi Ni Todoke. Figured I should write a review about it before going into the second season, while my thoughts on it are still fresh.\r\nDisclaimer: Mostly free of spoilers.\r\nPlot: Kuronuma Sawako is a gentle high school student who, due to her scary appearance (resemblance to classic ghost girl) has been unable to make any friends so far. Everything changes when Kazehaya, the most popular guy in class, starts talking to her, prompting others to do the same. From there Sawako begins to understand how friendship and, eventually, romance works.\r\nSounds like your usual, run-of-the-mill highschool anime, right? Well, you wouldn'tbe wrong, but this is heads and shoulders above the rest of the rabble.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the summary, most of emphasis is given on the friendship between Sawako, Chizu and Ayame, rather than the (very) slowly building romance with Kazehaya. In fact, the show seems intent on stressing the importance of friendship, since Sawako is completely new to the concept.\\n\\n\r\nKnT actually shocked me with how much I enjoyed it. Well, not exactly. What shocked me was that I couldn't find anything in particular to point at and say 'that kind of sucked'.\\n\\n\r\nIn more detail:\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Sawako (often called 'Sadako' after the ghost in 'The Ring') is genuinely likeable as a person. She is ignorant of a lot of things to do with interpersonal interactions due to her circumstances, but she is not stupid like a lot of protagonists are. She does have the always-positive attitude often encountered, but she does not take it to the annoying extremes often met. She is firm when she wants to be. She's gentle but not a pushover.\\n\r\nI'm generally not a fan of female protagonists. I'm generally not a fan of the 'always positive/nice' archetype. Sawako makes me question a lot of things about myself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the rest of the main cast (about 4 other people) are all well developed. Sawako's two friends, Chizuru and Ayame, have unique personalities, both likeable but equally distinguishable, without needlessly extra long character arcs to make them feel unique. Similarly, Kazehaya and Ryu are also like that, in that they don't instantly fall under an anime character archetype. I found it particularly impressive how the show managed to make the supporting characters feel unique seamlessly through the regular story arc instead of going into long-winded tirades/flash-backs/side-story in order to give them a personality.\\n\\n\r\nWell, Chizu does get an arc to herself near the end and I admit that the transition was a little jarring, but that is about the extent of the show's sin in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nI hesitate to classify this as a romcom. The show can certainly be funny. Whenever it wants to be, it succeeds, but comedy isn't the focus of it, it just occurs. Similarly, while the romantic feelings of various people are often discussed/thought on, for the majority of the show they're not the driving force or the center of attention. I'm not describing this very well, but KnT avoided going into drama territory while still technically being a romance story, basically. Slice-of-life fits it bets, perhaps, although considering the somewhat unique circumstances of Sawako I'm not sure how accurate that is.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's intro and closing sequence actually had songs I enjoyed, which is something I don't say often ... or at all. Music is a nonentity besides these two instances, however.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else, what else ... oh right. The animation is pretty fucking good. I really liked the style. Well above average. The character models are very well made and movements are not wooden, though background suffers a little bit. The focus on the quality of characters themselves really impressed me.\\n\\n\r\nA gripe I have is that there's wasn't any closure towards ... anything, really by the end of the season. I guess it doesn't matter that much since there's a second one, though. Still loses some points because of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there's not much else I can say about this. Perhaps light-hearted, certainly positive overall, watching KmT will make even a rock feel better. However, if one doesn't enjoy this kind of show, there is exactly zero reason to watch this. The biggest 'action' sequence is a slap. I think someone got shoved once, too. So, be warned.\\n\\n\r\nHere's hoping the second season doesn't bomb it.\\n\\n\r\nWow this wasn't actually that short, huh.\\n\\n\r\nFinal rating is 8/10. Would have been a 9, but the ending felt kind of weak. Well, not exactly weak, but not fitting to be an ending episode.",

            "content": "The main character of this anime gave off a bit of Toradora vibes, I liked her awkwardness and how oblivious she is throughout the whole anime. It develops really well and even though the whole show may be a little slow, I didn't feel like it had any (obvious) filler episodes.\r\nMUSIC:\r\nBesides the opening and closing songs I didn't notices many other songs and even though it is a short intro the music I heard was really nice. I think this is one of the only anime's where I actually watched the opening and closing each episode.\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nSawako is very similar to Ryu in Toradora from theway people react to them. Though in Torardora he is completely aware and just doesn't care, in Kimi ni Todoke she is oblivious and completely innocent. This eventually leads to her making friends and getting into a typical anime high school life, although she is still quite unusual. I feel like she's a very unique character, though the rest of her friends and other people in the school are no so unique. But that doesn't really matter since it follows her and her development over the whole show is really funny to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI especially like it when her face changes and the question marks appear since she has no idea what's going on, it adds a lot of humour.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is light and typical high school events, what makes the anime stand out is the main character and her affect on the high school. How rumours spread and she goes from being feared by students to being part of the class. It takes the whole 25 episodes to see a year in her life and it really feels like the year was important since each episode focuses on events that really impacted her.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a bit older style but like I said the change in style when (mostly Sawako) gets confused is really funny and adds to the effect. Making her seem scary and then smiling and looking cute adds a lot of depth to the main character.",

            "content": "This show was frustrating because it could've been so good but the main character was so annoying.\r\nSawako is the most frustrating character I've ever encountered. Her voice is so breathy and plaintive,  she is constantly questioning her actions, she's a coward, and she doesn't learn from her mistakes and she is ALWAYS in the middle of some verbal miscommunication. Overall, I couldn't stand her and that's why I stopped watching in the middle of Season 2. I thought she would change and grow as a character... which she didn't really do. The characters around her grew and pushed her, but she was annoyingly stagnant.There were a few times she made me laugh, but mostly, I wanted to slap her lol.\\n\\n\r\nI tried so hard to give this show a chance, watching all of season 1 and everything because the other characters are amazing. It made me even more frustrated that I was so interested in the side stories but whenever things focused on Sawako (which is most of the show, because she's the main character lol), I wanted to skip through those scenes. I liked Kazehaya a lot, but he was a saint because I could not stand Sawako and I don't know how he could.\\n\\n\r\nThis is such a rant against her, but I've never so strongly hated a character before so here I am leaving this review. If there is ever a dub, maybe have a voice actress who isn't so breathy and stuttering and unsure would greatly help her character.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the art, the music, and the characters were great. Anything that involved Sawako wasn't.",

            "content": "I\u2019ll start off by saying that I believe this anime is concidered to be more than it is\u2026  that doesn\u2019t make it bad, but it means that it certainly isn\u2019t a masterpiece either. Despite that, I felt nice watching it without being too hyper about it though. I can think of some other anime that deserve to be as highly scored as this and they aren\u2019t...\r\nIn any case let\u2019s begin with the\u2026 \r\nStory \u2013 7\r\nThe story at first glance looks quite unique, with Sawako being treated as an outcast because of her scary demeanor. It starts out funny and interestingly. But after just afew episodes it begins to feel repetitive in the sense that a lot of incidents happen over and over again. Same approaches, same reactions, same outcomes. And I just happened to realize that once again there they were, lying behind the surface\u2026 the usual things that characterize any other typical shoujo anime. And since I\u2019m not a big fan of the kind, I can\u2019t say it was a happy sursprise. Nevertheless it had some good moments which I enjoyed and it definitely gave out a cute and innocent feeling, reminding me a little of my high school years.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 7\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t a big fan of Sawako. I liked her innocent and kind nature, but I found that it went to extremes. She was too innocent and too kind for her own good, and that felt not only annoying but also a little bit \u201cfake\u201d. Especially those \u201ccrying\u201d moments were unbearable! My favorite characters where Chizuru, Ayane and Ryuu, for they felt more real. Also I almost pitied the poor guy Kazehaya who gave so many \u201copenings\u201d and hints to Sawako but it was like knocking on a deaf person\u2019s door. It was nice and lovely in the first few episodes but after a while it became somewhat irritating.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8\\n\r\nIt\u2019s nice and peaceful, the opening and ending themes are really beautiful to hear and watch. Especially the ending is one of my very favorites.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 8\\n\r\nThe pastel colors were what first caught my eye. They are so soft and compose some really beautiful scenes. The characters are well drawn, not top notch, but truly nice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 7\\n\r\nI would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t enjoy watching this at all. It was good for my free time and it left me with a sweet feeling. I wasn\u2019t at the edge of my seat watching it, although I caught myself being drawn to the story lots of times.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want something light and relaxing to watch in your free time, then this is definitely for you. It is a nice work to remind you of the years of sweet innocence back at school with your first love, how it all felt.\\n",

            "content": "So,\r\nthis is how I rated it overall. You might not agree with me since this show has an 8.30 rating on MAL but this is my review so un-helpful away.\r\nIncludes, both season one and two review.\r\nStory-6/10 (Cliche story)\r\nArt-6/10 (tooo much chibi)\r\nSound-8/10 (pretty catchy, different, good)\r\nCharacterization-6/10 (started out as good and unique but ended up as irritating and un-relatable)\r\nEnjoyment-6/10 (some moments were so retarded that they were funny )\r\nOverall-5/10\r\nIf this world was a cotton candied, sugar coated fluff ball then this anime being categorized as *slice of life* would have been justified. \r\nTo be honest, the only reason I started watching this was because I ama sucker for anti-social characters.\\n\r\nWhen I read the plot base for this anime, I thought it was quite unique.\\n\r\nAn anime tackling issues about the superficial, an anime in which there is a not so pretty girl, ostracized because she looks like the character from the ring. Oh, how original!\\n\r\nHowever\\n\r\nUnrealistic and unrelatable: Kimi ni Todoke hardly handled this unique topic in a unique way, instead it gave the clich\u00e9d shoujo spin to it and ended the series in the most basic *girl gets guy* manner.\\n\r\nThe plot is that Sawako is a teenager suffering from being labelled unapproachable. With long dark hair and pale skin, she is compared to the evil girl from the ring, due to the almost always, gloomy look in her eyes. Thus, everyone calls her Sadako.\\n\r\nThe present author himself was very unpopular in High School and tries to speak for all cast outs through this series. Except that Sawako is a very exaggerated version of your average *nice person* she gushes with gratitude for anyone who is nice or civil to her, buys them presents and bakes them cookies making her  more of a Disney character who is naive, innocent and desperate to make friends than actual person.\\n\r\nSawako is prevented from being a pathetic, pitiable character by her endless optimism and willingness to help others. She doesn't spend time feeling sorry for herself, nor have her isolation and the often cruel treatment of her classmates made her bitter. She is unfailingly generous with her time and her understanding of their school work.\\n\r\nThis little note is the thing that makes Sawako so frustrating. Here, is a person who has always been labelled and misunderstood, who\u2019s always been a castaway just because of her appearance. A person who has always been a loner and has never gotten a chance to make any friends, when things like this happen it\u2019s natural to feel resentment, jealousy and anger.\\n\r\nHowever, Sawako lacks all of these natural emotions and this is what makes her a flat, one dimensional character. Not once does she break down, not once does she feel frustrated about her situation. We don\u2019t see that side of her, nor are we aware of its existence. This marks this series as unsatisfying and incomplete as well as lacking in depth.\\n\r\n[Btw she's voiced by Mamiko Noto, big surprise! since she has made a career of doing these sweet-but-wimpy kinds of characters (Shimako in Maria Watches Over Us, Rimone in Simoun)]\\n\r\nWhile, Kazehaya is consistently a nice guy, aiming at Sawako only, even though the whole school is heads over heels in love with him. He chooses Sawako because she looks depressed and stands out. Since, he's the kind of guy who likes to see everyone happy and help them if they aren't.\\n\r\nSawako thinks the same, and takes all his advances to be *just kindness* \\n\r\nAt this point we see how because of this, a huge communication gap between Sawako and Kazehaya is shaped, which in the end consumes unnecessary episodes and the storyline lags continuously until the point that confessions are shouted out and wounds are healed. Except, the wounds that were inflicted on me, while I was watching this terrible series.\\n\r\nKazehaya\u2019s character is just as flawed as Sawako\u2019s. For a series that\u2019s about the high school years of a bunch of people, Sawako and Kazehaya don\u2019t really feel like interesting characters at all. Sawako is way too pure: whenever someone tries to take advantage of her feelings (by making her jealous for example), her incredible naivety just feels incredibly unnatural and it quickly turns into a bit of a lame gimmick. Kazehaya on the other hand is just as bland as a male romantic interest. He\u2019s just\u2026 there, with hardly any personality about him other than some guy who just keeps smiling. I mean we all want to be believe that there\u2019s a fictional guy out there who doesn\u2019t care about your looks and your inborn awkwardness, and loves you for who you are. Who will obviously knock off the prettiest girl and choose you, instead. Who\u2019s not superficial; and doesn\u2019t care about what other people think. Even though he\u2019s the most popular boy in school, cool story bro but no. Not to mention that Kazehaya has liked Sawako for some time now, ever since school started to be precise. However, he does not communicate with her until he hears her compliment him. (Narcissistic much eh, Heaney?) \\n\r\nMeanwhile, any scene that focused on Sawako\u2019s growth as a character was overshadowed by its romantic drivel that refused to go anywhere.\\n\r\nAnother set of characters worth mentioning are Sawako\u2019s two friends who become her best girl-pals (and her protectors), Chizuru Yoshida and Ayane Yano. Chizuru is your standard-issue aggressive female. Ayane, on the other hand, I found much more intriguing; in this first half of the season there's just one hint- in a phone call she answers- that her personal life might be rather complex. She's also pretty perceptive, and catches on to something about a character that no one else has realized just yet. Another character I really did like is Ryu, Kazehaya's buddy, a taciturn fellow who's terrible at remembering names. He and Chizuru have something going on, but she, at least, is not ready to admit they have any kind of relationship (though she apparently feels comfortable enough with him to casually invite herself and her friends up to his room, which is above the restaurant he works in.)\\n\r\nApart from Sawako, who as I\u2019ve said feels heavily exaggerated, the others feel real. Not terribly over the top and I think reactions and actions were all pretty \u2018normal\u2019, normal enough that it\u2019s believable. And I think because of that sometimes you become more attached to them more than Sawako. Even when rumors about them start flying around, they are in conflict whether it\u2019s Sawako who\u2019s spreading them or not. Though in the real world girls tend to get revenge straight out instead of sticking around long enough to hear the other side of the story, which by the way Sawako doesn\u2019t provide until the very end. \\n\r\nAs for the bad characters, there's a coach who's the requisite Annoying Male, and then there's the chief villainess, the two-faced Ume Kurumizawa, who pretends to be friendly and cheerful while quietly manipulating things behind the scenes to suit her own purposes.\\n\r\nKurumi, for me was one of the more realistic characters, however she too is overshadowed by Sawako\u2019s fluff and whimsically placed aside. Kurumi is one of the prettiest girls in the school, who is also in love with Kazehaya. She sees Sawako as a rival and tries to break them apart, as forcefully as she can. \\n\r\nSawako\u2019s reaction to this news is so undeniably idealistic that it almost made me laugh. Sawako thinks that because Kurumi shares the same feelings for Kazehaya as she, it will enable them to become better friends and bond over it. Showing us, yet again that Sawako contains absolutely no X chromosomes.\\n\r\nBesides Sawako's personality, the art is the other major problem the series has. The backgrounds are gorgeous, but the characters often aren't. Sawako herself seems to be rendered in simplified SD form over half the time. Chizuru and Ayane are realistically done a very few times in the show, but are mostly rendered much closer to SD as well, when they aren't actually SD. But Kazehaya, Ryu, and Kurumizawa receive much more consistently realistic renderings, for some reason.\\n\r\nAlso, the random light flares and bubbles appearing suddenly almost turned me into a diabetic. Not only does it give it a very kiddy feel to the show, but it also makes it very hard to read the expressions of the characters. Usually they\u2019re used with stylistic purposes; you know, color each character with these seemingly over the top reactions. Here however, they felt more like \u201cOkay, you can laugh now\u201d-signs, this show just continuously tried to be subtle, while it ultimately just wasn\u2019t.\\n\r\nKimi ni Todeke ultimately is an anime, that is meant to make you feel good, warm and fuzzy on the inside. It\u2019s supposed to make you feel happy and motivate you to become a better person. It revolves around the idea that no matter what, there\u2019s always some good in everyone.\\n\r\nExcept, holy fuck it isn\u2019t. Wake up, you little shit.\\n",

I like a hint of action, drama, something to make me worked up! And well, Kimi ni todoke lacked that. Yes, It was real.But at some points, I was trying too hard to stay in the \"real\" track that it got kinda annoying! \\n\\n\r\nIn general, this anime's strongest point in my opinion, were the characters. Specially the supporting ones! I Loved them all!\\n\\n\r\nI apologize to all the fans, but this is how I felt :\"> \\n",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite animes of all time. It is absolutely phenomenal from the get go. I will keep this completely SPOILER FREE for the sake of not ruining a brilliant anime. Here, I'll break it down for you:\r\nStory:\r\nEnriching. Inspiring. Heartbreaking. Emotional. Optimistic. Endearing. This story was so addicting and so incredibly attaching that I could not stop myself from watching episode after episode after episode. Each episode had me on the edge of my seat, rooting for Sawako, and anticipating what was going to happen next in her life and progress. I will not expand more to keep this a truly spoilerfree review but this is an absolutely beautiful story. 10/10\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is stunning. Each character design carefully planned and constructed and the colors completely appropriate and hooking. There were no holes in the animation, no strange spots where you were like \"why does this look so different from everything else\", no second questions. Absolutely beautiful. The scene with Kazehaya and Sawako under the sakura tree and the road to school is one of the most beautiful anime scenes I have seen confirming my decision to score this a 10/10.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI find myself listening to the anime soundtrack at random points of the day. Like the storyline, it is endearing and completely relevant to the story. The music truly heightens emotion at the most happy and heartwrenching moments. Stellar, absolutely stellar. 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSawako is one of the most endearing characters I have ever watched in my life. I loved her story and seeing her progress to the path of making friends, accepting who she is, and falling in love. Each character is completely individualistic and unique and given all of the personality and likeability (and screentime) to boot. Kazehaya is not our typical popular schoolboy and I truly love that different perspective. It's refreshing. Fantastic character development and fantastic timeline for that development. 10/10.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI have rewatched this anime multiple times and it still never gets old for me. Everything about it is brilliant, likeable, relatable, and realistic. It is such a fantastic watch for anyone of any age. I never got bored in the anime, never got tired of it, and never stopped watching it. I laughed out loud at some moments, jumped for joy at some, and cried at others. It is an emotional rollercoaster that you want to ride and ride again. 10/10.\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAn endearing character, perfectly developed side characters, your \"out of the norm\" love story, beautiful art and soundtrack, and complete and utter enjoyability. This is a masterpiece of an anime that I can honestly say no bad thing about. To not watch this would be an absolutely terrible decision, truly. 10/10.",

            "content": "I found Kimi Ni Todoke quite \"boring\" and not worth to watch it. Let me explain why...\r\nStory: 5\r\nWell the story seemed quite fine to me. Just the normal stuff: shy, weird girl is falling in love with the cool guy. Moreover he falls in love with her too, which was quite unusual at the beginning...I was expecting a romance but what I got was just a quite ordinary story about school, friends, food, being shy blahblah... Stuff that maybe 10-13 years old girls would love to watch. I just felt old while watching this show (haha back then I was 17-18 ). The point isthat the two main characters actually do LOVE each other but what happens? NOTHING AT ALL, and I hate that! This made me just ANGRY. Episode after Episode there was no improvement at all, sure there were some sweet moments but that's all. I won't say much about that because I don't want to write a spoiler like others do..\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good, I really like this kind of art in Animes. The only thing that was annoying me was the way too often use of chibis!\\n\\n\r\nSound: I didn't like the voice of the main girl Sadako, I just didn't can't explain why. The OP and the ED were not my style either so I just never really watched them..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThe characters were all individual and fun. BUT yes there is always a BUT.. I just couldn't feel myself in their situations. I just COULDN'T cry with Sadako (the main character). For me she was rather annoying with her way of being. She was just too shy to actually say what she was thinking and of course she improved after a few Episodes but NOT REALLY MUCH! The other guy (the one she likes) should be actually quite the opposite of her but the more I was watching the Anime, the more I felt like they were both idiots that just couldn't say what they were feeling for each other! All this took us 25 Episodes and for me and maybe it was just for me, but I had the feeling that NOTHING, really NOTHING happend between the two main characters at all! Like I said before they had some sweet moments and all but for me this wasn't enough. So to say..the whole Anime they were trying to find a way to be together but at the end they..ah well . let's stop here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nThere were some fun scenes and I highly recommend it if you want to laugh but as I said for me there was just no climax...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nI don't want to watch the second season and I'm tired of shows where the people are too shy, too weak and not self confident at all... I won't recommend it as a love story but maybe as a comedy after all it had some fun moments and sweet moments but that's it...\\n\\n",

Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Shojo fan but too often I watch an anime that seems interesting only to wind up with the same reused plot over and over again.\r\nKimi ni Todoke at a first glance appears to have that all-too-familiar \"unpopular girl falls for popular boy\" plot. Matter of fact, that's exactly what it is. However, Kimi ni Todoke manages to take the same plot and turn it into something incredible fresh and enjoyable.\r\nThe characters are instantly likable and they are the ones that draw you into the story despite it's simplicity.Everyday occurrences are presented in such a charming way that  you can't help but simply go along with the flow of the anime, which, admittedly is slow-paced but you'll never be bothered by it.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationships and the character interactions never seem fake or cheesy and it has a soothing soundtrack to boot.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is gorgeous even though it can sometimes be a little over-sparkly but it fits in with everything as a whole \\n\\n\r\nEven if you're sick of plots like these (and trust me, sometimes I am) Watching Kimi ni Todoke won't make you regret it ^^",

            "content": "While I enjoy romance anime, and while I'm new to the scene, Kimi ni Todoke really didn't hit any marks for me. I thought I would enjoy it, but after watching 13 episodes I've realised that I'm just simply waisting my continuing as it becomes incredibly frustrating to watch, as I'll go into more detail below.\r\nThe series first starts off innocent enough, with the main character being somewhat quirky and awkward. As the series progresses the viewer begins to realise that not only is she awkward, quiet, quirky, etc. She's simply socially retarded. She doesn't have basic social skills. Its like watching a five yearold try to hold a conversation. At the thirteenth episode, I really couldn't be bothered to deal with the show anymore. The situations that she gets herself into are frustrating and easily avoidable. Most of the drama that happens in this is stupid high school bullshit anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWithout character flaws and their journey to overcome them, how can there be character development? While Sadako or Sawako's flaws are obvious, it doesn't seem that the point of the show is to fix them. She's still socially inept, incredibly awkward, and frustrating to watch and it doesn't seem like she'll change. When a character in the show says, \"Shut up, you're annoying\" to the main protagonist who you spend most of the show watching and you agree with them, I think there's a big problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actor feels very forced, as she is trying to produce a weird airy, high pitched voice. Its obvious that it's forced, and it becomes annoying.\\n\\n\r\nDidn't enjoy it for the time that it had, but I guess I'm in the minority here, aren't I?",

            "content": "I'll try my hardest not to spoil this show. I'll also try to give you a reasonable, well debated and in depth analysis as to why this show is freaking AMAZING.\r\nStory - 10\r\nThe story of a girl learning about the world of love and school life, one which she should've learnt a few years ago, is an underplayed plot. While not entirely unique, and not always pulled off with class, Kimi revives this concept with new breath. There's not much more to say other than it's like watching playground politics; 5 year olds learning about interaction for the first time.\r\nArt - 10\r\nKimi ni Todoke andan animation and artistic paradise.\\n\r\nThe art style, pulled directly from the manga, in no way pulls from the true characters, nor the story. One of the few shows currently airing that's not trying to sell it's self by looking good, Kimi visually portrays each character as they're initially percived, allowing the story and developments to help the viewer see them in a different manner. Be it Yano-chi's gyaru lips or Chizu's delinquent eyes or Sawakos...looking like freaking Sadako. I adore this manner of portraying characters.\\n\r\nThe color palet of Kimi is enchanting. The playfull coloring of the op animation, to the simple, light and fluffy colors of the show and the water colored ed help the audience reconise, almost instantly, what this show is. A light hearted romance, that is what it is, and dosn't try to be anything more.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 10\\n\r\nI tend so see art style and animation as two different things. But that dosn't mean the animation isn't equally as stunning. Currently, in anime, animation is becoming much more advanced. A little less recently, we experienced the delight which was ToraDora. Despite being two very different styles of romance, both anime showcase beautiful animation which fully brings out the emotions of the characters. To really show you this, I would have to sit with people and go through an episode, pausing and disecting. To explain it in words as best as I can, Kimi catches those small mannerisms down to the angle at which people lean when they're just standing there, chatting.\\n\r\nWhat I love just as much is that they don't take liberties with comedy scenes, which are just as beautifully smooth and carefully animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nNot a voice actor out of place, there's nothing unatural about these seiyuus. Given briefly, the famous much loved voice actors steal abosolutly no spotlight from the main characters. Everyone does a lovely job.\\n\r\nI adore the OP and ED songs, which are just as light and fluffy as the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nSo.Damn.Good.\\n\r\nI wont go into depth with Kazehaya or Sawako, rather, I'd like to present Kurumi as my case.\\n\r\nKururmi is the most amazing character I've seen in a while. Without being bi-polar and all over the place, Kurumi represents the amazing development characters in Kimi under go. Starting confident but alone, thinking she didn't need friends, Kurumi soon reveals herself to be unable to change her path and brakes down, saying thing's she wouldn't want. She soon, although she wont admit it, begins to fully accept someone else as equal to her, Sawako. I have a blog written on her, if you wish to read further on Kurumi and why I adore her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke just leaves you smiling. Weather it be a small skit of Sawako learning something new and being over innocent or because everyone comes out alright at the end of an arc, Kimi is hard not to enjoy. For all those who need a brake from shows which force you to rethink everything, Kimi is for you. For all those looking for a good romance, Kimi is for you. For all those who want mecha, guns, fighting and testosterone, watch it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR, I love this show, I think you will too",

Sure the story wasn't very original but it was still a fun watch. The characters in this story were outstanding. they all had something extra that i can't quite put my finger on but it draws you in along with the story.\r\nAfter i watched the first two episodes i was hooked, and when i finished the show i went on to the manga which is a hundred times better than the anime. (but that is just my opinion)\r\nThe art in this animealso caught my attention. It kinda reminded me how some of the characters looked in Xxxholic. What i liked most about the art was that it is different from other anime shows. Over the years i as i started to watch more and more anime i noticed that a lot of the art had a similar aspect, but in Kimi ni todoke it felt more original.\\n\\n\r\nI throughly enjoyed the music in this show. I thought they did an excellent job in the openings and endings to this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a very fun watch. Although i wish it could have been longer. but it was funny, cute, romantic, and it just made you think how you first made friends and how close you are to them. \\n\\n\r\nI highly, highly recommend this anime to watch. If you do i guarantee you won't be disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "The story starts of with Kuronuma Sawako, a young girl that is avoided by everyone due to her appearance, which is quite gloomy or scary. She supposedly can speak to ghosts / see them and if you stare into her eyes for more than 3 seconds misfortune befalls you. These are all rumors and Kuronuma is quite the opposite. She's sweet, kind, and naive. But there was one person who probably saw something in her that everyone else was too blinded by their assumptions to see, Kazehaya Shouta. The popular, handsome boy at school who everyone likes because he's kind and charismatic. But there's moreto him that meets the eye. And because of an encounter between the two, Kuronuma's life starts to change, but for better or worse?\\n\\n\r\nThe main theme / moral for this anime is to not judge someone by the appearance. To give someone a fair chance, you know, get to know them. And once you get to know them, you can have more things in common than you could have imagined. This lesson can be applied to real life because something like this happened to me, and I'm sure, everyone.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing isn't very fast. Believe me, I can't recall how many time I screamed at my laptop screen saying: \"Why the hell don't they get together already!\" But I think the slow pacing is very good, despite my impatience. It gives you a chance to get to really know the characters - seeing them for who they are, being with them through all the obstacles they had to face & seeing their relationships grow.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters . . .\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the best thing of Kimi ni Todoke. By far. They all have their own personalities, whether they be good or bad, you'll still love them regardless. \\n\r\nFor me the characters didn't just play their roles, it felt like something more; all the predicaments, emotions they felt seemed real. Trust me, the first time I watched this, I teared at at so many scenes, whether they were sad, heartwarming, happy, whatever. The voice actors were perfect for each character; main or supporting. They did a great job conveying the characters' feelings, whatever they happened to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very good for a shojo anime. I don't really analyze anything because I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for, but, I know what I like, and I liked this. The animation was good throughout. Oh, I also liked how the characters looked outside their school clothing - very cute and stylish.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was very good. The ost's suited any situation that was happening. The openings & endings fit perfectly with the series; the lyrics as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you should watch this and come to a conclusion yourself. Because its not like I can convey how great an anime it is through words. Whether you like it or not, its up to you, I could careless because I know how wonderful it is and that's all that matters. This is my favorite shojo anime, that I've watched so far.",

            "content": "Okey this review is based on 11 episodes i'v seen so far.\r\nEven if i know that there are many animes like this one but still i want to say One of a Kind. You want to ask Why? because the whole story looks soo innocent and also with alot of suffering even thought you would think \"where is the suffering\" ? well it is there that girl Kuronumo (our main protagonist girl) has it because of her childhood and some time of high school every one avoided her because of her scary face it was until she meet's this one guy Kazehaya (Our main protagonistGuy) who changes her world its like he pulls her out from this dark pit ... after they meet many other encounters come into play many new friends and the best thing in this anime is all those development all the feeling flowing around happiness , tearful moments and joyful everything is in here. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want anything more here it is: The anyme Revolves around this girl called Koronumo Sawako (main character Girl) who has kind of scare face which makes every one avoid her and thus she doesn't have friends. And also there is this guy Called Kazehaya (main Character Guy) who is kind  and helps every one in need he meets with Koronuma before entrance ceremony because of Kazehaya being lost and Koronuma tells him where to go thus their friendship begins ... The whole story is practically about 5 friends and few off characters so far... which makes it kind of interesting to watch how 5 of them develops... The story takes place in High School ... and also at some point in friends houses and outside but mostly at school. well i don't know at the moment what to tell sorry.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is bit old schoolish but it makes really good atmosphere and thus its nice to watch this anime because of the whole surrounding atmosphere it really fits this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: well the development so far is the same falls in love , doesn't know that she , he is in love and such . but also has such things as meeting new people and befriending them and etc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: So far i enjoyed it becasue many interesting occurrences happening..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Perfect ... must watch anime ...",

            "content": "After getting a recommendation to watch this anime from a few people, I planned on it. From the default picture, it just looks like a regular anime. Nothing special, right? But it is. You find out parts of yourself you've never found before in this anime. I would have never thought I would fall in love with something so simplistic as this. I'll have to say I judged a book by it's cover. Before you try to throw this anime away, watch one episode first.\r\nStory? 10/10.\r\nAt first, Kuronuma is outsider in the school. Everyone thinks she can see ghosts and summon spirits, but she's justan ordinary girl. She means a boy named Kazehaya, and he changes her life completely. It may sound regular, but it's totally different from what you're thinking. She never smiles at all, and she's never had real friends, but it was fate that they met.\\n\\n\r\nArt? 10/10.\\n\r\nThis is one of the things that drew me away from the anime at first. I looked at the default picture and went, \"Ew, this totally isn't kawaii,\" since it's different from what I usually watch. As the story progressed, I fell more and more in love with this type of art. I suggest that everyone give it a try. It's similar to One Piece.\\n\\n\r\nSound? 10/10.\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the ending song for Kimi ni Todoke. It's the best in an anime I've seen probably. The lyrics fit the song perfectly, as well as the sound. I enjoyed listening to the ending every time the anime ended. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter? 9/10.\\n\r\nThe only reason this doesn't have a 10, is because I simply didn't like the misunderstandings that floated around in the story. It pissed me off quite a bit as well when Kanami did what she did, but you'll have to watch and see. Conflicts make the story grow, right?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? 9/10.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It made me laugh, cry, smile, and fall in love with all of the characters. Anime like this deserve an award. Slice of Life is my favorite genre of anime, and things like this is why. You'll surely fall in love with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall? 10/10.\\n\r\nI'm not over exaggerating when I say this anime was on the verge of being perfect. Other people might love the conflicts and misunderstandings, but it ruined the mood for me. That being said, the heart felt parts were the best. Everyone who's watched this anime knows how it feels to be Kuronuma, and how it feels to be hurt. They also know the want to be loved and have friends. It's a great feeling when you're happy, and this is exactly the anime that gives you happiness.",

            "content": "To start it off, I didn\u2019t expect Kimi Ni Todoke to be as good as it was. I\u2019ve come across several anime of the same genre, and after a while the \u201cShoujo\u201d genre feels as if it keeps repeating itself, while adding small changes into the plot. To be completely honest, I started this anime for the heck of it. This series is not that well known, or so I believe, because I\u2019ve never heard anyone else mention it to me before nor have I seen anyone talk about it. I found it through MyAnimeList and decided to watch it considering it had a goodscore. Despite this, I kept it away for a long time \u2018cause I wasn\u2019t really interested in the story, but I am really pleased to say that Kimi Ni Todoke went beyond my expectations and provided a really pleasant watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn\u2019t the usual generic narrative you find in your average Shoujo anime or manga. It isn\u2019t a about a girl trying to win the heart of some guy who isn\u2019t interested in her. It isn\u2019t about a harem of girls fighting for one guy who likes the one girl we all know he\u2019s eventually going to end up with. Of course, those types of anime are cute and all, but they lack originality. Kimi Ni Todoke on the other hand is original and cute beyond words and it feels relatable because it\u2019s simply about a girl who\u2019s trying to socialize with her classmates, but she can\u2019t because there has been a rumor about her that says she is the girl from The Ring, Sadako. Her classmates are afraid of her and tend to avoid her despite her charming and pleasant attitude.\\n\\n\r\n I\u2019m sure most of us have gone through this point in life \u2013 just trying to make friends and getting to know people around you. This aspect of the story is so beautifully developed that I couldn\u2019t help but smile whenever the main character, Kuronuma \u201cSadako\u201d didn\u2019t know how to behave around people due to the lack of interaction she had had, or when she got into an embarrassing situation because of her shy and nervous personality! This is the aspect that appealed to me.\\n\\n\r\nNothing in Kimi No Todoke seems forced. There are no over-dramatic characters, no troubled and depressed main characters, no bat-shit crazy parents, and no traumatic past for the main character. Yet the story progress effortlessly though its humor and commendable character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters fit into the story flawlessly. Kuronuma Sawako, who is called Sadako instead due to her resemblance to the girl from the ring is an average high-schooler. Pure and simple, Sawako is really likable. This is portrayed when her two best friends realise she isn\u2019t what the rumors depict her to be and get along with her. They eventually learn that she is actually a really sweet person, with an air of optimism about life unlike what they had previously imagined. Both the characters of Chizu and Amane add to the story as well. Despite being side characters their characters are developed wonderfully as the story progresses. Also, they add diversity the list of characters in Kimi Ni Todoke. Chizu is a tomboy and brusque while Amane is a seductive temptress. You might think that doesn\u2019t sound like they are nice people, but trust me, they make the best pair of friends Kuronuma could have ever asked. Kazehaya, who is secretly in love with Kuronuma, helps her character develop. You wouldn\u2019t like his character because he\u2019s really good looking or has an edgy attitude. You\u2019ll like him because he\u2019s simply that likeable. He\u2019s the guy that everyone wants to be friends with, but that doesn\u2019t make him a prick. All in all, I loved all the characters in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, to be honest, I didn\u2019t like it at first and it was one of the reasons I abstained from watching this anime for so long, but trust me, it\u2019ll grow on you after a few episodes. The music wasn\u2019t exceptional but it wasn\u2019t entirely bad either. I never skipped the Opening and the background music was satisfying for me as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe only fault I that found within this anime would be its slow pace. Personally, I love anime with a really fast paced story and a lot of drama. Most slow paced anime bore me to death, but the uniqueness of Kimi Ni Todoke was what kept me on board and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t stop watching after a few episodes. Despite this minor fault, I am really looking forward to binging season 2 and I hope it doesn\u2019t disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nSo, do I recommend watching it? Well, if you like this genre and are bored by the monotonous narratives of other anime from this genre, then sure go ahead and watch it! I\u2019m pretty sure you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

            "content": "General:\r\nJust your normal romance. Not a little bit of surprise. Anime was going so slow, it's a 25 episode anime (season 1). Plot is clear, but story goes slow. Likewise everytime hurdles will come just like in every romance.\r\nCharacter: 6\r\nCharacters are fine, not bad nor good. But something i found quite irritating is that the main character (male) acts like a girl, and he's like a girl inside, which I find quite irritating, like blushing & character development is fine. \r\nSo at the end I think this is your typical romance anime where story is soo slow that you'll fed up, if you're fast paced,like for me it'll be boring to spend time on series where you'll see a boy & girl fell in love, for 25 episode. Instead of that I'll read manga\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\n- story is good no doubt, but there are some laid-backs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:- 5\\n\r\n- you'll enjoy if you've already watched all good anime & you've no place to go(as for me)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5 \\n\r\nIt's an ok, ok anime. When i saw its rating & the reviews, I thought it'll be a fantastic anime. But I was disappointed.",

            "content": "\u201cDistances\u201d\r\nThe Story... Kimi ni Todoke have an impressive yet typical storyline that revolves about a girl and a guy with unrequited feelings from each other. An essence of romance yet to be seen that is filled with cheesy, laughable, and silly moments of each character involved. It contains a storyline with precise approach of idea that is somewhat predictable yet attractive because of the mood it draws out on each episode. Concerning on being a romantic series, it also have a harmonious approach between characters that gives an additional delight. It is a kind of a love boat trip on where we sit back andenjoy tightly as we see the ups and downs, twists, and memorable scenes it has to offer. The series gives high standards for it to be watched because it didn\u2019t focused only with one aspect which is romance rather it shown such many different emotions for us to be experienced and pleased on. Nevertheless, with its rather amazing storyline the series might give you such wonderful feedback and amusement.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation... The series gives such bubbly, fascinating, and lively background that carries the ambiance of the story. By having a clean and detailed art, the sensation of having a romantic and comical scene becomes more appreciative and attractive as it leaves a wonderful mark. For the animation, the scenes is quite typical as its shows as sweet as possible, hilarious than ever, and being emotional than before, but even though it is quite just the same as we\u2019ve seen from the others there are some unique qualities that this series hold which cause the series to truly shine.\\n\\n\r\nSound... It isn\u2019t that grand as I\u2019ve expected but it contains such breathtaking, refreshing, and tender background sounds that truly sync to the story itself. The series use a low pitch and melodic sound that increases the aura of romance, not to mention to some of the entertaining ones. OP song that gives an angelic and captivating feeling and ED song that gives an adorable and soothing tune. It is just the appropriate sound for its theme that gives the right impact to the overall series.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u2026 All characters have contributed such major impact to the story that to be considered memorable, a variety of characters that have done a great job on each of their roles. The series have a charming and also a bit disturbing personalities to been seen depending on the roles they\u2019ve performed. The focus might be on these pair of characters that really moves and fascinates the flow of the story being told. Kuronuma which brightens the show, while Kazehaya who complete the essence of the series. It has a scenic progression of their lives that reveals various feelings and outcome to be on one another. An additional detail is by having other characters put such great effort to make the show impressive which also increase the factor of the surroundings and its individual aspect. Regardless of the character representation that is predictable and common, they have just done it in a well manner way that is attractive enough to absorb the essence of the story which is truly amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall\u2026 It\u2019s a romantic trip that offers a nice ambiance between the story, interaction of different characters, and laughing moments to enjoy. It\u2019s a ride on where the flow of the story might be simple but has a promising result. It is a kind of anime where backgrounds, animation, sounds or either characters is responsible for being attractive. Being independent without these different aspects may affect the overall outcome and will become just a simple anime. All I can say is that they have managed to do something great from a simple and overly used layout.",

(sometimes a little bit cheesy but well when you are in the flow you dont mind xD)\\n\\n\r\noverall 9/10\\n\r\ntotaly recomended for romatic fans (not romantic horror *schooldays*, but romantic cuteness). its lovely ^_^",

            "content": "I absolutely loved this anime for so many reasons. It was such a delight to both watch and listen to as well. The animation was just gorgeous, each beautifully colored background painstakingly created to reflect the moods and seasons, a perfect pacing device as well. My favorites were the cherry blossoms in the spring, and the night sky full of twinkling stars, a reminder of our small place within a much larger universe. I don't normally pay attention to music during an anime, but I found the melodic piano pieces used were perfect to encompass the mix of hope, longing, fear and innocence that sooften defines our youth. \\n\\n\r\nI would say that this whole anime from both a plot and aesthetic perspective drove home this coming-of-age period, where everything is so new and exciting and scary at the same time. \\n\r\nSaweko is such a great character, you can't help but root for her! I normally like take charge type A-personalities but there is just something so endearing about her earnestness and her desire to be understood that you find yourself cheering every triumph no matter how small. You have to admire her for never being afraid of trying, despite the past rejections, and hurtful experience she still is optimistic and believes that if she does her best, things will work out. Beyond the romance, this is the story of a girl who is just discovering who she is, and is just beginning to understand  the bonds of friendship and love that ties us to those around us. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI felt the story's emphasis on these small gestures - whether a word or deed to be a powerful reminder in never underestimating the difference you can make on another person's life with such a seemingly simple act. From Kazehaya's kindness in giving Saweko a shot, to hurtful rumors and misunderstandings the ripple effects are felt during the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nI really loved the friendships formed by Saweko, the way she slowly realized what it means to make friends, and become part of a group who accepted her for her she was. Not only that but they truly cared about her happiness and did everything they could to help, while pushing her to take chances while always letting her take things at her own pace. I found Ayane to be especially wonderful, one of my favorite friend characters to date. Pin - the crazy homeroom teacher was also hilarious, I really loved the scenes he was in, they made me laugh out loud. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance that develops is slow and sweet, each moment of intimacy and trust building on each other. It's nice to see two nice people circle each other, in a courtship that was based in trust and respect. To truly be seen by another, that's really the best we can all hope for. \\n\\n\r\nThe one downside was at times I did grow a little impatient with the misunderstandings (CONFESS ALREADY), but at the end it was worth it. I loved watching this little group's high-school journey progress and felt an attachment to them that makes me think this is one Anime I'll be rewatching soon. \\n\\n\r\nI should note as well, that while the ending is a little unresolved, that there is a second season that ties everything up nicely, so don't be discouraged. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay so first off, yes this is my all time favourite.\nOkay now we got that out of the way. This anime is one of the main reasons I started watching romance anime.\nThe story starts rather simple but it builds up really nicely. The characters are well developed, obviously Sawako and Kazehaya more than the others but it is notable that there is actual character development in the side characters, which I, find absolutely fantastic.\nThe art in this Anime is really well done and quite true to the manga (yeah I'm currently collecting the manga as well because I can't have enough), not a single animedoes the art as well as this one. Though there is Chihayafuru which is pretty close but gives it's own twist to it.\\n\nFor people that don't like long and dreadful romance animes I say, please give this one another chance. And yes I must admit the anime is (as I heard someone say) a 30 episode love letter, but honestly it does it in such a nice way that you are always eager to see the next episode.\\n\\n\nI've currently seen the series 3 times. But don't take my word for it, just go out there and watch it and the second season.",

I was so happy, sad, depressed and full of all kind of emotions just by watching these 25 episodes. Maybe it's also because i saw myself in this anime a bit too, but i'm not really sure about that, could be.\\n\r\nIn this Anime you see how a beautiful person should be, how a beautiful person sees the world, how a beautiful person acts and talks to other people, how a beautiful person cheerful is and how a beautiful person LOVES. This anime shows how we should be, how we should act and care about others...it shows how to LIVE and LOVE.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTotally adorable characters, lovely ones, cheerful ones, sad ones, broken ones, and closed ones.

It really fits with the story\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation wasn't really that great like the story or the characters are, but there were some parts in the anime where you could see how beautiful they show something, and that's \\n\r\nwhy i liked the animation really much ^^\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor everyone who loves to watch a love story, watch this...u won't regret it for sure",

Sawako is a sweet and intelligent girl, always with the motto to practice at least one good deed a day, and his attempts to help people only hinders further because for a mere details it causes dread in their peers and teachers. Inside the room everyone thinks she can talk to spirits and to evoke them, which causes very funny situations. Thisis the life of Sawako, a pretty girl, intelligent practicing at least one good deed every day and is mistaken for an evocative of Satan.\\n\\n\r\nEverything changes when appears Kazehaya and Sawako draws the attention of the school. Kazehaya is a perfect human being and this is the downside more pointed by those who read the manga or watch anime, but it is perfect from the point of view of Sawako, ie, is presented to us how she sees the Kazehaya. In my opinion this view has to change in the manga course not to get extremely repetitive and get seasick easily.\\n\\n\r\nFrom all this history shows a novel surrounded by situations ranging of the funniest, the most consistent and sentimental dramas. Still relying on charismatic characters add in a lot in the work quality.\\n\\n\r\nKimi Ni Todoke is a great Shoujo anime with a beautiful art to look at and a story that will develop slowly, but improving more and holding the viewer. More than recommended.",

            "content": "This anime is worth the love. And I mean really, I ended up writing a review about it. It's one thing to say that I like this certain anime because of the following objective-to-subjective reasons, but it's something that is surprising for me to actually find an anime to \"love\" at.\r\nSTORY = 7\r\nThe story is of course, romance-esque. Shoujo-ish and all, preferrably not my cup of tea. The story itself is mild and has a basic plot, it's nowhere near as tense like Shingeki no Kyojin, not as close to laughing as the wacky Yuru Yuri, and even CLAMP's romance anime have more twists andturns than this. The story is as basic as what to do with a teaspoon: a shy, awkward, unpopular girl easily misunderstood because of her looks and introversion, with a running joke of being quite the resemblance of The Ring's Sadako, and on the other side is a \"gary-stu\" guy who is seemingly perfect in a lot of ways that everyone loves him, then add up a tandem of supporting characters who are not really all that dynamic yet been able to make some impact on the plot, and yet this story has worked like having that cup of tea with the right cake.\\n\r\nIn literature, we're particularly taught of what not to write. And this anime kind of ticked all those boxes BUT despite its elements as non-applicable to real life as we know how twisted the reality of our society is, Kimi ni Todoke just handed back all things literature taught to the butler who brought the tea and cake, and simply went on with its own ingredients; a creation a mild and touching, easy-to-watch shoujo-story with feels. In reality, no guy can act like Kazehaya, and only few friends out there can be like Chi-chan and Yano-chin and Ryu as well; and if you act like Kurunama you'd probably be the bully-magnet;\\n\r\nand I could still go on with hampering reality from this ideal romantic story, but being ideal and mild as it is, that's what makes the storyline as captivating and even sublime.\\n\r\nIt's just so unreal you'd wish it real. Kimi ni Todoke simply gave us a glimpse of an ideal love story as what it should be, full of laidbacks and awkward fleeting emotional heartbeat-skipping fidgets, yes, it's a love story after all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART = 10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watch anime, I'm not really particular about the art because being particular at it is like being particular at what box your mind wants to be comfortably snuggled in. But I never stay inside the box. Never.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 8\\n\\n\r\nBack in 2009, there was a hideous American mushy-mushy so-called love-story that gagged the entire vampire lore into a cheap, nasty vomitus.\\n\r\nIts proponent was the use of a silly romantic (romatic, as how its author wanted to put it, but tbh it's not romantic: it's bullshit) setting and mary-sue + gary-stu characters, where the author claimed she knows nothing about vampires among other hideous claims, but in the eyes of the mainstream, that story worked to their fandom (and this is one of the major-major reasons never to trust mainstream).\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke then, which was made in 2008, kind of used the same mary-sue + gary-stu characterization: an ideal pair, ideal setting, ideal supporting characters, ideal plot, but it's far from barfing to what it offered acidic to the stomach. Kimi ni Todoke is actually sweet, and actually right in mixture of ideal plot and character elements. It isn't acidic to you sitting in front of the screen and doesn't make you puke and roll your eyes like how Mokocchi did. You just simply cheer for Kurunama and Kazehaya with giggles and feels.\\n\r\nAmerican-made vampire story has nothing on this, this is how Japanese love story makes it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 9\\n\\n\r\nFull respect to Mamiko Noto on this one. She fully asserted and gave Kurunama Sawako the 100% life she needed. And this is one of the fewest anime where I can decipher (and yes you don't need forensics to sense that out) that even the seiyuus were having fun doing the voicing; for example, Miyuki Sawashiro is at her natural best as Yano-chin, and also is Yuuko Sanpei as Yano-chin; EVEN Aya Hirano as Kurumi-chan can't hide her natural voice on this.\\n\r\nAs for the music, I'm not a fan of either the opening and ending songs but I don't think I can ask for anything better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's not that difficult to rate it at 10. I mean, I wouldn't even be writing this long if I haven't enjoyed it. There are romantic anime out there like Tsubasa Chronicles, One Week Friend, Kannazuki no Miko (okay this is shoujo-ai), Waiting in the Summer, Clannad, and the list goes on, but Kimi ni Todoke is juz special.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 9\\n\\n\r\nI can't believe a time will come when I've watched a shoujo anime and be able to genuinely rate it at NINE. I originally wanted to rate it as EIGHT (around 7.5 if only MAL wills it), but I can't; because it feels too understated to put an 8 rating to it.\\n\r\nBut not to worry, I'm about to watch the 2nd season so maybe, just maybe I'd fetch the 10-rating there.\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is just brilliant. It's like how Bruce Lee quoted \"Simplicity is the key to brilliance\".\\n\r\nIt's like if we're comparing (analogy) cars, the American-made vampire story is like that silly but famous DeLorean which is a very flawed car in real-life but reeks of Hollywood thanks to its fictional time-traveling alter-ego. But Kimi ni Todoke, being an awesome sublime Japanese car--this is a Lexus, the Lexus LFA. It just went on from being simple, idealistic, unrealistic little shoujo story to being a love story you can perfectly love at all thanks to its right touches, and the right delivery of characters (and the right seiyuus---but okay, that's a personal opinion) in a plot that was meant to be wrong in every literature sense. And this is what you get: a shoujo love story worth the watch (and love).\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Kimi ni Todoke is just like how Lexus was idealistic to their LFA, and it worked.",

            "content": "First of all, what's a good show? Well, for me a good show, anime or not, should be able to create its own structures, establish a relation of empathy with the viewer and give an important contribution for the world, as critical or acritical portrait of something. Some shows develop in the field of fantasy, but are able to create parallels with modern day life. \r\n   Kimi Ni Todoke is not only a good show. Is an almost perfect show. I'm not a person who gives a 10 rating easily, but I couldn't say no to this particular anime. Why?I'll tell you!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\n   The best plots are, sometimes, based on conceptual nihilism, and Kimi Ni Todoke is a perfect example of that. In the tradition of the shoujo genre, this anime's action takes place in nowadays Japan, within a 10th Grade class. Sawako is a student that can't fit in the social groups that surround her, and she is most times misinterpretated and thought to have supernatural habilities. \\n\r\n   The pacing, developing and inteligent cliffhangers really brought something extra to it. There's also, I think, a bit of reality distortion according to Sawako's point of view, as in the personality of Kazehaya, that could be some sort of japanese Jesus Christ. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\n   The somewhat alternative styling in characters and the watercolour based cenarios are magical, and really push you deeper into the world of Kimi Ni Todoke. Also, the use of chibi and exageration of expressions, such as in Kare Kano, will help you create a relation of empathy with the characters and feel some nostalgia while watching scenes that remind you of your school days. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\n  Both opening and ending song are excelent, not my kind of music, but the right one for Kimi Ni Todoke. The in-show music is also good, sometimes with piano or guitar versions of the OP and END songs. I pretty much enjoyed all the toons for relaxed/comical moments. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\n   This is the really trump card of Kimi Ni Todoke. \\n\r\n   Sawako is a perfect character at all levels. Her reactions and unability to socialize and the evolution suffered after meeting her friends, Chizu and Yano, are very reasonable and realistic. She is the anime girl you will fall in love easily. \\n\r\n   Chizu and Yano are the counter-balances of Sawako, and they are responsible for her evolution as a social person.\\n\r\n   Actually Kazehaya is the first responsible for that, but only further will he have a more important role within Sawako's life, although he is, basicly, the object of her motivations.\\n\r\n   It is the realism and affectivity related to the characters that make Kimi Ni Todoke an awesome and kawaii show. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\n   So, in conclusion, I loved Kimi Ni Todoke, and is a pleasure for me to review it and recommend it to you. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n",

The characters are developed very well, and are hilarious. The only bad thing about this anime is that sometimes it is so annoying I can hardly stand it. However, these moments don't last too long. Also, both series don't have a very satisfying ending. Also, the story actually does not seem like a romance till much later.\r\nOverall, this is an awesome show to watch, very worth it! ;-D",

            "content": "\u3051 \u306b \u5c4a \u3051 - Kimi ni Todoke is an enchanting but timid love story. The slice of life combines the typical school life of the protagonist, which is characterized by prejudice and exclusion, with a very tender love story. In order to ensure that the character portrayal and the topics addressed do not superimpose the romanticism, there are some nice side stories that compensate this with comedy.\r\nStory: very slow but believable with a lot of depth (8/10) \r\nThe initially closed emotional world of Kuronuma Sawako is awakened, and slightly expanded with each episode. One could criticize that the romanticism compared to the comedy sometimesseems a bit pale due to the shyness of the protagonists. I found the slow but credible emotional development as a fitting counterpart to the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: genre-typical but aptly presented (8/10) \\n\r\nThe cast is a well-known but successful mix of genre-typical and on the other hand, very different characters. Amusingly, protagonists have more in common than it seems at first glance.\\n\\n\r\n*The description of the characters may include spoilers, so better watch the anime first.* \\n\\n\r\nKuronuma Sawako:\\n\r\nKrunoma \u9ed2\u6cbc(= black | swamp), the Kanji leave no doubt, Sawako-san is an outsider. Long, pitch-black hair, an insecure voice, a restrained nature as well a doll-like appearance make her ghostly and scary in the eyes of her classmates. If she bows her head out of shyness so that her pony covers the eye area, then that sight sends icy shivers down the spine of her classmates. The rumour mill does the rest. Completely isolated, her shy attempts to reach someone beyond this wall only make it worse. The allusion to Yamamura \"Sadako\" from the horror novel trilogy The Ring (\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0 ) by Suzuki K\u00f4ji (\u9234\u6728 \u5149\u53f8) is not a compliment. The novels are based on Japanese mythology in the form of an Onry\u00f4 (\u6028\u970a), a spirit that seeks revenge. The leitmotif of the underdog who falls in love with School-Beau is not new, but much emphasis has been placed on the development of feelings as well as the resulting difficulties and doubts that one could have as a socially shunned person. Kuronuma Sawako is a lovely, very sensitive character. Her altruistic way of acting and thinking is perceived as strange. The beauty of her personality is hardly noticed by anyone. The title Kimi ni todoke \"Reaching You\" hits the nail on the head. To reach someone beyond the wall of misunderstandings, superficiality and prejudices in the hope of gaining friendship and affection. Admirable, as she tries every day to clarify the misunderstandings. If the plot seems too slow or even cheesy, you should skip the anime.\\n\r\nKazehaya Shouta:\\n\r\nHe is always the center of attention and self-confident in dealing with others. Only Sawako's sensitive nature disarms his coolness. He seems clumsy, emotional and always a little jealous. He is thoroughly honest, does not hide his emotions but does not find the right words. The similarity of the protagonists in this point makes up a large part of the charm of the anime.\\n\r\nYano Ayane:\\n\r\nShe is strong-willed, smart, pretty and has the gift of gab. The rumor mill does not credit her with the best reputation, but unlike Sawako, she knows how to defend herself. She does not take everyone into her heart, but whoever finds a place there has a strong and helpful friend.\\n\r\nYoshida Chizuru:\\n\r\nQuick-tempered, energetic, direct and super emotional. That makes her adorable and with her impulsive, lively nature she always provides for action.\\n\r\nSanada Ryu:\\n\r\nI like his good-natured and relaxed manner. Because of its silent nature, his few words bring the interlocutors to the right idea.\\n\r\nKurumizawa Ume:\\n\r\nPretty, cute, popular, a real crush for boys at Kitahoro High School. But the little sweetheart is a sly old dog with a trunk full of tricks and keep an eye on a certain boy. I found her development well illustrated and in the end surprising.\\n\\n\r\n*spoiler alert end*\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: Drawings unusual, simple but nice and creating the right atmosphere (8/10)\\n\r\nShiina Karuho's drawing style is certainly not everyone's cup of tea. However, it's the simple depiction that underlines the expression and places it in the foreground as an essential element. Very well done, because with regard to the manga, especially in the close-ups, you can see that Shiina-san has drawn beautiful and emotional pictures. The eye area of Sawako, for example, has an endearing pen stroke that makes her eyes special. I particularly liked the fact that the reduction emphasizes the intensities of the scenes. On the other hand, the skillful use of soft pastel colours and soft focus effects are friendly and cordial to the viewer. The anime adaptation has the same dreamy, friendly image design as the manga, the presentation is very reminiscent of the style of the French Impressionists and is also well comparable with watercolors. In Combination with a decent animation, the realization successfully implement the same great atmosphere and the beautiful image design of the manga is reflected in the anime. A very special and beautiful example is when Sawako-san speaks to Shouta-kun for the first time. Even if I`m not really a fan of chibi or super deforming, but in combination with the comedy and slapstick elements, it is in balance with the emotional plot.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: lovingly accompanying the mood, but hardly any peculiarity, except the ED (7/10)\\n\r\nThe background music is from the instrumental formation S.E.N.S (sound, earth, nature, spirit). The Arrangements like \"Aozora\", \"Arigatou\" or \"Hohoemi\" have a really nice sound and provide a multifaceted acoustic pleasure that almost fondly accompanies the scenes.\\n\r\nThe OP Kimi ni Todoke is a light, gentle J-Pop intro and is sung by Tanizawa Tomofumi. The somewhat unusual and slightly nasal-sounding voice, the cheerful music with matching lyrics, puts the audience in the right mood for the anime. The animation of the OP is tactfully appropriate, simple but very charming, the mostly female audience is addressed well, without being too cheesy and frightening the guys completely.\\n\r\nThe ED Kataomoi is an alternative J-Pop song and is sung by Chara (Watabiki Miwa). Her voice is super shrill and oddly special, but with alternative rock songs like \"Katte ni Kita\" or \"Tiny Tiny Tiny\" (these, are not in the Anime!) she really comes across well. The animation for the ED is just cute and a great contrast to the voice. Whether you like the ED or not, is in the eye of the beholder but it's not badly done. You can say that being different is not a synonym for beauty, but I perceived it as completely unexpected and refreshingly different in a musical way.\\n\r\nThe voice actors give the anime a huge part its appealing charm. Especially the harmony between Sawako's shy, tender voice, which is spoken by Noto Mamiko, and the gentle and soft timbre of Namikawa Daisuke, who gives Shouta his voice. The other characters have also got very good voice actors, a nice example in my eyes is Sawashiro Miyuki as voice for Yano Ayane. Her character is feminine, smart but also tough, and that is reflected well in her synchronization.\\n\\n\r\nAn emotional and gently narrated love story, not only recommended for fans of the Slice of Life. However, what makes this anime extraordinary is the fact that very convincing and balanced, themes such as bullying, prejudice and exclusion are presented clearly and vividly. Although the presentation is psychologically simple, it is still true. If you liked this anime, you might also be interested in \"Ao Haru Ride\" or \"Suki-tte Ii na yo\".\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and have fun watching.",

It's hard not to grow fond of the supporting characters Chizuru and Ayane, which are quite relatable to me.\r\nThis story delivered the fuzziness I search for in shoujos, without the excessive drama. There was a good balance between comedy and relationship development. My only disappointment is how it dragged on for the last few episodes without a satisfactory ending. I guess they were planning on asequel. \\n\\n\r\nDespite a lack of substance in the plot, the storytelling was fantastic. I also thoroughly enjoyed the soothing watercolor backgrounds.

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke is a very entertaining and lively series which end each episode with either leaving a smile on your face or genuine worry for the characters. This anime is both humorous and exciting while also giving a good plot and a magnificent opening and closing songs. After watching each episode I can guarantee you will be burning with desire to get to the next episode as quickly as possible and soon begin contemplating which is more important; sleep or knowing how Sawako gets through the situation she found herself in.\r\nIn order to be able to break down the anime accordingly let's take alook at how the series genres play a role in the series plot and overall enjoyment; Slice of Life, Romance, School, Shoujo.\\n\\n\r\nSlice of Life~ In regards to this genre there isn't much criticism since all in all it stays loyal to the genre. It is a story about teenagers going to school and going about their daily lives by going places with friends, letting us see inside the family life of Sawako and Ryu as well as giving us the faint details about Ayane's relationship with her college boyfriend. All in all the anime stays true to its genre.\\n\\n\r\nRomance~ This genre is held well by the series main characters and their love interests such as Sawako's admiration of Shouta and Ume's feelings for Shouta. Romance is seen throughout the anime mostly between the main characters Shouta and Sawako and revolves about the two discovering their feelings for each other. In conclusion, the anime stays true to this genre also. \\n\\n\r\nSchool~ This genre is fitting since the main events that are important to the plot take place in the school and around the school as well as constantly referring to the school. I see no criticisms I could make towards the placement of this genre.\\n\\n\r\nShoujo~ In case some of you don't know this term is closely tied to the Japanese word meaning young woman, therefore, meaning that the target audience would be of the female gender but don't be discouraged if you are a male who wishes to watch this since the show isn't too biased toward gender. So I would say this genre is suited to an extent.\\n\\n\r\nI personally believe that the series also goes hand in hand with the Comedy genre and am sad to see that it is not mentioned in the description of the anime which could have made a difference in the views and ratings of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMy criticism would fall in the fact that some parts of the anime are quite dull and a little irritating with the awkwardness of the main protagonist Sawako. \\n\r\nThe episodes are 22 minutes each so time flies while watching this show but I wouldn't recommend watching it all in one go since it does get irritating and tiring after the first 12 episodes.\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series I believe to be very beautiful and traditional. It looks very artistic and welcoming. \\n\r\nThis could also be said for the opening which is around 1 minute and 4 seconds. The opening is upbeat and catchy as well as soothing. Trust me after hearing the tune and seeing the visuals you won't be able to skip through the loveliness of it all.\\n\r\n But I do admit I don't personally find the storyline of the series to be worth 25 episodes and a second season I firmly believe it could have been wrapped up a lot quicker and would have been a lot more enjoyable. \\n\r\ntherefore the story itself earns a 6/10 which I still believe is a fair score considering.\\n\r\nThe artwork I believe deserve 7/10 due to the visuals being magnificent, but that does not mean it deserved 10 points since some parts of the anime were too chibi for my liking and lazy at times.\\n\r\nthe sound deserves a 6/10 for its opening and closing songs no more due to the voice acting being quite poor in some parts.\\n\r\nCharacters deserve an 8/10 due to their charisma and their power to stand out. Especially Sawako who is considered scary looking and often related to Sadako from The Ring. Chizuru also deserves points for her tomboyish attitude and the kindness she brings to the series. none of the characters were made to be super beautiful or super special which makes them, in a way, more realistic.\\n\r\nEnjoyment deserves an 8/10 since the show kept me entertained and smiling throughout its duration. I am taking points off for the sheer fact that the series could have been more enjoyable with a better paste.\\n\r\nOverall the anime deserves the 8/10 mark and I would recommend it for people who are looking for a chill heartwarming anime that they can enjoy once and recharge themselves. \\n",

            "content": "(English isn't my first language so I apologize if I make any mistake.\r\nThis is also my first review so it might not be very fair.)\r\nA girl named Sawako starts highschool and has for objective, making friends with people of her class. But as she enters the classroom, people stare at her because of her looks ; she has very pale skin, long black hair and dark eyes, which caused people to call her \"Sadako\" (in reference of the movie ''The Ring\"). But then of course, the perfect and most popular boy of the class, Kazehaya, is the first one to talk to her and sheis lovestruck. Kimi ni Todoke is pretty much all about that. \\n\\n\r\nStory : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nA cliche and plain lovestory about the 'invisible girl'(Sawako) and the 'popular boy'(Kazehaya). I think this is one of the most plain story I've ever seen. I don't know how many times I have seen this in the shoujos. The only thing that is 'uncommon' is the appearance of Sawako and her background. 70% of the anime is Sawako and Kazehaya blushing while they are together. 30% is the plot that is struggling to move forward. This anime is awfully slow, which made me quite impatient and bored while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good. The artstyle is quite plain but it's rather pleasant to the eye. The animation is very smooth, especially in the openings and the endings. They are always very cute and interesting to watch, always depicting Sawako and Kazehaya together, or Sawako's friends. Some scenes were very beautiful and they fit the artstyle very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings were all very good. I enjoyed every single one. While the animation was amazing, the songs they chose were lovely as well. The OST wasn't particularly memorable but it fit the ambience of the scenes. This anime was very calm and cute, and I think the music played a big role in this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI felt like Kazehaya and Sawako could have been deeper characters because their chara-design and background were interesting. They are very appealing at the beginning but then, they start to become boring because of the lack of character development. Everything became predictable because of that. \\n\r\nThe side characters were also awfully cliche. The athletic tall girl, the makeup guru friend, the blase quiet boy, the popular and handsome rival, the bitchy and evil rival who's an hypocrite. Not a good thing.\\n\r\nThey have rather good chara-designs but I think they could have been a little bit more in the spotlight. They were unfortunately too invisible in this show and some of them were really underrated despite their plain personality. The character development in the side characters was really amazing and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only things that I really enjoyed were the art and the music. I had dropped the anime for a certain period of time because I was just, too lazy to finish it. It really didn't excite me and it was just a pain to think about it. Everything was so predictable, so slow and so cheesy that it made me kind of angry. Some of the moments were really cute, while some of them were just cringy. I usually enjoy shoujos and this type of anime in general but this one was just a waste. Lots of things could have been better and improved, especially the end. It's really a shame \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could give a lower mark to this anime but there were some really good things in this anime. If you're searching for a really sweet, cute and classic shoujo, then I recommend it to you. If that's not the case, then you should just overlook this anime.\\n\r\nI tried to be as objective as possible and I think this is the most fair mark I can give.",

            "content": "This is why some shoujos should never be turned into animes because sometimes what works well in a manga just doesn't once animated:\r\nI first came to know Kimi ni Todoke through the live action which I loved. Bought the manga, loved it in spite of being soppy and reaching volume 27 now... starting to drag A LOT...\r\nAnyway, Kimi ni Todoke just doesn't contain enough story to make it such a long show. 25 episodes for a couple of volumes where not much happens is just too long. While it works in the manga because ultimately, even if it's slow paced, there's just not that manyspace you want to waste on dragging things. It takes time to draw.\\n\\n\r\nThe live-action made the wise choice to shorten the draggiest part of the manga and make it a great slice-of-life high school drama that made it cute, without being too corny. The anime however drags the most annoying parts, and follows the manga to a tee. It feels so slow and corny that ultimately I couldn't help but cringe in front of my screen but arguably, it's faithful to the series. It's just that the animated version doesn't work at all for me.",

            "content": "May Contain Minor Spoilers!!!\r\nKimi ni Todoke is one of those shows that has such a good start, that you would never even consider it being disappointing. What starts off with an interesting premise with fun, likeable characters soon loses itself in its slow pace, strange humor, and awkward interactions. Though the show manages to stay afloat, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a few people jump ship by the end of it.\r\nThe story of Kimi ni Todoke begins with our main protagonist Kuronuma Sawako. The name \u201cSawako\u201d has the unfortunate case of sounding a lot like \u201cSadako\u201d, the creepy girl from The Ring. This, alongwith Sawako\u2019s general shyness and quiet demeanor, leads all of her classmates and instructors to believe she is cursed. This is not helped by the fact that every time she tries to correct any misunderstandings, she speaks with a gravelly voice and looks like she\u2019s about to murder everyone in her vicinity. This leads Sawako to become ostracized by the entire school until the magical day when Kazehaya Shouta, the most friendly, popular, and cutest boy in school, decides to invite Sawako to a \u201ctest of courage\u201d-type class event.  This allows Sawako to befriend Chizu and Ayane, two girls from her class, and have a private, little moment with Kazehaya, which allows their romantic story to slowly begin.\\n\\n\r\nIt is here that the show begins its slow decline towards mediocrity. While the premise feels like it sets up a lot of interesting things to happen, the reality is that it\u2019s a set-up for a few things to happen at an excruciatingly awkward pace. The first thing that the show focuses on is Sawako\u2019s efforts to become more sociable with her class and with her two new friends. This feels like it happens almost immediately. Though Sawako herself takes almost the entire series to come out of her shell a little, she almost instantly becomes friends with her classmates through little \u201cbribes\u201d. Whether its cookies, class notes, or \u201cmedical attention\u201d, Sawako\u2019s immense kindness wins over the school almost instantly. Though not a deal-breaker, this makes the entire \u201cThe Ring\u201d setup feel contrived and created just to give Kazehaya a reason to talk to her, because apparently he\u2019s conveniently into girls that don\u2019t get a lot of attention. The second thing the show focuses on is her growing infatuation with Kazehaya. Conversely, this part of the story is incredibly padded. Despite both of these characters\u2019 obvious romantic interest for each other, not a single one of them is capable of ever pulling the trigger. Almost every interaction between these two characters involves awkward dialogue, close-ups of them blushing, and you screaming at the screen for them to just confess and kiss already! Usually this drawn out style makes these shows endearing, but the frequency of it in Kimi ni Todoke can be infuriating at times. This simplicity is expected for this type of show and isn\u2019t inherently bad, but it is ruined by a somewhat mediocre cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already briefly talked about Sawako, but despite generally being a really nice, sweet, and loveable character, Sawako frequently turns into an airheaded, socially awkward, bore. She will spend hours of this show\u2019s runtime being confused by social norms and generally making poor decisions because of her failing to grasp a situation. This happens so frequently that the show even creates a specific, cutesy art-style for every occasion that Sawako starts freaking out about minor things. This also makes up for the bulk of this show\u2019s comedy, and while it started out as a quirky thing to chuckle about, there\u2019s simply too much of it. Kazehaya has the opposite problem of just kind of being there because he\u2019s the main love interest. He exists simply to allow Sawako to grow and develop into a more well-rounded character, while he shows little to no growth or development. If anything, he degrades overtime from a charismatic jock to a shy, awkward mess that can barely even look Sawako in the face.\\n\\n\r\nThe three \u201cfriend\u201d characters don\u2019t fare much better. Chizuru Yoshida is introduced as the athletic type who is initially rumored to be a brute that is quick to anger and beat people up. Despite having some rough, Sawako-esque attempts at humor, Chizu is given a decent arc that results in her being one of the more developed characters in the series. Ayane Yano is introduced as the flirty, beauty-queen who is initially rumored to sleep around A LOT. While being my favorite of the friends, Ayane suffers from an \u201cabusive boyfriend\u201d arc that ends as quickly as it begins, and not really having much personal growth besides that. Ryuu Sanada is introduced as Kazehaya and Chizuru\u2019s less-than-talkative friend. Ryuu suffers from very little screen time and a \u201csecret crush\u201d side story that doesn\u2019t really go anywhere, but his cool and stoic nature generally makes him a treat to see. The only other character worth mentioning is Sawako\u2019s short-lived rival Kurumi. Kurumi\u2019s two-faced nature sets her up as a potential antagonist for the series and is responsible for one of the more interesting series of moments in the story. It, however, turns out disappointing because of how quickly it is dealt with and how little it actually accomplishes in bringing Sawako and Kazehaya together.\\n\\n\r\nThis mostly positive, mixed bag of characters eventually leads the story to a sweet, but severely lacking conclusion. I\u2019m positive that the second season will do a lot to alleviate my problems with this show, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that season one feels lacking. Though the characters were entertaining enough to warrant me finishing this story in the near future, nothing presented thus far makes this show a must-watch series.\\n",

First of all , the art is a bit different in a good way, perhaps a little bit childish, although this is a shoujo anime so its justified. \r\nOverall, if you are a fan of romance,you should watch this anime. if you are not that into this genre, i suggest watching other anime. Sawako\u00b4s clueless attitude might also frustrate some people so keep that in mind.\r\nCharacters: \r\nthe main characters are Kuronuma Sawako, a girl with afrightening look , that is actually very nice, kazehaya shouta, your typical male protagonist, kind and popular, ryu, a reserved but sharp individual, chizuru , an athletic boyish girl , that is very sentimental, and ayane, a mature girl that has had her fair share of relationships.\\n\\n\r\nstory: \\n\r\nThe story starts with a relatively good pace, with kazehaya and Sawako getting to know each other, and then it starts to slow down a lot halfway through , to the point that i start shipping more the side characters (not gonna go into names) than the main ones.\\n\r\nAll in all the anime is still decent, with some funny moments.",

KNT is a good mix of both sukitte and tonari, i would say its more funny than either of them though. \\n\\n\r\nwhat strikes me as different about this anime though, is that there's a second season. i havent watched it yet but plan on doing so soon. i think a second season will allow for the romantic relationship to develop further than these typical animes. with sukitte and tonari, the series ends just has the leads are confronting their feelings. so im interested to see how far KNT will take that.",

Yet it's rather appealing. My fourteen year old sister who usually dislikes too cute stuff (she disliked Lovely Complex, please) loved this show. It's because Kimi ni Todoke feels...fresh, and its characters are all likable, especially Kuronuma Sawako. She's so good and honest you'll like her even if she's dense and \"oh my gosh what is this i'm feeling\" -y kind of girl.  Another thing I love about this anime is...the pace.The romanticpace between the main couple, I mean. It's very slooooooow...but you get to appreciate their conversations and you feel like they are really getting to know each other and falling in love beautifully. Watching them hesitantly walk the way to romance is much more delightful, then, say, \"I just met you and this is crazy but I'm gonna kiss you and two episodes later we're renting a hotel room maybe\" kind of anime. I HATE that kind of anime. \\n\r\nAlthough Kimi ni Todoke is great, it's still high school romance, though. If you don't like that kind of thing this show probably won't change your mind, though for those who like the genre, this is a true gem.",

I may understand, this is very romantic anime, so if you are in age you need it - here you go. Im a little bit old lady for this. Main character is just another \"noone loves me\" girl. There are plenty other anime with the same storyline but much greater action. Yup, action is the main thing what is missing, everything goes here so slow and predictible.... very slow... I think it was a biggest waste of my time, sorryguys, I will pick up some comedy.",

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke maybe one of the best Slice of life anime I have come across till now. For people who enjoy slow developing stories, this series definitely must to be on your list of animes to watch.\r\nStory begins with Kuronuma Sawako, who is mistook by everyone in her school as a spooky girl who can bring misfortune. A fateful encounter with Kazehaya Shota- the most popular student from her school, however, changes all that slowly. She begins to slowly open up more to others in her class. The most important change in her life is the beginning of her friendship with Ayane Yano andChizuru Yoshida. Lots of fun and happy moments follow in the course of the story which Sawako enjoys with both of them. Attitude of her classmates towards her slowly starts changing and they now accept her more than they did before. A sweet development of ever increasing feelings between Kazehaya and Sawako through out the story follows.\\n\\n\r\nAn overview:\\n\r\n1) The scenes in the series are really well crafted and are a complete delight to watch. Though Sawako is portrayed as a somewhat spooky girl she is probably the most optimistic amongst any of her classmates. Her flustering on the smallest of the things that a normal student wouldn't even bother, really add to many hilarious moments in the episodes.\\n\\n\r\n2) Her friendship with Ayane and Chizuru has been developed very carefully and is very believable.\\n\\n\r\n3) Developement of romantic feelings between Kazehaya and Sawako are really really cute and innocent.\\n\\n\r\n4) Lots of hilarious moments since Chizuru is absolutely dense when it comes to understanding many emotions.\\n\\n\r\n4) Chizuru's story unfolded at a later part of the show is really touching in many ways.\\n\\n\r\n5) Character development is strong and meticulously followed throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\n6) Dialogues are very well written and have a lot of depth if listened to carefully.\\n\\n\r\n7) Music is soothing though maybe there was some scope for improvement.\\n\\n\r\n8) Animation really good.\\n\\n\r\n9) Encode is excellent.\\n\\n\r\nNote: This is specifically for all girls: If you think that a guy shown blushing is absolutely kawaii then you have a treat in this show. Cause Kazehaya blushes a lot in this show which I personally founfd absolutely adorable :))",

And if you're into romance/everyday life storys, then this one's definitely for you! \r\nIt's basically about a girl name Sawako and something about her scares off some people so they keep a distant from her. She just never had friends but then one day, she meets a boy name Kazehaya, who's very outgoing and friendly and popular. She looks up to him and her life slowly changes after meeting him. \r\nStory:\r\nEven though i haven't finished the series yet, I know it gets 9 out of10. The story wouldn't be considered brilliant or a real masterpiece, but it has a very good calmness to it and the story is enjoyable to watch. There are a few conflicts here and there, but throughout the series, it keeps good consistency and gets me interested as more the series goes on. I must say this series seems to go really really slow for me. But I don't blame the producers since the manga story isn't that long and they've got 24 episodes to fill. ANYWHOS, it's a cute love story and has alot of funny scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nI love love this style of art. It's very pretty and cute at the same time. The OP and ED animation are fantastic and very relaxing for me o.o \\n\r\nI can't really explain how the animation is, but it's great. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI can't wait to get the OST when it comes out (or did it already come out hm..). The BGM are blended so well with certain scenes and they did a grreat job at it. I would say most of them are relaxing and very cute. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nMan, all the characters are great in this series, even the 'bad' characters. You just can't help but feel for them and in the end, like them as well. Knowing that Kimi Ni Todoke is all about romance and slice of life, I definitely didn't expect a really evil character that wants to kill people, and that's pretty obvious. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed it so far and I know I'll still enjoy watching it until the last episode of the series. It's one of those shows when you can watch it on a relaxing sunday afternoon and what not. And yes, there are a couple sad scenes, espcially when watching what Sawako has to deal with, but in the end, it leaves you with a good feeling and i dont know if i should say this, but it makes me sort of happier? Anyway, try it. \\n\\n\r\nc:",

Kimi ni Todoke \r\nOk, I'd like to start with what I've seen so far. Most people are crazy about this anime, and I see why. Great characters and it's pretty modern. As for me, I don't feel like I would watch this for two days non-stop like I do for a lot of romantic anime an such. It's like sweet girl likes sweet boy and romance sprouts between the two. The girl, Sadako(Sawako), is a young girl who is sweet and shy andmost people don't approach her since she looks a bit like Sawako from \"The Ring\". \\n\r\nOn her way to school one day, a boy named, Shota, wasn't afraid to approach her and asked her for directions since he was new to the school. She begins to develop feelings for him and, like I said, romance starts to sprout. Things start to turn around after their encounter and she makes friends and opens up a bit.\\n\r\nIt's a pretty simple anime. From what I've seen there are no inappropriate parts for young viewers. To be honest, it's not exciting really. It's like \"Nice girl meets nice guy, and BOOM, stuff happens.\" It's a cute anime, but a bit clich\u00e9. I recommend it to anyone who is first starting romance anime. \\n\r\nI did this on my phone so I'm sorry for any typos.",

I found some -no. a LOT of scenes which are compatible to be called as a shoujo-manga. The story was also good, only at the beginning, it was a bit fast. I also won't deny that I can guess some parts easily, and well... I wouldn't deny that I was quite shy while watching some scenes, especially the last episode.\r\nMy only complains are about the songs and the background effects, which were quite disturbing me severaltimes, especially the effects. As a shoujo-manga reader, I absolutely noticed that lots of manga, especially shoujo, have always put an effect like a bubble etc, and I've never really paid attention for that, since it's for an ornament for having a good yet making the background to be a bit 'crowded', but it's quite annoying if they put this into anime too, since anime was colourful, meanwhile manga wasn't.\\n\r\nOverall, this was good, and it made me amused as the main character, that 'Sunako' made me laugh several times because of her stupidity, and I love how they portrait the characters and the relationship between each others. But the most important thing is, this anime kinda reminded me of my life during high school, since it's one of the most precious memories that I've ever had.",

Now let me make this clear before I start ranting, just because I don't like this anime does not  mean that you won't. Now I have never had an anime frustrate me to this point. Let me say a couple of good things first. The art isn't so bad it can be beautiful at times, the music isn't so bad either it would always portray the mood. But that's it, the main character made me want to scream at times. No one and I meanno one is that slow, before I watched it I read a description and thought. Wow this character reminds me of myself when I was in high school. But man it was far from the truth. She is so dim that it's overwhelming, I get being isolated makes it harder to understand others when you do open up. But come on she was almost like a new born baby. And the crying I have never seen so many tears in my life, I didn't think it would ever end. There was so many opportunities to make this into a very good anime but sadly all it was about for the most part is girl unpopular, boy very popular, become friends, developed deeper feelings for each other. That's the first couple of episodes then it's just all about the drama. Characters development seemed lacking and the story just dragged on and I really had to force myself into finishing it. \\n\r\n But again this is my opinion nothing more and it seems many people like it. So don't be turned off on watching it just because of my feelings for it. You may enjoy it as well.",

I had high expectations from you but you have let me down massively.\r\nFirst of all, this anime should be called \"Goukai\" (Goukai = miunderstanding) instead. \r\nThe story is average. A girl is way too shy and gloomy looking to the point of complete regard of her existence, and a popular guy who likes her as the story progresses. I was fine with that, actually Sawako's character also made me happy to the extent of crying to say how pure someone can be.\r\nThat is all there isto it. Every single time she meets someone, there is a misunderstanding and she is way too shy to even approach them, let alone takes two Goku-like buffers to draw up the courage to actually admit it to someone.\\n\\n\r\nI understand the protagonist is shy and avoided by everyone but that does not mean that the character would not have the common sense to understand something ONE BLUNTLY SAYS TO HER FACE - THAT IS THE AMOUNT OF RIDICULE THAT HAPPENS WITH HER.\\n\\n\r\nThe cherry on top of the cake it takes 1.5 years of the anime cycle or two seasons worth for her to understand what everyone is blatantly saying to her face. Bravo Sawako, you're denser than the periodic element.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are average, an awkward/outgoing protagonist duo, and supportive friends on each side. Hence, to summarize:\\n\\n\r\n- Mediocre Characters\\n\r\n- Increasingly Frustrating episodes\\n\r\n- Art style was rather refreshing\\n\r\n- Too many f-ing misunderstandings\\n\\n\r\nThat is all.\\n\\n\r\nYoroshiku. *frustrated till the core*",

The best way to describe this show was an innocent romance, and for that reason alone it could be one of my favorites. It's a very pretty anime with a great sound track.\r\nIt is slow at parts and very frustrating when their misunderstandings get out of hand, but i think the story in all is worth getting though that.\r\n9/10",

            "content": "So, I'm going to be pretty blunt here, and it's not a review at all, more of a PSA to anyone who wants to watch this series.\r\nThe first season of Kimi ni Todoke is a complete waste of time, unless that's your initial motivation for watching the show in the first place. The first season moves at such an horrifically slow pace it's a wonder that I actually got through it all. My motivation for doing so was the linguring hope that: \"This will be the episode where something happens! I know it is!\".... Well, that moment never came..\r\nThough the artistry, the CGI and characterdevelopment is pretty solid, it just isn't enough to justify a higher mark than what I've given it (3/10). The thing that is consistent throughout both series is the realism of the characters, they certainly reminded me of people whom I used to be affiliated with at school.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said... I highly recommend the 2nd season of this show, it was such a refreshing change of pace. And although many people seemed to sneer at the introduction of a the new character [Kento], I found that it actually kept things interesting and although initially you may not take to him too favourable, I think he was pretty vital in keeping a casual, fun atmosphere to each episode. With Ryu and Pin supporting.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of flash-backs in the second-season that link back to the important moments of the first, that there's no reason to watch the first 25 episodes. You will not be missing out of the plot development... Simply because... Well, there wasn't any. \\n\\n\r\nBut ye, go watch the second season, it's good fun and pretty fucking cute, you'll be content with the ending I assure you, but there is certainly a possibility for a continuing season where we can see where the characters develop in the future. After 35 episodes leading up to the climax, I think we're owed a season that shows how their decision manifests for better or for worse.\\n\r\nI just want to say that the star of this show is Ryu, that guy made it pretty etertaining throughout the series, he provided solid comic-relief when it was needed, but he wasn't just a one-dimensional character, he's somebody that I think everybody knew at their high-school. So of course it's fun to reminisce about the good ol' days of high-school.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the shitty, monotonous post. Just don't want people waste their time with watching this season, so go watch the second!\\n\r\nPeace, Circos.\\n",

It's basically like the animators took the color illustrations from the manga and animated them. \r\nSOUND: (i guess what they mean is seiyu and music) The opening theme (Kimi Ni Todoke) is such a pretty song, i find myself singing it in the shower. All of the seiyuare very talented and the voices are just like the ones in my head as i read the manga. Ending theme by Chara was lovely at first, but as the series progressed, i found myself getting bored from it.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: this is what attracted me in the first place when i started reading the manga. Kazehaya is friendly and refreshing, Sawako is lovable and adorably innocent, Chizu-chan is hilarious, and Ryu+Pin just add to the bundle.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I'm pretty sure you can guess from the content of the review how much i utterly enjoyed this.",

I am so glad I chose to watch this though... everything about it left me so happy and Kazehaya has so many cute moments... one of my favourite moments is the end of season 2, but you won't get a spoiler out of me. I would recommend thisto absolutely EVERYONE who loves cute and feel-good animes. Seriously, you won't find much better than this. The pure and honest love Kazehaya and Kuronuma share is inspirational :D \\n\r\nThis anime has reached my favourite, officially! Kazehaya hits number 1 in my catagory of favourite anime guys... mainly because of his freshness, cheerfulness and outright cuteness lol! He's awesome. Kuronuma reaches number 1 in my catagory for favourite anime girls... because of her cuteness, always trying her best and she's so beautiful. There are so many funny moments in this anime too... really, you will not be disappointed! Give it a watch!!! RECOMMENDED 10 STARS!!!",

There is nothing particularly original about Kimi Ni Todoke but I couldn't help it; I had to keep watching.\r\nThe main character is shy, an outcast, and overall just a lonely soul. We can all agree that we have been in that position many times, which is what made me like Sawako instantly. Kazehaya is the one who starts motivating her along with Yano and Chizuru. Throughout the whole series you can't help but want to cheer forher as she slowly breaks out from her shell. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is worth a watch. The intro and outro songs fit the anime perfectly and sets the mood. I'm a guy and I loved it, so hopefully others will too.",

            "content": "The Story is really good, it is mainly a Slice of Life, romance, and shoujo anime. The story develops at a really good pace and it's not as deep as a phycological thriller it still tells a nice story that is fairly deep considering how you view it. The story rarely if ever got boring for me as it held be tight as I went through all the episodes wanting to see what happened next. The story is also unique with other shoujo anime and doesn't have many clich\u00e9s and unlike some other shoujo anime isn't this soap opera like anime that can break outdown at times rather it's much better. You might be thinking, well I'm a guy and shoujo anime and manga is for girls, well I too am a guy and I rather like shoujo anime and manga and romances, and I also like actions so you know. This is also one of the best romance animes that I've seen and I love romance anime. It really does a good job with the story though of course it being a Slice of Life anime some may think at times that it goes really slow, I really didn't think that when I was watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a place where this shines, it has wonderful and unquie characters especially Sawako and I condsider her one of my favorite anime characters as she just loveable and wonderful. As she cries we too tear up not always because it was sad but because it was beutiful and joyus. As she laughs we too find our selves laughing. Other characters in the series are good as well and I really enjoyed them like Shouta, Chizuru, Ayane, and Ryuu. Character development is wonderful and great, we really get to see how these characters grow and develop throughout the anime. It also doesn't focus on developing just one or two characters but rather several characters to a good degree and by the end you can really see how far these characters have come. Not only that but the story doesn't focus on just one love tale or just focus heavily on one character that we don't get to see a lot of the others, we really get to see into the other characters and they are really included. Because of all of the development and the time that we spend with them they really grow on you and you really like them and want them to succeed and they become amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is wonderful, I found the opening and ending themes to be great and awesome though they are only like 1 minute long compared to the normal 1 minute and thirty seconds however they are still great songs and are rememberable. They might not be the absolute best I've seen they are really good. It doesn't stop there the soundtrack in the anime also melds well and I can hardly remember hearing the same music over and over again to the point where it's overused. Though the soundtrack isn't as memberable as the opening and ending it did it's job well and I think that if I heard it in a playlist it would also be good. Maybe not where you have to have the CD of the sound track but nice to hear once in awhile.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good, it was nice and sweet and really well done. The characters where really well draw and the animation style was unquie and well done. That being said there were still some flaws, like I remember where when viewing a character from the side and a little diagnal and I think in a couple other view points as well we could only see one eye and the other side was kind of shaded in. It was enough for me to take notice, there are a couple of times where things like this happened but it doesn't greatly detract from the overall experience of the animation or the anime. The anime is not dubbed to my knowledge and I watched it subbed and the voice acting was pretty well done, I really don't have any complaints about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending, well there is a second season which only has 12 episodes, the first season has 25. So the ending of the first season was good, alight because there was a second season which I quickly jumped to. It's regretable that the second season though only has 12, I would like to see a third but who knows if that will happen. Though to comment on the second season's ending it was a little rushed but still good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a wonderful anime that I really enjoyed. I'm sure that if you like Slice of Life anime or Romance or even shoujo then you will like this anime, if you only ever watched mecha and action then maybe you will like it. It could be that nice refreshing anime that you watch. I urge you to check it out, maybe it give it a episode or just the opening, and if you don't like anime or never tried it then this could be your chance.\\n\\n",

The story is nice though typical for the high-school romance genre.  However, I think what won me over are the characters and the art.  The characters are amusing, well-developed, and fit nicely within the series.  The main character Sawako is especially likable, having a level of innocence that is very endearing, plus her voice fits the character very well.  The art not only fits theshow very nicely, but it also matches each scene.  Throughout the series, the art style changes from a more realistic style to a much simpler version during some of the more comedic moments.  These changes help enhance the feelings and emotions that each scene attempts to portray, which I think made the show even more enjoyable than it would have been otherwise.  It's a good thing that there's a second season, as I would like to see how the various romances continue to develop.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is a very heartwarming series, sure to appease fans of high-school romance.  It does have some chick-flick moments that may cause some to roll their eyes, yet they didn't deter my ability to enjoy the show.  With great art, characters, and even nice opening and ending sequences, Kimi ni Todoke is a 9/10 (Outstanding) for me.",

            "content": "I am a horror and psychological OTAKU but I also love watching action and adventure type of stories. Love stories are not really my type or at least it is the last in my lists of what I would want to watch or read. Most probably for the obvious facts that love stories have the strong tendencies of being so cheesy or too dramatic which is what I hate the most. Well, at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always believed to be the case but after watching this series I couldn\u2019t be so damn wrong. \r\nABOUT THE STORY\r\nThis beautiful story was about a very shy andweird girl in high school, Sawako, who was so outcast because of her resemblance to \u201cSADAKO\u201d of the famous movie \u201cRING\u201d. As the story went by it was revealed that she was simply so shy and awkward around people and almost everything for her was new so she\u2019s really had a hard time making friends. And this was also about a popular guy who she was looking up to and aiming to be like someday and without even realizing that the guy love her so much. The series revolved around her transformation, making important friends and most importantly, it showed how Sawako and Kazehaya fell in love with each other.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really love about the story was its simplicity and despite that, the author still managed to make it as beautiful and amazing like those famous stories with a heavy main plot. This series proved that love stories doesn\u2019t have to be too dramatic with characters sleeping around and end up hurting each other or people dying and making the lead character broken or worst having a half-assed resolve because you can\u2019t choose among so many girls like those HAREM-type of stories. This series was just about a girl who genuinely wanted to make friends and realizing how sweet it was to fall in love for the first time. There were no over to top scenes or cheesy dialogues. The characters\u2019 thoughts and dialogues were genuinely honest and innocent as if it was the feelings from a real person which was one of the strongest points of the series. Nowadays, most series put so much drama to the scenes and dialogues that make it over exaggerated which is not what real people would do or say in real life. The series showed more of the realistic side of life. Every romantic moment is expressed in details and almost magical. Even from simple romantic gestures, little sweet talks and even cute jealousies of both main leads, the romance is expressed genuinely. It is not too much or too dramatic. It is made as simple as possible and yet the impact is no doubt so huge which make the story so amazing despite the simplicity.  This is the definition of what a true love story should be, without any malice or people going insane, without a very serious heavy main plot. It was just a pure and innocent love story like our first love or for some what our first love should have been. The story reminds us how wonderful truly it is to fall in love.\\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nAlmost all the characters were so likeable whether the supporting characters or even the third parties. Both Sawako\u2019s and Kazehaya\u2019s friends were such nice people and would always support them behind the scenes. I also love Pin, his not only hilarious but he can also be reliable in important times. \\n\\n\r\nABOUT KAZEHAYA AND SAWAKO\\n\r\nOf course, the two main protagonists were the strongest characters among all of them. Sawako was the shy and very awkward type of person and Kazehaya was the popular and friendliest among the campus. I really love Sawako for being so innocent. She would be troubled for every little thing around her and would always assume that she might be bother to others. I would always thought of wishing to protect her innocence as so she won\u2019t be dirtied by the harsh reality of the world. What I really love about her was despite her shyness and insecurities; she worked hard just to be accepted by everyone. One thing that not only me but lots of her closes friends admire about her. And did I mention she was absolutely hilarious! She and Pin were the main source of comic relief in the series. But of course, let\u2019s not forget the very gorgeous Kazehaya who despite being very popular was still level-headed. Unlike your typical popular guys who sleeps around and as if they are collecting girls they can go out with, Kazehaya was also innocent about love and didn\u2019t even had the courage to confess to the girl of his dreams. He would even be innocently and cutely be awkward towards Sawako despite being famous. I also admire that his not the type of guy who would believe anything others would say and would just believe it if it was straight from the person himself. I strongly believed that\u2019s one of many reasons why he loved Sawako for being so honest and straightforward. He was also so damn cute whenever he would get jealous or shy when his admiring Sawako. What was really hilarious was the very obvious fact that both of them didn\u2019t even realized that they felt the same feelings for each other and all they had to do was be honest with each other and just say what they truly felt. They didn\u2019t even notice that each other\u2019s gesture towards the other was in fact a hint of love. They were such a cute and too dense couple. They are two of the best characters in my hundred lists of best characters.\\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nThe animation was superb. Every scene was beautifully made especially the effects in important scenes where the characters showed their strongest emotions or said their super cool lines. The characters were amazingly made; see how beautiful Sawako and Kazehaya are as well as the other characters. It was almost like a sin how the author made such gorgeous looking characters. And to add it up, the soundtracks were captivating. It was like the music made the series a lot more magnificent. Like a cherry on top of a cake. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long review! Well, it is one of the bests after all so we should express all the pent up ideas and comments.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to remember your sweet first love then you can definitely relate to this series and if it\u2019s not that sweet then you would definitely wish to have this kind of love story when you were younger. With the best story, cool lines, amazing characters, captivating animation and music, this series is definitely one you cannot miss. Find out why love has been the most important and the sweetest feeling in the world since ancient time.\\n",

            "content": "Take your average well-intentioned but misunderstood girl and place her in a friendship with one of the most popular boys in class, and what do we have? Despite the general cliched feeling the anime originally gives off, Kimi ni Todoke is actually quite a pleasant but at times exceptionally frustrating anime with, yeah, a couple of cliches but quite an emotional feeling and absorbing cast, especially when it comes to the supporting cast. \r\nOur protagonist is naive but generally a wholehearted person, which at times proves irritating due to the problems her lack of self esteem and ability to misunderstand everything cause. Despite this, thesupporting cast makes up for it more than enough, while providing comedic relief and all-round humor to the anime, and the supporting cast quite honestly push the anime that little bit further.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow Sawako (mistakenly nicknamed Sadako) as she originally sets out to befriend her classmates and attempts to follow Shota's (her eventual love interest) example of being a 'popular, refreshing person.' Eventually, she goes on to try to pursue a relationship with Shota. Despite the general simplicity of the plot, there are an endless amount of interferences and misunderstandings between the two, which causes this anime to be really, really frustrating to the point of me cringing whenever they attempt to talk to each other.     \\n\\n\r\nThe art, particularly the background art, had a very soft feeling, as though the characters were in a watercolour painting, which gave the anime a very delicate beautiful feeling, especially combined with the fragile soundtrack and the scene of the anime. I will admit everything was pieced together beautifully, the music, the art and the characters fitted together like a jigsaw, the animation was fluid and the voice acting was quite good.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, despite how angry i can get at the characters, I've already watched this anime twice and will again someday. It's quite a precious thing to watch and you will grow quite attached to it - felling quite satisfied with the ending, but a little sad to see it go.",

I was really shy in school and I had rumors about me and people who harassed me.  I never really had friends or a \"prince charming\" like boyfriend, but it felt nice to be able to relate to a character so much.

            "content": "Social isolation, like many afflictions dealing with the mind, is a cruel mistress. It robs you of precious moments before they can even form, even as you take a perverse sense of comfort in its cycle of self-harm. You fail to reach out to others, convince yourself that you deserved to fail, and then fully expect to continue to fail. Without the tools to change your behavior, in fact, you won't even realize the overlying problem at all, because this *is* your normality, having felt this way for so, so long.\r\nAs an outsider looking in, this can be a frustrating process to watch. Why doesn'tour female protagonist, Sawako, just simply state what she thinks in order to avoid confusion? Why is she so critical of herself; unable to accept her true worth as a beautiful, intelligent, kind young woman? Why doesn't she give Kazehaya the damn chocolates? Just *headpalm* give him the damn *backshove* chocolates! What's stopping you? He's right there!\\n\\n\r\nAnd that last scenario is in the *second* season. Because this takes time to resolve, I understand the criticism that is often levelled toward \"Kimi No Todoke\" - which translates to \"From Me to You\" - that there are episodes where \"nothing\" happens. This is because what may be a huge step forward developmentally for Sawako may very well be an everyday, mundane event to you or me. It can take the form of a single sentence that is no longer left unsaid, a piece of advice that is truly taken to heart, or the revelation that maybe she is capable of being loved. It may be slow, but there is definite progress, and it's heartwarming to see. \\n\\n\r\nCompare this with Tomoko, the main character in \"WataMote.\" Although it's a comedy and not a romance, it serves as a perfect example of a character who not only suffers from her own crippling social problems but always seems to find herself back at square one. Although you find yourself laughing at the situations she gets into, it is often very hard to watch her fruitless struggles if you have any empathy for her at all. Even though WataMote tries to end on a somewhat hopeful note, Tomoko's future is far from clear, and that is because through the entire season she lacks the one key ingredient that Sawako has in spades: a support system.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Shouta Kazehaya and friends. I have heard Kazehaya described as a \"Gary Stu\" and as with other opinions about this show that I feel are misplaced, I can understand why. On the outside he appears to be the perfect guy: attractive, outgoing, kind, popular, and sure of himself. Those first four traits are undeniable, but that last one is put into doubt more and more as the show progresses. Shouta doesn't always say the right thing, or give the right impression, or understand every situation - and it leads to many confusing situations for him and Sawako both. The beauty of it all is, despite first appearances, that Shouta needs her just as much as Sawako needs him. And it's everyone that needs to come to this realization, not just Shouta but Sawako as well, along with their classmates, and you too, the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way you get to meet a handful of side characters who are fleshed-out nicely and make a major contribution in moving the story along. As in life, some are quick to be friends with Sawako, and some aren't. Many of them start out as straight-up antagonists, but just as we learn new things about Sawako and Shouta along the way, there is much to appreciate about the ones who throw a wrench into the works, even deliberately. No one here is one-dimensionally cruel just for cruelty's sake. And again in a true reflection of how life actually works, many important lessons can be learned from those who are most critical of you.\\n\\n\r\nIt must be noted that \"Kimi ni Todoke\" makes all its points without beating your head over it. It avoids overusing symbolism, constantly repeating character exposition, and characters going into tearful hysterics every few minutes that afflict other titles such as \"Your Lie in April.\" Also unlike \"Your Lie in April,\" there's not this sense of impending doom that settles over the entire proceeding. Even during the setbacks, \"Kimi ni Todoke\" remains positive which makes for a comfortable watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, Production I.G. did a fine job of incorporating the original character designs from the manga source material. The animation quality is good, and actually improves slightly as the season progresses. The soundtrack is quite good too, especially the opening and ending vocal tracks of which instrumental versions find themselves woven into the episodes on occasion. The voice performances, as is to be expected nowadays, is top-notch with well-established talent taking up the roles of main characters and side characters alike.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, if you are one to appreciate a good romance story, then I cannot recommend \"Kimi ni Todoke\" enough. If I have any criticism of it at all, it lies in the fact that for now we only have the two seasons to watch these characters grow and flourish. I am hopeful that since the manga is still going as I write this, we may get to see them again on the small screen for a third season, or maybe even the big screen as a one-hour movie that double features with something else. Sawako and Kouta deserve that much.",

            "content": "This series had a huge impact on me when I watched it for the first time about six years ago. I thought it was a true masterpiece, and I still think it is. I could go on for a long time listing everything that I love about this anime, but there is already so much been said about that so I don\u2019t even know what else I can add to that. The story, the characters, music, art\u2026 Everything is just top notch. It\u2019s an amazing fairytale and a classic romcom right there.\r\nBut\u2026\r\nRecently I re-watched the first season, for the first time in many years. Andnow that I have become older, smarter and wiser I started to see things in Kimi ni Todoke a bit differently. As I was re-watching the first season, I started to notice certain issues and interpret things in a different way. It\u2019s like I\u2019m watching it through a prism of time and all the knowledge that I have accumulated in the past years.  So instead of praising this anime I would rather focus on those issues and look at some things more in detail. Just remember that I\u2019m NOT saying that this anime is bad, as a product of entertainment, I just want to share some of my observations and interpretations. You can do whatever you want with that information.\\n\\n\r\nSo there I go:\\n\\n\r\nWhen I was watching it for the first time, I was around the age of 18, just about to finish high school. And like I said earlier, looking back at it, I realize how much this anime impacted me. Not only emotionally, but it also influenced me in how I developed further as a person for a long time, how I behaved to other people and generally speaking\u2026 It had a huge influence on my perception of reality. The most important point that I am trying to make is that \u201cfairytales\u201d like Kimi ni Todoke (or any romcom for that matter) can really f*** up people\u2019s minds. \\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is a highly distorted representation of reality where people are actually being kind to each other, where \u201cbeing weak\u201d is being encouraged and idealized, where people love and help each other unconditionally, where everyone is basically being \u201chappy together\u201d in one dumb clusterfuck. Kimi ni Todoke is the embodiment of \u201cwishful thinking\u201d. Everything described above are in my opinion the worst things to promote and teach to children/young people. Yea\u2026 You might say something like \u201cIt\u2019s just a fairytale bro, aren\u2019t all fairytales supposed to feed people\u2019s wishful thinking and be unrealistic?\u201d. Yea, maybe. But the problem is that animes like Kimi ni Todoke can set highly unrealistic expectation from the environment, which can result in disappointment in life and people, depression and other psychological problems. \\n\\n\r\nKids/Young people who are not educated and who don\u2019t have a fully developed brain yet, unable to think rationally and strategically, might really think that all the events and behavior presented in Kimi ni Todoke is legit. The worst thing is that most kids who watch that show don\u2019t even question the behavior and motives of the characters, and most kids automatically assume that people behave like that in real life too.  In the reality, teenagers don\u2019t try to include anti-social, weak and dumb kids\u2026 Or ANY kid who deviates from being \u201cnormal\u201d. No they don\u2019t shower them with warmth and love. Most people are very egocentric. Any person who\u2019s been through an average high school knows that the reality is actually different from what is being presented in Kimi ni Todoke.\\n\\n\r\nMain character Sawako\u2019s behavior is just text book autism. She doesn\u2019t understand why people act in a certain way, she doesn\u2019t understand the motives behind other people\u2019s behavior\u2026 I could go on for a long time summing up all the symptoms, but you can go see it for yourself, it\u2019s all right there. Just take the opening scene for example, where Sawako is overhearing a conversation in the toilets, like the first 2-3 minutes of the first episode. She is alone, people are gossiping about her, nobody is taking her serious and people are literally running away from here. I think the opening scene of the first episode actually shows the reality the way it is for Sawako\u2026 It\u2019s cold, grey and lonely. But because you are only getting it shown for such a short period of time, and because it contrasts so much with the rest of the series where everything is colorful and fluffy, you simply don\u2019t get enough time for your consciousness to register what\u2019s going on. I simply don\u2019t have enough space and time to debunk every scene, but you can just go watch it yourself. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cFor some reason, I always find people apologizing to me\u201d. \\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not living up to your expectations, but I can\u2019t see ghosts.\u201d... \\n\r\n\u201cFor some reason, people are always afraid of me. I just try to be friendly\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nNuff said\u2026 \\n",

I hate a message in this anime that almost made me give it a lower score; Hail justice! Shall we dive in to the review?\r\nStory 3/10 :\r\nLet me get this straight : there is absolutely no story.\r\nWe follow the daily lives of the characters by seasons and that's it. A shy/introvert girl who tries to socialize after an interaction with a boy. And here comes what turned me off the most-the message. (WAIT FOR YOUR PRINCE CHARMING TO SAVE YOU, GIRLS. YOU WILL SEE HAPPINESS AFTERHIM. YOU WILL CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. TRY TO BE PRETTY FOR HIM)\\n\r\nSeriously? Flash news: there's no such a thing as prince charming, and no one will change you for the better but yourself. Change FOR YOURSELF and be pretty FOR YOURSELF cause others really don't care and you will feel disappointment if you keep on looking for validation.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10 :\\n\r\nWhat can I say? I have watched high-quality animation anime so this was so mediocre next to them, add to that the use of \"fast sketches/chibi version\" too much and even in serious times, which was cheap but acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nI loved the opening so much. The very few OSTs were soothing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\r\nSawako, baby girl,  \"naivety\" can only take so much for what you're doing. I study maths as a main subject and I detected an absence of logic. Yes, I know you grew up with no friends, I know. But how do you explain this : \\n\r\nKurumi : I hate you. Sawako : Kurumi was my bff and she loved me and I loved her wow fRIENDSHIP !\\n\r\nKazehaya, boy, don't you have any PROBLEMS? SERIOUSLY THE GUY WAS SMILING EVERYTIME and beside the fact that he's \"loved by everyone\" and he has a small brother, WE LITERALLY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM.\\n\r\nRyu and his childhood friends were explored more than the main characters and developed so much.\\n\r\nMediocre cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 :\\n\r\nI enjoyed some of the sweet/funny moments in this anime. But it wasn't enough to make me watch the 2nd season. I will close my chapter with this anime here, no more suffering for me YAY :(\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10 :\\n\r\nIf you have PLENTY of free time, go ahead and watch this at your own risk. Beware of the slow pace, it will feel like a chore sometimes.",

I got really hooked in with the first couple of episodes in, it was an easy and thought out concept that you know what to expect. Even though the was alot of progression through the whole season with the main characters, the screen time with side characters is really what shined to me and how they did it. Overall this anime is a beauty to watch, one of the best romance anime, I've seen so far for sure. Fora guy like me that's heavily in to shounen and action this anime was really enjoyable.",

Also, Sawako scaring the hell out of her classmates creates lots of funny situations, so that's a bonus. Oh, and her best friends and their relationships, that's good too. \r\nVery prone to cliffhangers, which will keep you on the edge ofyour seat wanting more.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr It was very enjoyable to watch.

            "content": "Oh, goodness, I can't believe I actually found a 100% realistic romance anime. \r\nI'm just gonna jump into why this anime is one that everyone should watch. For one thing, it isn't just a romance. I've been noticing this a lot lately, but many romance anime do this thing where EVERY plot point revolves around the main romance story. I hate it. Kimi ni Todoke actually managed to break that barrier. At its core, it's your standard \"popular boy meets shy girl\" plot, but once you delve deeper into it, it really becomes a story about friendship, and that's why it's so good. \r\nThe charactersthemselves are what makes this anime great, in my opinion. They're all written in ways that makes them seem authentic and likable. That, in turn, supplements the story (which is also amazing, just to be clear). It's hard to explain, but I just loved watching this dynamic of girls having girls' backs and classmates that welcomed one another despite their differences and a girl learning what it means to care for people. It all comes together really nicely through this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I didn't really fall in love with was the art style, and obviously, that's just personal preference. It did grow on me, but I'm not the biggest fan of the more 2-D, simplistic style. That being said, there's still some pretty shots in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI can confidently say that if you want a good romance, school, or slice of life anime, this is where you need to be. It goes above and beyond almost every other anime in the genre that I've seen. It's heartwarming, it made me cry almost every episode, and it made me happy. So, I'm really looking forward to what's next.",

            "content": "Chicken Noodle Soup for the Soul: Anime Edition\r\nJust like any medium, anime can elicit a wide range of emotions and thought-provoking ideas about any number of serious subjects. But the thing is, sometimes you just want to sit back and watch something that makes you feel good. \r\nKimi ni Todoke (season 1) is simply one of the most heartwarming anime I\u2019ve come across. Even during my second time through the series, each episode rarely failed to make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, and sometimes even moved me to tears. And yes, as you can see on my MAL profile, I\u2019m a guy. \r\nSohow did Kimi ni Todoke pull this off? Well, first and foremost, characters. They\u2019re a delight, and will be getting the lion\u2019s share of the attention. Let\u2019s start with the main character, Sawako, the awkward but sweet social outcast. It\u2019s nearly criminal just how likeable she is, to the point of someone being that nice is almost unrealistic. Plenty of \u201cloner\u201d main characters end up being portrayed as quite bitter and disillusioned, but that could not be farther from the truth for her. Despite so many reasons not to (I mean almost everyone calls her \u201cSadako\u201d after girl from The Ring), she not only treats everyone well, but almost always puts others first. Yes, her social skills are severely lacking, but given her history, it didn\u2019t seem too implausible, and more importantly, she did make strides in that area throughout the first season. How? Well, I\u2019m glad you asked.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Kazehaya, the main love interest and most popular boy in school. And I know those of you that have seen enough shoujo must be thinking \u201cI\u2019ve seen this story before\u201d, and you wouldn\u2019t be entirely wrong. But I\u2019ll say this, as a guy that watches plenty of shoujo, the male love interests tend to be sort of hit-or-miss for me; but I legitimately came to like Kazehaya. Unlike similar characters, people didn\u2019t like him because he looked like a model, was the star of the basketball/football/soccer team, or his parents were loaded; they were drawn to him simply because he was a genuinely good person. Despite all their differences, him and Sawako had that in common. Oh, and like her, he displayed his fair share of awkwardness in their budding relationship. Actually though, Sawako did not look at him in a romantic sense to begin with. He was just someone she admired and wanted to emulate. It happened gradually, but she did sort of begin to emulate him. She got more friends, started socializing, and even fell in love for the first time.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of those new friends, there were 3 more members of the main cast. Chizu, the tomboy with a bit of a fragile heart. Ayane, the decidedly more feminine-looking but also much less emotional of the two girls. Then there\u2019s Ryu, the strong and (very) silent type. I won\u2019t go as deep with these three, but needless to say, like the main 2, they are all very likeable and add something of value to the show. Sawako\u2019s new-found friendship with Chizu and Ayane was the basis for some of the more heartwarming moments in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow it\u2019s time to briefly touch on some of the other aspects of the show, starting with the story. Like I said, the \u201cunpopular girl meets popular boy\u201d thing has been done a lot in shoujo. But I feel like it was presented in a realistic manner that did not come off as another pandering \u201cself-insert MC X dream girl/guy love interest wish fulfillment\u201d romance anime. Also, watching Sawako grow as a person and her world sort of opening up was a real joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was solid, although don\u2019t expect to be blown away. The character models were pretty realistic for the genre, but each had their charm. IMO the chibi scenes worked great for the comedy aspects of the show. I can never get enough chibi Sawako. Warning, there\u2019s a lot of those sudden shoujo bubbly, flowery backgrounds. Hope that\u2019s not a deal-breaker for anyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was spectacular across the board. I loved every seiyuu\u2019s performance, but if I had to pick my favorite, it would probably be Yuuko Sanpei as Chizu. She really made that particular character come to life. As far the OPs/EDs, they\u2019re all good, but the OP1 is the stand-out for me. The sweet and gentle melody captured the feel of the show so well.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed season 1 of Kimi ni Todoke. Yes, the plot was somewhat generic and the romantic element moved slowly, but everything about the show was just so darn endearing. It\u2019s a 9.5/10 in my book, and if I wasn\u2019t so stingy giving out 10s (less than 3% as of writing this), I would probably round up to 10. Please watch this series if you can withstand a little bit of cheesiness. It\u2019s a real gem.",

            "content": "This is my first review, but I've watched a bunch of shoujo anime and yeah.  If you've read any other reviews on KimiTo, you probably think very positively already, and you should be!\r\n[8]Story:  The only reasons why I gave KimiTo an 8 and not a 10, is because of the simplicity of the story itself and some moments that lack originality.  But if you do plan to watch KimiTo, then be prepared for a VERY slow pacing.  In my view, the slow pacing in this anime was very well executed and it made KimiTo stand out over the other rom/coms.I thought each and every moment between the main characters was fairly important, and it made the storyline have greater purpose.  The best thing I love about the story though, is the fact that KimiTo focuses more on romance rather than comedy.  The comedy is just a good relief factor to ease the tension, and I've got to say the comedy in KimiTo is priceless.\\n\\n\r\n[9]Art:  The basic animation in KimiTo is well made and easy to look at.  The reason why I bumped the score up to a 9 is because of the picture moments.  I don't know how to clearly explain it unless you've seen it, but each time you see one of these scenes it amazes you.\\n\\n\r\n[10]Sound:  Voice actors and actresses are amazing.  Sawako's voice actress was meant to play her, and all the other voice actors and actresses do very well at their part as well.  I especially liked Kurumi's voice.  The opening and closing themes are AMAZING!  The opening theme was named Kimi Ni Todoke, so it fits perfectly with a soothing rythem.  The ending theme was a female role, and well, you've got to hear it.\\n\\n\r\n[9]Character:  Almost a perfect 10, but the reason why I gave a 9 is because the other main characters weren't fully developed, so I would have prefered to have more development toward the main guy and girl.  Also, Joe is annoying sometimes! XD But the main guy and girl characters are very well developed, except for the fact that we don't have the guy's thoughts explained well enough.  Nevertheless, still a solid 9.\\n\\n\r\n[10]Enjoyment:  Every single freaking episode, I wanted to keep going to the next.  Every moment I savored, and this has got to be one of the most enjoyable animes I've ever watched.\\n\\n\r\n[10]Overall:  Despite the 8 for Story, and 9's for Art and Character, this was one of the best animes I have ever watched in my life.  Gladly, there is a second season to finish off the series.  I do hope that there will even be a 3rd season though @_@.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I'd reccommend this anime to any of the shoujo fans out there.  (:",

She has never had friends so she doesn't understand the normal social rules.  She is herself and that's why the story is so beautiful.  A beautiful relationship forms from this two as well as Sawako and two other girls which help her.  I truly enjoyed this story because of that wholesome feel.  You typically don't get that out of an anime, and this anime really broke free ofthat label.  The only thing I didn't like were some of the episodes were a little slow and left you with terrible cliff hangers.  When you don't have the full season out to watch it's nerve wracking to wait until the next week to see what finally happens or if their romance will finally blossom.  It's definitely a love story that you won't forget.",

Nothing was too rushed or too slow, everything happened at a really nice pace. This anime is nice for those who enjoy reading/watching high school romances. Kimi Ni Todoke had me screaming at my computer screen and drowning in a pool of feels. It really captures how two people fall in love and the troubles that come a long with it.\r\nOnce I started watching, I couldn't stop. The characters and the simple story line had me hooked and reeled in. Iimmediately fell in love with the characters (with the exception of a few...) and how this anime really highlights friendship as an important part of life.",

Kimi ni Todoke managed to pull ahead as my favorite Rom/Com through its awesome characters, and the wonderful development that went with them. \r\nA heart warming story of friendship and love blossoming hit home with me. Seeing the growth of an individual who finds unexpected friendships in even more unexpected kinds of people shows you just how amazing we can be as human beings. We can put aside our differences and be a part of others lives in ways you wouldnever expect. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing a shy, and gloomy looking girl become friends with a tom boy, a makeup wearing pretty girl with an attitude, and a the most popular guy in school certainly puts ones mind to wondering how that could even happen. However, this show manages to show that progression in such a natural, and heart warming way, that i never found myself questioning that. \\n\\n\r\nItazura na Kiss must now step aside and let Kimi ni Todoke take it's place as my favorite Rom/Com",

            "content": "Story: 10\\10\r\nI love how the plot and story is simple. It follows the life of a school girl, Sawako, who is shy and misunderstood. Despite her scary looks, she has a really pure heart and she's very innocent and pure. The pace is very slow, but in no way is it dull. The girl is going through changes, so naturally, to change, it takes you time. changing can't just happen with the blink of an eye, and this is why I loved this anime so much. The pace was perfect to make me understand every part of the story.\r\nAnd can I add how much Iloved the fact that it wasn't cliche in any way? Abuse and violence wasn't romanticized and the main character didn't get harassed by the guy of her dream and then called him \"BAKA\\HENTAI\"!!!. I can say that this was a first for me in anime. And the time where there were bullies, they were teasing a certain character, and the bullies were considered pathetic and they were the ones who were losers.\\n\r\nArt: 7\\10\\n\r\nI thought the art was good. It wasn't the best, but it certainly was good and well drawn. Something that annoyed me a little is that I wasn't able to know if some characters were goodlooking or not since they were all drawn in an appealing way. Other than that, the art was cute and the eyes weren't exaggerated, which is something that I found beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening theme and ending theme so much! They really set the mood and the lyrics were quiet good. The opening theme will always touch my heart. As for the voice actors, they were very good in conveying the emotions of the characters, and I didn't find any of them to be annoying haha. There was no \"overly cute anime voice\" that made you think one of the characters was 4 years old. I really liked the voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\10\\n\r\nOh man, I don't know where to start! Each character has its own personality and all the characters have their flaws and imperfections.\\n\r\nKazehaya, the main guy, isn't this typical anime guy. He is not a hot perverted who falls head over heels for the girl and teases her a lot and plays with her emotions. Nor does he sexually harass her. He is in fact as shy as she is! He blushes and he has many flaws that we later find out as we get deeper in the story.\\n\r\nThe beautiful thing about those characters is that they are realistic and there was no exaggeration in their personalities. They all have their flaws and imperfections. Even the bad guys aren't 100% bad. Also, we were able to see a reason for the actions of all the character; (they did this when that happened which means they have this trait, and their personality is like that).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\10\\n\r\nAs I said, in no way was the story dull, and there was always something happening, from a quirky, funny thing that somebody did, to a line or an action that a character said or did which will break your heart and makes your stomach hurt.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\10\\n\r\nThis is a masterpiece. I have never ever seen anything like that. It was in all means beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI say there should be season 3, since the story is not over yet. If you ever end with the anime, I say you continue with the manga because more things happen that make you understand the characters even more and love them even harder.\\n\r\nThe manga is as beautiful as the anime, and the anime was pretty faithful to the manga except for the last episode of season 2, which was a bit different. If you don't want to miss anything, just read the chapter of the final episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this is one of the best things I have ever seen and I will always love this anime\\manga.",

            "content": "A short review about Kimi ni Todoke. No spoilers are present (as it should be).\r\nI haven't watched many episodes, but I was eager to write a review this anime.\r\nStory:\r\nWell, it can embarrassingly emotional and juvenile, but also sweet. So if that's up your alley, then this is perfect. There is not much action, but rather talking instead.\r\nRegarding genre, it would be most likely be categorized as Comedy, Romance, and Slice of Life.\r\nSo this anime is suitable if you feel like watching something a bit slower paced. 8/10.\r\nArt:\r\nWell, the art is normal. Sometimes the characters make weird faces, usually cute/adorable or weird/creepy (but not a \"scary\"creepy) ones. There may be a lot of background sparkles. Just so you know. So many sparkles... and flowers. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe BGM music has a lot of slow piano playing, with lots of sentiment and flourishes. But this is very soothing and pleasant. There can also be light strumming on a string instrument, guitar, or percussion (e.g. chime, xylophone), or lightly synthesized music. The opening and ending theme songs are both pleasant. Great! 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe main heroine can be a bit frustrating to watch, but if you will bear with her, she can be quite endearing and a satisfying leading character. The other characters are quite funny, but display a broad variety of emotions. But I like how these characters are not one dimensional. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm enjoying this. If you like romantic comedies... well, this *is* a romantic comedy. So expect the things that romantic comedies have. I don't think I have giggled and blushed simultaneously so much in such a short time... 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'm rating this 9/10 overall because I enjoy the story and the characters. The music works great with the art and the feeling of the show, and all these are making it quite enjoyable. Watch this if you enjoy a bit of drama, teenagers in love, and all that!\\n\\n\r\nQuick Summary:\\n\r\n- It's a romantic comedy, so expect as such. Ah, young love and love triangles... \\n\r\n- It's actually quite funny. (I like the Japanese version with subtitles most. Good job voice actors!)\\n\r\n- If you don't like the first few episodes, well... this anime might not be for you. But if you like a good laugh from all the situational comedy, then stick around!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoy! ^_^",

It was filled with feel-good moments, the occasional clich\u00e9 and lots of blushing. It did get repetive after a while, but I finished it, and I'm glad I did. Unfortunately, the main flaw lies in Sawako. \r\nI liked the characters. Kazehaya was kind from the start, which was a nice break from the usual tsundere love interests.\r\n I especially liked Ryuu, though I do have a tendency to favor quieter characters. Sadly, i just didn't see what I wanted to see fromSawako. Though she did grow, there were flaws. But in the end, she wasn't a bad character, I just wish we would've seen a little more out of her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was truly lovely. I can't really describe it in a way that would do it justice, but believe me, even if you hate everything else about this series, you'll love the art.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I enjoyed this anime. It had a sort of calm feeling about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance was cute and innocent, and though it was slow, I didn't mind. So, even if this isn't your cup of tea, watch an episode or two. You never know. Maybe it'll be your new favorite.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kimi ni todoke was a refreshing change of setting for me, especially after watching the Kara no Kyoukai series. I had actually watched the first few episodes of this anime a few months ago, but had dropped it because I was getting tired of it. I had thought that it was boring and kind of repetitive.\r\nI was wrong. I'm glad that I gave it another chance.\r\nThis anime started out unassuming and looked like any other shoujo anime that I'd seen before, but there were several characteristics that stood out from the rest. Our main character, Sawako, is an extremely shy girl that is trying herbest to change her life for the better. She is a lonely girl, with only one childhood \"friend\" from her middle school. Sawako is then put into a classroom with completely new faces all around. But there is one face that she recognizes and admires, Kazehaya.\\n\r\nUnlike other animes, the relationship isn't actually determined from the very start, but grows as the two main characters get to know each other better. We see why Kazehaya is so popular and why Sawako falls in love with him. For this reason, I like how this anime respects its viewers and not throw them into a relationship that feels forced. \\n\r\nNo, no. As Sawako continues on her quest to make new friends and do what all other ordinary girls do, Sawako grows into a beautiful character that most viewers can't help but fall in love with. To make an analogy, she is like a blank sheet of paper at the start at the series. By the end of it, all of her friends and experiences draw rainbows, stars, hearts, and love onto the canvas. The environment that she is shown to grow up in really brings her personality to life. The one thing I couldn't help but think about was that what kind of loneliness and suffering she went through before the start of the series. It kind of makes me sad, seeing as she was so isolated from others that she never had a chance to grow until the start of the series. \\n\r\nI've just been going on and on about Sawako so lets move on to Kazehaya. Kazehaya is a good person. I really like that about him. He is nice, looks out for others, and gets along with people easily. But underneath that outgoing face he puts up, he's just as shy as Sawako. They both are so similar to each other and yet so different. \\n\r\nChizu and Yano I actually thought that they were going to rip Sawako apart at the beginning, but I'm glad that they turned out to be caring friends. I'm actually surprised at the amount of depth they went into Chizu. But I would have wanted to know more about Yano as a person. \\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are the story; their interactions, stories, and reactions to situations is what makes it so cute. You can't help but cheer on Sawako and all the other characters when they run into trouble. It's a realistic anime and lovable at the same time. \\n\r\nArt: The art was okayish. I didn't really enjoy it as much, but its to be expected when watching one of the older animes. Sometimes Kazehaya's smile is so wide I think that it might snap in half. It bothered me a few times, but I got used to it as the series progressed. \\n\r\nSound: I actually enjoyed the sound quite a bit. The opening was one of my favorite songs. The soundtrack during the anime was quite fitting and nice, with its sweet and mellow tones flowing as the characters went on with their days. I didn't really like the ed though. The tone of the singer didn't agree with my ears.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this anime very much. It had some slow pacing that would probably make some of my friends freak out, but I actually enjoyed it. It's characters are ones that are not only realistic, but also are easy to fall in love with because they're human. They have flaws like all the rest of us but their strengths more than makes up for that. I liked this anime.\\n\r\nOverall: This anime is not one to skip out on if you are into romance and slice of life animes. Watch it or read it. It doesn't feel forced and you'll keep on wanting to press the next episode button.",

            "content": "\"I don't know how I handled loneliness. I can't remember how I dealt. All of that has escaped me. Without a trace.\"\r\n[Plot]\r\nCommunication relies on a message from one human to another being interpreted correctly. Sawako Kuronama\u2014a beautiful, selfless, misunderstood girl\u2014enters high school with the same middle school social status she was given: a ghost. Not an invisible ghost, but a scary living, walking one. Her abnormal facial expressions and difficulty socializing landed her a spot as an outcast. She's exceptionally friendly and attempts to say hello to everyone she meets, but her initial\u2014slightly funny\u2014facial expressions cause them to flee away. That is, until the catalystknown as Shouta Kazehaya enters Sawako's life. He single handedly gives her the \"ability\" to destroy her comfort zone and widen her world. Don't be mistaken though, he is not the all-powerful male protagonist who manages to alone save her. Sawako's best friends Ayane Yano and Chizuru Yoshida are precious gems who stay by her side regardless of situation, helping her grow.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\r\nLove. Platonic, Romantic, Unrequited. Love. This is a romance anime, love is expected. What I did not expect was how well platonic love was portrayed. The protagonists and their supporting friends are genuinely good people. It is not easy to create such realistic relatable characters. \\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Sawako is truly selfless. Not in an annoying, pathetic way; she is not a burden. She always attempts to create a clear line of communication, probably because she knows how it misunderstandings can be so cruel. Aesthetically, she is relatively pretty with long, black hair and bangs that suite her face. She is still new to social interaction, so sometimes she takes messages too literally, but in the end if it's important, she will find out through her own will. Sawako doesn't attract attention by means of pity or sympathy, she draws in people one they take the opportunity to know her. As she begins to become closer to her newfound friends, her character rapidly develops. \\n\\n\r\nShouta Kazehaya, every girl's love interest, falls for Sawako. However, the romance is not immediate\u2014in fact it's awfully slow paced to be frank\u2014but it's not boring either. The success of a romance anime heavily relies on the male protagonist too, and Kazehaya exceeds expectations. As a handsome, outgoing boy with a killer smile; he has girls fawning over him. His cute, polite personality and kind heart earn him a popular position in school. As an active member of the community, he his generally liked by everyone and receives little-to-no hate. He's almost equally as flustered as Sawako during their encounters, a \"refreshing\" factor. Unlike many other stereotypical male protagonist, he blushes, and get's embarrassed too. Shockingly, as much as Sawako looks up to Kazehaya, he is equally as memorized by her as she is by him. \\n\r\nNot only does the male protagonist surpass my expectations, Sawako's new found friends Ayane and Chizuru are remarkably impressive. \\n\\n\r\nAyane, a beautiful adult-like classmate of Sawako's, is exceptionally mature and intelligent. She wears plenty of makeup, has full lips and a great figure, and could easily be dismissed as a \"popular\" pretty girl, but instead she opts for the \"badass\" look. Her perceptive abilities are impressive and she's an awfully considerate person. Being slightly more mature, Ayune dates plenty of older people and has the most \"experience\" out of the group. She has no issues socializing and more often than many others thinks before she speaks. \\n\\n\r\nChizuru\u2014a tall, strong, and athletic girl\u2014is probably the most friendly and second most emotional of the bunch. She's very expressive, not in a rude way but in a funny way. The best way to describe her thought process most of the time would be \"simple\". She isn't stupid or any of the sorts, but she's nowhere near as observant as Ayane. \\n\\n\r\nBoth Chizuru and Ayane were best friends in middle school, and Sawako managed to fit into the group perfectly. They value Sawako's friendship and help her expand her horizons. Initially, they were a little freaked out by Sawako, but once they were able to get to interact with her, they immediately accepted her. Realizing that Sawako was actually friendly and tremendously kind-hearted, the two considered her a good friend. They are extremely reliable friends and worthy of Sawako's admiration.The pair\u2014especially Ayane\u2014often assists Sawako with her relationship with Kazehaya. In fact, if it weren't for Ayane I doubt Sawako would have the courage to even reach out to Kazehaya. \\n\\n\r\nRyu Sanada is the fifth link to the group of five. He's a quiet, observant, baseball playing boy. If he's not likeable then he's certainly not dislikeable. He provides great advice and blunt answers. . Ryu also is willing to listen to any of friend's problems.  He's considered a part of the group and is invited to all activities involving the friends. Not to mention the fact that his room is most-often the area most used to host the parties/get-togethers. \\n\\n\r\nHer parents are really supportive and kind.\\n\\n\r\n[Features]\\n\r\nThere are plenty comical moments that caused me to burst out laughing. Sawako's facial expressions, and sometimes simple misunderstandings are hilarious. The art is pretty, and switches at times to a more cartoonish style, especially when facial expressions are made. Characters are well designed, the main ones are all aesthetically pleasing. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are pleasant, good lyrics and an enjoyable voice. Character voices are great and fitting. \\n\\n\r\nTo me, the best most notable aspect of this anime would be not the romance, but the bonds between the characters. Sawakos' development is outstanding. Her two friends Ayane and Chizuru don't feel uncomfortable at all around the \"awkward\" Sawako, and Sawako isn't an introvert, she's just new to socializing. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance itself is quite slow, but certainly does develop over time. Kazehaya seems to be slightly more confident than Sawako, but not confident enough to bluntly confront her. Sawako misses a couple of hidden messages, being the slightly oblivious girl she is. The two are a great couple, if the pacing of the romance were a little quicker the anime would have soared. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have any interest in the Romance or Shoujo genre, then I highly suggest watching this anime. Though don't come in for the Romance, think of it as a nice sprinkle on a Slice of Life anime. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n",

This is what this anime had me feel like.(NOTE:My opinion may be quite biased because I'm just a sucker for shoujo anime.) I felt like i was a part of the story, and that i have yet to experience until now.\r\nStory-10- You may think this is just your average anime, nothing special about it,thats what i thought at first, but then it is so much more.The story is about a girl name Sawako. She looks creepy (Something like the girl from \"the ring\".) People call her sadako because they thinkthat name fits her. She is nice and kind but she is kind of an outcast, who doesn't really want to be one. One summer day she meets Kazehaya, a kind guy who is lost trying to find the school.(Turns out he is Mr.Lively, almost the complete opposite of Sawako.) He then helps her get friends and fit in more during the year;what goes on next are love triangles, misunderstandings, and alot more.(NOTE:You may think ending is incomplete but there is a second season to answer all of the questions left unanswered.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-10- At first you may think \"The art is not all that good\", but as the series progresses you will understand why the art is the way it is. It complements the story and characters. IMO i don't think the voices and story could be the same without the art as the way it is. 9.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10- The voices are superb. They fit the characters perfectly. (There aren't any voices that don't fit the characters.) The opening and ending songs are good too. Soft melodies with a catchy beats. Also in some part during the show soft music complements certain thing, and was good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10- I don't want to spoil the plot and the good characters, but i have to say the characters complement each other nicely and if one was removed the story would not have been what it was.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10- This anime kept me on my toes,and i liked that. I was engulfed in it and did not want to stop watching it (ended up watching it straight through). If you are a shoujo anime fan than this is definitely a must watch. Also if not this anime could make you a fan.",

I love its opening songs, and it's unique in the sense that the main character is a lonely, friendless girl who is too considerate and kind, but very very shy.This anime not only centres around romance, but friendship love as well, and how important it is. It follows the steps to achieving amazing friends with amazing character developments, and how a loner, shy girl finds friends and eventually the guy she likes. \\n\r\nI really loved this anime, and it's on my top list for romance anime along with Lovely Complex, and I really recommend you to watch it! You will be crying by the end of the series, and find yourself rooting for the characters every step of the way! It's not so deeply engrossed in romance of girlfriend and boyfriend that it becomes sort of annoying, but it deals with friendship problems, bullies, and even your friend's boyfriend/girlfriend messes. \\n\r\nWatch it!",

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke starts off with REALLY high potential, then ends up dying midway and just feels like some sort of comedy, slice of life, drama, chibi character series.\r\nThe romance in this series is SO dried out, and starts off fresh but just keeps going on with no progression at all.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nStarts off very nice with the fun aspect of the main character Sawako being a creepy girl who no one likes. This is funny the first 2 episodes, but then just progresses on and you just sit there thinking WHY? \r\nArt: 5/10\r\nI enjoyed this art, even though the character designs were simple they werepretty, i would give 9/10 for character art. However, the amount of times the art is drawn as chibi weirdo characters and bubble backgrounds is just plain annoying and ugly. Even in serious moments ALL the characters are chibi (weird) and you are going to sit there thinking the anime didn't have a big enough budget.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7/10\\n\r\nGood, nothing extraordinary\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nThis is the main problem in the series. The main character has mental problems I'm sure of it. She keeps crying over NOTHING, she has NO back bone, and she doesn't even speak to people. Yeah i get she's supposed to be nice but she's a pushover, and barely talks to her friends... She's also extremely shy to the point of being scared to tell her parents she wants to go to a party etc.\\n\r\nHer two main friends, Ayane, the cliche pretty girl with loads of boyfriends and Chizuru, the dumb airhead tomboy, are plain boring, nice though nothing special.\\n\r\nThe main guy Kazehaya is nice, but popular for no specific reason other than he is nice?? yeah alright, all girls at the school apparently like him and spread rumours like children to get him, when he's nothing special but a nice person... Also his love for Sawako comes out of nowhere...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nIf you look past the flaws it's quite funny and relaxing. It's a good anime to watch if you're bored and have nothing else to do, and want a little pure romance (even though the lack of romance is quite comical)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nThe romance is quite bad and is just two people liking each other for the hell of it. This show is more like a slice of life/drama than a romance (don't expect any kisses, holding hands nothing). But it is SOOOO unrealistic. When watching this you're just gonna cringe because it's just plain weird.\\n\r\nIt's an alright anime, just not something i would ever give more than a 6.\\n\r\nTBH I'm very surprised about all the 10/10 reviews and ratings.. Was nowhere near that.",

THIS.. was just too painful.\r\nSTORY: 6\r\nIt's the classic cookie cutter romance anime. It doesn't mean that it's bad, it's just nothing special. Although the Chizu story line did peak my interest, the rest of the story just couldn't make up for it. The struggle toform even the slightest of a bond was mostly what put me off, considering the length of the series.\\n\r\nAwkwardness between characters can really add to a RomCom anime, it's just when nearly every scene is worthy of a filthy frank award, it's too much.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nThe art is very aesthetically pleasing and very well done. There is no drop in quality throughout the entire series.\\n\r\nEveryone is adorable and I feel the need to protect them OK.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nThere is nothing special about the sound, although the opening for season 1 did boost the rating as I am biased for a good OP. (to me at least)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8\\n\r\nSome characters are much more well-made than others. Sawako being such a creative character that i'm not completely sure how they made such a bland, uninteresting and generic male counterpart. The supporting cast is also well designed, even the characters that barely speak are interesting in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\r\nAlthough I did mostly talk about the negativity in the anime, I can't lie that I did enjoy it. Even as much as this anime made me want to drop it, it still got me to watch it all the way through to the end- and that's saying something I guess. But for real, it's still worth a watch (like every anime ever lol) it may seem generic and silly but at the end of the day it'll warm your heart.\\n\r\nAnd that's pretty much what you want out of a RomCom, to feel fuzzy and happy I guess.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7\\n\r\nKimi Ni Todoke is a cute story, although cluttered with poor choices and characters (mind you, not THAT many) it still left me satisfied.\\n\r\nI would recommend it to any RomCom enthusiast but other than that, watch some My Little Monster or something beforehand.\\n\\n\\n",

The constant slow pans of lovers looking at each other, the blushes as they quickly look away, the gasps as they say each other names, etc; I just find it all too hilarious and tedious to get into the show.\r\nNow you would think based on my score Kimi ni Todoke must've done away with these tropes. You would be wrong. Kimi ni Todoke has enough blushes, slow pans, and gasps to last me a decade. Not to mention enough inner monologuing to make me feel I was reading a novel. Oh, did I forget to mention the classic misunderstanding trope,where characters refuse to communicate with each other for more than 5 seconds and therefore it takes a couple of episodes for conflicts to be resolved? Cause it has that too.\\n\\n\r\nSo why the hell do I like this show? It's simple really. It's because of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show may classify as a romance, I see this more as a story of friendship. Sawako may be the sweetest MC I have ever watched. I can't help but like her. Her pure-hearted way of tackling things made me want to root for her, and that pure-heartedness is mirrored in her friend Chizuru, a brash loudmouth that couldn't act more differently than Sawako yet be more similar at the same time. Then there's Ayane, who's more experienced and perceptive, with such a mischievous personality that she can't help herself from teasing her friends. The two males of the friend group are just as likable. Kazehaya, Sawako's love interest, is a popular guy with a kind heart but naive and shy enough that he isn't as confident as he appears to be. Ryu, Kazehaya's best friend, is aloof and disinterested but still willing to help out his friends in his own way. The interactions and relationship between these 5 friends are what made me enjoy the show so much. They're genuine people, and it's nice to watch them.\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke is a romance, and a slow-paced one at that. Sawako and Kazehaya sure like taking their time getting with each other. But despite that, I rarely felt bored. The cast of characters is just so damn heartwarming that I had a stupid smile on my face nearly every episode. If you wanna watch something that lets you relax and feel good inside, this is it.",

            "content": "A fairly short review on Kimi Ni Todoke. \r\nDon't get me wrong, I liked the show, but I just can't rate it more than a 7. For me the show didn't click completely and I'll tell you why. \r\nThe story is fantastic, I have to give the creators credit for this. They put us in a realistic situation with circumstances we could relate to. The show felt like it really was happening and I have to say this is one extremely good storyline. \r\nThe art is a slight downside for me, at some points the art was a bit pale for me lacked color anddepth. Blending for me was off but maybe that's because it's kind of old. So I had to rate the art a 7 as it lacks a bit of cleanliness. \\n\\n\r\nThe dubbing quality was decent but I have to say that the acting was quite well done. But sound effects and music for me were off and didn't click the circumstances together for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were an absolute joy to watch, they were realistic and incredibly relatable. There were a few moments where I was cringing slightly, but that's just because of the MC's voice. Otherwise the characters have thorough back stories and the roads they take are quite intriguing to witness. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show quite immensely but then why am I rating it a 7? It lacked in the visual aspects and there was a certain lack of depth to the story. And I'll tell you why. Read the manga.",

I can only give sound an 8 since it became repetitive after 8 or 9 episodes, and most of the tracks inside the movie is a cover of either OP or ED. I would give this anime a 10 without a doubt, but it is so slow that it gets bored. It isnt exagurate to say that half of the anime is either Sawako or Kazehaya getting flustered at each other, which stands for why my enjoyment is only 7. Even for a Romance genreaddict such as myself, this anime is still way too slow for my taste.",

Just want to know if you should watch it? I got you covered\r\nSO many people who watch romance anime use this one as their measuring stick. I can understand why. But it just wasn't that magnificent for me.\r\nThe main issue with this one is the pacing and then the blatantly obvious turn the show takes to draw out the story to unnecessary lengths.\r\nIf the show had been condensed into a 13 episode season, or even23-26 episodes, it would have benefited. The female MC was very interesting at first. The extreme level of her awkwardness and level of outcast was fun to watch. But after two seasons of moving at a snail's pace with the MC's relationship, it gets EXCRUCIATING. After watching several other romance anime's where, at least EVENTUALLY, the MC's actually show some real love towards each other AND are able to express it without some issue causing misunderstandings, this one is hard to give a great review.\\n\\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS: Music got stuck in my head, is fun for the first ~13 episodes\\n\\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENTS: Not much progress, loses its way after first season, SLOWER THAN A SNAIL MOVING THROUGH MOLASSES with regards to the MC's relationship, MISUNDERSTANDINGSSSSSSSssss",

But the second time around I found it very slow and without much character development. The issue is the pace for me. With the manga, so much is happening with the other characters the pace didn't bother me as much. But the anime obviously didn't have as much time so it was cut short for the sake of making \"convenient\" season 1 & 2 finales. The final version is being published in English in December, so if you likedthe first season for the story, but not the pace, I'd read the manga.",

            "content": "Edited: Got the right quote and a better look at the visuals and plot.\r\n\"I'm sorry, Sadako! Don't say you'll be all right by yourself. Don't you get it? We love being around you! Don't you see?... We've been friends all along, Sadako.\"\r\nI think that, in order to appreciate this show, you have to see it from the eyes of the heroine, Sawako \"Sadako\" Kuronuma (evidently you need to watch The Ring in order to appreciate the nickname, but there are long-haired yokai in Japanese folklore, so that works for me). Socially awkward, a bit airheaded, not really understanding why people freak out around her, andwith a heart of pure gold. Let her draw you in, and laugh at the teens not understanding who she is, and at her innocent attempts to learn how to communicate.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a romantic comedy, but because the early chapters of the manga emphasized comedy over romance, the actual story proceeds at a bit of a slow pace. I think this was a good choice, since it allows us to get to know not just Sawako, but also Shouta, Chizuru, Ryu, and Ayame. Series 1 is faithful to the original, and the dramatic (melodramatic, even) moments are emotionally powerful because of the strength of the manga. Two such scenes stand out: one where Sawako resigns herself to being alone, until Shouta asks \"Hey, can someone trade me a seat next to her?\" The other is when Sawako is bullied by other girls, and Chizuru and Ayame walk right in to save the day. When this show gets dramatic, it cranks it up to 11, so have some tissues handy.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of a girl, of whom everyone had such a terrible first impression, that she's written off as \"creepy\" and avoided like she's radioactive or something, is more than a little ridiculous, but it is a comedy. At the same time, when the supporting characters realize just what a genuinely good girl she is, they start to change. Shouta starts inviting her along and offers to sit with her, and Chizuru and Ayame not only take a liking to her, but smile at her innocence and truly become angry when she's mistreated, effectively becoming her best friends.\\n\\n\r\nI guess if there's a weakness in the show, it's the character of Shouta (but only a little). I generally don't find \"flawless\" characters believable, even if he says \"I'm not as good as you think\". But I guess his big weakness is Sawako herself, so I can live with that. The casting, from Mamiko Noto's Sawako to Aya Hirano's Kurumi is spot on.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the show is pretty good, often using cute SD characters during funny or relaxed moments. The fingers distracted me a bit-- to me they were so long and skinny, they almost looked like chopsticks. (I'm actually struggling to remember the visuals and story, as this is a show I need to re-watch. I DO remember, however, that Sawako's smile is a heart-melting moment in the show. Shouta, you lucky bastard.) OK, now that I'm re-watching it... it looks like the post-production added in a noisy coloration through Photoshop or a similar editor. I might be mistaken, but the original may have used \"noisy\" tones to make the backgrounds and scenery look more real, and this is the animators' way of replicating that effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme song is a good love song, featuring Sawako in various cute situations. But Kimi ni Todoke is a song that I probably won't import-- the reason is, the \"short\" version is probably an early arrangement with just standard band instruments plus piano. The finished arrangement adds a number of instruments (at least a flute and synth set to sawtooth) that in my opinion diluted the great vocals. The end credits theme is cloyingly sweet, which means that I probably skipped over it often. Most of the soundtrack is fairly simply composed and arranged, staying out of the way for the most part and lifting up the more dramatic scenes.",

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke screams average. The anime lacked character development and the plot moves much too slow. The characters were flat and didn't have much substance to them. I could say I enjoyed the art as it had a soft texture to it, but it didn't really stand out compared to other animes. The soundtrack was suitable but not memorable whatsoever. To be honest, I couldn't even make it through the first season because of how boring it was. Each move was predictable and not very suspenseful. I'm not saying the anime was *bad*, it was just so typical and the plot was a bitoverrused: unpopular, quiet yet innocent and kind girl with a popular and athletic, yet super friendly boy. They also have a small crew of friends who have their own problems with crushes and so forth. If you're into this type of innocent anime, then I recommend Kimi ni Todoke, but if not, there are much better animes out there.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, characters. They were just so stereotypical and predictable. Also a little annoying. For example, Sawako, the protagonist. Her voice was super annoying in my opinion. High-pitched, breathy, and constantly stuttering over her words. Her innocent and naive personality became much too forced and unfortunately did not allow her character to develop much. She did make a lot of friends, which I guess some would consider development, but she didn't mature based on how many episodes I watched, if that makes sense. She also didn't bare any flaws, besides owning a bit of social anxiety. For example, she cooks for her friends, she is loyal, she is kind, even to people that dislike her, and so on. The reason she did not really develop as a character, I believe, is because the anime created a lovable and cute girl bubble around her.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Kazehaya. Like Sawako, he is almost flawless and super likeable. Of course, they fall for each other, because who could've seen that coming, am I right? His personality is so two-dimensional. Sure, he's friendly and sociable but that's about it. Nothing very special. Oh, and he's good-looking, like of course he is. \\n\\n\r\nI was okay with the other main (side?) characters. The anime unfortunately forced too many confusing and badly executed issues onto them in an effort to make the anime not completely Sawako and Kazehaya centered.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, average anime with poor development. There are definitely better animes out there so I suggest not to waste your time watching Kimi ni Todoke. Literally.",

            "content": "If you were to read the summary of Kimi ni Todoke, you'd never watch this hidden gem of romantic anime. The story is in many ways derivative and typical of shoujo romantic stories, with an innocent, straightforward, lonely girl falling in love with the popular guy in class.\r\nYet the story hides a special charm that grows on you the more you watch and this draws you into the world as you watch the characters grow and struggle.\r\nThe real highlights are the artwork and music which really convey the emotions and carry the viewer along. Those 2 elements is what helps lift this story and allowsus to really feel for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI had no problem with the pacing of the story which I found entirely appropriate. It allowed us enough time to get to know the characters. All the cast performed brilliantly with the seiyuu voicing sawako particularly outstanding as she had a lot of work voicing her thoughts. In many ways this story is perfect for anime because many of the comedic elements and emotion cannot be conveyed in any other medium.\\n\\n\r\nObviously the main weakness is that at the end of season 1, there is no resolution whatsoever and hence I was very lucky to come along knowing that there is a season 2 to complete the story. However, I am also aware that the manga is still ongoing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an extremely easy to watch romantic comedy style anime with  charming characters, beautiful art and a heartfelt soundtrack. Highly recommended for those who enjoy such anime. Please read my review of season 2 for my overall view. Thanks!",

Which makesit even worse when you see characters you enjoy experiencing the same problems and never speaking their mind.",

There was very little that bugged me. \r\nThe art is very nice and pleasing. Especially for something from 8 years ago. The scenes with the goofy animation are pretty great and the character designs are good. \r\nThe character designs are all good. I just felt that Sawako's character design could be better. I thought that if she had her hair in a Ponytail or a bun she would look better. Later on when she does have her hair up she does look very good. She isstill pretty anyway's. I just think it would have been better if her hair was up for most of the show. In the end with her makeover she looks so nice and looks better.\\n\\n\r\nSome things that i kind of found weir were : \\n\r\n1. In the earlier episodes i found it weird how the entire class starts surrounding and praising  the MC kind of out of the blue.\\n\r\n2. The show kind of drops her being thought of as a spooky person. \\n\\n\r\n~~Spoilers~~ \\n\r\nI kind of wish we got more of the romance.\\n\\n\r\nSuch as Ryuu and Chizuru becoming a couple. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple people that fit really well together. Such as \\n\r\nRyuuxChizuru \\n\r\nSawakoxKazehaya\\n\r\nKind of seems there is a thing with Ayane and  Pin going on. \\n\\n\r\nThere are characters kind of forgotten such as kurumi. She had a couple episodes. Even though most seemed annoyed with her i actually liked her. I kind of like how after she fully realizes she wont get with the guy she stops acting all cute. \\n\\n\r\nOver all a good show.",

However, this show takes forever to conclude any side-story. I would say that it takes up to about 5 episodes to conclude one story; it should have been at least 3 episodes because it took quite awhile and a waste of time.\r\nIt was a waste of time to watch some parts of each episode because it chooses to be repitative. You heard this statement before, you've seen this flashback 4 times already,you don't need to do long pauses every second, so can we just move on from it and call it a memory to remember while watching this? No. They have to keep reminding you over and over how every character feels, and it doesn't seem necessary.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't interested in the characters, rather, I was more interested in the side stories and the main story. All the characters seemed bland and noncompetitive, they were just generic characters.  Even though the stories took awhile to conclude, it's partially what helped it to be watchable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat also kept me going was the art style. I loved the art. Sometimes it felt great to watch while seeing the characters interact, but you'll catch that some scenes look like they were showing off their art. I am not interested in a art contest; I want to watch a show with great quality. \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 6/10, by the way, it was a boring romantic story.\\n",

            "content": "I know I'm a bit late in seeing this anime, since it's been out for 6 years now. But I think that it is truly timeless. It's story line was breathtakingly beautiful and for me, is a worthy comparison to Clannad, the all time feels jerker of romance slice of life anime, though of course they feature different plots. I loved every part of it, and I was only able to because Sawako the female protagonist is the most sincere and humble character I have ever witnessed. She may not be as capable as others, but she tries. She tries so hard that you canfeel sympathy for her every time, but nonetheless, even if you don't, I think you will end up rooting for her till the very end. It might be a romance anime, but it explores many different types of love one can feel: familial, friendship, self love and romantic love.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 One day, I found myself seeking a romance anime that would touch my heart and make me feel some type of way. And after finishing this anime, I have no regrets! I'm so glad this was the anime I settled on because from the first episode, it had my tears rolling. I usually don't cry for anime, but this one hit something in me. The entire plot plays out in such a delicate manner, where all the feels come genuinely from each character's personality type and their innocent interactions with others. This anime is kind of dragged out to 25 episodes, and I was hesitant at first if it would even be necessary to watch all 25. But after I finished this, I went straight into the second season because I just could not stop. It was addictive for me, and I would definitely watch it again. It's rated PG-13, but concepts are very simplistic and other than one or two episodes where they use a bit of offensive language, I think this anime is fairly innocent. However, perhaps the concepts of love and reasoning may be difficult for those under 13 to understand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 I think that a huge reason why this anime was able to speak to me was because of how well each character was able to convey their emotions, their thoughts and feelings. Now I do not mean that they are 100% on every aspect, but I think it was definitely above average. The core reason why I would rate this 10/10 for the characters is because of their ability to grow. There are anime with female leads who fail to do the simplest of tasks, but then there's Sawako, a girl who truly finds it hard to understand things most of us would see as normal, but because of her humility, and her honesty, the viewer is almost able to sympathize with the reasoning behind her actions. Every time she accomplishes even the smallest of acknowledgement, one just can't help but be happy for her. She is a main character that may not always be capable but she is definitely one I could never hate because she displays qualities of the purest of heart. The male lead, Shouta, is someone who one can identify as the most popular boy in school, one sought after by a bunch of girls, one who is athletic as well as smart. Sure he sounds typical at first, but he is so much more than that. He is not full of himself, there are things he cannot do, feelings he doesn't know how to express. He is kind but he is not kind just to be kind, and he is able to see others for who they truly are. They developed his character to be able to display qualities of what it's like to be human. Instead of simply leaving him as \"the perfect person\", they were able to incorporate the concept that he makes mistakes too, and that's what is most lovely about it. The idea that characters are able to be who they are, imperfect, but still they receive love, and compassion. The idea that the main girl may not be the most beautiful girl in school, nor is she popular. The idea that people can be loved for their personality, even if they are not a perfect person is what is refreshing. And the way all this love is conveyed through a very \"clean\" story lacking in all things ecchi is what amazes me the most and I am happy that this is one of the few anime out there that doesn't need sexual components to have viewers. The other characters are just as lovely in their own right, and do share some background story to them as well, although not as much. But all the characters stick to who they are and have a firm ground on the person they see themselves as versus what they are really like, giving their character depth.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 This anime's art style is not bad, and must have been good for when it first was released. However, I am watching this in 2016 where graphics have been pretty stellar. Regardless however, the art style did not bug me that much. Everything was proportional because they chose to keep the art and backgrounds rather simple. If the viewer does decide to watch the second season, I'd say the art improves but not dramatically. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 It is what it is, and their voice actors suffice. I like the main guy's voice but other that that nothing bad stands out but there's nothing that was amazing either. The opening and closing are pleasant to hear but they do not stick in my mind very much. The second season has a better opening and closing, but that is just my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 I loved it. Definitely worth pulling an all nighter for. I'm someone who does not like skipping episodes because I want every single detail but I can imagine that someone might not be interested in watching all 25 episodes. There's a lot of parts that build up into something that pushes character growth but once finishing you might feel like wow all this was only to get this far. To each their own, but this anime was very pleasant for me. Maybe it did not hit home as hard as Clannad and Toradora did, but it is definitely one to remember for a very long time.",

Her classmates are afraid of looking at her and there are gossips that you'll get cursed if you do it for longer than 3 seconds. She's the shy and, because of it, lonely type of girl, but when she meets Kazehaya, she tries to change a bit. She's not used to having friends and the process of her developing friendships is one of the most well depicted. This anime is an emotional one, but, thankfully, it has its funny moments, too. The thing that can be annoying is the progressof Sawako and Kazehaya's relationship, but it's the kind of anime that doesn't focus on lovey-dovey things, but they aren't bad, either. The style is a bit like the K-on!'s. Music. Personally, I liked the opening and the ending. The first one is a little melancholic and fits the ambience of this production. If you survive the first episodes, you'll get sucked in and watch it with interest to the very end.",

            "content": "I'd like to say first off that I didn't want to watch Kimi ni Todoke when I first read about it.\r\nFrom the synopsis, I thought the anime would be shallow, and that it would revolve completely around Sawako's attempt at proving she was nothing like the character from The Ring, and that she would use Kazehaya expressly for that purpose.\r\nI have never been so wrong!\r\nThe story was sweet and innocent and cute, and very heart-warming. I found Sawako's character very unique - she's not headstrong and assertive like most other anime leads, and I think that's why I liked her so much. Yes, the storyis based on how she is feared by her classmates, but I found that that fact merely added tot he story instead of completely swallowing it. It's because of this fear that Sawako grows, and that she can grow closer to Kazehaya. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nLike I said above, the story was sweet and innocent. The pacing was really slow, but I kind of enjoyed it - it felt more realistic. Seriously, let's be honest - how often do romances bloom in the space of a couple days?? It can happen, but rarely. Although I enjoyed the sweetness, I admit that sometimes the problems that arose frustrated me. Nine times out of ten, the problems that surfaced were from some sort of misunderstanding, and sometimes I found myself thinking \"seriously?? Just say what you meant!\" However, it was a minor annoyance, because the problems do add to the anime. Also, the ending was satisfactory - I finished this anime with a smile on my face, not a frown.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI loved the art!! It was so airy and romantic and beautiful. I think this anime has one of the best artwork I've seen. However, I feel like the characters weren't as well drawn as the backgrounds. Sometimes their artwork was superb, like during really pivotal points, but most of the time it was just okay. The comedic artwork was perfect though - some of the portrayals of Sawako's face get me every time.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 9 \\n\r\nThe opening theme for season one was my favourite! I always watched through it, because I loved it - it matched the anime perfectly. I didn't really like the opening theme for the second season though. They should have kept the one from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime was fantastic. It was paced like the anime - slow but believable. And it wasn't super noticeable development either. You'd stop and realize that so-and-so really grew from the beginning, or something similar. And the way the characters revolved around each other was awesome as well - everyone was unique and likeable. I even liked the \"bad\" character! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/ Overall: 10\\n\r\nI love love love love this anime. Like, with all my heart. It had everything I liked! And the romance that developed in this anime was so beautiful. I found myself looking forward to the next episode every time I finished an episode. \\n",

Usually it's the smart, beautiful girl who gains the attention from the popular boy, but in this, it's exactly the opposite. The most popular guy in the school ends up falling for a girl who is socially awkward and is cursed by her looks, beingdescribed as a character from a horror movie!

Simply...?\r\nIt took me a while(very slow at times) to realize that you do not see individual scores on reviews so here they are and I hope you can help me improve my review writing(worst area in writing)\r\nStory 7: Reviews I read over-hyped it, but it was good.\r\nArt 9: Liked how different it was.\r\nSound 8: Music and Voice acting was good.\r\nCharacters 7: Main leads weremore typical then described, but the minor characters stole the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: Really liked this anime and I am planning to watch the live movie.\\n\\n\r\n                          *          *              *\\n\r\nWhen I read reviews of this anime I thought it would be a change of pace from the typical shoujo genre. However as I began watching this anime I realized the reviews I read exaggerated this anime. The story is about a girl named Sawako, but people call her Sadako after the scary character from \"The Ring.\" She is feared by her classmates, yet is clueless about the reason. Then she meets her savior, Kazehaya who is a nice guy. From there the story is slow paced as the two feelings grow. In some aspects the story is different from others as it does not have unnecessary misunderstanding and unrealistic situations. The realness from the anime match the setting of high school. Yet there is one thing it has that is not typical yet is disappointing and it was the ending. It didn't end bad, but it felt flat, so maybe more fun stuff will happen next season.However the anime still holds typical shoujo elements mainly in the characters. \\n\\n\r\nNever had I watch a shoujo anime where the characters looked mostly normal. The water based color softens and sweeten the anime helping tell it's cute story. You get used to the art and the fact the the main character is not a bishie which I love. Normal guys are not that sexy and I feel it draws away from the story and characters. If I knew more about art I would describe it more, but one thing I can describe is the camera angles. From the close ups, to the wide shots none of the video seems unnecessary and it all fits the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe theme songs both fit the mood of the anime as the opening is sweet, yet a little edgy and the ending softens the episode. The voice acting is nice and normal just like the characters. In the beginning Sawako soft voice bothered me until I got to know her character and realized it was the voice actor transmitting the character perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead, Kakehaya, is more typical shoujo then some would admit. While he is not cold or rich he is athletic and smart. People assume he is not just because he does not play baseball anymore, but once an athlete always an athlete. Also like a lot of male leads the guy is popular with his peers both guys and girls, and the girls can be creepy. The female lead Sawako is not dumb in school and has her creepy ways, but she is too is like a lot of female leads. She is naive, kind hearted, and easily loved. The cock blocker in the season was t Kurimi and while she didn't do daring moves on Kakekaya like many cock blockers she still had that jealous behavior. Besides some typical shoujo personality traits the characters are lovable and you find yourself thinking how cute they could be. Still the sidekicks Chizu and Ayane stole the show as they brought the aspect of different type of friends. They are not the type of friends you would expect Sawako to be friends with which makes it more believable. Throughout the story characters like Sawako grow while some stay neutral like Kakehaya. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime overall and I can't wait for the second season. I would recommend this anime to someone looking for a mostly drama free story with plenty of sweet scenes. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who likes heavy drama because this anime is too sweet for you. This anime is unique in it's on little way and if you decide to watch it well enjoy :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

She meets some friends later on and you get to really understand her.\r\nThis story is very heart-warming and you will never forget it, it leaves you with a sort of syrupy feeling after you finish the series.

            "content": "This review won't be as thorough as others so I hope it would be short but sweet.\r\nStory: \r\nThe first few episodes start out very nicely. You see the problems surrounding the main characters and you, the audience, can relate to Sawako with her issues. This anime is definitely a romantic anime as almost everything is encircled around love. Will they confess to each other? Will they be alone together? Will they see each other again? And so on and so forth. But the love build up is wayyyy tooo slow. If you're okay with an extremely slow paced love relationship then I suggest this handsdown. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Nice art, although not the best I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Loved the opening and closing music. It's gonna be my jam for a while. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where I get frustrated. It's okay that the secondary characters are a bit iffy and unrealistic but it simply frustrates me to see Sawako so oblivious to everything. I won't spoil it for you guys but seriously, she needs to open up her eyes and the reality around her. She doesn't need to apologize for EVERYTHING she's done and hasn't done. She needs to wake up and see what her relationships and her feelings actually mean, of course, in the end she does, but how can her oblivion drag on to almost 25 episodes! And yes, most of the issues are caused by her oblivion, so I guess without her oblivion, there would be no show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI did thoroughly enjoyed it, if you don't count the parts where I wanted to tear Sawako to pieces because of her unrealistic oblivion towards relationships and love. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nYou saw the name everywhere and everyone's recommending you to watch it. If you're a total romance and shoujo sucker then I definitely recommend!",

            "content": "I often find it hard to compare animes that I have determined to be among my favorites with other shows I have liked less because those that fit into that category tend to have something striking about them, like a particularly interesting plot, particularly interesting casts, or some other feature that just jumps out at me. Because of that, I only ever want to say is something along the lined of \"Well this shows characters were awesome\" or \"this shows story rocked\" but I can never say exactly what part of the story rocked or why the characters were awesome. In this case, I cansay exactly what makes it stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that makes Kimi Ni Todoke stand out is its pacing. Kimi ni is a lot like other shoujo animes in many ways. The main characters are styled much like most shoujo characters, the story, although not the most common plot, has been seen before and will surely be seen again, and the music doesn't stand out in any significant way in my mind. What makes this show stand out above the rest is the smooth story progression. Where many shoujo stories seem to come in little chunks of plot broken up by episodes with little story value beyond character development, Kimi ni devotes every episode to story progression, and that combined with it's well executed take on a classic story, interesting art (the many different art styles used in this will stick in your mind in for weeks after watching this show ;), and lovable characters will have you laughing and crying all the way to the end.",

            "content": "Kimi Ni Todoke is one of the most optimistic and beautiful shows that I\u2019ve ever seen. Watching it again only made it clearer how much other shows simply do not compare. The story\u2019s about a teenage girl named Sawako Kuronuma who, because of her scary-looking appearance, is doomed to be an outsider. But one day she meets a boy, Shota Kazehaya. And it\u2019s thanks to this boy, and the spark that he provides in her life, that she is able to muster up the courage to try and make changes to her life. The show is then less about the love story, and more aboutSawako\u2019s growing world, growing self-confidence, growing capacity to interact with the people around her, and how this manifests itself throughout the show (relationships, friendships, her self-esteem, and even the way she\u2019s drawn). Sawako\u2019s personality is ultimately what gives the show its unique aesthetic and worldview.\\n\\n\r\nSawako has remained alone throughout most of her school years. There are constant rumors and misunderstandings about her. Some say she\u2019s cursed, some day she does black magic; all anyone can agree on is that she\u2019s kind of creepy. It doesn\u2019t help that any time Sawako tries to force a smile, it looks like she\u2019s just killed her husband and drowned her children \u2013 it\u2019s scary. But Sawako remains a bastion of positivity and optimism. She always helps out, volunteers, and does things for others, never expecting anything in return. She notices how Kazehaya always seems to be around people, talking, laughing, the center of attention; she admires that. Soon enough, he\u2019s making an effort to include her in the dynamic of the rest of the class (going so far as to sit next to her when everyone else refuses to).\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s because of this initial effort from Kazehaya that Sawako starts making more chances. She puts herself out there, hoping for the best. Soon enough she makes two friends, Yano and Chizu. But, even still, her self-confidence and her knowledge about these matters is so poor that she isn\u2019t even sure that she qualifies as being a friend to them. Part of Sawako\u2019s problem is that she\u2019s become so accustomed to being alone that she doesn\u2019t even recognize the importance of her own feelings. She knows of things, but has never experienced them. This is why she doesn\u2019t even know if she qualifies as being a friend, or later why she doesn\u2019t even understand that her feelings for Kazehaya are romantic (a shoujo standby, but given psychological depth here).\\n\\n\r\nAs Sawako begins to make friends, the central conflict becomes internal. It is no longer about her classmates or friends accepting her, but rather about Sawako thinking enough of herself to see herself as an equal to her peers. Most of the time she believes that she should put her wants and desires on hold to let other people get what they want. That\u2019s why she volunteers or all the jobs that people don\u2019t want at school \u2013 she\u2019s completely selfless in an almost self-denigrating way. She casts herself down in order to bring up others \u2013 in order for her to aspire to become like them. Part of the growth o Sawako\u2019s character is finding out the ways in which all the people she admires and wants to be like are all flawed in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nEven after acknowledging her feelings of love and friendship and seeing what she\u2019s on equal ground with everyone else, she still has moments when she reduces herself again. I\u2019d like to discuss Sawako\u2019s \u201cchibi\u201d moments. I\u2019m aware of the long history of these in anime; however, in Kimi ni Todoke, they serve an explicit thematic purpose. Sawako\u2019s \u201cchibi\u201d moments are an expression of her current standing within the situation. If she feels awed by a situation or if she can\u2019t understand it, she\u2019ll go into that mode; her height is changed, her facial features become simplified, etc. She makes herself sub-human, even; unable to comprehend the situation she finds herself in. This is because she assumes she\u2019s not equipped or on the same level as the people around her. It\u2019s an issue of self-esteem. But these situations become fewer and farther in between. Part of the show\u2019s strength is seeing Sawako rise to meet the challenge in situations that are important (notice that she does not go \u201cchibi\u201d in these confrontations).\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a formal elegance to the construction of Kimi ni Todoke that still baffles me. It is a balance that seems perfectly realized. It always seems to know exactly when to leave our mundane world behind and replace it with colors, sparkles, floral patterns \u2013 it taps into Sawako\u2019s psyche even, and the animation is derived from her emotion. How else does one explain the pinks, the greens, the effervescence, the transcendence, the almost utopian ever-optimistic sensibility that seemingly is able to only come from being able to intensely identify with this teenage girl\u2019s feelings?\\n\\n\r\nKimi ni Todoke believes in a world where people are good and darkness is there only to allow for opportunities to grow; it is a thoroughly uplifting vision. Through Sawako, we experience the world not as it is, but how it should be.\\n\\n\r\nNote: I should mention that this write-up focuses more on the first season than anything else. The first season concerns itself more with the growth of Sawako\u2019s inner strength and confidence, and the tentative steps she takes to have a life that she can be happy with. The second season, on the other hand, tries to resolve the romance between Kazehaya and her. As such, it\u2019s beyond the scope of what I was focusing on in this essay. However, the second series is quite worthwhile, just necessarily different.\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: thenextthingwordpress.wordpress.com",

I'm really fond of the theme tune; it's very feel-good, and though there is a lot of repetition, I really found I didn't care. I just let myself be absorbed, sat back, and enjoyed. \r\nAt the end, I did have a RAEGFEST since I felt cheated ofmy happy ending with a kiss/confessions of love, but then a friend pointed out to me that the second season has just begun airing in Japan this January. Thank goodness it's being continued because, JEEZ! I'm looking forward to it, but for only being 25 episodes, it took me days to get through because it really is quite a slow burn.",

            "content": "STORY: Well, basically Kimi Ni Todoke shows you that no one should judge a book by its cover and that sometimes people who seem weird or unfriendly turn out to  be kind and warm-hearted, afterwards.\r\nHonestly, I cried in the middle of the 2nd episode. And for me, it's really hard to cry about something I would watch. I really can relate to Sawako's story even though I'm not like her when it comes to personality.\r\nEven so, I know the feeling of people making false assumptions about you without even knowing the real \"you\".\r\nDespite the fact that the story progress seems kinda slow and therearen't many lovey-dovey scenes, Kimi Ni Todoke is an anime that will make you cry, laugh and smile for sure.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I find the art very appealing. Mostly because it emphasizes the characters' feelings and  in the end makes it look much more realistic than the common cutesy shoujo art you see every day.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is to me the best feature in the whole anime. Throughout the series, you will recognize a collection of 22 original soundtracks including the opening by Tomofumi Tanizawa (awesome singer btw).\\n\r\nIt just makes me feel relaxed with a warm feeling inside my heart. (cheesy but true) Whenever I hear them I feel like I want to daydream forever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: From the synopsis  you realize the main character, Sawako, has a very unique personality. But she's not the only one. The supporting cast also have their particular characteristics which once again sets a different concept of what you would usually see in this genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Kimi Ni Todoke creates a great combination of a unique plot with very amusing characters, an awesome sound compilation and beautiful, simplistic art. If you are looking for something  other than the typical romance/shoujo anime this is for you.",

            "content": "Kimi ni Todoke is an Anime that, while it is aimed at female teenagers, I personally loved and enjoyed all the way through. If there is a Shojo anime that guys can enjoy, this is one of them. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story revolves around a shy, but friendly girl named Sawako who tends to be socially awkward because of her resemblance to Sadako from \"The Ring\" series, giving off a creepy vibe to everyone around her. This all changes when the most popular boy of the class, named Kazehaya, starts to talk to her. The anime then continues on how Sawako becomes friends with many peopleand becomes popular among everyone at school, as well as how her feelings towards Kazehaya develop throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art style is one of the greatest I have seen up to now, and I can go on and on about how pleasing the art style is. The character proportions are very well done, although the heights are a bit off for my tastes. One thing I did love of the art style is the way the characters look during different scenes. An example would be that a silly, chibi-like version of the character would be placed during a silly or funny scene, while a more adult-like or beautiful/handsome version of a character would come up on a romantic or serious scene. There are many things that can be discussed about each of the characters art style, but it's one that I will surely remember for a long time. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are very heartwarming and nice, not to mention they set the tone of the show. The songs that are played in different scenes fit well based on the situation. An example would be a silly, fast, upbeat song would play during the silly scenes. The voice acting was very nice and the VAs fit the characters very well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are very well done, probably one of my favorite characters in all of Anime. Sawako is the shy, but sweet female protagonist who tries to make friends but is pretty socially awkward and takes a while to do so. Kazehaya is the male protagonist who's known to be the most popular guy of the class because of his kindness to others and his good nature, all while showing interest towards Sawako. Ayane and Chizuru are Sawako's best friends, where Ayane is mature and calm, while Chizuru is tomboyish and emotional. Ryu is a close friend of Kazehaya and the childhood friend of Chizuru, known to be very quiet but knows when to give support to those in need. Pin is the homeroom teacher of the group and he tends to pick on Kazehaya, since he knows him from Kazehaya's baseball days, and likes to joke around a lot, but he shows a serious and helping side when the students need it. Kurumi is a girl that has known Kazehaya since middle school and she seems like a sweet and caring girl, but there is more to her (Which is something you have to see). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the series, seeing how Sawako develops as a character throughout the series, starting out as a shy girl that no one talked with to a girl who was well known and friends with everyone. I enjoyed the silly scenes with the music that played in said scenes, and I enjoyed the scenes that were romantic or important. I also enjoyed the characters and their interactions with each other, with each of them having a unique personality. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is one that really made me happy and feel good, especially for how the show went along. This show is bound to make you root for Sawako and Kazehaya to get together, and it's easily a couple in anime that you would enjoy. Whether you're a person who loves romance animes or someone who enjoys slices of life, or someone who likes feel good animes, this is one that anyone can enjoy. The pace may not be for everyone, but I assure you that if you just roll along with it, it'll come out to be a series you would enjoy. This is one I highly recommend to anyone that watches anime, whether you're new to anime or a veteran in watching anime.",

            "content": "(Spoiler free)\r\nSUMMARY\r\nKimi no Todake is a good slice-of-life high school romance. Featuring Sawako - a very shy, and socially withdrawn girl finally making friends and dealing with social interactions. You can forgive some minor irritations, due to the supporting cast of Ayane and Chizou moving things along nicely. It's a shame the second series falters after this good start - although things are wrapped up nicely. See my other review of Season 2.\r\nOVERVIEW\r\nSawako Kunomura doesn't have many friends in high school. Made fun of, and feared, by her schoolmates for resembling the girl from the Ring series, she also has the nickname Sadako - nothelp by her unintended creepy smile and awkwardness. Things change one day though, when the most popular guy in school, Kazehuya, befriends her and she starts coming out of her shell. After soon becoming friends with Ayane Yona and Chizou Yoshida - she starts developing a social circle and all the drama that entails.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW\\n\r\nOne thing becomes very apparent - Sawako does take everything far too literally. Her social anxieties and inability to read other people's emotions and intentions clearly is unusual - it seems she aligns with traits of someone on the autistic spectrum. When sarcastically told by other characters to become a ghost or do something - she will go ahead quite naively and carry it out quite literally.\\n\\n\r\nEven when Sawako is facing other students with an ill intent towards her, Sawako's naive in her understanding of the situation. Sawako's excessive internal monologues can grate after a while - constantly thinking she's in the wrong, but thankfully things move on in an episode or two, with her realising she is a well liked person. By the end of the series Sawako has become more socially adept.\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead Kazehuya is a likeable but unremarkable guy, and only serves to provide moments of pleasantness and light relief. It's a shame as his function in the series is somewhat mute, given Ayane and Chizou great characterisations helping Sawako.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the show was easily, Ayane and Chizou - while initially introduced to give an impression of delinquent students they soon reveal themselves to be some of the kindest characters and Sawako's closest friends. There's a heart-warming scene in episode 4 which cements Sawako, Ayane and Chizou friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe friendship between Ayane/Chizou/Sawako is the stand-out feature of series, and it overshadows the love interest between Sawako and Kazehuya - and even Sawako's own personal development. Regardless of the situation Sawako is facing, Ayane and Chizou are always on hand to make sure she will get by - this is incredibly refreshing, where in other romantic anime the supporting characters are just walls the protagonists can bounce their heads off - instead Ayane & Chizou are actively taking action to help. Situations where you would expect Ayane and Chizou to be mad at Sawako, are actually resolved through talking openly and honestly - without allowing the trope of a series of unfortunate misunderstandings develop (even though it seems this will be case early on in the series). The series makes you feel like everyone should have a friend like Ayane.\\n\\n\r\nAt times it feels as if the series is getting to a dull routine \u2013 and the introduction of Pin, a wise cracking chauvinistic supply teacher is a welcome addition \u2013 if only to alleviate Sawako's insecure rumblings.\\n\\n\r\nThe most disappointing thing part of the series was just how much animation and art styles vary \u2013 switching between ultra-cute and a more grounded art style. I get that the studio is trying to convey the endearing qualities of the characters but at times its too much. On occasions it is great in effect, but it happens so often it just too jarring \u2013 and it's a noticeable off putting point.\\n\\n\r\nAs is typical, there are some of misunderstandings that need to be cleared up - however what is a pleasant piece of fresh air is that none drag on too long, leading to a quick resolution of issues, and moving through relationship and character development in a brisk manner. With the exception of a couple of episodes that drag-on, the pacing is fair. Special note should be given to episodes 4, 10, 14 and 18 which are great moments for the season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an OK romantic anime \u2013 leading into (a disappointing) final and complete Season 2.",

            "content": "Hello.\r\nThis will be my review about \"Kimi ni Todoke\", which I consider a really really great anime. \r\nOn one hand, I struggled to actually make out a rating, as I wasn't sure to give it a 9 or a 10, and as a conclusion, I would give it a 9.60 which is rounded to 10. however, if I need to round a number I always choose the lower, as it actually reached that rating for me. \r\nAs a first real rating topic, I take the storyline, which I consider one of the weaker points of the anime*, I feel like something is missing at fewparts (like the storyline to be less predictable, even though it is meant to be something like this). Although I especially liked how it went on. And the fact that besides romance you can actually laugh gets this anime an extra point. \\n\\n\r\n* Being a story maniac, it is awfully hard to give me a story that will get 10/10, so I will give my rating of 9.\\n\\n\r\nSecond for every anime is the art, which left me breathless. The design of the characters is something fabulous, also the special effects are used in a perfect balance with the story in the right moments which actually empowered the excitement. That was simply something I had to give 10 points.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly I need to mention that the sound is completely fine, the intro and outro fit the anime, also most of the sounds are placed at the right point, one or two little errors I felt, and even those might not be noticeable in most cases. So, all in all, I would give it 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth point is the characters, some of which without the art do not give back what the story needs them for, however, the art corrects it sometimes and as the story goes on they become forgettable moments, although the main characters will remain for quite some time. For that lack of strength, I decided, however, to give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nFifth point and last is the enjoyment which I can say that was the hardest to put a rating on. I was between 9 and 10, and I can actually say that the filler episode made me feel even more uncomfortable at a point, despite this I decided to give it a 10 because it was some time ago when I laughed so freely like on this anime and waited so much to see what's next. \\n\\n\r\nSo in overall as I already said it's 48/5, which is exactly 9.6. But the anime itself is not a 10 for me, as it never really reached 10, not even for a moment, however, it was always close to it, so it's a superior and proud 9. \\n\r\nBeing so, I recommend watching it if you like romance animes with a cute sense of humor.",

By and large, it played straight the ones I love, and subverted the ones that usually aren't to my liking, catching me flatfooted more than once. Whereas many romcoms play with the old \"will they, won't they\" (spoiler alert: they usually will), this one didn't really leave any doubts by episode 3 that they definitely will.\r\nAsking the if question above, it's often hard to write a story about. You can answer it yes or no and that's that. Kimi ni todoke didn't ask the if question, but more of the when and how and where question. You candefinitely write stories about those. Add into that that the main couple are not the be all, end all of this work, but instead we also get a well characterized supporting cast, and it definitely stands out from the usual blend.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all a very enjoyable anime, likely one of the very best in its genre, a genre which doesn't exactly lend itself to providing outstanding work, so a 8/10 overall is probably the best score a pure romcom is ever gonna reach. Kimi ni todoke definitely earns that mark.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the art style, and it seems to me it will age well.",

            "content": "This is my favorite anime. Ever. It was also my first ever anime so I might be biased but I really think it is incredible. I WON'T HAVE ANY SPOILERS in this review so you can read on safely, I'll skip the synopsis seeing as you can find many, and get right to what I love about this anime:\r\nWhat I loved about it most is that it taught me things about life.\r\nIn this anime we look at the tough world of high school through the ultimately innocent eyes of Sawako. Though she doesn't really have any friends she is eternally optimistic, honest and.... extremely dense.The fact that she is dense, though, is actually what makes her so great at figuring out complicated issues of friendship, popularity and love. When you know nothing about life and making friends you have to start from zero and learn the basics first. We sometimes forget the basics getting too caught up in unwritten social rules and insecurities. Her solution to a lot of things that bother everyone is being honest, believing in people and not giving up. Everyone can clear up a misunderstanding. It gives you courage to see her go through life, it makes you want to be a good person. \\n\\n\r\nThe best stories are the ones that make you want to be better yourself, that help you deal with everyday life and that help you become who you are or want to be, this is one of those stories.  Why are you still reading this, go watch it!! \\n\\n\r\nI see you're still reading this so I'll get into the other aspects of the anime. \\n\r\nThe anime is very slow paced with relatively little emotional pay offs and big moments. Personally it never bothered me for a minute, though, it made it more realistic and made the character development more meaningful. I think the way the anime works is very character driven, the story never seems to just serve the plot and choices and realizations are given enough time not to feel rushed. The story is actually quite typical shoujo but it still feels very different from a lot of other shoujo I've watched now and it is perfect in it's execution. The lack of regular emotional pay offs and big drama might bother you if you are already used to the shoujo genre (I wasn't) but I'd say give it a few episodes if you still think it's too uneventful then this might not be the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked the art, has a bit of a pastel watercolory vibe, perfectly capturing the innocence and it's got the funny chibi versions of characters to show the extra emotions (and just to be funny). I also like the way the people are drawn not too unrealistically and that there's no trace of the weird obsession with boobs you seem to find in other animes. The backgrounds were also beautiful.\\n\r\nThe music is not incredibly complicated, mostly simple piano, but perfect for the atmosphere. Both season one and season two have got great theme songs, too! The voice actors seemed perfect for their characters to me, but I did watch the anime first and I guess that can make a difference.\\n\\n\r\nI think a lot of people will enjoy this anime, I got the recommendation from people whom I didn't think liked this kind of story. I never watched any anime before this one, foolishly thinking it wouldn't be for me, and this is what got me watching, so thinking like that is no excuse either! I've watched it multiple times, so even if you've already seen it and are just scrolling through wondering what you liked about it again, just go watch it, I'll shut up now.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This is the first time I'm submitting my review, so I don't know if I'm doing it well..) \r\nThese anime series is not like any other anime. The story is very heart warming and the kind of \"slow\" development between Sawako and Kazehaya didn't annoy  me at all.. In fact, it was very adorable to see those two getting closer by baby steps. \r\nStory (9/10): \r\nThe story revolves around a girl named Kuronuma Sawako (often mistaken as Sadako a.k.a. the girl from \"The Ring\"). At school she doesn't really have friends, since everyone thinks they'll get cursed by even sitting on the chair sheused to sit on! That all changes, though, as she made new friends: Kazehaya-kun, Chizu-chan and Yano-chin (that's how she refers to them). The whole lonely girl making friends is, of course, not really a new thing in the anime/manga world, which makes the story a kind of clich\u00e9. HOWEVER, everything besides that is not really that clich\u00e9. Okay, except from the fact that Kazehaya is a popular guy chased by many girls who even set up a \"Kazehaya belongs to everyone\" group. I'm rattling too much right now.. Anyways, this anime is definitely worth watching! \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nIt's kind of.. yeah, plain, but also very creative. The characters don't have outstanding looks, pink hair, unnatural eye colors.. They just look like average japanese students. The reason why I give the art style an 9 is because to me, that kinda looks plain. But at the same time it looks nice too, I just don't know what to say about it. There are some moments when the art kinda differs, such as when Sawako gets nervous and such. She kinda turns into a chibi character or something like that lol. That always cracks me up. When Sawako smiles, however, the art mostly turns into a beautiful colorful art (since Sawako rarely smiles). This will all make sense to you if you watch the show, honestly.. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty nice. They used the right kind of music at the right moments. I also happened to hear acoustic versions of the intro/ending song. These were really peaceful. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\\n\r\nAs for the character.. Honestly, you can't help but feel sorry for Sawako from time to time. She's pretty dense, you know. Sometimes a little too dense, to be honest. Sometimes it's pretty funny how she struggles to understand something that's actually very easy to understand. However, it's very fun to watch her open up more and more throughout the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): \\n\r\nI've actually re-watched this anime, because I knew how cute the story was. I really loved it the first time, but the second time was even lovelier. This anime is just ADORABLE. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8,8/10):\\n\r\nJUST WATCH IT ALREADY! Oh, and don't forget about season 2!",

If you are looking for a romantic anime, and expecting a lot of interaction with the girl and her love interest, as well as great development in their relationship, you should know that this anime has a slow pace and is't romance driven.\r\n One of the reason I love this anime is becasue of the main character, Sawako. I enjoyed seeing how she interacts with other people, and how she develops friendship with her classmates. Her interactions with people and reactions to various things is what makes this anime so appealing.\r\nI enjoyedthe art in this anime. It wasn't the most beautiful, and some of the characters designs looked very simple, but I loved the use of the background, and flowes. It has some beautiful scenes in it.\\n\r\nThe sound suited the anime well. It was calm.\\n\r\nCharacters are the biggest strength in this anime. Sawako's friend are the best friends in an anime show I've seen so far. They didn't only provide background to the main character. I was looking forward for Sawako to interact with her friends and loved Chizu and Ayane. As well as that, Kazehaya ( main love interest) is a really nice guy but also seems human aswell with some of his flaws.\\n\r\nOverall I loved this anime.  I loved it's different outlook on love, as it seemed more pure and innocent from other animes. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Kimi ni Todoke\" is something very elusive in anime: a realistic and non exploitative look at high school life. There is nary a boob shot! This is a rarity in anime, but probably in television everywhere, but I found it be a very enjoyable show. \r\nOur protagonist is Sawako (not Sadako!) a shy and jarringly awkward girl who has the best intentions but ends up terrifying her classmates. She even tries to embrace her spookiness as something of a personal quirk in a last-ditch effort to make friends. However, things really don't change until she happens into two new female friends who seem different fromthe rest. \\n\\n\r\nI found her to be a very relatable character. Who didn't have awkward teenage years? The story was a pleasing portrayal the way that her anxiety and lack of social aptitude frustrated her attempts to break out of her shell, while avoiding making her wallow obnoxiously in petty problems. The real highlight for me were the realistic moments of teenage glory - hanging out with her friends for the first time and the girls scheme to get her on the phone with her crush, for example, that reminded me of what it was like to be an awkward but enthusiastic teenager in the best possible way. \\n\\n\r\nThis is really the last anime to watch if you want cheap titillation, obviously. Despite that it miraculously avoids melodrama through basically realistic characters. It even avoids being too tedious by having a funny teacher who generally makes a baffoon of himself given the slightest opportunity - I can't even say it breaks the realism as I had a sports coach teacher in high school myself who was remarkably similar to him. \\n\\n\r\nThe art didn't strike me as anything special until the final story arc which takes place around New Years and features some stunningly beautiful scenes in the snow. \\n\\n\r\nI've sought out many animes like this, and by comparison, it's quite good. It is more realistic than \"True Tears\" or especially \"Rumbling Hearts\", which are popular shows in this subgenre, and largely as I result I found it to be superior to them. It even seemed a notch better than what had been my favorite \"serious\" high school romance anime, \"Myself; Yourself\" as the protagonist is better drawn as a realistic teenager.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to say why this wasn't a \"perfect 10\" for me. I definitely liked it, and wish there were more shows like it. Sawako's love interest is perhaps a bit too perfect, as if he was custom created to be the only sort of boyfriend who could spark up a relationship with a girl with such disastrous social skills. The story does stray into a side arc involving one of her female friends which was okay but definitely seemed a notch below the main story's quality. It was ultimately just very fun to watch and reached an enjoyable conclusion, but never really took it to the next level. For this sort of a realistic drama though, that might not even have been appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, this is about the opposite of your typical high school anime. For me, that's a good thing. Maybe you're the same way?",

But no spoilers here!\r\nStory - 8\r\n--------\r\nThe story could be pretty generic if you look at it normally. But in my opinion, it just seems like the anime is about a bunch of misunderstandings. But it is believable. The first episode supports it as well. Overall, the story is really good and believable.\r\n--------\r\nArt - 8\r\n--------\r\nThe animation and art style stood out to me. It was very fitting with the theme of the anime and very innocent. And don't get me wrong, Kimi niTodoke is a very innocent show, well Sawako has a really pure heart, only intending to interact with people normally, but I'll save that for the character section. The chibi moments in the anime were very adorable and lighthearted as well.\\n\r\n--------\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the anime is very relaxing and peaceful, especially the OP's and the ED's. While I was listening to the soundtrack, I felt my mind at ease. Definitely something worth listening to if you want to relax.\\n\r\n--------\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nI loved all of the characters in Kimi ni Todoke.You can't hate any of them. I felt more connected to the supporting characters like Yano or Chizuru. Sawako is very likable and adorable. All she wants in life are friends. She is a bit of an airhead but that adds to her cuteness. Kazehaya is also a likable character, being energetic and a perfect match for Sawako. All the characters contrast each other and are all balanced in the show.\\n\r\n--------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nI wasn't bored by Kimi ni Tdoke, but frustrated. All romance anime has some type of misunderstanding that you want to have solved. Kimi ni Todoke is no exception. But I will say that it does have its comedy together and a good amount of cute moments that I will remember for a long time. I would definitely share funny moments with a friend or two to get them interested in the same anime.\\n\r\n--------\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nAlthough Kimi ni Tdoke is one of the best romances, it's not the best. It has its flaws like cliches and such, but it does stand out and makes a name for itself. The anime is a bit slow but quickly picks up in the second season. It really deserves more recognition than what it has right now. It's a really great anime in the end.",

With 5 episodes it has already told something other anime do with twice as many episodes.

            "content": "After watching Kimi ni Todoke I like to think of this anime as a Jane Austen style romance. The slow growing relationship between the male and female protagonists is heartwarming, old fashioned and requires time to blossom. This anime takes patience and it is well rewarded.\r\nWhen checking out reviews I often quickly read small portions so I'll say the most important bit first. If you are a fan of romance, comedy, school, shoujo or josei there's a good chance that you'll enjoy Kimi ni Todoke. In my opinion you don't need to be a veteran of these genres either. I am relatively new to theworld of romance anime and I extremely enjoyed Kimi ni Todoke. This anime also has a live action adaptation which I found helped ease the, 'what am I to do with my life now' feeling after completing an awesome series. To keep from writing any spoilers about the ending I will only say that it is written extremely well though I do recommend watching season two for a proper sense of story completion.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is nothing overly complicated. It has similarities to other stories in the shoujo/romance genre but I thought it was unique in it's own way. I found myself emotionally invested in the story. I've never had an anime make me teary eyed and then full of joy until I watched Kimi ni Todoke. \\n\\n\r\nYou'll find yourself rooting for the characters. The friendships that develop are outstanding and were by far my favorite part of this anime. The majority of the main characters are extremely likable. Kuronuma is refreshing as the female lead though you may find yourself frustrated with her at times. The same goes for the male lead, Kazehaya. You come to understand just how much they have in common as the story gives you both of their perspectives. This anime does a brilliant job at conveying the emotions of the characters which in turn involves the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was superbly done and some scenes were downright beautiful. I am a bit of a snob when it comes to the art, I like anime's that look realistic, colorful and lovely without that extreme cartoony style. Overall the music was enjoyable and the scene music fit perfectly. I especially liked the opening songs for both seasons. This is one you don't skip over the openings or endings.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I'm glad I decided to watch Kimi ni Todoke. There's so much anime to choose from and this is one that should be chosen. It will give you that warm feeling in your heart and leave you a little bit happier with the world.",

All I could think about was the ending, and how utterly adorable some of the scenes were in this anime. When I was suppose to be sleeping, I just couldn't get it out of my head. I don't usually feel this way about most anime's, in general.\r\nWhen I heard about Kimi Ni Todoke, and read the plot, I thought, \"Oh, another cliche romance.\" And I was right, some of the situations, and moments in this anime are very cliche, but I felt that they did a great job atturning those usually normal moments into something even greater.\\n\\n\r\nWhen a character did something, or said something cute or embarrassing, I would be on the edge of my seat, grinning from ear to ear, or covering my eyes; even though it wasn't me experiencing all this.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, music, and sounds are memorable, and the characters and plot are to die for. I really felt for these characters, and although I usually get annoyed by cliche characters in romances, this anime did a really good job at expressing the emotion realistically. Some moments we're a bit doubtful, and were a bit unrealistic, but c'mon, it's anime right?\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kimi Ni Todoke is a heartwarming, cute, slice of life anime with a dash of Perfect romance. I can't even begin to explain the feelings I felt while watching this, and it wasn't just the plot, it was the very vibes. Even when one character blushed, or glanced at another character, I was whining with joy.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'm crazy to feel so happy when watching this anime, but if I were to rate it, my rating would be a perfect score. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nI hope anyone who reads this will enjoy.",

I started watching this one at about 11pm and went old school with a 10 hour 'i'll be fine for work' marathon. Needless to say, I made the call. \r\nThe high rank on MAL is what brought me to watch the show and I was not disappointed. The story for me was original. I've seen the movie 'The RIng' and the introduction of 'Sadako's' character had me in stitches. The early laugh made the rest of the ride easy. \r\nThe art was really well done. I loved the intro. The colours and framesreally set the tone for what you can expect. The character designs are very pretty and real easy on the marathoning eyes. All the girls are really cute, not in a 'chibi' type way, but more of a 'legit' way.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is good. I acquired it immediately afterwards. Loved the intro tracks to both and the background music was very fitting for all scenes. The voicing is excellent. They all match (looks vs sound). I love a show thats really well thought out across the board.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the best stories are all about the characters and their situations. This show was able to turn somebody's interesting situation into something very enjoyable. The characters are great and         you get very well acquainted as the series moves forward (yes 'forward!'). The smile I had after watching this show was well worth the day off.

True enough, I'm glad I was able to get a copy of the whole season 1...\r\nMain Characters: Sawako Kuronuma and Shouta Kazehaya\r\nStory: 8/10 - I can say that the storyline is more realistic than the other anime romances I've seen... it seemed more heartfelt... I'm glad that the writers did not rush the story, however, there was an \"arc\" that I did not particularly likeand this is the Kurumi rivalry arc... that was when I kinda got uninterested and watched a different movie... good thing it was saved by the Chizuru - Ryu - Tohru arc... it was also refreshing to get the guy's point of view (speaking for both Kazehaya and Ryu)... \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 - Sawako as \"Sadako\" is funny esp in chibi-japanese doll-form... it took quite a while for me to get used to her voice since it's too high pitched/breathy but once I was able to equate the voice with her personality, it became easier to bear... Kazehaya is cute and funny whenever he shares an \"embarassing moment\" with Sawako... though I did not really feel that he was given a story of his own... hmmm... Chizu, Ayane and Ryu were good supporting characters for the couple... I am glad that they were given ample screen time since they liven up the story...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 - very nice opening and ending songs... BG music for most part were romantic as well as dramatic... fits well with the scenes...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 - it would have been an 8 if only Kurumi was an interesting character... also, it seems that Sawako cries a lot and i mean a lot (may it be bcoz of joy or sadness)... but then again, her new feelings can be so overwhelming that anyone would cry...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 - it was a little slow-paced for me but like I said, it was realistic... not all courtships end in a span of 1yr... besides, the characters are only in high school (I think)...\\n\\n\r\nIt ended on a good and sweet note... here's hoping that the 2nd season will be much better...  :)\\n",

(trying not to write any spoilers)\r\nI think everyone who watched it knows what I'm talking about.\r\nThough I havent watched the second season yet I'm afraid that it will be thesame thing.\r\nBut I have to say that this anime was so romantic and sweet and makes you think about your own friends and how much you love them and how often you take them for granted,even the little things.\r\nIt's a nice animeto watch when you want to relax and laugh and say \"awwww\" allot :D\\n",
