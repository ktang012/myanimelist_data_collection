            "content": "Adaptation:Breaker\r\nTalk about a poor adaptation. After reading some of the manga, I was anticipating what this series could do when moved to the big stage aka. adapted into an anime. Not only does this series fail as an adaptation, but it fails as a stand-alone anime series. There were so many failures with this series that I don't even know where to begin. I guess let's start with the plot.\r\nThe plot itself is at least interesting. A select group of agents within the government, unbeknown to mankind with special abilities are hired to eliminate evil. This story follows one such agent who is assigned toprotect a \"rare breed\", someone who has the ability to nullify special abilities. In my opinion, it's a decent plot...but the story's progression was weak and stereotypical. As the story progressed, it made for the reveal and story behind Hitomi seem underplayed. That's where the characters come in and it's probably the biggest weakness of this series. \\n\\n\r\nSakura Sakurakouji is quite possibly the worst lead character I've ever seen...at the very least the worst in a shonen series. While it's understandable that she has a strong sense of justice, she takes it to a downright ridiculously stupid degree. Her beliefs and her actions are so boneheaded that I groaned at least once in every episode where she said or did something. While yes, I'm aware her righteous actions in the manga are a little over the top, the anime blew it FAR out of proportion. At least for the most part Rei Ogami stayed in character...sort of. While most of the other characters did stay in character, I found how they re-worked the introduction of these characters apart from the manga to be underwhelming. As I mentioned before, that brings forth the antagonist, Hitomi. His story seemed so stereotypical that he was just a boring villain. \\n\\n\r\nThe scriptwriting was some of the most lackluster I had EVER seen in an anime. In fact, I'll just come out and say that this might be some of the worst script work I have EVER seen in an anime. It's amazing that this is the work of Yasuhiro Irie because I applauded his efforts with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The only thing I can guess is perhaps Irie bit off more than he could chew with this project. He was handling the direction, the series composition, the script writing, and the storyboard. He's not an experienced script writer and it showed in this series. This series reeked of under-staffing and Kinema Citrus should be ashamed that they didn't put in a better effort when it came to staffing.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint with this series is I think it strayed way too far from the manga. The manga did a stronger job of executing character development, comedy writing, and dramatic tension. The small nuances and stories that Kinema Citrus decided to cut out from the manga slightly ruined the bonding the characters had in this series. While I know Kinema Citrus isn't exactly the biggest or strongest production company on the market, I think their handling of the Code:Breaker series was far too ambitious for them. Code:Breaker is a long-running manga series. It's the sort of series that needs to be tackled by a production company that can put out episodes on a weekly basis like Studio Perriot (and that's not a compliment of Studio Perriot's work). Trying to condense Code:Breaker's plot into a 12 episode season just isn't possible without ruining the story and characters in any way, shape, or form. The animation and music was nothing special. Nothing about it was really all that memorable, although I did like the OP and ED. I didn't love them or found them captivating, but they were catchy enough for me to like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's just a really poor adaptation. I'm not usually one who rips an anime for straying from it's predecessor but the problem is Code:Breaker did nothing for me as a stand-alone series to separate it from it's manga counterpart. Even looking at it from just an anime viewer's POV, it's a bland, boring, predictable, and stereotypical. It doesn't do anything to stand out, as an anime or an adaptation. If you're a fan of the Code:Breaker manga, I don't recommend watching this. If you do watch this anime and do like certain elements behind it, I would recommend giving the manga a chance. It's an entertaining read and was far better than this.",

            "content": "What is evil? \r\nIt can be describe as something wicked, malevolent, sinister, ill, or something which holds responsibility for the bad things that happen in this world. It's a four letter word that strikes fear, anxiety, and many other emotions. In the real world, people commit deeds through free will. Some of these are good deeds, while others are evil. In the Code Breaker world, there exists supernatural beings who are able to judge deeds (good/evil)  and carry out justice with an iron fist. \r\nRei Ogami: \u201cAn Eye for an Eye, a Tooth for a Tooth, and Evil for Evil\u201d\r\nWelcome to the world ofCode:Breaker.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is written by Akimine Kamijyo based off the manga of the same name who is also known for her previous work, Samurai Deeper Kyo. It all begins one day when Sakura, a local high school student, witnesses some blue flames like she's never ever seen before. Likewise, from there on and out, her life is changed forever. \\n\\n\r\nThe hero or maybe better seen as the anti-hero of Code:Breaker is Rei Ogami. He is the local bad boy with a tough attitude who does what he wants, when he wants, how he wants as long as it gets the job done. In his mind, there is no justice for evil and as he quotes one more time, \u201can eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and evil for evil\u201d. He expresses a darker side of \"justice\" similar to those more like a vengeance hero rather than some ally of justice like we see in pop culture.\\n\\n\r\nCode:Breaker doesn't avoid most of the cliches we see in most of today's themes. The common gag of 'boy meets girl' is employed but it doesn't just end there. Sakura Sakurakouji is portrayed as a school beauty and idol that is admirable by many of the students. Then, there's the mysterious transfer student Rei Ogami. Things like this is very common for anime viewers to see these days in the industry. To add on to this topping of cliches, there's an assumption that the two have a \u201cthing\u201d going on by nearly everyone at the entire school. They misunderstand their relationship and often misinterprets it as if the duo are dating.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there on and out, the two seems to have a strained relationship. In every way, Sakura tries to explain Ogami that killing others is \u201cwrong\u201d because it's the wrong thing to do. She strives to get her ideologies to Ogami in order to convince him to be a good hero and do the right thing. However, her words are often deaf to his ears as Ogami kills to protect others, at least in his point of view. At times, Ogami even expresses himself as evil and that in this world, in order to save lives, sacrifices are needed. He presents himself as not a hero in this case but rather as someone who is trying to do what he believes is \u201cright\u201d. The question here remains though:\\n\\n\r\nWould you kill to protect someone you care about?\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization of the other characters from the series is explored to a lesser degree although a few of them does stand out in particular of those associated with the Code:Breaker organization. Most if all of the Code Breakers has their own standard code of conduct (or rather their signature Code of Hammurabi) and coupled with them some supernatural abilities that makes them fearful of others. In fact, Code Breaker itself has become a term of both fear and hatred. \\n\\n\r\nThe Code Breakers themselves all have different personalities as well. Some are fun to watch such as the playful Yuuki Tenpouin while others are more straightforward and serious such as Rui Hachiouji. The most mysterious of the bunch are Masaomi Heike and Hitomi, two individuals who are very difficult to read. In fact, throughout the series they seem to be playing mind games with the other characters in particular Ogami. In the world of evil, there is injustice but in their eyes, they seem to represent evil themselves.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily for the ladies, this series presents some good bishonen sketch work. The characters' designs all possesses a sense of style by the way they dress, act, and presenting their ideas not through words but by their actions. Most of the time, they engage in what they do best and that's to deliver \u201cjustice\u201d to evil. At other times, they seem to be chilling around like ordinary people despite their feared status. \\n\\n\r\nThe series' theme itself also becomes a sense of philosophy. What exactly is evil and how it is defined? More importantly, how do we take actions against it? These questions often become ambiguous and may never have a direct answer. Nonetheless, the blue flame executed by Ogami  seems to serve itself as a metaphor in which criminals are terminated by being burned to actions. Similar to how an individual goes to hell for wrong deeds, the flame itself manifests as a tool to destroy those who are evil, or at least those who are considered so under the eyes of the Code Breakers.\\n\\n\r\nIn the artwork department, everything seems quite generic. Most if not all the characters have the same design with different colored hair styles to match their themes. While pleasing to the female audience, it can become a bothersome after seeing it so many times. The backgrounds itself is just normal with nothing that really stand out as the setting is set in present time rather than a futuristic dystopia. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks of the series is presented with mixed rhythms shifting from comedic, to action, to violence, and to mystery. The opening song, \"DARK SHAME\" by GRANRODEO has a rock beat and orchestrated with a montage of the main characters. From the song, a viewer can see some of the potential action and even foreshadowing of some events. It doesn't stop there though as it shows some of the violence in various scenes that are mostly presented by Ogami and his blue flames. As cliched as it sounds, the song does work effectively so no shame there.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Code:Breaker is a package of an action series that deals with the world of evil. It is cliched at many times especially with whole 'girl meets boy on a mysterious night' setting, the school life drama, the shounen like battles, and secret organizations. The drama and comedy also seems to be a bit forced  as often times or not, they occur out of nowhere and tries to bring the audience a good laugh. It works sometimes but at other times just seems awkward. The series is just slightly above mediocre  with the good premise and ideas but still contains too many overused tropes. However, if you're looking for some action packed thriller sequences with dark heroes, then C:B might be for you.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nNOTE: This is my first review at MAL, so please bear with me. Also, I haven\u2019t read the manga AT ALL, and I don\u2019t know if the manga\u2019s story is similar to the anime\u2019s. Consider this as a point of view of someone who just watched the anime. There are some spoilers along the way to explain my point in the review, so read at your own risk. :)\r\nI remembered watching the first few episodes of Code:Breaker (together with a few more anime) when it was still being aired last year. I got curious since I thought, \u201cHey another super power-themed shonen anime! Cool!\u201dAfter watching those few episodes, I stopped watching it and simply waited for the series to finish since I got tired of waiting for a new episode, which was released weekly.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching the last episodes of Code:Breaker,  I got disappointed to this anime due to various reasons, but mainly I got disappointed because of the plot.  Well, it started good, but how the series ended is just bland and generic. Perhaps most of us (if not all of us) have seen a story with a character betraying the good guys, working for the bad guy, and then in the end, betraying that bad guy and saying that he has been in league with the good guys all along. Well, we have that kind of clich\u00e9 here. How about the Big Bad showing up after the bad guy gets defeated? We also have it here. The great presentation made at the start of the story was wasted by how they ended this series, which is clich\u00e9-filled, and done in a bad way at that. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing here is the characterization of, well, the characters, which doesn\u2019t seem real and human enough for me, and it shows more as the series progresses. Come on, someone who really IS evil doesn\u2019t say he\u2019s evil; rather, he would say that he\u2019s the hero of justice (or something like that). Besides that, there are also some dialogues in this anime that I find weird and/or just simply wrong. And being an adaptation of a manga, the series\u2019 ending is rather inconclusive, since 1) the manga is not yet finished and, 2) the adaptation is only 13 episodes long, which is very short. What I find wrong about its ending is that it never left me wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, the anime isn\u2019t all bad points and no good points at all. Just as I said earlier, the way the story was presented in the beginning was great, with a certain number of people with superpowers (called Code:Breakers) are working for the government to eliminate (i.e.; kill) people that the government sees as evil. The character designs are also great, although the design for the Code:Breakers have varying touches of bishounen-ness in them. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a groundbreaking new anime, this certainly is NOT it. Maybe if you haven\u2019t watched a lot of superpower-themed anime, you might enjoy this.  Just \u201cmight\u201d, though.",

It's got a good visual quality, some nice characters (in my case I liked Ogami and Yuuki most) and nicely choreographed battle scenes.\r\nThe balance and the dynamic between Humor, Action and a little bit drama is done wonderfully and keeps the audiences attention, throughout the anime, \"upright\" ;) \r\nThe little problem tough is how this anime has been set out so far. I don'treally like the ending. I mean, everything before was done very nicely and I did enjoy it - that's why my expectations grew over the time while I was watching C:B. But the end can be compared to a crash with another car - suddenly, unexpected, fast, ... finish...\\n\r\nThey should have done at least 3 to 5 episodes more, just to give us a better end and more screen time for the remaining 3 code breakers.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I can recommend it to everyone because I believe it's worth watching \u00ect!\\n",

It is true that there are only 4 episodes yet but if we consider the fact that this anime is going to have only 13 episodes, these 4 episodes are enough to give a fair opinion of it. Rei has the power of burning people with his flame and without hesistation he kills people- they are either evil or criminal people- as if lighting his cigarette but he is still a very cool and likeable character. He leaves the impression that there is a reason behind all his cruel way of killing and whiledoing so, he is not depicted like an emo or a drama queen. Instead, he keeps his cool attitude whatever the circumstances are. \\n\r\nAs much as Rei, Toki is also very interesting character. With his involvement in the series, the dark heavy air is dispersed. In fact, he kinda balances the heavy and dark air Rei rises.  Especially, if you are a keen on both comedy and supernatural, you'll enjoy the parts where Toki appears. \\n\r\nSakura is the type of annoying girl who butts in Rei's business on every possible occasion but I think Rei likes her company and is curious about her as he believes she is the rare species. With Toki's coming to the stage, Rei will probably be more closer to Sakura. They would make an interesting couple.\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime has a great potential and I really enjoy watching it. I only wish it had 25 or 26 episodes instead of 13 so that the remaining 3 code breakers would have a fair place in the series.",

Sadly there are a bit too many filler scenes (and chapters) that would be expected from a Anime that will have 50+ chapter, but with only 13 Code:Breaker is on the short side and spends too much time developingcharacters and locations (like the highschool) that end up having no relevance to the main story.\\n\r\nAs for the rest, it's fairly entertaining and does pick up towards the end but never really leaves the generic side of anime story or setting.\\n\r\nAlso be warned that it's open ended with a clear indication to a sequel, but I guess that will depend on how popular it is and how well it is recieved.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art and animation are quite average for a weekly Anime. Not look too bad but nothing stands out and some of the CGI effects used on some powers look a bit cheap and ugly. The animation is fine for the most part although some fights feel a bit underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing to complain here. The OST does not stand out but fits good enough with the mood and style of Code Breaker and personally I found the voice acting solid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMy biggest complain with Code Breaker is in this area as I really found the mian female character to be really, really annoying. She seems to have little relevance to the story, has absolutely no evolution and for the most part seems to be there only annoy the viewers.\\n\r\nBecause of some traumatic event in her past (which is never revealed ,BTW) she seems to be obssesed with protecting people and not letting anyone get hurt... and in a story about people with powers that KILL criminals this is a bad thing as we have to hear her screen and complain about this every single episode. What is worse is that the story makes a good point as to why this criminals have to die, the story makes focus on explaining that they can't be arrested or captured by regular authorities and it also shows them off as evil, sadistic people that deserve to die... yet many of the chapters are filled by scenes of the \"heroine\" talking to Ogami, the main character, about how he can't  kill people and how it's wrong. And yeah, it also doesen't help that half here lines in the 13 episodes are repedely screaming Ogami's Name (and I really whish I would be exagerating... but I'm not).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEven with all generic story and annoying characer, I have to say that it's still fairly entertaining show.... just aproach it as something to sit back and relax for 20 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nOVerall Score 6",

Anyone that has watched the fighting scene betweenIchigo and Grimmjow in Bleach will remember how annoying Orihime was by repeating  non-stop \"kurosaki-kun\", well, the girl from code breaker is far worse and she does it in every chapter of the 13. The rest of the characters are kinda meh, nothing to say about them, they are not as annoying and the girl but they dont add much, even the male protagonist is a meh character, he's just a cool guy who kills bad people, he doesnt even talk too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really non-sense. to be fair the premises arent bad, some people with incredible powers erradicating evil. its not great but its ok. But the thing that makes the story so bad is the  plan of the villain and why  he is trying to do  such evil thing. i dont want to spoil anything to anybody, but i will just say it is retarded. he is trying to obtain something by doing actions that doesnt make any sense and even if he succeded in his plan i am not able to understand or grasp how it would benefit him in obtaining his goal. let me put an example to explain myself: imagine you want a new car, but you cant have it, instead of working, or stealing it from the shop or whatever it takes to get the car, you go killing  owners of the car you originally wanted. remember your main objective, you wanted a new car, so why would you benefit by killing people?Exactly it doesnt make any sense, and Code Breaker Plot is something similar to this, im not kidding, its dumb.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair the art is not that bad, though some guys looks seem to belong to a shoujo manga, but its okay i guess, and the animations during some battles are good though i should say the battles themselves are not very interesting or epic.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this, Code Breaker a very dissapointing anime, with the worst character i've seen in almost any anime and a plot that is absurd. I am really sad....\\n",

This is really just an educated opinion concerning a possible direction for the anime, but I'll just have to wait to see if I'm right or not. \r\nAnyway, the coolest aspect is that the protagonist, Sakura Sakurakouji has already focused on Rei Ogami as her own personal antagonist. The dynamic this implies just sets the stage for conflict between the two main actors through out the series. With Reihaving to monitor Sakura and Sakura monitoring Rei, for her own personal reasons, plenty of trouble is bound to ensue. \\n\\n\r\nRei's job makes the story interesting in that as an assassin does he really have any morality left. The dark persona displayed in his job life and the good persona portrayed in school are defining traits for a skilled assassin but it calls into question which is his real state of being. This for me makes me want to watch it, plus the interjection of Sakura into his world\\n\r\nis like the icing on the cake because it just throws a virtual monkey wrench into his plans.\\n\\n\r\nWith seemingly spot on voice acting, good graphical quality, and possibly really good dynamic interaction, I'm definitely keeping my eye on this anime. Let's hope it doesn't disappoint. I recommend this one as a good one to check out.",

            "content": "This anime had a lot of potential, but for me its biggest flaw was how it handled its female characters, particularly the lead, Sakura. This review may have mild spoilers so don't read it if you intend to watch the anime.\r\n1. It's frustrating to see a teenage girl THIS oblivious and idealistic in today's world. All that comes out other mouth are the words - please, stop, I beg you, you are wrong, don't do this, no, blah blah blah. I'm assuming her role was to act as the moral compass to Code Breaker 6's staunch ideals, but she only came across as a whiny,useless teenage girl.\\n\\n\r\n2. She is trained in martial arts and yet her best weapons are her tears. All she does is cry and beg for evil people to NOT be killed. Wow.\\n\\n\r\n3. The man:woman ratio. In a world where half the population is female, this anime had only 3 female characters. And let me sum up these women for you-\\n\r\nSakura the wimp\\n\r\nSakura's mom who could have easily been her younger sister, what with her huge breasts and tiny waist\\n\r\n6's assistant, who also had big breasts and wore tiny mini skirts to her job and did everything in heels.\\n\\n\r\nSo essentially, the women were nothing but stereotypical props put there to please men. They could have easily been replaced by men, or better yet, could have their existence erased from the anime and nobody would have even noticed it.\\n\\n\r\n4. Stereotyping women. Is this really what shounen anime and mangas are all about? No wonder young boys believe that women should be meek, submissive and have impossibly big breasts. People say porn gives men impossible expectations, but I'd say manga like Code: Breaker easily beat porn to it. \\n\\n\r\n5. I hated how sexual assault is downplayed as \"harmless\" playfulness. When 4 grope's Sakura's breasts (TWICE) he does get a beating but not once does she say that it is WRONG of him to touch her without her CONSENT. This is a recurring theme I've seen in many shounen anime - sexual assault is okay, and women only either blush or slap you in exchange. And then everything is normal again, because that is exactly how it is in real life\\n\r\n*sarcasm*\\n\\n\r\nDeeply saddened to see HOW women are portrayed, and how few of them even exist in shounen anime. They have 3 primary purposes it would seem -\\n\r\nLoving and caring mothers or elder sisters\\n\r\nGirlfriend/meek, sweet woman\\n\r\nHot woman who fights her way through but eventually ends up falling for the man anyway.\\n\\n\r\nDisappointed.\\n",

            "content": "Code Breaker is not about Java security breaches but rather about a Japanese version of X-Men, cast with bishounen guys and a female version of Touma from Toaru Majutsu no Index. Basically, there are a great deal of children with \"special abilities\", which the government takes care of. The most powerful of these ability users are turned into 007-type agents that do the bidding of the Prime Minister, unbeknownst to the greater Japanese population. Our protagonist, Sakura, one day discovers one of these \"code breakers\" in action as he kills some unimportant fodder characters. Will her investigations lead her down a path of disaster?\r\nThe ideaof elemental super-humans is nothing new, explored in other shows like K and, more thoroughly, in the Toaru series. While the huge bishounen to female ratio is different, this only adds further questions to the show's purpose and target demographic. While the pretty-boy to girl ratio might seem to hint shoujo, don't expect any semblance of relationships here- it's all about calling out pointless catchphrases and battles. The plot is mildly entertaining but builds to a climax that just doesn't make sense. Not in the way of K's \"there's some crazy s**t going on here\" but in the illogical reasoning of the antagonist. Some may argue that this would have been better if it were longer but I'd say I'm pretty glad it's over. Unless you love action and are too young to use reason, please do yourself a favor and watch something else.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIn general. the animation is fairly good. There's good detail, shadowing, and color balance. Character designs are unique and emotions (or lack thereof) are conveyed appropriately. However, combined with the plot, certain elements don't seem to mesh. For instance, you'll see Sakura getting pummeled (kicked in the face & body repeatedly) yet two minutes later she's walking fine with no bruises. Not to mention the special abilities themselves, which makes Dragonball appear scientifically sound, relatively speaking. Think you know chemistry? Ice vs fire? Forget it as here willpower and shouting determines which \"element\" wins.\\n\\n\r\nThis is ultimately a shonen show with lots of fighting and no fan service (unless you count Sakura's weird mother who constantly cosplays as a schoolgirl). Expect a lot of fighting and a lot of special effects.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show opens with a techno-heavy rock piece, but the dude almost makes it feel shoujo appropriate. The ED reminds me a bit of some of Naruto's EDs, standard rock fare. More unique is the BGM, which is almost always on during the show. I'd go as far to say that BGM is overused in this show, as if they're afraid you'd lose attention if they stopped.\\n\\n\r\nVAs do a fair job but are limited by the script and, well, lack of unique characterization in general.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe show follows Sakura as she shadows the cool, calculating, and emotionless Rei Oogami- supposedly trying to stop him from killing other people. Despite her moral cries of \"there must be a better way\", nothing is ever proposed and she basically ends up as a spectator to the works of the Code Breakers. The central plot line is indeed contiguous, but it is also riddled with unanswered questions and fallacies that end up ruining the show for those of us who have a brain. All the seemingly isolated terrorist events and killings eventually get linked to a single individual, and then the show builds to a predictable climax encounter that is resolved in just about the worst possible way, that is other than the Mass Effect 3 ending.\\n\\n\r\nYou get the impression that Code Breaker was going for something deep (moral questions, government conspiracy, etc.) but it ends up all feeling shallow and not terribly thought out. For instance, there are only six Code Breakers at a time. Why only six when they show literally hundreds of special ability children? Also, the support organization for the Breakers, Eden, seems to employ just about every other person in Japan so it seems that the general \"populace\" isn't as ignorant as suggested. In the end, this show ends up somewhere between K and Zetman. Not as baffling as the former and not as outright disappointing as the latter. While Code Breaker has decent action, the reasons behind it is underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSakura reminds me of other shoujo female leads (think Special A & Maid Sama). She's apparently every guy's crush at school and academically/physically gifted, though I find it odd that no one realizes that she's a child of basically a yakuza family. She's definitely labeled as \"slow when it comes to love\" as her actions make everyone else think she likes Oogami, when in fact she obviously has no interest in any guy. Both Sakura and Oogami have bewildering moral beliefs, Sakura will put herself at risk to help others while Oogami is on a crusade against \"evil\", whatever he thinks that is. So what character development can we expect here? Oogami goes from trying to kill Sakura repeatedly to being her bodyguard at the government's request. Yes, at the government's request. He himself shows little if any interest in Sakura's well-being.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, you'll find very cold relationships between practically everyone in this show. Confusingly, at times the code breakers act like a well-oiled team. Yet at other times they themselves claim that they almost always act solo. Ultimately, all the characters are given cookie-cutter personalities and are in general impossible to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThe greatest value in this show is finding all the inconsistencies in the directing, presentation, and story. The story itself a mess that isn't worth telling and the characters might as well be amoeba. If you're not particularly desperate for a bit of action, steer clear.",

            "content": "If you like original, innovative anime with dynamic characters and complex storylines, turn away now. Turn away and don\u2019t look back. However, if you\u2019re looking for something with super-powered, angsty pretty boys and rather cool fight scenes, you might want to give this a try.\r\nBy far, Code:Breaker is the most generic anime I\u2019ve ever seen, and its start is much rougher than its conclusion. For the first 5 or 6 episodes, I had this anime pinned as a 4. The two main characters, a Mary Sue and a clich\u00e9, angst-ridden teenage boy, were the perfect broken record duo. Every fight turned into a bland, depthlessargument between whiny Sakura and expressionless Ogami. \u201cDon\u2019t kill this man!\u201d says Sakura. \u201cBut I\u2019m evil,\u201d says Ogami, and incinerates the man\u2019s head. \u201cOh, well then don\u2019t kill THAT man!\u201d says Sakura. \u201cBut I\u2019m evil.\u201d Ad. Nauseum. \\n\\n\r\nThe only saving grace of the anime came in the later episodes, with the slightly more interesting other Code:Breakers and the steady break-down of Ogami\u2019s heartlessness. The save wasn\u2019t amazing, but it made the series watchable despite its flaws. I remember being genuinely excited maybe once or twice.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The concept has a lot of potential that simply fell flat. \u201cCode:Breakers\u201d are government agents who do the politicians\u2019 dirty work. They all have special abilities, and were recruited due to their uniqueness. The main conflict has an X-men-esque taste of mutant super humans wanting to be recognized in society. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t explore this any further than that. Code:Breakers want recognition, government won\u2019t give it to them. The end?\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, each arc was generic. Generic bad guys, generic reason for being evil, generic take down, move on. The fights were well-animated, and the Code:Breakers\u2019 special abilities made the fights at least interesting to watch. On the whole, nothing special. The final fight with the \u201cbig bad\u201d Hitomi, an ex-Code:Breaker, was more interesting, if not for it being bogged down by Hitomi\u2019s motive making no sense. More on that later.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh god\u2026where to start? Well the main character Sakura is one of the most useless main characters to come out in recent history. She is perfect in every way, the beauty of the school whom literally EVERY guy chases. She opens her locker every day to find it stuffed with love letters. A Mary Sue start is never good, and Sakura never redeems herself. She preaches non-violence like it\u2019s going out of style, but never with a good reason. Moral characters can be interesting, usually depending on their motives and backstories for being so moral. Sakura, though, has none of these. If I had a dime for every time she said \u201cKilling is wrong!\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t kill people!\u201d I\u2019d be a very rich person. It\u2019s vaguely hinted that she experienced violence in the past, but it\u2019s never built on. She\u2019s a depthless foil to Ogami\u2019s cool, collected murder. This senseless, shallow morality of hers wouldn\u2019t be half as annoying if she were of any use. Unfortunately for her, she\u2019s not super-powered. She can only sit in the background whining about killing while Ogami sets everyone on fire.\\n\\n\r\nOgami. I\u2019ve been trying to avoid using any internet lingo in this review, but he is the perfect representation of a \u201c2edgy4me\u201d character. For those unfamiliar with the term, he is a character who tries to be dark, mysterious, and edgy simply for the sake of being dark, mysterious, and edgy. Most of his actions serve no purpose other than to show \u201cWow, Ogami will do edgy stuff!\u201d Sakura is guilty of egging this on, since most of her broken-record complaints serve as fodder prompting Ogami to dive into a monologue about why he must be dark and edgy. He claims to be evil for no real reason. He claims to be inhuman for no real reason. At the end of the day, he\u2019s just a super-powered boy who\u2019s been hired to kill bad guys, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys are, if anything, worse than Ogami and Sakura. They\u2019re perhaps more tolerable because they never stick around long, but for the short time they\u2019re around, they suck.  The prime minister in charge of the Code:Breakers is as two dimensional as it gets. He\u2019s the man just there to piss off Sakura with level-headed speeches about how unimportant the lives of Code:Breakers are. He\u2019s also the character who doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019s been defeated. He transitions instantly from wetting his pants in sheer terror (since he\u2019s hanging over the edge of a 100-story building) to mocking the Code:Breaker who saved him for being \u201ctoo soft.\u201d The villains have the most potential for depth, since many of their twisted mindsets for doing evil are downright fascinating. For this bad guy, he\u2019s evil for the sake of evil, depthless, and cold for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nEvery other goon is as generically evil as possible. They abuse super-powered children because edgy bad guys do that. They kick dogs because that\u2019s what edgy bad guys do. They never seem to have any motive for the time they\u2019re on screen. They simply gloat about their evilness and dick around until Ogami incinerates their heads. All the while Sakura begs Ogami to spare them. Lather, rinse, repeat. The big bad Hitomi is more interesting, considering his fleshed out character. He is an ex-Code:Breaker, who loved protecting his friends and citizens like nothing else. That is, until he discovered Code:Breakers eventually self-destruct from using their powers. At this point, he decides it\u2019s a good idea to flee, plant bombs around Japan, and kill 50,000 people so that Japan will be forced to recognize the Code:Breakers who protect them. WHAT?\\n\\n\r\nLuckily the other characters save the cast from being complete crap. Toki, who has the rather generic motivation of \u201cprotecting his sister\u201d, at least has more depth than most of the lot, since he tries to hide this fact. Most of the other Code:Breakers in the cast have enough depth to be tolerable, and Sakura\u2019s parents are decently entertaining. The Sakura fanboys, though, could definitely have been left out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I won\u2019t lie, the art is nice. The animation, for the most part, is smooth. The fights are well-executed, and the boys are all very, VERY pretty. Code:Breaker is eye candy: the anime. I\u2019d be tempted to say that the art makes Ogami the perfect guilty-pleasure character, essentially the Sasuke of the series. In summation: pretty boys, cool fights.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: This will be short, because I never really noticed the music throughout the show. It was certainly not bad, but nothing of note stood out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: about a 6/10. It was saved from a lower rating by the slightly interesting side characters, cool fights, and semi-decent backstory for the big bad. Ogami\u2019s cold shell starts to melt around the seventh episode, which saved his character from being completely static. The change wasn\u2019t too drastic, but it helped. Working against it, of course, are the poorly executed plot-line and the depthless, annoying main characters. At the beginning, I watched it because it was fun to make fun of it. Toward the end, I watched because of its redeeming qualities. At no point was in unwatchable, but certainly not something that was ever impressive. However, if angsty pretty boys are your guilty pleasure, and you like super-powered fighting scenes, Code:Breaker might be worth a shot.   \\n",

            "content": "Code: Breaker kind of bothers me, I've been pondering for 5 minutes on how to start this review but with all my thoughts and ideas I can't even fathom a way to make this opening paragraph seem enticing to the reader. You might be thinking that this is because of lazy writing or that I'm not on my A-game because I barely have the time or enthusiasm to write these anymore. But.. It's not that. No, the reason I can't say anything for this anime in my aimless opening paragraph is simply because this anime is so average. So mediocre. So normal. That's not tosay it's bad. I'm hardly ready to grab my torch and pitch-fork over the 13 episodes I was exposed to, but I am ready to give you a long sigh and a little insight as to why I find Code: Breaker so hard to praise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\r\nThe World of Code: Breaker is somewhat typical. In fact, now that I think about it, many anime seem to follow a \"red pill, blue pill\" format and this is no exception. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't understand my Matrix reference then let me enlighten you by tying it into what happens in Code: Breaker. We have our young MC living a normal life until one day a mysterious person enters the mix with powers that should only be possible by the system admin. From this point forward our beloved MC is thrust into a world of mystery and corruption, being told that she has \"lifted the veil\" in a way, exposing herself to the true world around her. This is what I mean by \"red pill, blue pill\" and its sadly overused in the anime genre.\\n\\n\r\nI feel as if introducing a newbie to the group is the easiest way to start a story and it also happens to be the most popular. Which is why I find it extremely insulting when by the end credits you realise she didn't really do anything. Sure she blocked a few potshots but the story heavily implied that the MC is extremely important and we only know that when the story tells us that because most of the time her only job is to play constant devils-advocate to people who really couldn't give a sh*t. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the later story is nothing special. A typical \"stop the terrorists\" plot except with the epic twist that the leader is everyone's old mentor.... I don't know about you but a twist like keeps the plot as straight as a ruler... actually its not even a twist, but it was supposed to make the story more interesting, which it failed to do... mainly because we don't know anyone.\\n\\n\r\nTldr; I have two words for you, Generic and average.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\r\nNot really much to be said about this. The art was pretty standard and the only reason I'm boosting it up to a 7 was because of the sharp and interesting portrayal of the Code: Breakers powers.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound? Nothing really stood out. I say this a lot in my reviews but this time I mean it in a different way. If you listen to the soundtracks of  Bleach, Fairy Tail, FullMetal: Alchemist, The Seven Deadly Sins and others then you'll find that every epic moment or sad moment is complimented by an eruption of sound that almost dominates the atmosphere. In Code: Breakers, I barely even noticed that there was sound besides when people spoke... I won't go as far to say that the music was bad... It just didn't compliment anything.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nLemme be honest with you, I didn't find this anime by browsing the catalogue or going on Reddit. I was looking specifically for an anime with a badass protagonist. After looking around and asking a few people I decided that this would probably be the one for me. I was wrong. Oogami was supposed to be a badass and I suppose, in a way, he is but I simply can't get over how boring the motherf*cker is. He isn't witty, he isn't funny, hell, he isn't really that talkative. He just walks around and turns on his blow-torch when he gets pissed off. Meh.\\n\\n\r\nBy far my favourite character was Heike as he actually had some interesting uses of his powers besides \"throwing them at people\". There is, of course, his horribly over emphasised posh-boy attitude which I don't really mind as his wits and actions kind of justify them. There was also Tenpouin, who has always seemed half asleep and somewhat deluded. Not sure why I liked him, he just seemed different.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest, they were pretty normal, the perfect midpoint between the boring oven-light and the cat-person... can't really sing much praise but at the same time I can't disregard them as worse than average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nWhat can I say... If I can direct your attention to my first paragraph in which I said that this anime was average, you can probably guess what I would say in this section. Although I did enjoy the process of watching it more than I did looking back on it when I was done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion - \\n\r\nCode: Breakers is far from a waste of time, In fact, I recommend that you watch it. Its perfectly ok television to watch, I simply wouldn't put any aspect of it on a top 10 list. Which is one mistake that Orzzzz.com made on their \"Top 10 short anime with badass main character\" list, which I found... and read... and then decided to watch Code: Breakers because of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo well done Code: Breakers, you got the first ever honourary MEH award. Wear it with pride.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

But for those who already masters the world of anime, this is, as harsh as it might sound, rubbish. \r\nPlot: 4\r\nSo the plot at first is interesting though lacks of originality but as the story progresses, it becomes downright cliche to the point that I cringe. I'm not even joking. It's so, so, predictable. The boring villains? You have it in this anime. The cold and cool protagonist? All's here for you. All the anime cliches' it's all here, no doubt. \r\nCharacterization: 1\r\nWhere do I even begin?Oh lord. Again, so cliche and annoying. \\n\\n\r\nSakurakouji Sakura, I despise her character. I know that despise is a strong word to use but it matches how I honestly feel about her character. She's like your typical anime/fanfic girl that's overly famous despite her average look, good in sports and studies and have tones of fans at school. She's annoying, pathetic, weak; all the negative adjective goes to her. She refuse to see people got hurt and die but all she does is beg for it to stop instead of using her special pyhsical abilities. As smart as she is claimed to be, she is clueless in love, which again, so, so, cliche. You'll understand why I hate her so much after watching this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOgami: Three words; Cliche, pathetic and weak. His character doesn't develop well. \\n\\n\r\nHitomi: Your typical villain. \\n\\n\r\nThere's more characters and all of them are weak, I dare say. If I must choose a favourite character in here, I'll choose Yuuki, the supporting role in this anime. He's not original too, true but at least it's fun watching his scenes. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said again, this might be enjoyable for anime newbies, but for me, a person who has lived and breathed anime 24/7, this is crap. \\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga but I heard it's way better than the adaptation. I will proceed with the manga instead of continuing with the anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 3/10 (just because I do enjoy the bishonen characters and Yuuki's funny parts, that's all)\\n",

            "content": "Adaptation:Breaker\r\nTalk about a poor adaptation. After reading some of the manga, I was anticipating what this series could do when moved to the big stage aka. adapted into an anime. Not only does this series fail as an adaptation, but it fails as a stand-alone anime series. There were so many failures with this series that I don't even know where to begin. I guess let's start with the plot.\r\nThe plot itself is at least interesting. A select group of agents within the government, unbeknown to mankind with special abilities are hired to eliminate evil. This story follows one such agent who is assigned toprotect a \"rare breed\", someone who has the ability to nullify special abilities. In my opinion, it's a decent plot...but the story's progression was weak and stereotypical. As the story progressed, it made for the reveal and story behind Hitomi seem underplayed. That's where the characters come in and it's probably the biggest weakness of this series. \\n\\n\r\nSakura Sakurakouji is quite possibly the worst lead character I've ever seen...at the very least the worst in a shonen series. While it's understandable that she has a strong sense of justice, she takes it to a downright ridiculously stupid degree. Her beliefs and her actions are so boneheaded that I groaned at least once in every episode where she said or did something. While yes, I'm aware her righteous actions in the manga are a little over the top, the anime blew it FAR out of proportion. At least for the most part Rei Ogami stayed in character...sort of. While most of the other characters did stay in character, I found how they re-worked the introduction of these characters apart from the manga to be underwhelming. As I mentioned before, that brings forth the antagonist, Hitomi. His story seemed so stereotypical that he was just a boring villain. \\n\\n\r\nThe scriptwriting was some of the most lackluster I had EVER seen in an anime. In fact, I'll just come out and say that this might be some of the worst script work I have EVER seen in an anime. It's amazing that this is the work of Yasuhiro Irie because I applauded his efforts with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The only thing I can guess is perhaps Irie bit off more than he could chew with this project. He was handling the direction, the series composition, the script writing, and the storyboard. He's not an experienced script writer and it showed in this series. This series reeked of under-staffing and Kinema Citrus should be ashamed that they didn't put in a better effort when it came to staffing.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint with this series is I think it strayed way too far from the manga. The manga did a stronger job of executing character development, comedy writing, and dramatic tension. The small nuances and stories that Kinema Citrus decided to cut out from the manga slightly ruined the bonding the characters had in this series. While I know Kinema Citrus isn't exactly the biggest or strongest production company on the market, I think their handling of the Code:Breaker series was far too ambitious for them. Code:Breaker is a long-running manga series. It's the sort of series that needs to be tackled by a production company that can put out episodes on a weekly basis like Studio Perriot (and that's not a compliment of Studio Perriot's work). Trying to condense Code:Breaker's plot into a 12 episode season just isn't possible without ruining the story and characters in any way, shape, or form. The animation and music was nothing special. Nothing about it was really all that memorable, although I did like the OP and ED. I didn't love them or found them captivating, but they were catchy enough for me to like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's just a really poor adaptation. I'm not usually one who rips an anime for straying from it's predecessor but the problem is Code:Breaker did nothing for me as a stand-alone series to separate it from it's manga counterpart. Even looking at it from just an anime viewer's POV, it's a bland, boring, predictable, and stereotypical. It doesn't do anything to stand out, as an anime or an adaptation. If you're a fan of the Code:Breaker manga, I don't recommend watching this. If you do watch this anime and do like certain elements behind it, I would recommend giving the manga a chance. It's an entertaining read and was far better than this.",

            "content": "What is evil? \r\nIt can be describe as something wicked, malevolent, sinister, ill, or something which holds responsibility for the bad things that happen in this world. It's a four letter word that strikes fear, anxiety, and many other emotions. In the real world, people commit deeds through free will. Some of these are good deeds, while others are evil. In the Code Breaker world, there exists supernatural beings who are able to judge deeds (good/evil)  and carry out justice with an iron fist. \r\nRei Ogami: \u201cAn Eye for an Eye, a Tooth for a Tooth, and Evil for Evil\u201d\r\nWelcome to the world ofCode:Breaker.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is written by Akimine Kamijyo based off the manga of the same name who is also known for her previous work, Samurai Deeper Kyo. It all begins one day when Sakura, a local high school student, witnesses some blue flames like she's never ever seen before. Likewise, from there on and out, her life is changed forever. \\n\\n\r\nThe hero or maybe better seen as the anti-hero of Code:Breaker is Rei Ogami. He is the local bad boy with a tough attitude who does what he wants, when he wants, how he wants as long as it gets the job done. In his mind, there is no justice for evil and as he quotes one more time, \u201can eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and evil for evil\u201d. He expresses a darker side of \"justice\" similar to those more like a vengeance hero rather than some ally of justice like we see in pop culture.\\n\\n\r\nCode:Breaker doesn't avoid most of the cliches we see in most of today's themes. The common gag of 'boy meets girl' is employed but it doesn't just end there. Sakura Sakurakouji is portrayed as a school beauty and idol that is admirable by many of the students. Then, there's the mysterious transfer student Rei Ogami. Things like this is very common for anime viewers to see these days in the industry. To add on to this topping of cliches, there's an assumption that the two have a \u201cthing\u201d going on by nearly everyone at the entire school. They misunderstand their relationship and often misinterprets it as if the duo are dating.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there on and out, the two seems to have a strained relationship. In every way, Sakura tries to explain Ogami that killing others is \u201cwrong\u201d because it's the wrong thing to do. She strives to get her ideologies to Ogami in order to convince him to be a good hero and do the right thing. However, her words are often deaf to his ears as Ogami kills to protect others, at least in his point of view. At times, Ogami even expresses himself as evil and that in this world, in order to save lives, sacrifices are needed. He presents himself as not a hero in this case but rather as someone who is trying to do what he believes is \u201cright\u201d. The question here remains though:\\n\\n\r\nWould you kill to protect someone you care about?\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization of the other characters from the series is explored to a lesser degree although a few of them does stand out in particular of those associated with the Code:Breaker organization. Most if all of the Code Breakers has their own standard code of conduct (or rather their signature Code of Hammurabi) and coupled with them some supernatural abilities that makes them fearful of others. In fact, Code Breaker itself has become a term of both fear and hatred. \\n\\n\r\nThe Code Breakers themselves all have different personalities as well. Some are fun to watch such as the playful Yuuki Tenpouin while others are more straightforward and serious such as Rui Hachiouji. The most mysterious of the bunch are Masaomi Heike and Hitomi, two individuals who are very difficult to read. In fact, throughout the series they seem to be playing mind games with the other characters in particular Ogami. In the world of evil, there is injustice but in their eyes, they seem to represent evil themselves.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily for the ladies, this series presents some good bishonen sketch work. The characters' designs all possesses a sense of style by the way they dress, act, and presenting their ideas not through words but by their actions. Most of the time, they engage in what they do best and that's to deliver \u201cjustice\u201d to evil. At other times, they seem to be chilling around like ordinary people despite their feared status. \\n\\n\r\nThe series' theme itself also becomes a sense of philosophy. What exactly is evil and how it is defined? More importantly, how do we take actions against it? These questions often become ambiguous and may never have a direct answer. Nonetheless, the blue flame executed by Ogami  seems to serve itself as a metaphor in which criminals are terminated by being burned to actions. Similar to how an individual goes to hell for wrong deeds, the flame itself manifests as a tool to destroy those who are evil, or at least those who are considered so under the eyes of the Code Breakers.\\n\\n\r\nIn the artwork department, everything seems quite generic. Most if not all the characters have the same design with different colored hair styles to match their themes. While pleasing to the female audience, it can become a bothersome after seeing it so many times. The backgrounds itself is just normal with nothing that really stand out as the setting is set in present time rather than a futuristic dystopia. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks of the series is presented with mixed rhythms shifting from comedic, to action, to violence, and to mystery. The opening song, \"DARK SHAME\" by GRANRODEO has a rock beat and orchestrated with a montage of the main characters. From the song, a viewer can see some of the potential action and even foreshadowing of some events. It doesn't stop there though as it shows some of the violence in various scenes that are mostly presented by Ogami and his blue flames. As cliched as it sounds, the song does work effectively so no shame there.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Code:Breaker is a package of an action series that deals with the world of evil. It is cliched at many times especially with whole 'girl meets boy on a mysterious night' setting, the school life drama, the shounen like battles, and secret organizations. The drama and comedy also seems to be a bit forced  as often times or not, they occur out of nowhere and tries to bring the audience a good laugh. It works sometimes but at other times just seems awkward. The series is just slightly above mediocre  with the good premise and ideas but still contains too many overused tropes. However, if you're looking for some action packed thriller sequences with dark heroes, then C:B might be for you.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nNOTE: This is my first review at MAL, so please bear with me. Also, I haven\u2019t read the manga AT ALL, and I don\u2019t know if the manga\u2019s story is similar to the anime\u2019s. Consider this as a point of view of someone who just watched the anime. There are some spoilers along the way to explain my point in the review, so read at your own risk. :)\r\nI remembered watching the first few episodes of Code:Breaker (together with a few more anime) when it was still being aired last year. I got curious since I thought, \u201cHey another super power-themed shonen anime! Cool!\u201dAfter watching those few episodes, I stopped watching it and simply waited for the series to finish since I got tired of waiting for a new episode, which was released weekly.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching the last episodes of Code:Breaker,  I got disappointed to this anime due to various reasons, but mainly I got disappointed because of the plot.  Well, it started good, but how the series ended is just bland and generic. Perhaps most of us (if not all of us) have seen a story with a character betraying the good guys, working for the bad guy, and then in the end, betraying that bad guy and saying that he has been in league with the good guys all along. Well, we have that kind of clich\u00e9 here. How about the Big Bad showing up after the bad guy gets defeated? We also have it here. The great presentation made at the start of the story was wasted by how they ended this series, which is clich\u00e9-filled, and done in a bad way at that. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing here is the characterization of, well, the characters, which doesn\u2019t seem real and human enough for me, and it shows more as the series progresses. Come on, someone who really IS evil doesn\u2019t say he\u2019s evil; rather, he would say that he\u2019s the hero of justice (or something like that). Besides that, there are also some dialogues in this anime that I find weird and/or just simply wrong. And being an adaptation of a manga, the series\u2019 ending is rather inconclusive, since 1) the manga is not yet finished and, 2) the adaptation is only 13 episodes long, which is very short. What I find wrong about its ending is that it never left me wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, the anime isn\u2019t all bad points and no good points at all. Just as I said earlier, the way the story was presented in the beginning was great, with a certain number of people with superpowers (called Code:Breakers) are working for the government to eliminate (i.e.; kill) people that the government sees as evil. The character designs are also great, although the design for the Code:Breakers have varying touches of bishounen-ness in them. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a groundbreaking new anime, this certainly is NOT it. Maybe if you haven\u2019t watched a lot of superpower-themed anime, you might enjoy this.  Just \u201cmight\u201d, though.",

It's got a good visual quality, some nice characters (in my case I liked Ogami and Yuuki most) and nicely choreographed battle scenes.\r\nThe balance and the dynamic between Humor, Action and a little bit drama is done wonderfully and keeps the audiences attention, throughout the anime, \"upright\" ;) \r\nThe little problem tough is how this anime has been set out so far. I don'treally like the ending. I mean, everything before was done very nicely and I did enjoy it - that's why my expectations grew over the time while I was watching C:B. But the end can be compared to a crash with another car - suddenly, unexpected, fast, ... finish...\\n\r\nThey should have done at least 3 to 5 episodes more, just to give us a better end and more screen time for the remaining 3 code breakers.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I can recommend it to everyone because I believe it's worth watching \u00ect!\\n",

            "content": "So far, Code:Breaker has been my favourite of the Fall season. It is true that there are only 4 episodes yet but if we consider the fact that this anime is going to have only 13 episodes, these 4 episodes are enough to give a fair opinion of it. Rei has the power of burning people with his flame and without hesistation he kills people- they are either evil or criminal people- as if lighting his cigarette but he is still a very cool and likeable character. He leaves the impression that there is a reason behind all his cruel way of killing and whiledoing so, he is not depicted like an emo or a drama queen. Instead, he keeps his cool attitude whatever the circumstances are. \\n\r\nAs much as Rei, Toki is also very interesting character. With his involvement in the series, the dark heavy air is dispersed. In fact, he kinda balances the heavy and dark air Rei rises.  Especially, if you are a keen on both comedy and supernatural, you'll enjoy the parts where Toki appears. \\n\r\nSakura is the type of annoying girl who butts in Rei's business on every possible occasion but I think Rei likes her company and is curious about her as he believes she is the rare species. With Toki's coming to the stage, Rei will probably be more closer to Sakura. They would make an interesting couple.\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime has a great potential and I really enjoy watching it. I only wish it had 25 or 26 episodes instead of 13 so that the remaining 3 code breakers would have a fair place in the series.",

Sadly there are a bit too many filler scenes (and chapters) that would be expected from a Anime that will have 50+ chapter, but with only 13 Code:Breaker is on the short side and spends too much time developingcharacters and locations (like the highschool) that end up having no relevance to the main story.\\n\r\nAs for the rest, it's fairly entertaining and does pick up towards the end but never really leaves the generic side of anime story or setting.\\n\r\nAlso be warned that it's open ended with a clear indication to a sequel, but I guess that will depend on how popular it is and how well it is recieved.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art and animation are quite average for a weekly Anime. Not look too bad but nothing stands out and some of the CGI effects used on some powers look a bit cheap and ugly. The animation is fine for the most part although some fights feel a bit underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing to complain here. The OST does not stand out but fits good enough with the mood and style of Code Breaker and personally I found the voice acting solid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMy biggest complain with Code Breaker is in this area as I really found the mian female character to be really, really annoying. She seems to have little relevance to the story, has absolutely no evolution and for the most part seems to be there only annoy the viewers.\\n\r\nBecause of some traumatic event in her past (which is never revealed ,BTW) she seems to be obssesed with protecting people and not letting anyone get hurt... and in a story about people with powers that KILL criminals this is a bad thing as we have to hear her screen and complain about this every single episode. What is worse is that the story makes a good point as to why this criminals have to die, the story makes focus on explaining that they can't be arrested or captured by regular authorities and it also shows them off as evil, sadistic people that deserve to die... yet many of the chapters are filled by scenes of the \"heroine\" talking to Ogami, the main character, about how he can't  kill people and how it's wrong. And yeah, it also doesen't help that half here lines in the 13 episodes are repedely screaming Ogami's Name (and I really whish I would be exagerating... but I'm not).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEven with all generic story and annoying characer, I have to say that it's still fairly entertaining show.... just aproach it as something to sit back and relax for 20 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nOVerall Score 6",

Well i can say it didnt fulfill my expectations.\r\nProbably the worst aspect of the anime is the characters, specially the female protagonist. She is just annoying with a ridiculous sense of justice, and probably its one of the characters in any anime with more repetitive dialogue. I swear i have heard her yelling \"oogami-kun!\" (the male protagonist name) like 20 times in each episode followed by the sentence \"dont kill him\" or \"dont do this\" or similar stuff. Anyone that has watched the fighting scene betweenIchigo and Grimmjow in Bleach will remember how annoying Orihime was by repeating  non-stop \"kurosaki-kun\", well, the girl from code breaker is far worse and she does it in every chapter of the 13. The rest of the characters are kinda meh, nothing to say about them, they are not as annoying and the girl but they dont add much, even the male protagonist is a meh character, he's just a cool guy who kills bad people, he doesnt even talk too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really non-sense. to be fair the premises arent bad, some people with incredible powers erradicating evil. its not great but its ok. But the thing that makes the story so bad is the  plan of the villain and why  he is trying to do  such evil thing. i dont want to spoil anything to anybody, but i will just say it is retarded. he is trying to obtain something by doing actions that doesnt make any sense and even if he succeded in his plan i am not able to understand or grasp how it would benefit him in obtaining his goal. let me put an example to explain myself: imagine you want a new car, but you cant have it, instead of working, or stealing it from the shop or whatever it takes to get the car, you go killing  owners of the car you originally wanted. remember your main objective, you wanted a new car, so why would you benefit by killing people?Exactly it doesnt make any sense, and Code Breaker Plot is something similar to this, im not kidding, its dumb.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair the art is not that bad, though some guys looks seem to belong to a shoujo manga, but its okay i guess, and the animations during some battles are good though i should say the battles themselves are not very interesting or epic.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this, Code Breaker a very dissapointing anime, with the worst character i've seen in almost any anime and a plot that is absurd. I am really sad....\\n",

This is really just an educated opinion concerning a possible direction for the anime, but I'll just have to wait to see if I'm right or not. \r\nAnyway, the coolest aspect is that the protagonist, Sakura Sakurakouji has already focused on Rei Ogami as her own personal antagonist. The dynamic this implies just sets the stage for conflict between the two main actors through out the series. With Reihaving to monitor Sakura and Sakura monitoring Rei, for her own personal reasons, plenty of trouble is bound to ensue. \\n\\n\r\nRei's job makes the story interesting in that as an assassin does he really have any morality left. The dark persona displayed in his job life and the good persona portrayed in school are defining traits for a skilled assassin but it calls into question which is his real state of being. This for me makes me want to watch it, plus the interjection of Sakura into his world\\n\r\nis like the icing on the cake because it just throws a virtual monkey wrench into his plans.\\n\\n\r\nWith seemingly spot on voice acting, good graphical quality, and possibly really good dynamic interaction, I'm definitely keeping my eye on this anime. Let's hope it doesn't disappoint. I recommend this one as a good one to check out.",

            "content": "This anime had a lot of potential, but for me its biggest flaw was how it handled its female characters, particularly the lead, Sakura. This review may have mild spoilers so don't read it if you intend to watch the anime.\r\n1. It's frustrating to see a teenage girl THIS oblivious and idealistic in today's world. All that comes out other mouth are the words - please, stop, I beg you, you are wrong, don't do this, no, blah blah blah. I'm assuming her role was to act as the moral compass to Code Breaker 6's staunch ideals, but she only came across as a whiny,useless teenage girl.\\n\\n\r\n2. She is trained in martial arts and yet her best weapons are her tears. All she does is cry and beg for evil people to NOT be killed. Wow.\\n\\n\r\n3. The man:woman ratio. In a world where half the population is female, this anime had only 3 female characters. And let me sum up these women for you-\\n\r\nSakura the wimp\\n\r\nSakura's mom who could have easily been her younger sister, what with her huge breasts and tiny waist\\n\r\n6's assistant, who also had big breasts and wore tiny mini skirts to her job and did everything in heels.\\n\\n\r\nSo essentially, the women were nothing but stereotypical props put there to please men. They could have easily been replaced by men, or better yet, could have their existence erased from the anime and nobody would have even noticed it.\\n\\n\r\n4. Stereotyping women. Is this really what shounen anime and mangas are all about? No wonder young boys believe that women should be meek, submissive and have impossibly big breasts. People say porn gives men impossible expectations, but I'd say manga like Code: Breaker easily beat porn to it. \\n\\n\r\n5. I hated how sexual assault is downplayed as \"harmless\" playfulness. When 4 grope's Sakura's breasts (TWICE) he does get a beating but not once does she say that it is WRONG of him to touch her without her CONSENT. This is a recurring theme I've seen in many shounen anime - sexual assault is okay, and women only either blush or slap you in exchange. And then everything is normal again, because that is exactly how it is in real life\\n\r\n*sarcasm*\\n\\n\r\nDeeply saddened to see HOW women are portrayed, and how few of them even exist in shounen anime. They have 3 primary purposes it would seem -\\n\r\nLoving and caring mothers or elder sisters\\n\r\nGirlfriend/meek, sweet woman\\n\r\nHot woman who fights her way through but eventually ends up falling for the man anyway.\\n\\n\r\nDisappointed.\\n",

            "content": "Code Breaker is not about Java security breaches but rather about a Japanese version of X-Men, cast with bishounen guys and a female version of Touma from Toaru Majutsu no Index. Basically, there are a great deal of children with \"special abilities\", which the government takes care of. The most powerful of these ability users are turned into 007-type agents that do the bidding of the Prime Minister, unbeknownst to the greater Japanese population. Our protagonist, Sakura, one day discovers one of these \"code breakers\" in action as he kills some unimportant fodder characters. Will her investigations lead her down a path of disaster?\r\nThe ideaof elemental super-humans is nothing new, explored in other shows like K and, more thoroughly, in the Toaru series. While the huge bishounen to female ratio is different, this only adds further questions to the show's purpose and target demographic. While the pretty-boy to girl ratio might seem to hint shoujo, don't expect any semblance of relationships here- it's all about calling out pointless catchphrases and battles. The plot is mildly entertaining but builds to a climax that just doesn't make sense. Not in the way of K's \"there's some crazy s**t going on here\" but in the illogical reasoning of the antagonist. Some may argue that this would have been better if it were longer but I'd say I'm pretty glad it's over. Unless you love action and are too young to use reason, please do yourself a favor and watch something else.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIn general. the animation is fairly good. There's good detail, shadowing, and color balance. Character designs are unique and emotions (or lack thereof) are conveyed appropriately. However, combined with the plot, certain elements don't seem to mesh. For instance, you'll see Sakura getting pummeled (kicked in the face & body repeatedly) yet two minutes later she's walking fine with no bruises. Not to mention the special abilities themselves, which makes Dragonball appear scientifically sound, relatively speaking. Think you know chemistry? Ice vs fire? Forget it as here willpower and shouting determines which \"element\" wins.\\n\\n\r\nThis is ultimately a shonen show with lots of fighting and no fan service (unless you count Sakura's weird mother who constantly cosplays as a schoolgirl). Expect a lot of fighting and a lot of special effects.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show opens with a techno-heavy rock piece, but the dude almost makes it feel shoujo appropriate. The ED reminds me a bit of some of Naruto's EDs, standard rock fare. More unique is the BGM, which is almost always on during the show. I'd go as far to say that BGM is overused in this show, as if they're afraid you'd lose attention if they stopped.\\n\\n\r\nVAs do a fair job but are limited by the script and, well, lack of unique characterization in general.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe show follows Sakura as she shadows the cool, calculating, and emotionless Rei Oogami- supposedly trying to stop him from killing other people. Despite her moral cries of \"there must be a better way\", nothing is ever proposed and she basically ends up as a spectator to the works of the Code Breakers. The central plot line is indeed contiguous, but it is also riddled with unanswered questions and fallacies that end up ruining the show for those of us who have a brain. All the seemingly isolated terrorist events and killings eventually get linked to a single individual, and then the show builds to a predictable climax encounter that is resolved in just about the worst possible way, that is other than the Mass Effect 3 ending.\\n\\n\r\nYou get the impression that Code Breaker was going for something deep (moral questions, government conspiracy, etc.) but it ends up all feeling shallow and not terribly thought out. For instance, there are only six Code Breakers at a time. Why only six when they show literally hundreds of special ability children? Also, the support organization for the Breakers, Eden, seems to employ just about every other person in Japan so it seems that the general \"populace\" isn't as ignorant as suggested. In the end, this show ends up somewhere between K and Zetman. Not as baffling as the former and not as outright disappointing as the latter. While Code Breaker has decent action, the reasons behind it is underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSakura reminds me of other shoujo female leads (think Special A & Maid Sama). She's apparently every guy's crush at school and academically/physically gifted, though I find it odd that no one realizes that she's a child of basically a yakuza family. She's definitely labeled as \"slow when it comes to love\" as her actions make everyone else think she likes Oogami, when in fact she obviously has no interest in any guy. Both Sakura and Oogami have bewildering moral beliefs, Sakura will put herself at risk to help others while Oogami is on a crusade against \"evil\", whatever he thinks that is. So what character development can we expect here? Oogami goes from trying to kill Sakura repeatedly to being her bodyguard at the government's request. Yes, at the government's request. He himself shows little if any interest in Sakura's well-being.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, you'll find very cold relationships between practically everyone in this show. Confusingly, at times the code breakers act like a well-oiled team. Yet at other times they themselves claim that they almost always act solo. Ultimately, all the characters are given cookie-cutter personalities and are in general impossible to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThe greatest value in this show is finding all the inconsistencies in the directing, presentation, and story. The story itself a mess that isn't worth telling and the characters might as well be amoeba. If you're not particularly desperate for a bit of action, steer clear.",

            "content": "If you like original, innovative anime with dynamic characters and complex storylines, turn away now. Turn away and don\u2019t look back. However, if you\u2019re looking for something with super-powered, angsty pretty boys and rather cool fight scenes, you might want to give this a try.\r\nBy far, Code:Breaker is the most generic anime I\u2019ve ever seen, and its start is much rougher than its conclusion. For the first 5 or 6 episodes, I had this anime pinned as a 4. The two main characters, a Mary Sue and a clich\u00e9, angst-ridden teenage boy, were the perfect broken record duo. Every fight turned into a bland, depthlessargument between whiny Sakura and expressionless Ogami. \u201cDon\u2019t kill this man!\u201d says Sakura. \u201cBut I\u2019m evil,\u201d says Ogami, and incinerates the man\u2019s head. \u201cOh, well then don\u2019t kill THAT man!\u201d says Sakura. \u201cBut I\u2019m evil.\u201d Ad. Nauseum. \\n\\n\r\nThe only saving grace of the anime came in the later episodes, with the slightly more interesting other Code:Breakers and the steady break-down of Ogami\u2019s heartlessness. The save wasn\u2019t amazing, but it made the series watchable despite its flaws. I remember being genuinely excited maybe once or twice.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The concept has a lot of potential that simply fell flat. \u201cCode:Breakers\u201d are government agents who do the politicians\u2019 dirty work. They all have special abilities, and were recruited due to their uniqueness. The main conflict has an X-men-esque taste of mutant super humans wanting to be recognized in society. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t explore this any further than that. Code:Breakers want recognition, government won\u2019t give it to them. The end?\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, each arc was generic. Generic bad guys, generic reason for being evil, generic take down, move on. The fights were well-animated, and the Code:Breakers\u2019 special abilities made the fights at least interesting to watch. On the whole, nothing special. The final fight with the \u201cbig bad\u201d Hitomi, an ex-Code:Breaker, was more interesting, if not for it being bogged down by Hitomi\u2019s motive making no sense. More on that later.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh god\u2026where to start? Well the main character Sakura is one of the most useless main characters to come out in recent history. She is perfect in every way, the beauty of the school whom literally EVERY guy chases. She opens her locker every day to find it stuffed with love letters. A Mary Sue start is never good, and Sakura never redeems herself. She preaches non-violence like it\u2019s going out of style, but never with a good reason. Moral characters can be interesting, usually depending on their motives and backstories for being so moral. Sakura, though, has none of these. If I had a dime for every time she said \u201cKilling is wrong!\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t kill people!\u201d I\u2019d be a very rich person. It\u2019s vaguely hinted that she experienced violence in the past, but it\u2019s never built on. She\u2019s a depthless foil to Ogami\u2019s cool, collected murder. This senseless, shallow morality of hers wouldn\u2019t be half as annoying if she were of any use. Unfortunately for her, she\u2019s not super-powered. She can only sit in the background whining about killing while Ogami sets everyone on fire.\\n\\n\r\nOgami. I\u2019ve been trying to avoid using any internet lingo in this review, but he is the perfect representation of a \u201c2edgy4me\u201d character. For those unfamiliar with the term, he is a character who tries to be dark, mysterious, and edgy simply for the sake of being dark, mysterious, and edgy. Most of his actions serve no purpose other than to show \u201cWow, Ogami will do edgy stuff!\u201d Sakura is guilty of egging this on, since most of her broken-record complaints serve as fodder prompting Ogami to dive into a monologue about why he must be dark and edgy. He claims to be evil for no real reason. He claims to be inhuman for no real reason. At the end of the day, he\u2019s just a super-powered boy who\u2019s been hired to kill bad guys, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys are, if anything, worse than Ogami and Sakura. They\u2019re perhaps more tolerable because they never stick around long, but for the short time they\u2019re around, they suck.  The prime minister in charge of the Code:Breakers is as two dimensional as it gets. He\u2019s the man just there to piss off Sakura with level-headed speeches about how unimportant the lives of Code:Breakers are. He\u2019s also the character who doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019s been defeated. He transitions instantly from wetting his pants in sheer terror (since he\u2019s hanging over the edge of a 100-story building) to mocking the Code:Breaker who saved him for being \u201ctoo soft.\u201d The villains have the most potential for depth, since many of their twisted mindsets for doing evil are downright fascinating. For this bad guy, he\u2019s evil for the sake of evil, depthless, and cold for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nEvery other goon is as generically evil as possible. They abuse super-powered children because edgy bad guys do that. They kick dogs because that\u2019s what edgy bad guys do. They never seem to have any motive for the time they\u2019re on screen. They simply gloat about their evilness and dick around until Ogami incinerates their heads. All the while Sakura begs Ogami to spare them. Lather, rinse, repeat. The big bad Hitomi is more interesting, considering his fleshed out character. He is an ex-Code:Breaker, who loved protecting his friends and citizens like nothing else. That is, until he discovered Code:Breakers eventually self-destruct from using their powers. At this point, he decides it\u2019s a good idea to flee, plant bombs around Japan, and kill 50,000 people so that Japan will be forced to recognize the Code:Breakers who protect them. WHAT?\\n\\n\r\nLuckily the other characters save the cast from being complete crap. Toki, who has the rather generic motivation of \u201cprotecting his sister\u201d, at least has more depth than most of the lot, since he tries to hide this fact. Most of the other Code:Breakers in the cast have enough depth to be tolerable, and Sakura\u2019s parents are decently entertaining. The Sakura fanboys, though, could definitely have been left out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I won\u2019t lie, the art is nice. The animation, for the most part, is smooth. The fights are well-executed, and the boys are all very, VERY pretty. Code:Breaker is eye candy: the anime. I\u2019d be tempted to say that the art makes Ogami the perfect guilty-pleasure character, essentially the Sasuke of the series. In summation: pretty boys, cool fights.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: This will be short, because I never really noticed the music throughout the show. It was certainly not bad, but nothing of note stood out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: about a 6/10. It was saved from a lower rating by the slightly interesting side characters, cool fights, and semi-decent backstory for the big bad. Ogami\u2019s cold shell starts to melt around the seventh episode, which saved his character from being completely static. The change wasn\u2019t too drastic, but it helped. Working against it, of course, are the poorly executed plot-line and the depthless, annoying main characters. At the beginning, I watched it because it was fun to make fun of it. Toward the end, I watched because of its redeeming qualities. At no point was in unwatchable, but certainly not something that was ever impressive. However, if angsty pretty boys are your guilty pleasure, and you like super-powered fighting scenes, Code:Breaker might be worth a shot.   \\n",

The characters were good, especially i liked Yuki and Heike.\r\n  To sum up it is a good anime if you like superpowers but still realistic setting",

            "content": "Code: Breaker kind of bothers me, I've been pondering for 5 minutes on how to start this review but with all my thoughts and ideas I can't even fathom a way to make this opening paragraph seem enticing to the reader. You might be thinking that this is because of lazy writing or that I'm not on my A-game because I barely have the time or enthusiasm to write these anymore. But.. It's not that. No, the reason I can't say anything for this anime in my aimless opening paragraph is simply because this anime is so average. So mediocre. So normal. That's not tosay it's bad. I'm hardly ready to grab my torch and pitch-fork over the 13 episodes I was exposed to, but I am ready to give you a long sigh and a little insight as to why I find Code: Breaker so hard to praise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\r\nThe World of Code: Breaker is somewhat typical. In fact, now that I think about it, many anime seem to follow a \"red pill, blue pill\" format and this is no exception. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't understand my Matrix reference then let me enlighten you by tying it into what happens in Code: Breaker. We have our young MC living a normal life until one day a mysterious person enters the mix with powers that should only be possible by the system admin. From this point forward our beloved MC is thrust into a world of mystery and corruption, being told that she has \"lifted the veil\" in a way, exposing herself to the true world around her. This is what I mean by \"red pill, blue pill\" and its sadly overused in the anime genre.\\n\\n\r\nI feel as if introducing a newbie to the group is the easiest way to start a story and it also happens to be the most popular. Which is why I find it extremely insulting when by the end credits you realise she didn't really do anything. Sure she blocked a few potshots but the story heavily implied that the MC is extremely important and we only know that when the story tells us that because most of the time her only job is to play constant devils-advocate to people who really couldn't give a sh*t. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the later story is nothing special. A typical \"stop the terrorists\" plot except with the epic twist that the leader is everyone's old mentor.... I don't know about you but a twist like keeps the plot as straight as a ruler... actually its not even a twist, but it was supposed to make the story more interesting, which it failed to do... mainly because we don't know anyone.\\n\\n\r\nTldr; I have two words for you, Generic and average.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\r\nNot really much to be said about this. The art was pretty standard and the only reason I'm boosting it up to a 7 was because of the sharp and interesting portrayal of the Code: Breakers powers.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound? Nothing really stood out. I say this a lot in my reviews but this time I mean it in a different way. If you listen to the soundtracks of  Bleach, Fairy Tail, FullMetal: Alchemist, The Seven Deadly Sins and others then you'll find that every epic moment or sad moment is complimented by an eruption of sound that almost dominates the atmosphere. In Code: Breakers, I barely even noticed that there was sound besides when people spoke... I won't go as far to say that the music was bad... It just didn't compliment anything.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nLemme be honest with you, I didn't find this anime by browsing the catalogue or going on Reddit. I was looking specifically for an anime with a badass protagonist. After looking around and asking a few people I decided that this would probably be the one for me. I was wrong. Oogami was supposed to be a badass and I suppose, in a way, he is but I simply can't get over how boring the motherf*cker is. He isn't witty, he isn't funny, hell, he isn't really that talkative. He just walks around and turns on his blow-torch when he gets pissed off. Meh.\\n\\n\r\nBy far my favourite character was Heike as he actually had some interesting uses of his powers besides \"throwing them at people\". There is, of course, his horribly over emphasised posh-boy attitude which I don't really mind as his wits and actions kind of justify them. There was also Tenpouin, who has always seemed half asleep and somewhat deluded. Not sure why I liked him, he just seemed different.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest, they were pretty normal, the perfect midpoint between the boring oven-light and the cat-person... can't really sing much praise but at the same time I can't disregard them as worse than average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nWhat can I say... If I can direct your attention to my first paragraph in which I said that this anime was average, you can probably guess what I would say in this section. Although I did enjoy the process of watching it more than I did looking back on it when I was done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion - \\n\r\nCode: Breakers is far from a waste of time, In fact, I recommend that you watch it. Its perfectly ok television to watch, I simply wouldn't put any aspect of it on a top 10 list. Which is one mistake that Orzzzz.com made on their \"Top 10 short anime with badass main character\" list, which I found... and read... and then decided to watch Code: Breakers because of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo well done Code: Breakers, you got the first ever honourary MEH award. Wear it with pride.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

But for those who already masters the world of anime, this is, as harsh as it might sound, rubbish. \r\nPlot: 4\r\nSo the plot at first is interesting though lacks of originality but as the story progresses, it becomes downright cliche to the point that I cringe. I'm not even joking. It's so, so, predictable. The boring villains? You have it in this anime. The cold and cool protagonist? All's here for you. All the anime cliches' it's all here, no doubt. \r\nCharacterization: 1\r\nWhere do I even begin?Oh lord. Again, so cliche and annoying. \\n\\n\r\nSakurakouji Sakura, I despise her character. I know that despise is a strong word to use but it matches how I honestly feel about her character. She's like your typical anime/fanfic girl that's overly famous despite her average look, good in sports and studies and have tones of fans at school. She's annoying, pathetic, weak; all the negative adjective goes to her. She refuse to see people got hurt and die but all she does is beg for it to stop instead of using her special pyhsical abilities. As smart as she is claimed to be, she is clueless in love, which again, so, so, cliche. You'll understand why I hate her so much after watching this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOgami: Three words; Cliche, pathetic and weak. His character doesn't develop well. \\n\\n\r\nHitomi: Your typical villain. \\n\\n\r\nThere's more characters and all of them are weak, I dare say. If I must choose a favourite character in here, I'll choose Yuuki, the supporting role in this anime. He's not original too, true but at least it's fun watching his scenes. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said again, this might be enjoyable for anime newbies, but for me, a person who has lived and breathed anime 24/7, this is crap. \\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga but I heard it's way better than the adaptation. I will proceed with the manga instead of continuing with the anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 3/10 (just because I do enjoy the bishonen characters and Yuuki's funny parts, that's all)\\n",

            "content": "I didn't expect a lot from Code: Breaker going into it. This was probably from reading some of the bad reviews. The synopsis wasn't even that intriguing, and it really sounded as if it would be a mediocre anime series at best. I know it is an ongoing manga series, but I decided to try the 13 episode anime first because it is so short. I am glad I gave this series a look, and it's definitely better than I expected. Though it has some low points in quality, it has some really high points that bring it to a low 8 in my book.\r\nThesynopsis doesn't really tell you much, nor does it prepare you for what you are about to watch. The synopsis is quite simply an introduction to the first episode. This series is about Code:Breakers (people with special abilities or super powers) that hunt and kill evil people. I don't want to say more than that because the reason why they kill is part of the reveal as the story progresses. Ultimately, this perfect \"do-good\" girl attaches herself to the main male lead and we learn more about the Code:Breaker world as she does. She has almost an obsessed opinion and it is a little stalker-ish how she takes to Oogami. This is a super-power battle anime series, and it's not too often over the top. It's sort of an \"X-Men\" like story, but it is a roller-coaster as far as quality goes.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk the basics. Animation and artwork are fairly solid. There is a quality drop when they attempt to drop humor into a scene, but sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The music and sound are pretty well done, except I think the opening song is a little cheesy at the end. All in all, it delivers for the most part in these two areas.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for Code:Breaker is simply good. It's not \"great\" or \"thrilling\" but it works and it kept my attention. As I said before, it's very \"X-Men\" like, but this is mostly in regards to the plot. This works for the story in a lot of ways, but the anime is so short that it is never really developed. It ends like most of these partially adapted series, with a cliffhanger right as things are getting going.\\n\\n\r\nI want to say that the characters are \"amazing\" but they are are not. I wasn't overly fond of any, but I did like their overall dynamic. As a group they worked really well, and I found that the personalities worked well together. Most are underdeveloped, but the main male and female characters are developed enough for the scope of the story we get to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall you can tell that this series should have been better. It's the potential that I think captured me the most. I give it a low 8, pretty much right at the the 7-8 threshold. We're talking a photo finish here folks. There were a lot of elements done better than others, and then there were a lot of inconsistencies in quality throughout. Some scenes felt rushed, and others felt dragged out, while some scenes were right on. Even with all of it's flaws it still found a way to grab me, so it gets a lot of points from the enjoyment category. The bottom line is that I enjoyed it, and that's all you can ever really hope for when dedicating a few hours of your time to something like this. It definitely has been added to my \"plan to read\" manga list, so it's done enough of it's job on that front. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, this should have been an amazing series, but it wasn't. That aside, it was pretty good and it is worth watching. If you enjoy super-power battle series then you should check Code:Breaker out. If not, then move along now, nothing to see here.",

            "content": "So, Code;Breaker. A 13 episode adaption of an over 200 chapter manga. Of course it doesn't come out that good...\r\nCode;Breaker is based on a manga by Kamijyo Akimine, who also originally wrote Samurai Deeper Kyo, and the anime is directed by Irie Yasuhiro, who also directed Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. It tells the tale of an ordinary high school student, Sakurakouji Sakura. One day however, while riding a bus, she sees a man burn several people with blue flames, but when she goes tot he scene of the crime, there are no ashes. The next day the man has became a transfer student at her highschool, and Sakura learns he is a Code;Breaker, who seems to be a group of people with special powers who work for the government. Sakura makes it her goal to stop this man from killing, no matter how much stalking it takes. The man himself is interested in Sakura as for some reason his flames won't burn her...\\n\\n\r\nThe sad thing is, Code;Breaker could've been a good show. I man, we have just about the same exact theme as Death Note, (is it okay to kill criminals?) an rather decent anime. However, Death Note never got preachy, it allowed you to form your own thoughts on the theme instead of running around having the lead saying, \u201cdon't kill, killing is bad\u201d over and over again. There's also some really pointless school scenes that fail in every way. I mean, chances are they're for comic relief, but they are not used very well at all. It just seems out of place in such a dark shonen anime. They're also very annoying as you see, Sakura's friend believes that Sakura likes Ogami as, well, she stalks him more or less, and Sakura, who doesn't seem to like Ogami, does nothing at all to deny this, just brushing it off. They're just not very funny and are not used well. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is just how damn unambitious this show is. First, this is one of those shows where most of the side characters seem interesting, but the main leads are hopelessly dull. Our male lead is little more than a badass, and Sakura- They try for her, but her going around yelling at everyone why killing is bad gets old fast. Also, there are interesting powers in this show, such as controlling sound waves, controlling metal, and light, which we don't see much... So they of course give the lead the power to control flames and the main antagonist the ability to control electricity, two stock superpowers. The of course the leads also have these dark and troubled past hinted throughout. And there's of course a shady secret organization. Another thing is the power distribution makes no sense. In the final fight, guy gets totally surrounded in flames... And yet is still in not-half bad shape afterwards. And even if Code;Breakers are more resistant to powers, the clothes aren't even burnt off. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag. At first glance Sakura seems strong, but she falls under the damsel in distress role too many times in this series, not to mention the fact she stalks Ogami to try to get him to stop killing people.  Ogami's got your classic generic badass personality like I already mentioned, but the others Code;Breakers are typically better. Yuuki was my favorite by far. He has a strange obsession with cats and a very relaxed personality.  Heike was also pretty good, he has a mysterious over-the-top personality. Prince, who despite her name I believe is a girl, acts very boyish. Toki, who has sort of the rival personality, is annoying in the comedy scenes but okay in the drama parts. The big bad isn't nothing spectacular either, he's just a bit clich\u00e9 for my taste.\\n\r\nThe music was rather decent, with a rather epic and very catchy opening song, and the ending isn't that bad either, just a little more generic sounding. The animation does his job I suppose, though some of the character designs do look a little weird, mainly Sakura's. \\n\\n\r\nThe show did end obviously with a sequel hook, but it didn't sell very well so that sequel probably won't come, and boy does that hurt the show. Only the arc is ended well, for the main storyline, almost nothing is concluded. In the end, Code;Breaker is well, just another shonen action anime. Sure some of the supporting cast is interesting, but the main cast is not very good. If you're a fan of shonen action anime and are running out of ones to watch, then give it a whirl. I can't recommend this to anyone else though.",

            "content": "Think this is a ripoff of Blue Exorcist because the main character has black hair, blue flames, and the same seiyuu as Rin Okumura? Well, you're wrong; those are all just very big coincidences. \r\nI don't know why this is rated so low? I mean, maybe the people that've seen it have read and prefer the manga, I don't know. I'm gonna read the manga next, so I guess I'll see, but this anime still felt really amazing to watch. \r\nSo, the art and sound were pretty average. I like the opening and ending, but in between, the music was touch and go. The Code:Breakershave special abilities that probably could've been translated a little better to screen than they were, but it was still interesting artwork. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was on point. I loved it. I don't normally point out voice acting when I review anime, but Code:Breaker stuck out to me because of how engulfing it was. As far as the characters themselves go, they were very well done. None of them felt static at all. Every character that was given more than two lines was dynamic. Obviously, not all of the manga's story takes place in the anime, so you couldn't get proper backstories on all of the characters, but the illusion to something greater was brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and concept itself was so freaking cool. I feel like the world was very well thought out without being overly complicated. One of the things I really liked about this anime was the villain. Not only did the villain have a proper motive (which is surprisingly overlooked in a lot of anime), but the motive made sense. You could actually sympathize and understand where that character was coming from rather than them having a redemption arc while the audience is just sat there like, \"Yeah, I don't care, he's still a jerk.\" You know? So, I really appreciated that aspect of the story.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, I'm just really excited to continue the story in the manga. I've been watching anime for a while now, and no other story has prompted me to read the manga more than this one. On that fact alone, I really think that anyone who is interested should watch it. I think it deserves more love.",

This anime could have been amazing, but instead it came out just sub-par.  There are a few reasons I believe the anime was lacking what could have brought it to greatness.\r\nI have a problem with quite of few of the logical inequities throughout the anime, but the character that bother me the most was:\r\nSakura\u2014not only arrogant in her ideals, she was willing to endanger others for her own deluded perception of right and wrong,and cared little about the consequences, other than enabling what she thought was right to be the only justification.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tries to be too ruthless and sappy at the same time, bringing about an obnoxiously contradictory cast of characters.  Beyond that, they would so willingly kill, yet the one antagonist that led their most beloved role model to ruin was allowed to simply mock him at the final moments without repercussion\u2014and instead\u2014protection?  Why?\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it: one of the main characters was whiny, annoying, and boring; constant contradictions and cliches are predictably present, yet easily avoidable; and the ending is incredibly lackluster to say the least....\\n\\n\r\nI would say this is fine to watch once, since it is a relatively short anime, but do not go in expecting greatness, because you will be let down.  Code breaker had the potential for excellence, but failed at far too many points to bring that potential to fruition.",

            "content": "(Free of Major Spoilers)\r\nOk, when it comes to the story, it's not too complex but it's still pretty good despite the cliches that it may throw in there. Matter of fact, it's those cliches that make the anime funny at times. Also, I like how the flashback episode was done. As viewers, we eventually learn that the Code Breakers are close but that episode really showed us their closeness. One thing that might be seen as an issue though is the fact that one of the Code Breakers is hardly mentioned and doesn't become important until later. There's also the thing with Rei's power... Theynever really explained how he got so strong at a certain point. They just said that his powers were \"awakened\". The phrase \"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and evil for evil\" may be a little repetitive but I do think that it adds to the story. Other than that, there aren't many other problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks a little cool. It's not too different from what you usually see in anime but the characters are nice to look at. There's also no issues with the animation. I don't recall seeing anything too weird looking.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening Dark Shame by Granrodeo really fits with the anime. The ending song also sounds nice. There's nothing really memorable about the soundtrack but it did add to the serious and emotional moments. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are good as well. Sakura may be seen as annoying, or even stupid, due to her strong sense of justice but she certainly isn't useless. Her sense of justice is both a flaw and a strength and the anime shows this. Most of the character motivations and actions are understandable, especially Hitomi's. In my opinion, Rei has the most character development. I don't think there's a lot of it in this anime, especially with Yuki, but the characters are likable due to their overall personalities and appearances. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nCode Breaker questions what's good and what's evil.

It seems to me they addedthe fact she can fight to make her seem like a strong female.\\n\r\nThe antagonist\u2019s motivation is still not legitimate enough for me, it seems fake and shoe horned in just so it seems more tragic he's evil.\\n\r\nThe sound was good with alright voice acting from some and not so alright voice acting from others. The art was decent I suppose but I have seen better. (The \u2018magic\u2019 was quite pretty and dynamic)\\n\r\nI think the thing for me was the characters, they seemed flat, token or just not nice which made the series a bit of a damp squib.\\n",

The main characters Sakura and Ogami are flat, poorly developed and often behave and react to situations in ways that don't really make sense. The dialogue in this show is also horrible where Ogami will shout the same cringy mantra (AN EYE FOR AN EYE A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH AND EVIL FOR EVIL!!!!!) over and over again and the overall. The characters do such a poor job in this show that you lose interest in the plot.\r\nBUT...\r\nDespite all this, I would highly recommend this show and that is for one reason. This show is so badthat it actually turns around and becomes enjoyable. I personally had a blast watching this anime and would highly recommend watching it with friends. Especially for those of you who have a taste for ironic humor. Seriously, I cant think about this anime without smiling.",

One is how irrational the antagonist's plan/idea is.

            "content": "Overview:\r\nI've always been very selective about the anime I watch, and as a result, I could probably count the anime I regret watching on one hand. \"Code:Breaker\" is, without a doubt, one of these. With an exceedingly tedious morality conflict that ultimately goes nowhere, the most incompetent female lead I've seen in any anime, and the type of facepalm-inducing melodrama that would make even the biggest \"Final Fantasy\" fan groan, this is a series that stands out in absolutely no way, shape or form and, while not completely abysmal, is definitely not one I will be re-watching anytime soon.\r\nStory (3.5/10):\r\nThe story follows Sakura Sakurakouji (yeah,that incompetent female lead is also the main character) who while on the bus home, sees a blue fire suddenly light, and at the centre of it is a boy her age, who comes to her school the next day as a transfer student. He is Rei Ogami, an assassin with a strange power known as a 'Code;Breaker'. Convinced that killing is never justified, Sakura decides to stop Ogami before he kills again, while Ogami, at the same time, takes an interest in Sakura because of her status as a 'Rare Breed'. While this does seem like an interesting set-up, trust me when I say that any illusion of that shatters by the end of the first episode when Sakura scolds Ogami for euthanizing a DOG! Yeah, so the dog was on the brink of death, there was no way to save it, Ogami did the kindest thing he could have done and she screams 'How could you?!'. In hindsight, that  was the first hint to walk away as things only get worse in the next two episodes (the third being the worst of the worst) and then slightly better after that.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is simply atrocious. For a while, the series just doesn't know what direction it wants to go in. The third episode is practically filler as it adds absolutely nothing to the rest of the plot, being little more than annoying melodrama. The series is only 13 episodes long, so to have filler is a serious problem and makes everything else come off as rushed. Furthermore, all the arguing between Ogami and Sakura about killing is completely pointless because it never creates any good development in either of them. Sakura never learns that killing is necessary sometimes, and her words never get through to Ogami.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (6/10):\\n\r\nOn the surface, \"Code:Breaker\" actually looks pretty good. The environments and power effects are believable and the humans are overall well-drawn. However, then you see the animals and they look TERRIBLE! I can swear whoever wrote the series has never even SEEN a dog or cat before. There is practically no detail in them, making them little more than blobs with features, and they don't fit at all with the rest of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Dialogue (5/10):\\n\r\nNothing about the soundtrack stood out for me, and the opening and ending themes are instantly forgettable. Voice acting is good, for the most part, but I've certainly heard better. Dialogue varies from decent to horrendous.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5.5/10):\\n\r\nAs I mentioned twice before, Sakura is highly incompetent, to the point that it's hard to believe she's the main protagonist. Worse yet is that she's depicted as a nice person but instead comes off as self-righteous to the point of hypocrisy. You see, with her martial arts and 'Rare Breed' abilities, she can easily stop Ogami from killing, as opposed to begging him not to which she knows falls upon deaf ears. She does sometimes, admittedly, but more often than not she just stands there seemingly helpless as he kills, almost as though a part of her knows it's them or the criminals but she refuses to admit it. This, combined with her claim that her childish beliefs are a fact of the matter, which she's trying to force on this guy she barely knows, makes her come off as an arrogant, stubborn and highly judgemental individual, certainly not the kind, caring girl she's supposed to be. All in all, she is a character that I grew to loathe and, while she does get a little better towards the end, she ultimately came off as weak, underdeveloped and just tried very hard to be a character she really wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is no better. There's Yuki and Toki, two of the other Code:Breakers who serve as the comic relief. However, two guys who turn into a cat and child when they use their powers too much just doesn't fit with the dark tone the show attempts to go for. And, more importantly, it isn't funny. There's also Rui, the only female Code:Breaker who is as bland as Sakura is incompetent and Miyuki, a normal woman who works with the Code:Breakers and calls Ogami her master for reasons that are never explained. The villain's goal and motivations are so poorly written and explained that I just didn't know whether I was meant to hate him or sympathise with him.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, there is one good character, and that is Ogami. Despite claiming that criminals are dogs that need to be put down, Ogami, much like Lelouch vi Britannia and Kiritsugu Emiya, is fully aware that his actions are wrong and that he isn't a good person. He flat out admits this, which makes for some of the better dialogue in the series.\\n\\n\r\nOgami: We all have a job to do. You said yourself taking out the trash is a noble profession, right?\\n\r\nSakura: Yeah, so?\\n\r\nOgami: Well, that's exactly what those gang members were.\\n\r\nSakura: And it's your job to remove them.\\n\r\nOgami: Every single one of them was a cold-blooded killer.\\n\r\nSakura: Oh, I see. Fighting fire with fire, of course. What gives you the right to judge?\\n\r\nOgami: I told you, I'm a bad man. I recognize my own.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this exchange, you can immediately see the gap in quality between Ogami's dialogue and Sakura's. Unfortunately, Ogami isn't exactly a saving grace, as even he has a point where he becomes annoying. Furthermore, his aforementioned similarities to Lelouch from \"Code Geass\" and Kiritsugu from \"Fate/Zero\" are unfortunate yet inescapable reminders that you should be watching those shows instead.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4.5/10):\\n\r\n\"Code:Breaker\" is not without its enjoyable moments, but a good few of the episodes were just a pain to sit through. And yet here I am today, wondering why the hell I watched the whole thing from start to finish. Was I curious about how bad it would get? Was I under the vain hope it would get better? Or am I simply a masochist? I don't even know. But what I do know is, in spite of everything, I can't even say I'm disappointed, as by the end all I was left with was the realisation of how little potential it had to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I've highlighted what I think of \"Code:Breaker\", but just in case, let's recap. It's tedious, it's inconsistent, it's incredibly melodramatic, it's almost completely devoid of interesting characters and, ultimately, it all just feels as though it's been done before- and better. It's not the worst anime I've seen, but it has all the problems of an average series and too few redeeming qualities to make it worth recommending.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n3.5+6+5+5.5+4.5=24.5/50=4.9/10",

            "content": "Just to clarify, I am only reviewing the Code Breaker anime, not the manga which is apparently both longer and from some of the early scans I've seen appears to follow a different story. At the time of this review, I've only read the 1st chapter of the manga so for fans of the manga keep in mind this review is aimed specifically at the anime.\r\nThat being said, Code: Breaker is a very strange anime to review. This is not because it is so much as unorthodox anime as it is a confusing one. After finishing it, I had very mixed feelings. So before Iprovide a very long analysis of the 13 episode season I want to state my general thoughts: It's not a bad anime but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nCode: Breaker starts off with the story of a young girl named Sakura who while riding the bus one night, witnesses a young man setting several others on fire in the park. Running off the bus to investigate the scene however she sees no trace of evidence of an actual crime committed. Confused, she goes to school the next day and a new student, Rei Ogemi has arrived as a transfer student and he looks just like the young man she had seen the day before. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself has a good premise. We have Sakura, a girl driven by her feelings of righteousness, and Rei, an executioner for the wicked. The two early on play off each other well, with Rei playing mind games against Sakura as she contemplates the ethical debate brought up by the show: Killing killers. Quite frankly, the best part of this series is the earlier episodes with Rei still being a dark entity and Sakura a witness to his actions. I very much liked how they played off each other with their ideologies clashing with the other. However, this concept soon becomes repetitive for the viewer as it seems for the first half of the show, before the main story kicks in, they keep repeating the same concept in differing scenarios. Every time, Sakura questions Rei's right to judge and he clarifies why he feels it's okay for him to take another's life. \\n\\n\r\nThe story further struggles because it feels in a word, compiled. Interesting ideas such as Sakura's mysterious back story never are fleshed out and so the story feels increasingly incomplete. While I can understand there is much to cover in a 13 episode series and some ideas could be left out, there are several pointless moments that I'll refer to later that can easily be removed.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the 13th episode, the plot seems to be unclear as to what is going on, what has been going on and what will happen later down the road. This ultimately leads to just a bitter ending for the viewer who feels like nothing significant changed for these characters by the end of the show; Rei never changed his ways from taking another life from the show and while the anime may have meant to justify vigilantism, it was never made clear. \\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the characters I'd say that this is, while stronger than the story, still a weak aspect of the show. Starting off we have Sakura. The show makes it very clear early on that she is an optimist, always trying to see the morality in people. While not necessarily original, I think Sakura was a nice sort of conscience for Rei. She makes clear points that murder is wrong and her character does help fuel the ethical debate greatly. However, Sakura is constantly undermined by the series. First off, the cops are in on what the criminals are doing, as explicitly stated in episode 1. As a result, thugs would not be properly prosecuted which makes the argument that killing is not the only way to stop evil a fallacy because it practically is. it's particularly strange to see the law's corruption because the manga's 1st chapter implies that the police actually do legitimate work. The only reason I can think of as to why this change was made to the anime is because it might make Rei seem more justified. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is the opposite of what happens. Rei's character is a mass murderer, taking the lives of criminals throughout the course of the series. He views his actions as \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and evil for evil\", meaning that in his mind what comes around goes around. The show constantly justifies this view point by putting Rei and Sakura in positions where its clear that Rei's way is the only way. The problem with this is that while yes you do what Rei to not be a complete bastard, he seems to be ALWAYS in the right so his darker character seems incapable of ever being wrong. As a result, Rei comes off as a glorified mass murderer, making his character difficult to like because his view point is never proven wrong. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does a commendable job with the series villain, Hitomi. Without going into too much detail, he is portrayed as one of the most sympathetic villains I've seen in anime, making his character very likable. In one of the last episodes, we are given a fantastic insight into the character from his back story and therefore making him pleasant to watch throughout the series. Unfortunately, the anime makes a mistake with his character as well. The problem is Hitomi is too justified, similar to Rei. Hitomi's reasons for what he's doing are not just sympathetic but almost admirable. Although he does do terrible actions later on that doesn't make this problem too extreme, Hitomi is easily the most likable character in the series because of his ideology. \\n\\n\r\nI viewed the English dub for Code: Breaker and while not a fan of most English dubs, found this one to be pretty strong. Rei's voice actor in particular, Micah Solusod, does a great job applying a dark tone for his character's voice. While later on Sakura's voice actress Jackie Ross seemed not as strong, I found this issue to be more with the dialogue she was given rather than the actual performance which in the earlier and better written episodes was very well done. Other highlights such as the Prime Minister and Hitomi deserve recognition as well. The music from both the opening and ending I'm indifferent to because while it was not bad, there's nothing worth noting. \\n\\n\r\nThe art direction for the show is not anything worth noting either, the best parts of the show being the fights and use of the character's powers, particularly Rei's blue flames.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I conclude this review though, I'd like to address two very important issues I found with the show that I feel don't really fall into any of the categories previously discussed. This is mostly from what I mentioned very early on in the show, its misuse of time. This first has to do with a scene where a girl at school fondles Sakura's breast. I have a series issue with this for various reasons. Firstly, the scene has no reason to exist. These 30 seconds or so could be better used for things related to the actual plot, particularly the bitter ending which needs great fixing. Secondly, this is inappropriate in my opinion. Others may find this funny and I am a male so my opinion lacks any actual \"experience\" but this is just sexual harassment. It's clear Sakura is uncomfortable with the scenario and there's no real reason to have it in there. I'm from America so I am aware there's going to be a difference in humor between where I grew up and Japan but all the same this is just wrong to me. As a result such scenarios weaken my enjoyment of the show because of its poor taste and treatment of the heroine.\\n\\n\r\nMy second complaint is with the focus on Sakura's family. This is a plot point randomly given to the story and I'm not sure why because up until the show needed her family to be powerful enough to have so many \"guards\" it was never clear. This seems to be for convenience and annoys me because previous episodes never even hinted at this home life DESPITE us seeing her at home previously. This issue only annoys me more after an incident where multiple people at her home become injured and she feels guilty. They give her a cliched speech about how they believe in her, only further irritating me because it is so unnecessary. These people have no reason to be in the show and for the 1st half weren't present. This randomness hurts my enjoyment further by causing me to only resent them for existing in the medium without proper justification.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Code: Breaker is okay at best. I want to like the show but I can't because its characters and story are generally flawed. If you have nothing else to do, maybe watch the first 3 or so episodes and see if you want to continue from there. Otherwise, this series is not worth the watch sadly.",

Now when I watched it I can say this really is a hidden gem. Although a lot of people say this show was kinda a let down after a great manga, I still loved the show. I'm unfamiliar with the Code:Breaker manga but if it was better than this show I just have to read it sometime...\r\nStory: Well, long story short, this show doesn't have a good story. Imean, it gets the job done, but it really is nothing special. Just some code breaker trying to save other code breakers and kids with special powers while forgetting about all other innocent people. As I said, it really gets the job done...   Story: 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I really like this anime's character designs and animation. Especially Yuuki's and Heike's design. I kinda don't like the female appearances in the anime. They say Sakura is the prettiest girl in school. Hell no! I'm not homo but girls in this anime look ugly...   Art: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and ending of this show are so amazing. The ending is probably one of my favorite endings ever. If you start watching this anime please don't skip the endings.   Sound: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: For me, characters are the most important segment of every anime and I have high expectations of every anime's characters. The characters in this show are ok. I personally love Heike's and Hitomi's characters because they just give this anime its personality. Heike is like the mystic guy protecting everybody and Hitomi is a great leader who went off the road. I kinda have a feeling Rui was a filler character because she does almost nothing and the show would have been almost the same without her. Sakura is the second main character if I can express myself like that. In the beginning she really annoyed me with all that \"Don't kill him\" garbage but she became an important part of the show. And Ogami is just a cold-blooded main character who wants to stop evil...   Character: 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I highly enjoyed this anime because of all the action scenes and dialogues.   Enjoyment: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Even though this anime was a let down for a lot of people I really enjoyed it and I didn't regret a single minute of my spent time on this show. If you're looking for a good action show one tier lower than the best action shows, I highly recommend you Code:Breaker. That's all of me for today, hope I helped you clear some things and maybe start watching a new anime you'll like...   Overall: 8/10.",

            "content": "Story: \r\nOut of the gate, seems decent but ends with plot holes and cliff hangers.\r\nArt: \r\naverage, I've seen worse, and better.\r\nSound: \r\naverage, Nothing particularly memorable except for who is singing the opening.\r\nCharacters: \r\nTerrible. The main character Sakura is the strongest and smartest person in her school. Knows Aikido and can stop two of the code breakers mid-punch by grabbing their wrists.  But when it's plot related She does stupid stuff, and has to be rescued.  It gets so bad that she couldn't even get herself out of a choke, even though she would know exactly how with her training. Says \"Don't Kill\" likea broken record, but offers no alternatives, or guts to prevent it. Which make the male lead appear as the correct one. She is able, but the writing forces her to be unable. Pathetic male fantasy. \\n\\n\r\nCode breakers 01 and 04 have their motivations for being a code breaker revealed, but everyone else is a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in Sakura's school and home are one note, and forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI finished pissed. Frustrated by Sakura's inability to do anything worth being in the show. All she did was show me that the manga writer can only belittle and weaken a strong female to make the men look good. Other anime have this problem too, but it as blatant in this series.  I don't mean to sound feminist, but I'm just frustrated by how overpowered Sakura is, and yet she wasn't allowed to be capable. Which made her terribly annoying. Episodes 9-13 were the worst.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nChauvinistic modern male fantasy.  I recommend passing on this, the MC is handicapped by bad writing so much so that it'll make ya mad at her, and it's not even her fault character wise. She's a bait 'n' switch. First episode you learn she's smart, and strong, every episode after, she does only dumb things and needs rescue.",

If the show started following the anime then loosely interprets it is when I do not like it. \r\nThe girl tries to change the views of her friends who call themselves code breakers. Code breakers go about ridding the world from evil by killing them using special abilities. These people break the code of law, which is why the received their name. The girl travels with her friends on the assignments given to them by the prime minister. \r\nAs she knows them better shewants to make them realize that death is not the answer. It is not simple as an evil for evil like her friends say. Another person agrees with her, but in the opposite direction thus the code breakers gather to save the city. \\n\\n\r\nThe back story of the code breakers before this time is really neat seeing that at one time they enjoyed carrying out their assignments instead of hating one another. It is amusing for the code breakers personality quirks show.",

The whole thing felt rushed, \"like lets just throw a whole but of stuff and see what happens\". Nonetheless, it did have a plot and mediocre ending. Nothing heart stopping, jaw dropping or tear jerker. Overall the whole story line was bland.\r\nArt & Sound- These aspectsof the anime were nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- There was no character development aspects to the story. My personal opinion is that there were so few characters for one of them not to make an impression on me. Basically they all just came and left from my memory. Nonetheless for a 13 episode anime each character did compliment the other. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I overall enjoyed this short anime. It had a nice concept but had a problem with deliverance. Nonetheless, there was plenty of Action, Supernatural, School and Comedic parts of the anime.",

And I'm a bit annoyed of Sakura Sakurakouji's \"Sense of Justice\" and keeping yelling Ogami countless times in entire episodes makes my head filled with Ogami over and over. I do hope that there will be a Season 2 for Code:Breaker(because of Seeking One) and I really wish that the Season 2 will match exactly as the manga(if it happens), Because the Re-codes arc(or whatever they called it) is the most epic arc I haveever read. Putting that aside a little disappointment on Storyline, but the Characters and their voices really exactly the Characters' traits/aspect.\\n",

The story falls short as there isn't much flow in the anime. For a 13 episode anime it feels very slow at points and some things happen far too abruptly ruining the flow.\r\nThe characters are extremely two dimensional. All of them seem to use a short wordbank of phrases, are obsessed with achieving only one thing each and the lack of personality fail to make the characters come to life. Each individual character isnot fleshed out in a way that you can gain an attachment and the side characters feel more like story filler than anything else. The character who shows the most personality and change in the show is Hitomi but given how the story flows, the character growth doesn't feel right.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime though has nice artwork. It's nothing mindblowing or over detailed but it is pleasing to the eye and simple. All the bodies are in good proportion which can sometimes be hard to find in a shonen.",
