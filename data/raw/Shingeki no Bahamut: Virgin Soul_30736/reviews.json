            "content": "This review will contain major  for both Season 1 and Season 2. So, for anyone who does not want to be spoiled, please watch the anime before reading this review.\r\nSo, Shingeki no Bahmut: Virgin Soul. The much anticipated sequel to the 2014 anime (in my opinion) Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis finally aired it's 24th and final episode and boy was it a major let down. Let me get straight into it.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe story picks up 10 years after our heroes have saved the planet from a certain destruction. And what did they get for their selfless sacrifice? Favaro is MIA for half the seasonand Kaiser in stuck in stagnation as the commander of a dying-out military force. Some nobody is out of the blue named King and is following closely in the footsteps of an all-to-familiar 1939-1945 dictator from west Europe. Janne is exiled for reasons beyond my understanding. Demons are discriminated and considered as trash, angels are being massacred left and right for no reason and humans are just kind-of there. A NEW character is introduced, without any background or foreshadowing, without any character development or contribution and we're somehow supposed to jump aboard.\\n\r\nSkip a few episodes (23 to be precise) and we come to the conclusion where, SURPRISINGLY all the bad guys turn out to be ACTUALLY good guys, some people die, get forgotten and the BAD guys, who turned GOOD guys get to live happily ever after as heroes. Sound like LeLouche? Well, it's LeLouce only without him dying but instead getting everything he wanted and more.\\n\r\n(those of you, who actually sit through this 24 episode of time-waste will understand)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nJust like the prequel, the art in this sequel is top-notch. It's not on the level of Unlimited CashWorks but it will leave you satisfied if visual effects are all you're looking for.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLet's get this straight - the bad-ass opening from season 1 is gone and it's not coming back. The OP and ED in this sequel are not worth mentioning and the soundtrack in the actual anime is almost forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nBland villains, bland main character, little to no character development, lots and LOTS of plot armor for the important characters. NO plot armor for the side characters. Not really the strong point of this anime (much like the story). Bad guys turning good - cliche as cliches get. The true bad guy defeated, but not really, so that a 3rd season cash-grab can be made - check! If you're into mindless action and shallow storytelling, with little to no character presence, then this anime is PERFECT for you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymend: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the anime had potential. The second half ruined it all with it's horrendous storytelling, cliche characters and predictable plot. Not to mention the sacrifice of key characters without their contribution to the story being fully told. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could give it a lower score but the average from the above 5 categories prevents me from doing so. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize: if you are into a shallow story, with bland characters, no development, lots of minutes (potentially hours) wasted in idle chatter, some battles and some moral discussions, all leading to a predictable ending (with a few sad but overall overlooked deaths here and there) then this anime is definitely for you (poor soul). \\n\\n\r\nI do hope we NEVER see a third sequel, as that will most certainly butcher an already massacred anime.",

            "content": "I will be starting this with a warning: If you are looking for fast paced action, suave dialogue, likable characters and great fight choreography\u2026 which is to say, an actual sequel to Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, then turn back right now. Close this tab and never look back at this show. This is not the sequel that Genesis deserved\u2026 or even one that it needed, looking at the end result. Virgin Soul can only be described as a convoluted mess, which not even the returning characters could save.\r\nIf that wasn\u2019t descriptive enough, then read on. Below, I will attempt to explain exactly what went wrongwith Virgin Soul. Do expect some minor spoilers with regard to the initial few episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Virgin Soul starts 10 years after the events of Genesis, and the world is quite different from how we remember it. Humanity has extended its reaches, as far as to bring demon-kind to its knees, while achieving great power along the way. These changes bring with them quite some intrigue, and world-building progresses at an optimal pace. Then, they introduce the new protagonist, Nina Drango. Even ignoring her endless libido and her shoujo manga-esque encounters with pretty much any young man, the story seems to be progressing somewhere. The themes of morality and sociology were quite strong in the initial few episodes, especially from the likes of returning characters such as Kaisar and Azazel. So far so good\u2026\\n\r\nThen, somewhere along the way, the series started on a downward spiral that never really stopped. The intelligent conversations and ideas just slowly faded out into the background, and the focus moved on to a romance which would make the likes of Twilight look half decent. I can state without doubt that the romance in Virgin Soul is the worst I have ever witnessed on screen. One could hope that at least this subplot may help develop the characters in question\u2026 well, in this case, it outright broke the character of the male participant, making his personality impossible to salvage.\\n\r\nThe rest of the story can\u2019t exactly be called intelligent, with multiple contradictory or even outright stupid reveals and \u2018plot twists\u2019. Worst thing is, every single thing just somehow leads back to the central romance, which just sucks the life out of the series. Honestly, if this were advertised as a shoujo anime which was unrelated to Shingeki no Bahamut, it may not have felt like such an insult, but the way it went, it simply became a detriment to its \u2018prequel\u2019. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are quite reminiscent of Genesis, and are quite pleasing to look at. The only real gripe I have is how they use some outright atrocious crowd CGI in some scenes, which seem completely out of place.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nAbove average, but nothing really special. The openings and endings are all decent, yet forgetful. All the Engrish in the songs didn\u2019t exactly help that. Even the soundtracks weren\u2019t anything to write home about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest failure of Virgin Soul was certainly the depiction of the characters and their interactions. I\u2019ll be analysing this in two parts: New characters and Returning characters.\\n\r\nWhen talking about the New characters, the first and foremost would be Nina Drango. The best way to describe her would be a female version of Hyoudou Issei. She spends most of her time drooling over any good-looking guy (which, for some reason, seems to be the norm for men in this show), and the rest of her time utterly wrecking the sho\u2026. Umm\u2026 Causing trouble for others. Other than her, we have Charioce and Mugaro. Charioce had some great potential, and his views were quite intriguing to begin with\u2026 but of course, they decided that he was better off as a pretty-boy version of Hitler. As for Mugaro\u2026. He was literally a walking plot device from beginning to end.\\n\r\nAs for the Returning characters, we have Favaro, Kaisar and Azazel (well, there was Jeanne, Bacchus, Hamsa and Rita, but they\u2019re not really worth mentioning at this point). We start off with quite a bit about Kaisar and his views. This was interesting while it lasted, but he started to become more and more insufferable as the series went on. Near the end of it, you\u2019d be left wondering if it\u2019s even the same character anymore. As for Favaro, I had great hopes for him. He flourished in the leading role of Genesis, and I was hoping that he would breathe some life into the show\u2026 sadly, all he got was a minor supporting role as Nina\u2019s father-figure. The one good character that we got out of this series was Azazel. His development was exceptional. He portrays a loner, in the truest sense of the word \u2013 he fights alone, and takes the full brunt of the responsibilities for himself, including the failures.\\n\r\nOne strange thing I noticed is how the characters were never particularly consistent, and their behaviour varied quite wildly from episode to episode. The character interactions ranged from decent to horrendous, depending on the characters in question and the mood of the writer at that time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10):\\n\\n\r\nExtremely difficult to watch. My tolerance for bullshit is generally pretty high, but this one made me absolutely lose it. There were some moments in the latter half of the show that made me scream abuse and point rude gestures at the screen, simply because of how frustrating and annoying it was. Watching this show made me question the writer\u2019s intelligence (or the lack thereof), at multiple occasions. I had to force myself to watch the last few episodes, just for the sake of finishing this review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4.4 ~ 4/10):\\n\\n\r\nWith this, it is quite clear that the anime was a disaster, and that the new writer was a mistake. In fact, I\u2019d be glad if she never touches anime ever again. So to speak, avoid this anime \u2013 there\u2019s absolutely nothing good waiting for you in this one. With this, I conclude.\\n",

            "content": "The original Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was perhaps one of the most surprising anime of the last few years in the sense that it was an ultra-rare case of a game adaptation that actually didn't suck. In fact, it was actually a really solid fantasy adventure, albeit perhaps not with the best ending. Virgin Soul can be roughly described as a more extreme version of the same pattern: it's even better than the original for the vast majority of its runtime... but also somehow has an even worse ending.\r\nVirgin Soul takes place approximately 10 years after the events of the original. At this point thehuman realm is the dominant force in the world, lead under the ruthless King Charioce XVII. He has managed to effectively steal the powers of the gods and used them in order to turn the demon residents in the capital area into slaves. Both Heaven and Hell have rebellious thoughts on their minds due to the oppression they're suffering, but they have a hard time doing much against the overwhelming power which Charioce possesses. It is here we find our new protagonist Nina Drango: a young and energetic bounty hunter who arrives at the capital seeking her fortune. As a tiny little catch, Nina has the ability to transform herself into a dragon, but only spontaneously, involuntarily and uncontrollably.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story goes on, many more characters are introduced, including both new ones and returning ones from Genesis. And what I really like about them is that they're not only extremely well characterized, but you get so many different perspectives about the conflict in place in Virgin Soul. It's not just that many of the characters are quite likable on a personal level, but the agendas of Heaven, Hell and the human realm respectively are all very logically depicted. It's a very balanced cast both in terms of differentiating back stories but also in terms of personalities. Nina herself may be extremely na\u00efve and overly optimistic, but that's also part of her charm and her personality is frequently played around with as a means to drive the story forward in certain directions. And on the opposite side of things, I also have to say that Charioce is one of the more interesting villains I've seen in quite some time. There's so much mystery regarding his true intentions and motives that pretty much up until the very last few episodes of the anime, you still don't know for sure if he's really good or evil, or why he's doing any of the things he is. Yet at the same time he's extremely charismatic, and the peculiar Romeo & Juliet-esque relationship he forms with Nina throughout the story is very unorthodox in nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe world-building in Virgin Soul is also excellent. It truly feels like a living and breathing fantasy world in its own right, and it helps magnifying the importance of the consequences of any major event that takes place. And there truly are a lot of major events in it, with its large scale storyline and grandiose vocal + instrumental soundtrack. It just feels epic in general, but without being excessively overdramatized. But unfortunately, for some reason the story just can't keep up all the way to the end. I can't really go into detail without spoiling some of the biggest plot points, but basically there are several plot twists towards the end of the anime which quite frankly don't make any sense. They undermine the credibility of large portions of the anime's storyline leading up to that point, and as a result it leaves you with a bad taste in the mouth by the time you actually finish the show. Of course this is only a small part of the anime as a whole, but the ending is pretty important for a story like this, so seeing them slip up at the end like this is a bit frustrating. Especially considering that it's the second time in a row it has happened for the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, for the most part Virgin Soul is still a very good fantasy adventure anime in my opinion, even more so than its predecessor, and while it certainly left a lot more to be desired in the end, ultimately the level of the journey leading up that point is enough to make up for it. I also firmly believe this is an anime which most people will enjoy regardless of what your usual genre preferences may be. Honestly I generally dislike action anime and typical battle shounen adventures even more so, but I like this anime quite a bit. Virgin Soul just feels more believable than most series of this genre. No one feels unreasonably overpowered in this story, it's not too predictable and other than the disappointing plot twists towards the end, the various motives for its rather diverse character cast are quite logical. Even when it does go into action scenes, every move feels perfectly plausible based on the characters' own writing, and you don't see any forced turnarounds as a result of plot-convenient power-ups or dumb luck. It all feels relatively fair.\\n\\n\r\nVirgin Soul is a solid continuation to an already good anime, making great use of its world-building and characterization to deliver a very enjoyable final product. Yes, the ending kind of sucks (again) but don't let that discredit the quality of the show leading up to that point. Overall it's still one of the better adventure anime in the last few years.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul aired in spring 2017, Animation by studio MAPPA.\r\nI'll write this review presuming that the reader has watched the prequel.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story of SNB:VS takes place in the same world as its' prequel, but 10 years after the events of Bahamut's ressurection and fall. \r\nDuring those 10 years, Charioce XVII (the new king) has destroyed the demon capital of Cocytus as well as invaded sanctums of the gods. The demons are now enslaved and the Rag Demon (Azazel) is seeking revenge and to free his brethren.\r\nWe currently follow the dragon/girl Nina as our main character, but have yet to see muchplot development except for her being thirsty for young men, stupid and extremely powerful.\\n\r\nThe plot of SNB:VS is not as immediate as it's prequel, but I daresay that it might have more potential. It's a 24 episode show and we are most certainly missing something in the current story as well as a few characters that are bound to show up later. The reason for me saying this is that the prequel packed an extreme amount of content into a 1-cour show, it was executed well but it could have been more elaborate if given the time.\\n\r\nThe plot is not generic, it could be regarded as an anime original due to its' source material being quite unclear. There is a manga called Twin Heads but it's a prequel to Virgin Soul. The story originates from a card collecting mobile game.\\n\r\nWhat will happen in the end? Will Bahamut rise again? It's not as clear what exactly will happen compared to the prequel.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nStudio MAPPA did a great job in this department, it's quality throughout the episodes and I have trouble finding anything to complain on. So far, they've improved on the art of the prequel, although we have yet to see any extremely high-qual scenes like the scene with Lucifer in the prequel yet. Looking forward!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nGreat OP and ED songs. the OST of SNB \"Chorus of Despair\" is also a gem.\\n\r\nThe sound effects are almost all high quality.\\n\r\nCharacters have good voice actors, especially Rita.\\n\r\nAn interesting point about the sound in this series is how it uses different sound filters depending on the environment, same with prequel. Just one easily regognizable example of this would be that you can hear echoing in the throne room, and the voices sound a bit more metallic. It's clear that Studio MAPPA didn't cut corners on neither Art/animation nor sound.\\n\r\nThe only VA I could \"complain\" slightly on is Azazel, it might also be that either the character has changed slightly but he definitely doesn't sound like he used to in some moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nWe have Rita, Nina, Kaisar, Azazel, Bacchus&Hansa, Mugaro and Charioce as our main cast currently. We are still missing Favaro.\\n\r\nBacchus gets a lot more screentime and even some character development in this season, we now know that he really is a fallen god and that he can reclaim his place in heaven. He's still got a great voice actor and his facial expressions are golden.\\n\r\nEven though Nina is the real current MC, Azazel is fairly similar to it. He has a lot of screentime and the history between him and Charioce with the demon capital being destroyed and the demons enslaved makes him a great protagonist to fight against Charioce who is the current antagonist, I do have a feeling that something will change about this in the future however.\\n\r\nNina is a sweet girl who has a lot of weirdness surrounding her. We know that she is a dragon, but she can only change into one when she gets aroused. She also has no memories of when she turns into a dragon and is probably connected to Bahamut in some way.\\n\r\nMugaro (M/F?) is a mysterious character who will receive a lot of attention, but we currently know little of him apart from his powers.\\n\r\nRita and Kaisar currently fills a supportive role, they are missing FAVAROO to become the unbeatable trio.\\n\r\nEvery character in this show is unique and interesting, it truly deserves a 10 in this area.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nWhile the specs of this show are mostly top-notch, the episodes feel quite short. It's a 24 episode show so things are bound to be more elaborate and slowly paced than a 1-cour show, which means that the enjoyment factor will change in the future. The most enjoyable current parts are definitely the comedy in it. The battles are handled well but it's still too early in the series to really enjoy them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis is a show that has LOTS of potential. studio MAPPA are not cutting corners when it comes to animation and there is a lot of room for the story to develop over these 24 episodes. The characters are all great and unique but we are still missing a few of them, which means that before I can give this show a flashy 10, I need to see more of it. Definitely one of the best shows of spring 2017.",

            "content": "This anime will probably never get a 3rd season since it has done so poorly but besides all that its a decent enough series it def isnt as good as the first season and part of that reason is because of the entire nina and chris dynamic which really takes the series from like an 8 to a 6. \r\nIf you've watched season one you know how great the ending was i've grown to appreciate it more over the years but it was really good it defintely didn't need a second season in my eyes but they gave it a second season so like mostfans i was excited but then you see nina and not favaro and it leaves a sour taste in ya mouth personally i didnt care because she was so eccentric and just had a lot of high energy so i liked her the season was good for a whlle but then the king comes in he's basically made a society in which the demons are slaves to the humans and has some crazy ass army with magic powers and shit at first you'd think his only purpose was to be an asshole.. but cool hes a basic character then you have to factor in nina dragon changing ability at first it was whenever she became attracted to a guy she would turn into a dragon fast forward her meeting the king for the first time but the king is disguised and basically helps her out when a bunch of dudes were tryna beat her up or some shit llike that my memory isnt the best bare with me she ends up falling for him not knowing hes the king  and because she ends up falling for him shes the only guy she is now attracted to her first love and he is the only person at that point which can turn her into a dragon. I thought the king would use her and the story would go in that direction but it didnt  and that was my problem her loving the king him clearly having feelings but repressing them and him being a terrible dictator yet she still loves him. Her completely negating all the shit hes done because shes in love is retarded and it ruins the series in my books. They had previous characters from season one bacchus,jean,zombie girl,kaisar and favaro even back when favaro came back i was hyped but then he didn't really contribute much to the season even though in the moments where he did help nina out they were great but having nina as the main character and having favaro exist being a much better fleshed out character also made the series suffer. I'm just gonna skip to the ending it was good and bad but because it left me kind of frustrated i'll side with the bad more than the good. The fact that jean and Azazel  allowed the king to live when they had the chance to kill him is beyond me the fight with the bahamut was a cup of coffee the result of the bahamut with nina ending up becoming mute and is unable to speak while the king has become blind in both eyes... i mean wtf kind of shit is that. The good about the ending was nina meeting amira in the light of the bahamut which was cool but it didnt last long nor was much of anything and then the scene where favaro tells everyone hes leaving this occurs after the fight and nina and the others are having a meal she goes with him and ends up writing out a message on the ground because she cant speak anymore she tells favaro that she met amira in the light of the bahamut and relays a message she told her during that moment for favaro that was really cool but other than that the final episode was dissapointing the entire season has been disspointing and its a shame there was many good moments in this season but towards the ending half of the series it was very wishy washy and ended up falling off a cliff. Its not a bad season but it doesn't live up to how good the first season was so its a dissapointment. It really did not need a second season at all.",

The art and music continue to be mesmerising and breathtaking, but both of which cannot compensate for the lack of good storytelling and character developments. \r\nThe story in general has a great plot going for them that has sociopolitical tones which follows after the events in the first anime, but is frustratingly overwhelmed by a romantic subplot that is arguably unnecessary, and ludicrous. The female protagonist was wasted on said romantic subplot although she was formerly presented as an individual who was not onlyvastly intriguing, but also reasonably appealing. Not the same could be said with the other characters, most of whom do return to the screen, unwaveringly charming and significant. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am vastly disappointed and infuriated with the turn of events in the anime that could all have been avoided if the writers had decided to not add said subplot.",

            "content": "It's honestly disappointing that I have to write this review because I adored Genesis. But for some reason they decided it was a good idea to turn a adventure fantasy anime into a soap opera with one of the worst romances between two of the worst characters I've ever had the displeasure of watching in an anime. While the visuals are gorgeous, the same can't be said for the plot or characters. Ironically, the only characters that are enjoyable are the ones from Genesis. But even that enjoyment is short lived since the writers of this season go above and beyond to shit on thosecharacters while propping up the horrible new ones. Nina who starts off as an enjoyable and energetic character turns into this mentally handicapped lovestruck idiot who constantly makes questionable decisions that ends up hurting her own friends. And the old cast from Genesis are either treated horribly or used as a mouthpiece for the writers to justify the nonsense in this series. And this leads to the character that I have the biggest problem with, Charioce. The definition of Gary Stu, nothing goes wrong for this guy and despite the fact that he's a horrible person, the writers try to justify it with the whole \"he did it for the great good\" nonsense which immediately falls apart if you even slightly think about it. This series is a cautionary tale of how not to make a sequel and is an insult to it's great and fun predecessor Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis.",

            "content": "My pulse is still a bit high after this experience that was \u201cShingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul\u201d. When I heard that a 24-episode sequel to \u201cShingeki no Bahamut: Genesis\u201d was to be released, I was both part overly excited and part anxious. I loved the prequel, it instantly became one of my all-time favourites. So, naturally I was very nervous when I was watching the first episode of \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d, would it be as good as Genesis? \r\nI would have been satisfied with just half as good, but was rewarded with, that yes, it was indeed as good as Genesis. Or maybe even little betterbecause it had the double amount of episodes, which they used with exactly right sorts of material. You know, right amount of background stories, that fill up the gaps from the past 10 years since the prequel, and on world building. The extra time also gives the opportunity to knot every main and side character together in a story-wise appealing way, which neither forces their interaction or totally neglect it. \\n\\n\r\nWell balanced, is the short term I seek to give a fast summarize of \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d. Just as it\u00b4s prequel, \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d mixes fantasy, adventure, action, drama, comedy, magic and romance in such a fluent and balanced manor. \\n\\n\r\nAnd leaves me now with mixed feelings. I\u00b4m equally satisfied and sad that the adventure is over. The story, the characters, the action and the fights, the friendships and the romance, the epic adventures, and not to speak of the awesome animation and choreography, makes \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d shine like a star. Especially compared to many other shows this past two seasons, it is in its own league. I\u00b4m going to be honest, I\u00b4m absolutely biased. Not only cover \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d my favourite mix of genres, its execution, in my eyes, it\u2019s done in an absolute perfect manor, and certainly worth the title masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nNow, when I got that of my chest, let\u00b4s talk about \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d in a little more practical way.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place 10 years after the end of the prequel. I highly recommend you to watch the prequel first, it makes the sequel 10 x more enjoyable. A lot have changed since that last destructive battle with Bahamut. Humans have with their new king Charioce XVII in the lead, turned their backs to the Gods and are ransacking their holy temples for power. The humans have used that power to attack the Demons Capital, and forced even the strongest demons into hiding. The ones not so lucky to escape, was turned into slaves to rebuild the Human Capital, Anatea. Demons are also forced to fight as gladiators, used for experiments, and to work as prostitutes. The gods have so far stand hand fallen at the march of the humans, and desperately seeks the one child that can turn the war to their favour.  Only one Demon and his mysterious companion, seem to fight for the imprisoned demons, the Rag Demon. Disguised, he attacks and kills slave traders, soldiers, and noblemen that do horrific things to demons. Kaisar, now Captain of the Orleans Knights, are pressed by king Charioce, to obtain the Rag Demon at all costs. Rita now works as a doctor, and do everything in her usual calm, cool zombie manor.\\n\\n\r\nAnd perfectly oblivious to all of it, Nina Dragno, a teenage girl from the far East who has come to the city for work, lands in the middle of everything. As the story progresses, the fates of those who was around last time, and new faces, are drawn together, and starts to spiral towards the inevitable ending.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is the start ground of one hell of an adventure-fantasy-romance story. As in the prequel, they manage to weave this story web as neatly as ever. It\u00b4s coherent, balanced, and even paced. They manage to link the story to the prequel, so the characters actions get more weight behind them without feeling forced. Not many unnecessary, words or conversations. Their exchanges bear all meaning and clues to the plot, and how different characters are connected. They do a great job with keeping us in what\u2019s happening and why, by cut in previous scenes that gives the information you need, and knit the story together. \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d has little slower pace than \u201cGenesis\u201d, but it has twice it\u00b4s time and the little shift of pace only left room for more exploring of the characters and the world setting. Like, why is he or she in that particular situation, with this or that character, or in that mind set. \\n\\n\r\n*A tip while watching, many of the episodes have extra material relevant to the plot after the ED-song. So, if you not want to miss anything, check the remaining minutes of the episode when the ED starts. It\u00b4s a good chance that there is more material.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of actions having consequences, are highly applied in the \u201cShingeki no Bahamut\u201d-series. You can feel the brutality of deaths, the emotional scars they leave, and what those scars can lead to. That, is no small task to manage to display on screen. To provoke and establish those type of emotions, make me feel for the characters, their cause, and why they are fighting. That is what makes the fight scenes and action so good. I could feel the underlaying conviction, rage, determination, vengeance, love, or the regrets that drives the character. \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d have them all. It for sure has it\u00b4s lights part as well, which creates a very harmonic contrast. A warm delicious meal, with companions in a fairy tale cosy setting, or an everyday errand that ends up in an unlikely encounter, or the shopping for some goodies in a small shop, or a dance at a festival, are all details of light and easy happiness. The mood of \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d skews towards more darker tones the later half of the show, which makes the warm and happy parts clench your heart an extra bit more.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are as well fleshed out as they can be. Their background stories, developments, relationships, and personalities are all satisfyingly explored and coherent. And here have \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d managed to do what so many before them have failed with, all the main and side characters feel equally important and interesting. In many shows, you get the feeling that many of the side characters are just there to make the protagonists look good or better than they are. That\u00b4s not the case for the characters in \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d, each of them are equally exciting to watch, and they all feels important to the plot. Some minor details, can at first seem very clich\u00e9, but are turned and used in a very heart-warming way, at least I could see the beauty of it. Of course, the personalities are exaggerated, this is anime after all. But, for me, it only highlights what\u00b4s \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d is all about. It\u00b4s about epic battles, people, and monsters. It\u00b4s about adventure, love, and hardships. It\u00b4s about family, bravery, vengeance, betrayal, and choices. About people brought together to write history. \\n\\n\r\nI\u00b4ve read some complaints about Nina\u00b4s character, but I have only positive things to say about her. Nina was a fresh breath of air as a fantasy-heroine to me. She isn\u00b4t overly pretty, or overly smart, and for sure not a damsel in distress. She is however, independent, wild, caring, strong, fast, carefree, brave, and positive. Her character felt multi-layered, believable, and relatable to me. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an overall theme for the characters in the series, they have their personal traits, but are for sure not static. The things they go through, how they handle it, and how they grow from it as individuals, is just as different as it would be for you and me. Their reactions to certain events, felt in harmony with their character, but in the same time left them space to grow and change in a believable way.     \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is outstanding, to put it short. Dramatical orchestral music, during those intense battle scenes, beautiful and peace giving tones for the light and happy moments, and heart-clenching pieces for the emotional scenes. They even have some nice opera pieces. Can just say \u201cAaaawe\u201d, and thank you for their good work. The sound effects are always spot on, and matches the great visuals perfectly. I could feel the impact of someone thrown into a stone wall, the power of an energy blast land, the rubble raining down across the city, or the chilling sound of a sword leaving its sheath. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors (Japanese) are outdoing themselves, each character is well matched with it\u00b4s voice actor. The cold and powerful voice Charioce, the honourable and passionate voice of Kaisar, the positive and carefree voice of Nina, the calm and un-faced voice of Rita, the desperate and rage filled voice of Azazel, and the fierce and strong voice of Jeanne D\u00b4Arc - they are all spot on. They made me cry and laugh many times during my watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation, direction, and choreography is in its own league. Top notch, it doesn\u00b4t get much better than this. Half the budget most`ve been spent on the characters eyes and faces, for not to speak of the backgrounds. The facial expression is so clear and intense, brought forth by those masterly done eyes. You can see the slightest shift in an emotion, how much they communicate with them. Bright colours and light are used to lift a burning determination, surprise, or warmth. The scenery is always gorgeous; no matter if it\u00b4s a bird\u00b4s view of the Capital with its stone and wooden houses and enormous lake, or the shiny lands of the gods, or a local festival with its tents, foods, dances and fireworks. It all looks positively stunning. The choreography is bloody perfect, the movements of the characters or objects, the angles they are followed in, are just so darn awesome. Just watch and see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSo, did I enjoy \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d? I think it is pretty clear that I enjoyed it a hell of a lot. Each episode felt like a well-rounded satisfying piece in the adventure that was \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d to me. Best damned thing I watched since its prequel earlier this year. And I\u00b4m quite thrilled that the show leaves it open for a continuation. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were as awesome as ever, the story as interesting as ever, the battles as badass as ever, the romance one of the best I seen in a long while, the art and animation reached new heights, and the music was mind-baffling. \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d just landed on my all-time favourite list, no questions asked. Hands down, this was bloody awesome. Thanks again, studio MAPPA, who once again shows that they are a studio to be reckon with.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhere does the wind blow? It blows towards tomorrow.\u201d \\n",

            "content": "I've spent the whole of yesterday watching the first season. Then the first episode of  the second season and after realizing it's inferior, I fast-forwarded the rest of the second season up to the 20th episode.\r\nSimply put, the second season is a disaster, a letdown, really boring and overall bad. The first season in contrast felt a bit more mature, straightforward and to the point, while the second one has twice the episodes, some episodes feel like 90% fillers and 10% content or useless flashbacks taking up to 90% of the episode when they can take about 30% (at best) and leave the restfor the story to unfold so that it all falls into 12 episodes again.\\n\\n\r\nIt feels to me like this show has deteriorated the same way Shingeki no Kyojin did (similar names irony pun maybe?) - they both started out good in their first season, but at the second one went on, it became clear that they are being dragged to make more money rather than leave the viewers satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what made me dislike the second season:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters - the new protagonist is a girl with striking similarities to the old one that kinda died a little (or whatever) - both are naive, both are obsessed with eating, both have a funny side, in season 2's case, the protagonist gets uncomfortable near hot men and while this can be fun to see one or two times at best throughout the show, it gets boring, WHEN IT'S HAPPENING A COUPLE OF TIMES EACH EPISODE. It also really bothers me how the two (remaining) protagonists from season 1 feel like secondary characters in season 2, one of which actually makes an appearance during THE MIDDLE of season 2 and most of the primary characters in season 2 are either new ones or ex-secondary ones from season 1.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and setting - while season 1 felt more like One Piece (characters traveling around the world, seeing new locations), season 2 feels more like Naruto (characters spending the entirety of the show in the same few locations).\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of the show - the theme has changed between season 1 and 2 - while in season 1 it was more serious and dramatic, in season 2 it has become more light-hearted and funny, relying on stupid puns to pass the time and I really hate that in anime I watch (if you check my profile, it says I like serious and thought-provoking anime such as Mushishi for example contrary to stupid ones relying on puns to pass time) and ones as Shingeki no Bahamut season 2 are pissing me off to the point I might even give anime a break, but I won't because there are still very good ones that I wouldn't want to miss out on. xD\\n\\n\r\nIf you've read this far into it, thank you for taking your time to read my take on this show and I hope this review helps you decide how you spend your time better rather than get you angry at me because we have differing opinions.",

            "content": "If you want to learn how to screw up a hero's journey story, a love story and a \"good all along\" story - all at the same time - look no further than Virgin Soul.\r\nI don't think i've seen an anime trip over itself more in its 3rd act than this one, and it's a real shame, because for the most part you have a cast of characters that mesh really well together. Even though I found Jean D'Arc and the angels quite boring and they suck up a lot of screen time in the 2nd half, that's really only the beginning of Virgin Soul'sproblems.\\n\\n\r\nVirgin Soul starts off 10 years after the events of the 1st season. I wouldn't recommend watching this without first having seen the prequel.. but I wouldn't recommend this anime at all to begin with. But i'm getting ahead of myself -  our main character this time around is Nina, a bubbly and energetic young girl looking for an adventurous new life in the capital. Over time, she eventually gets entangled with familiar cast members, although you'll have to be patient for some to arrive.\\n\\n\r\nThe villain - at first - seems to be the stern and unwavering young King Charioce, who has enslaved and killed thousands of demons and angels with a powerful magic bestowed on his personal army, effectively placing humans at the top of the world's food chain. Nina, befriending characters such as Jean, Bacchus and Azazel, is very much aware of this and vows to join their efforts to stop him.\\n\\n\r\nBut then.. well, our little starlet Nina unknowingly falls in love with him. And you could forgive some young puppy love - especially if you don't know your crush is a genocidal psychopath hellbent on world domination. But then it keeps going - even after she realizes who he actually is, she insists that he should be spared - because how could her naive feelings possibly be wrong? And thus Nina goes from being the ambitious, likable young sprout to a completely insufferable, selfish brat who consistently screws over her friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all this culminates to what has to be one of the most confused, muddied and bizarre disasters of a 3rd act of a story. There's only so much I can give away without completely spoiling the entire sorry excuse of a story, but I will say this - the plot \"twists\" are totally insulting to the audience, and everything that made this franchise good gets sidelined in favor of shoving in a totally unappealing romantic sideplot as the crux of the 2nd half.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episodes, while exciting and heartwrenching for brief moments, are totally baffling. That the writers thought audiences would buy into everything that was shoehorned into this anime legitimately puzzles me. And how all of Nina's friends weren't absolutely infuriated with her is equally confusing - but also probably just lazy writing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that is really the main issue with Virgin Soul. The set-up is fantastic, but it can't deliver on one-upping itself. Maybe the writers got lost in the story and simply ran out of time to come up with a good ending. We'll probably never know. And it doesn't matter. What matters is that in the end, Virgin Soul is a great example of what NOT to do with the story paths the writers chose to follow.\\n\\n\r\nIf they had found a way to wrap up the story in a neat bow in 12 episodes, I would have recommended this anime. But it kept going, and it kept getting worse, and they ruined it. I only give it a 4/10 because I did enjoy the first half - a solid 8/10. The 2nd half is more like a 2/10. So yeah - if someone gave you a sandwich with random splotches of mold on it, would you eat it? You can't cut it in half and only eat the good parts. You've got to eat ALL of it. Don't go into this anime without expecting to be let down.",

The story focuses on a new character Nina this time around and the old characters such as Favaro and Kaiser, while still important to the story, they play more of a supporting role this season. I thought the story was enjoyable overall although I'm probably being more lenient than most others. The writing in the story does have it's issues, especially in the second half of the season.\r\nThe art and the animation were outstanding and I feel as if it was a step up from what the first seasonwas if I'm remembering it right. Also the soundtrack did a fabulous job of setting the atmosphere for the anime. The characters were good but the way some of them were handled could have been better.\\n\r\nOverall I had a great time with Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul and I thought it was near the level of where the previous season was.",

The Background sounds in fights or in emotional moments enhance the feelings that the show wants you to express.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\n It has some Clishee characters like the King or Azazel but still it has a good main cast Nina which continues the good female part like in the prequel.\\n\r\nEvery characters backgrounds get explained really good so that you feel with them as they die or have epic moments. Same Thing as in the Story Section \\n\r\nthe ending for each character felt a little bit to swift thats why only can give 8 Points.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymend: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the anime not only  because I'm a fan of fantasy but also of great emotional storys and musicial background.Each episode got me really \\n\r\nexcited and through the good animation i felt entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nto summerize the whole show i would say that if you have a thing for fantasy storys with great characters and good animation you should watch this and the prequel.",

Storytelling is great, I don't need to see the first season to understand what's going on. I can see the progress is being made, but not character's developments since it's just the beginning of the show. The humor doesn't feelforceful at all, I've had some good laugh, but shit does get real when it needs to. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is on point. It makes the atmosphere really immersive. There is CGI mostly used for the background characters, but they are definately not perfunetorily, but very detail, lifeful and connect with the scene instead. They really put a lot of budget and effort into this. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is kinda meh. Maybe it's because I've heard to much from top-tier producers. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, this is being the most enjoyable show of this season for me till date. One thing I wound recommend is to wait till it has finished and then watch it all at once, since you would probably forget about it in a week or so to focus on AoT or Hero Academia.\\n\\n",

The beginning and middle were really enjoyable and I was eager to watch the next episode, but the last severalepisodes leading to the end were just plain wtf, and that very last part where they opened it up for a third season SHOULD had made me happy, but instead it gave me the feeling that they were using that as an excuse to be lazy with the ending. With Genesis we had a concise and proper ending that made me super hyped for the inevitable sequel. Here though, it just makes me concerned for season 3 considering what they did to Virgin Souls' ending. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, avoid this like a plague, but if you haven't watched the first season, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, then do yourself a favaro and do it.

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was a fun, vibrant, swashbuckling adventure in such a clusterfuck setting. To quote Tolkien's \"On Fairy Stories\", it's a Secondary World that does not inspire Secondary Belief. But it works for the kind of story Genesis attempted. Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul attempts to expound on that simple narrative with a far more ambitious story, one that is set up to fail in the light of the world built in Genesis. The established world simply does not hold up to scrutiny once a more serious narrative repeatedly brings forth its glaring flaws.\r\nVirgin Soul is set 10 years after the events ofGenesis, under a new social equilibrium and power dynamic of a new world order. Enter the ubermensch, super-powered, menacingly armored humans under the control of the king. With humanity's newfound might, they now waged war upon gods and demons. The latter has been soundly defeated years ago and made slaves under the cruel whip of the species they once tormented.\\n\\n\r\nHere, the most glaring problem arises almost immediately. Ethics, morality, socio-economic realities, these are such complicated concepts for a setting with so many holes and so many facets still left unestablished.\\n\\n\r\nThe power dynamics introduced in Genesis is one where humans fight an eternal war with demons, with the occasional help from the gods thrown in. One can infer from the events in Genesis that humans are merely proxy in the wars of the gods and demons. It's so simplistic in nature and now that the wheels had turned, you cannot bring yourself to care. Now humanity has the upper hand and by god, they have every right to hold demons in contempt and to flaunt their power against the gods whose whims and fancy they are no longer under the mercy of.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what is ethics? At what state of social equilibrium is this world under? How do they view slavery? A necessary evil in rebuilding? A proof of humanity's triumph? This should clue you in to how secure or how tenuous the king's hold is and how the events of the story changes that.\\n\\n\r\nOn the side of the gods, their effort to bring humanity back into their fold calls forth into question the benefits of such an arrangement. Aside from ready cannon fodder which seems to be composed entirely of one kingdom, there is no other stated benefit for their leader to be feverish about. There is still the matter of survival, though certain conversations side-line that in favor of the idea that humanity, that the sheep has strayed from the flock and requires a shepherd. Or maybe the gods are the supreme arbiter of the world order? Except that the events of Genesis says otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is faith? How does it work in pantheon of what seems to be a shit-ton of deities? Are angels gods? Are they minor deities? What do they inspire in people? We have a world where deities have physical manifestations. Surely its not your usual Abrahamic belief?\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to be invested in a setting you keep questioning. Other reviewers will say the failure of Virgin Soul lies in the characters or the story. They are wrong. The failure of Virgin Soul lies in the setting that should have given more depth to the story and more nuance to the characters and their decisions.\\n\\n\r\nExploring nuance in the politics and ethics of a setting with the barest of social equilibrium... it's simply isn't done. Especially so when much of the meat of Virgin Soul before the final third of its runtime is an attempt at that.\\n\\n\r\nNot much else can be said about Virgin Soul. If you know your Gaise Macon, your Arthas Menethil, your Lelouch Lamperouge, then you've seen this story done better, even by such an infinitesimal degree.",

Strong, silent, has a gentle side, easily misunderstood, passionate to his cause, and serious but with a fun side too!\r\nAnd I also love that they made the main female character strong and capable.

At first I didn't like the way she looked (didn't look as beautiful as the other main female characters) but the way she presented her emotions and her frankness really captivated me. Indeed I must admit I enjoyed both main characters a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT! As far as the plot, it made sense to me...even up at the point where Nina is betrayed by Charioce. I not only understood why he did it but admire him for it! I believe he was trying to protect her and everyone else as well as being committed to his original cause. Who likes a wavering heart!\\n\\n\r\nI just couldn't get enough of the moments of Charioce and Nina, I wish there were more! And the end...as sad as it is, I'm glad it's not the usual happy ending where everyone comes out okay and everything is as before.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are drawn so beautifully too that you can't help but have the hots for some of them.",

            "content": "This review will contain major  for both Season 1 and Season 2. So, for anyone who does not want to be spoiled, please watch the anime before reading this review.\r\nSo, Shingeki no Bahmut: Virgin Soul. The much anticipated sequel to the 2014 anime (in my opinion) Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis finally aired it's 24th and final episode and boy was it a major let down. Let me get straight into it.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe story picks up 10 years after our heroes have saved the planet from a certain destruction. And what did they get for their selfless sacrifice? Favaro is MIA for half the seasonand Kaiser in stuck in stagnation as the commander of a dying-out military force. Some nobody is out of the blue named King and is following closely in the footsteps of an all-to-familiar 1939-1945 dictator from west Europe. Janne is exiled for reasons beyond my understanding. Demons are discriminated and considered as trash, angels are being massacred left and right for no reason and humans are just kind-of there. A NEW character is introduced, without any background or foreshadowing, without any character development or contribution and we're somehow supposed to jump aboard.\\n\r\nSkip a few episodes (23 to be precise) and we come to the conclusion where, SURPRISINGLY all the bad guys turn out to be ACTUALLY good guys, some people die, get forgotten and the BAD guys, who turned GOOD guys get to live happily ever after as heroes. Sound like LeLouche? Well, it's LeLouce only without him dying but instead getting everything he wanted and more.\\n\r\n(those of you, who actually sit through this 24 episode of time-waste will understand)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nJust like the prequel, the art in this sequel is top-notch. It's not on the level of Unlimited CashWorks but it will leave you satisfied if visual effects are all you're looking for.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLet's get this straight - the bad-ass opening from season 1 is gone and it's not coming back. The OP and ED in this sequel are not worth mentioning and the soundtrack in the actual anime is almost forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nBland villains, bland main character, little to no character development, lots and LOTS of plot armor for the important characters. NO plot armor for the side characters. Not really the strong point of this anime (much like the story). Bad guys turning good - cliche as cliches get. The true bad guy defeated, but not really, so that a 3rd season cash-grab can be made - check! If you're into mindless action and shallow storytelling, with little to no character presence, then this anime is PERFECT for you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymend: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the anime had potential. The second half ruined it all with it's horrendous storytelling, cliche characters and predictable plot. Not to mention the sacrifice of key characters without their contribution to the story being fully told. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could give it a lower score but the average from the above 5 categories prevents me from doing so. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize: if you are into a shallow story, with bland characters, no development, lots of minutes (potentially hours) wasted in idle chatter, some battles and some moral discussions, all leading to a predictable ending (with a few sad but overall overlooked deaths here and there) then this anime is definitely for you (poor soul). \\n\\n\r\nI do hope we NEVER see a third sequel, as that will most certainly butcher an already massacred anime.",

            "content": "I will be starting this with a warning: If you are looking for fast paced action, suave dialogue, likable characters and great fight choreography\u2026 which is to say, an actual sequel to Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, then turn back right now. Close this tab and never look back at this show. This is not the sequel that Genesis deserved\u2026 or even one that it needed, looking at the end result. Virgin Soul can only be described as a convoluted mess, which not even the returning characters could save.\r\nIf that wasn\u2019t descriptive enough, then read on. Below, I will attempt to explain exactly what went wrongwith Virgin Soul. Do expect some minor spoilers with regard to the initial few episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Virgin Soul starts 10 years after the events of Genesis, and the world is quite different from how we remember it. Humanity has extended its reaches, as far as to bring demon-kind to its knees, while achieving great power along the way. These changes bring with them quite some intrigue, and world-building progresses at an optimal pace. Then, they introduce the new protagonist, Nina Drango. Even ignoring her endless libido and her shoujo manga-esque encounters with pretty much any young man, the story seems to be progressing somewhere. The themes of morality and sociology were quite strong in the initial few episodes, especially from the likes of returning characters such as Kaisar and Azazel. So far so good\u2026\\n\r\nThen, somewhere along the way, the series started on a downward spiral that never really stopped. The intelligent conversations and ideas just slowly faded out into the background, and the focus moved on to a romance which would make the likes of Twilight look half decent. I can state without doubt that the romance in Virgin Soul is the worst I have ever witnessed on screen. One could hope that at least this subplot may help develop the characters in question\u2026 well, in this case, it outright broke the character of the male participant, making his personality impossible to salvage.\\n\r\nThe rest of the story can\u2019t exactly be called intelligent, with multiple contradictory or even outright stupid reveals and \u2018plot twists\u2019. Worst thing is, every single thing just somehow leads back to the central romance, which just sucks the life out of the series. Honestly, if this were advertised as a shoujo anime which was unrelated to Shingeki no Bahamut, it may not have felt like such an insult, but the way it went, it simply became a detriment to its \u2018prequel\u2019. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are quite reminiscent of Genesis, and are quite pleasing to look at. The only real gripe I have is how they use some outright atrocious crowd CGI in some scenes, which seem completely out of place.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nAbove average, but nothing really special. The openings and endings are all decent, yet forgetful. All the Engrish in the songs didn\u2019t exactly help that. Even the soundtracks weren\u2019t anything to write home about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest failure of Virgin Soul was certainly the depiction of the characters and their interactions. I\u2019ll be analysing this in two parts: New characters and Returning characters.\\n\r\nWhen talking about the New characters, the first and foremost would be Nina Drango. The best way to describe her would be a female version of Hyoudou Issei. She spends most of her time drooling over any good-looking guy (which, for some reason, seems to be the norm for men in this show), and the rest of her time utterly wrecking the sho\u2026. Umm\u2026 Causing trouble for others. Other than her, we have Charioce and Mugaro. Charioce had some great potential, and his views were quite intriguing to begin with\u2026 but of course, they decided that he was better off as a pretty-boy version of Hitler. As for Mugaro\u2026. He was literally a walking plot device from beginning to end.\\n\r\nAs for the Returning characters, we have Favaro, Kaisar and Azazel (well, there was Jeanne, Bacchus, Hamsa and Rita, but they\u2019re not really worth mentioning at this point). We start off with quite a bit about Kaisar and his views. This was interesting while it lasted, but he started to become more and more insufferable as the series went on. Near the end of it, you\u2019d be left wondering if it\u2019s even the same character anymore. As for Favaro, I had great hopes for him. He flourished in the leading role of Genesis, and I was hoping that he would breathe some life into the show\u2026 sadly, all he got was a minor supporting role as Nina\u2019s father-figure. The one good character that we got out of this series was Azazel. His development was exceptional. He portrays a loner, in the truest sense of the word \u2013 he fights alone, and takes the full brunt of the responsibilities for himself, including the failures.\\n\r\nOne strange thing I noticed is how the characters were never particularly consistent, and their behaviour varied quite wildly from episode to episode. The character interactions ranged from decent to horrendous, depending on the characters in question and the mood of the writer at that time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10):\\n\\n\r\nExtremely difficult to watch. My tolerance for bullshit is generally pretty high, but this one made me absolutely lose it. There were some moments in the latter half of the show that made me scream abuse and point rude gestures at the screen, simply because of how frustrating and annoying it was. Watching this show made me question the writer\u2019s intelligence (or the lack thereof), at multiple occasions. I had to force myself to watch the last few episodes, just for the sake of finishing this review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4.4 ~ 4/10):\\n\\n\r\nWith this, it is quite clear that the anime was a disaster, and that the new writer was a mistake. In fact, I\u2019d be glad if she never touches anime ever again. So to speak, avoid this anime \u2013 there\u2019s absolutely nothing good waiting for you in this one. With this, I conclude.\\n",

            "content": "The original Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was perhaps one of the most surprising anime of the last few years in the sense that it was an ultra-rare case of a game adaptation that actually didn't suck. In fact, it was actually a really solid fantasy adventure, albeit perhaps not with the best ending. Virgin Soul can be roughly described as a more extreme version of the same pattern: it's even better than the original for the vast majority of its runtime... but also somehow has an even worse ending.\r\nVirgin Soul takes place approximately 10 years after the events of the original. At this point thehuman realm is the dominant force in the world, lead under the ruthless King Charioce XVII. He has managed to effectively steal the powers of the gods and used them in order to turn the demon residents in the capital area into slaves. Both Heaven and Hell have rebellious thoughts on their minds due to the oppression they're suffering, but they have a hard time doing much against the overwhelming power which Charioce possesses. It is here we find our new protagonist Nina Drango: a young and energetic bounty hunter who arrives at the capital seeking her fortune. As a tiny little catch, Nina has the ability to transform herself into a dragon, but only spontaneously, involuntarily and uncontrollably.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story goes on, many more characters are introduced, including both new ones and returning ones from Genesis. And what I really like about them is that they're not only extremely well characterized, but you get so many different perspectives about the conflict in place in Virgin Soul. It's not just that many of the characters are quite likable on a personal level, but the agendas of Heaven, Hell and the human realm respectively are all very logically depicted. It's a very balanced cast both in terms of differentiating back stories but also in terms of personalities. Nina herself may be extremely na\u00efve and overly optimistic, but that's also part of her charm and her personality is frequently played around with as a means to drive the story forward in certain directions. And on the opposite side of things, I also have to say that Charioce is one of the more interesting villains I've seen in quite some time. There's so much mystery regarding his true intentions and motives that pretty much up until the very last few episodes of the anime, you still don't know for sure if he's really good or evil, or why he's doing any of the things he is. Yet at the same time he's extremely charismatic, and the peculiar Romeo & Juliet-esque relationship he forms with Nina throughout the story is very unorthodox in nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe world-building in Virgin Soul is also excellent. It truly feels like a living and breathing fantasy world in its own right, and it helps magnifying the importance of the consequences of any major event that takes place. And there truly are a lot of major events in it, with its large scale storyline and grandiose vocal + instrumental soundtrack. It just feels epic in general, but without being excessively overdramatized. But unfortunately, for some reason the story just can't keep up all the way to the end. I can't really go into detail without spoiling some of the biggest plot points, but basically there are several plot twists towards the end of the anime which quite frankly don't make any sense. They undermine the credibility of large portions of the anime's storyline leading up to that point, and as a result it leaves you with a bad taste in the mouth by the time you actually finish the show. Of course this is only a small part of the anime as a whole, but the ending is pretty important for a story like this, so seeing them slip up at the end like this is a bit frustrating. Especially considering that it's the second time in a row it has happened for the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, for the most part Virgin Soul is still a very good fantasy adventure anime in my opinion, even more so than its predecessor, and while it certainly left a lot more to be desired in the end, ultimately the level of the journey leading up that point is enough to make up for it. I also firmly believe this is an anime which most people will enjoy regardless of what your usual genre preferences may be. Honestly I generally dislike action anime and typical battle shounen adventures even more so, but I like this anime quite a bit. Virgin Soul just feels more believable than most series of this genre. No one feels unreasonably overpowered in this story, it's not too predictable and other than the disappointing plot twists towards the end, the various motives for its rather diverse character cast are quite logical. Even when it does go into action scenes, every move feels perfectly plausible based on the characters' own writing, and you don't see any forced turnarounds as a result of plot-convenient power-ups or dumb luck. It all feels relatively fair.\\n\\n\r\nVirgin Soul is a solid continuation to an already good anime, making great use of its world-building and characterization to deliver a very enjoyable final product. Yes, the ending kind of sucks (again) but don't let that discredit the quality of the show leading up to that point. Overall it's still one of the better adventure anime in the last few years.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul aired in spring 2017, Animation by studio MAPPA.\r\nI'll write this review presuming that the reader has watched the prequel.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story of SNB:VS takes place in the same world as its' prequel, but 10 years after the events of Bahamut's ressurection and fall. \r\nDuring those 10 years, Charioce XVII (the new king) has destroyed the demon capital of Cocytus as well as invaded sanctums of the gods. The demons are now enslaved and the Rag Demon (Azazel) is seeking revenge and to free his brethren.\r\nWe currently follow the dragon/girl Nina as our main character, but have yet to see muchplot development except for her being thirsty for young men, stupid and extremely powerful.\\n\r\nThe plot of SNB:VS is not as immediate as it's prequel, but I daresay that it might have more potential. It's a 24 episode show and we are most certainly missing something in the current story as well as a few characters that are bound to show up later. The reason for me saying this is that the prequel packed an extreme amount of content into a 1-cour show, it was executed well but it could have been more elaborate if given the time.\\n\r\nThe plot is not generic, it could be regarded as an anime original due to its' source material being quite unclear. There is a manga called Twin Heads but it's a prequel to Virgin Soul. The story originates from a card collecting mobile game.\\n\r\nWhat will happen in the end? Will Bahamut rise again? It's not as clear what exactly will happen compared to the prequel.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nStudio MAPPA did a great job in this department, it's quality throughout the episodes and I have trouble finding anything to complain on. So far, they've improved on the art of the prequel, although we have yet to see any extremely high-qual scenes like the scene with Lucifer in the prequel yet. Looking forward!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nGreat OP and ED songs. the OST of SNB \"Chorus of Despair\" is also a gem.\\n\r\nThe sound effects are almost all high quality.\\n\r\nCharacters have good voice actors, especially Rita.\\n\r\nAn interesting point about the sound in this series is how it uses different sound filters depending on the environment, same with prequel. Just one easily regognizable example of this would be that you can hear echoing in the throne room, and the voices sound a bit more metallic. It's clear that Studio MAPPA didn't cut corners on neither Art/animation nor sound.\\n\r\nThe only VA I could \"complain\" slightly on is Azazel, it might also be that either the character has changed slightly but he definitely doesn't sound like he used to in some moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nWe have Rita, Nina, Kaisar, Azazel, Bacchus&Hansa, Mugaro and Charioce as our main cast currently. We are still missing Favaro.\\n\r\nBacchus gets a lot more screentime and even some character development in this season, we now know that he really is a fallen god and that he can reclaim his place in heaven. He's still got a great voice actor and his facial expressions are golden.\\n\r\nEven though Nina is the real current MC, Azazel is fairly similar to it. He has a lot of screentime and the history between him and Charioce with the demon capital being destroyed and the demons enslaved makes him a great protagonist to fight against Charioce who is the current antagonist, I do have a feeling that something will change about this in the future however.\\n\r\nNina is a sweet girl who has a lot of weirdness surrounding her. We know that she is a dragon, but she can only change into one when she gets aroused. She also has no memories of when she turns into a dragon and is probably connected to Bahamut in some way.\\n\r\nMugaro (M/F?) is a mysterious character who will receive a lot of attention, but we currently know little of him apart from his powers.\\n\r\nRita and Kaisar currently fills a supportive role, they are missing FAVAROO to become the unbeatable trio.\\n\r\nEvery character in this show is unique and interesting, it truly deserves a 10 in this area.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nWhile the specs of this show are mostly top-notch, the episodes feel quite short. It's a 24 episode show so things are bound to be more elaborate and slowly paced than a 1-cour show, which means that the enjoyment factor will change in the future. The most enjoyable current parts are definitely the comedy in it. The battles are handled well but it's still too early in the series to really enjoy them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis is a show that has LOTS of potential. studio MAPPA are not cutting corners when it comes to animation and there is a lot of room for the story to develop over these 24 episodes. The characters are all great and unique but we are still missing a few of them, which means that before I can give this show a flashy 10, I need to see more of it. Definitely one of the best shows of spring 2017.",

            "content": "This anime will probably never get a 3rd season since it has done so poorly but besides all that its a decent enough series it def isnt as good as the first season and part of that reason is because of the entire nina and chris dynamic which really takes the series from like an 8 to a 6. \r\nIf you've watched season one you know how great the ending was i've grown to appreciate it more over the years but it was really good it defintely didn't need a second season in my eyes but they gave it a second season so like mostfans i was excited but then you see nina and not favaro and it leaves a sour taste in ya mouth personally i didnt care because she was so eccentric and just had a lot of high energy so i liked her the season was good for a whlle but then the king comes in he's basically made a society in which the demons are slaves to the humans and has some crazy ass army with magic powers and shit at first you'd think his only purpose was to be an asshole.. but cool hes a basic character then you have to factor in nina dragon changing ability at first it was whenever she became attracted to a guy she would turn into a dragon fast forward her meeting the king for the first time but the king is disguised and basically helps her out when a bunch of dudes were tryna beat her up or some shit llike that my memory isnt the best bare with me she ends up falling for him not knowing hes the king  and because she ends up falling for him shes the only guy she is now attracted to her first love and he is the only person at that point which can turn her into a dragon. I thought the king would use her and the story would go in that direction but it didnt  and that was my problem her loving the king him clearly having feelings but repressing them and him being a terrible dictator yet she still loves him. Her completely negating all the shit hes done because shes in love is retarded and it ruins the series in my books. They had previous characters from season one bacchus,jean,zombie girl,kaisar and favaro even back when favaro came back i was hyped but then he didn't really contribute much to the season even though in the moments where he did help nina out they were great but having nina as the main character and having favaro exist being a much better fleshed out character also made the series suffer. I'm just gonna skip to the ending it was good and bad but because it left me kind of frustrated i'll side with the bad more than the good. The fact that jean and Azazel  allowed the king to live when they had the chance to kill him is beyond me the fight with the bahamut was a cup of coffee the result of the bahamut with nina ending up becoming mute and is unable to speak while the king has become blind in both eyes... i mean wtf kind of shit is that. The good about the ending was nina meeting amira in the light of the bahamut which was cool but it didnt last long nor was much of anything and then the scene where favaro tells everyone hes leaving this occurs after the fight and nina and the others are having a meal she goes with him and ends up writing out a message on the ground because she cant speak anymore she tells favaro that she met amira in the light of the bahamut and relays a message she told her during that moment for favaro that was really cool but other than that the final episode was dissapointing the entire season has been disspointing and its a shame there was many good moments in this season but towards the ending half of the series it was very wishy washy and ended up falling off a cliff. Its not a bad season but it doesn't live up to how good the first season was so its a dissapointment. It really did not need a second season at all.",

The art and music continue to be mesmerising and breathtaking, but both of which cannot compensate for the lack of good storytelling and character developments. \r\nThe story in general has a great plot going for them that has sociopolitical tones which follows after the events in the first anime, but is frustratingly overwhelmed by a romantic subplot that is arguably unnecessary, and ludicrous. The female protagonist was wasted on said romantic subplot although she was formerly presented as an individual who was not onlyvastly intriguing, but also reasonably appealing. Not the same could be said with the other characters, most of whom do return to the screen, unwaveringly charming and significant. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am vastly disappointed and infuriated with the turn of events in the anime that could all have been avoided if the writers had decided to not add said subplot.",

            "content": "It's honestly disappointing that I have to write this review because I adored Genesis. But for some reason they decided it was a good idea to turn a adventure fantasy anime into a soap opera with one of the worst romances between two of the worst characters I've ever had the displeasure of watching in an anime. While the visuals are gorgeous, the same can't be said for the plot or characters. Ironically, the only characters that are enjoyable are the ones from Genesis. But even that enjoyment is short lived since the writers of this season go above and beyond to shit on thosecharacters while propping up the horrible new ones. Nina who starts off as an enjoyable and energetic character turns into this mentally handicapped lovestruck idiot who constantly makes questionable decisions that ends up hurting her own friends. And the old cast from Genesis are either treated horribly or used as a mouthpiece for the writers to justify the nonsense in this series. And this leads to the character that I have the biggest problem with, Charioce. The definition of Gary Stu, nothing goes wrong for this guy and despite the fact that he's a horrible person, the writers try to justify it with the whole \"he did it for the great good\" nonsense which immediately falls apart if you even slightly think about it. This series is a cautionary tale of how not to make a sequel and is an insult to it's great and fun predecessor Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis.",

            "content": "My pulse is still a bit high after this experience that was \u201cShingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul\u201d. When I heard that a 24-episode sequel to \u201cShingeki no Bahamut: Genesis\u201d was to be released, I was both part overly excited and part anxious. I loved the prequel, it instantly became one of my all-time favourites. So, naturally I was very nervous when I was watching the first episode of \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d, would it be as good as Genesis? \r\nI would have been satisfied with just half as good, but was rewarded with, that yes, it was indeed as good as Genesis. Or maybe even little betterbecause it had the double amount of episodes, which they used with exactly right sorts of material. You know, right amount of background stories, that fill up the gaps from the past 10 years since the prequel, and on world building. The extra time also gives the opportunity to knot every main and side character together in a story-wise appealing way, which neither forces their interaction or totally neglect it. \\n\\n\r\nWell balanced, is the short term I seek to give a fast summarize of \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d. Just as it\u00b4s prequel, \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d mixes fantasy, adventure, action, drama, comedy, magic and romance in such a fluent and balanced manor. \\n\\n\r\nAnd leaves me now with mixed feelings. I\u00b4m equally satisfied and sad that the adventure is over. The story, the characters, the action and the fights, the friendships and the romance, the epic adventures, and not to speak of the awesome animation and choreography, makes \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d shine like a star. Especially compared to many other shows this past two seasons, it is in its own league. I\u00b4m going to be honest, I\u00b4m absolutely biased. Not only cover \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d my favourite mix of genres, its execution, in my eyes, it\u2019s done in an absolute perfect manor, and certainly worth the title masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nNow, when I got that of my chest, let\u00b4s talk about \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d in a little more practical way.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place 10 years after the end of the prequel. I highly recommend you to watch the prequel first, it makes the sequel 10 x more enjoyable. A lot have changed since that last destructive battle with Bahamut. Humans have with their new king Charioce XVII in the lead, turned their backs to the Gods and are ransacking their holy temples for power. The humans have used that power to attack the Demons Capital, and forced even the strongest demons into hiding. The ones not so lucky to escape, was turned into slaves to rebuild the Human Capital, Anatea. Demons are also forced to fight as gladiators, used for experiments, and to work as prostitutes. The gods have so far stand hand fallen at the march of the humans, and desperately seeks the one child that can turn the war to their favour.  Only one Demon and his mysterious companion, seem to fight for the imprisoned demons, the Rag Demon. Disguised, he attacks and kills slave traders, soldiers, and noblemen that do horrific things to demons. Kaisar, now Captain of the Orleans Knights, are pressed by king Charioce, to obtain the Rag Demon at all costs. Rita now works as a doctor, and do everything in her usual calm, cool zombie manor.\\n\\n\r\nAnd perfectly oblivious to all of it, Nina Dragno, a teenage girl from the far East who has come to the city for work, lands in the middle of everything. As the story progresses, the fates of those who was around last time, and new faces, are drawn together, and starts to spiral towards the inevitable ending.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is the start ground of one hell of an adventure-fantasy-romance story. As in the prequel, they manage to weave this story web as neatly as ever. It\u00b4s coherent, balanced, and even paced. They manage to link the story to the prequel, so the characters actions get more weight behind them without feeling forced. Not many unnecessary, words or conversations. Their exchanges bear all meaning and clues to the plot, and how different characters are connected. They do a great job with keeping us in what\u2019s happening and why, by cut in previous scenes that gives the information you need, and knit the story together. \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d has little slower pace than \u201cGenesis\u201d, but it has twice it\u00b4s time and the little shift of pace only left room for more exploring of the characters and the world setting. Like, why is he or she in that particular situation, with this or that character, or in that mind set. \\n\\n\r\n*A tip while watching, many of the episodes have extra material relevant to the plot after the ED-song. So, if you not want to miss anything, check the remaining minutes of the episode when the ED starts. It\u00b4s a good chance that there is more material.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of actions having consequences, are highly applied in the \u201cShingeki no Bahamut\u201d-series. You can feel the brutality of deaths, the emotional scars they leave, and what those scars can lead to. That, is no small task to manage to display on screen. To provoke and establish those type of emotions, make me feel for the characters, their cause, and why they are fighting. That is what makes the fight scenes and action so good. I could feel the underlaying conviction, rage, determination, vengeance, love, or the regrets that drives the character. \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d have them all. It for sure has it\u00b4s lights part as well, which creates a very harmonic contrast. A warm delicious meal, with companions in a fairy tale cosy setting, or an everyday errand that ends up in an unlikely encounter, or the shopping for some goodies in a small shop, or a dance at a festival, are all details of light and easy happiness. The mood of \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d skews towards more darker tones the later half of the show, which makes the warm and happy parts clench your heart an extra bit more.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are as well fleshed out as they can be. Their background stories, developments, relationships, and personalities are all satisfyingly explored and coherent. And here have \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d managed to do what so many before them have failed with, all the main and side characters feel equally important and interesting. In many shows, you get the feeling that many of the side characters are just there to make the protagonists look good or better than they are. That\u00b4s not the case for the characters in \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d, each of them are equally exciting to watch, and they all feels important to the plot. Some minor details, can at first seem very clich\u00e9, but are turned and used in a very heart-warming way, at least I could see the beauty of it. Of course, the personalities are exaggerated, this is anime after all. But, for me, it only highlights what\u00b4s \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d is all about. It\u00b4s about epic battles, people, and monsters. It\u00b4s about adventure, love, and hardships. It\u00b4s about family, bravery, vengeance, betrayal, and choices. About people brought together to write history. \\n\\n\r\nI\u00b4ve read some complaints about Nina\u00b4s character, but I have only positive things to say about her. Nina was a fresh breath of air as a fantasy-heroine to me. She isn\u00b4t overly pretty, or overly smart, and for sure not a damsel in distress. She is however, independent, wild, caring, strong, fast, carefree, brave, and positive. Her character felt multi-layered, believable, and relatable to me. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an overall theme for the characters in the series, they have their personal traits, but are for sure not static. The things they go through, how they handle it, and how they grow from it as individuals, is just as different as it would be for you and me. Their reactions to certain events, felt in harmony with their character, but in the same time left them space to grow and change in a believable way.     \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is outstanding, to put it short. Dramatical orchestral music, during those intense battle scenes, beautiful and peace giving tones for the light and happy moments, and heart-clenching pieces for the emotional scenes. They even have some nice opera pieces. Can just say \u201cAaaawe\u201d, and thank you for their good work. The sound effects are always spot on, and matches the great visuals perfectly. I could feel the impact of someone thrown into a stone wall, the power of an energy blast land, the rubble raining down across the city, or the chilling sound of a sword leaving its sheath. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors (Japanese) are outdoing themselves, each character is well matched with it\u00b4s voice actor. The cold and powerful voice Charioce, the honourable and passionate voice of Kaisar, the positive and carefree voice of Nina, the calm and un-faced voice of Rita, the desperate and rage filled voice of Azazel, and the fierce and strong voice of Jeanne D\u00b4Arc - they are all spot on. They made me cry and laugh many times during my watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation, direction, and choreography is in its own league. Top notch, it doesn\u00b4t get much better than this. Half the budget most`ve been spent on the characters eyes and faces, for not to speak of the backgrounds. The facial expression is so clear and intense, brought forth by those masterly done eyes. You can see the slightest shift in an emotion, how much they communicate with them. Bright colours and light are used to lift a burning determination, surprise, or warmth. The scenery is always gorgeous; no matter if it\u00b4s a bird\u00b4s view of the Capital with its stone and wooden houses and enormous lake, or the shiny lands of the gods, or a local festival with its tents, foods, dances and fireworks. It all looks positively stunning. The choreography is bloody perfect, the movements of the characters or objects, the angles they are followed in, are just so darn awesome. Just watch and see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSo, did I enjoy \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d? I think it is pretty clear that I enjoyed it a hell of a lot. Each episode felt like a well-rounded satisfying piece in the adventure that was \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d to me. Best damned thing I watched since its prequel earlier this year. And I\u00b4m quite thrilled that the show leaves it open for a continuation. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were as awesome as ever, the story as interesting as ever, the battles as badass as ever, the romance one of the best I seen in a long while, the art and animation reached new heights, and the music was mind-baffling. \u201cVirgin Soul\u201d just landed on my all-time favourite list, no questions asked. Hands down, this was bloody awesome. Thanks again, studio MAPPA, who once again shows that they are a studio to be reckon with.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhere does the wind blow? It blows towards tomorrow.\u201d \\n",

            "content": "I've spent the whole of yesterday watching the first season. Then the first episode of  the second season and after realizing it's inferior, I fast-forwarded the rest of the second season up to the 20th episode.\r\nSimply put, the second season is a disaster, a letdown, really boring and overall bad. The first season in contrast felt a bit more mature, straightforward and to the point, while the second one has twice the episodes, some episodes feel like 90% fillers and 10% content or useless flashbacks taking up to 90% of the episode when they can take about 30% (at best) and leave the restfor the story to unfold so that it all falls into 12 episodes again.\\n\\n\r\nIt feels to me like this show has deteriorated the same way Shingeki no Kyojin did (similar names irony pun maybe?) - they both started out good in their first season, but at the second one went on, it became clear that they are being dragged to make more money rather than leave the viewers satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what made me dislike the second season:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters - the new protagonist is a girl with striking similarities to the old one that kinda died a little (or whatever) - both are naive, both are obsessed with eating, both have a funny side, in season 2's case, the protagonist gets uncomfortable near hot men and while this can be fun to see one or two times at best throughout the show, it gets boring, WHEN IT'S HAPPENING A COUPLE OF TIMES EACH EPISODE. It also really bothers me how the two (remaining) protagonists from season 1 feel like secondary characters in season 2, one of which actually makes an appearance during THE MIDDLE of season 2 and most of the primary characters in season 2 are either new ones or ex-secondary ones from season 1.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and setting - while season 1 felt more like One Piece (characters traveling around the world, seeing new locations), season 2 feels more like Naruto (characters spending the entirety of the show in the same few locations).\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of the show - the theme has changed between season 1 and 2 - while in season 1 it was more serious and dramatic, in season 2 it has become more light-hearted and funny, relying on stupid puns to pass the time and I really hate that in anime I watch (if you check my profile, it says I like serious and thought-provoking anime such as Mushishi for example contrary to stupid ones relying on puns to pass time) and ones as Shingeki no Bahamut season 2 are pissing me off to the point I might even give anime a break, but I won't because there are still very good ones that I wouldn't want to miss out on. xD\\n\\n\r\nIf you've read this far into it, thank you for taking your time to read my take on this show and I hope this review helps you decide how you spend your time better rather than get you angry at me because we have differing opinions.",

            "content": "If you want to learn how to screw up a hero's journey story, a love story and a \"good all along\" story - all at the same time - look no further than Virgin Soul.\r\nI don't think i've seen an anime trip over itself more in its 3rd act than this one, and it's a real shame, because for the most part you have a cast of characters that mesh really well together. Even though I found Jean D'Arc and the angels quite boring and they suck up a lot of screen time in the 2nd half, that's really only the beginning of Virgin Soul'sproblems.\\n\\n\r\nVirgin Soul starts off 10 years after the events of the 1st season. I wouldn't recommend watching this without first having seen the prequel.. but I wouldn't recommend this anime at all to begin with. But i'm getting ahead of myself -  our main character this time around is Nina, a bubbly and energetic young girl looking for an adventurous new life in the capital. Over time, she eventually gets entangled with familiar cast members, although you'll have to be patient for some to arrive.\\n\\n\r\nThe villain - at first - seems to be the stern and unwavering young King Charioce, who has enslaved and killed thousands of demons and angels with a powerful magic bestowed on his personal army, effectively placing humans at the top of the world's food chain. Nina, befriending characters such as Jean, Bacchus and Azazel, is very much aware of this and vows to join their efforts to stop him.\\n\\n\r\nBut then.. well, our little starlet Nina unknowingly falls in love with him. And you could forgive some young puppy love - especially if you don't know your crush is a genocidal psychopath hellbent on world domination. But then it keeps going - even after she realizes who he actually is, she insists that he should be spared - because how could her naive feelings possibly be wrong? And thus Nina goes from being the ambitious, likable young sprout to a completely insufferable, selfish brat who consistently screws over her friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all this culminates to what has to be one of the most confused, muddied and bizarre disasters of a 3rd act of a story. There's only so much I can give away without completely spoiling the entire sorry excuse of a story, but I will say this - the plot \"twists\" are totally insulting to the audience, and everything that made this franchise good gets sidelined in favor of shoving in a totally unappealing romantic sideplot as the crux of the 2nd half.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episodes, while exciting and heartwrenching for brief moments, are totally baffling. That the writers thought audiences would buy into everything that was shoehorned into this anime legitimately puzzles me. And how all of Nina's friends weren't absolutely infuriated with her is equally confusing - but also probably just lazy writing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that is really the main issue with Virgin Soul. The set-up is fantastic, but it can't deliver on one-upping itself. Maybe the writers got lost in the story and simply ran out of time to come up with a good ending. We'll probably never know. And it doesn't matter. What matters is that in the end, Virgin Soul is a great example of what NOT to do with the story paths the writers chose to follow.\\n\\n\r\nIf they had found a way to wrap up the story in a neat bow in 12 episodes, I would have recommended this anime. But it kept going, and it kept getting worse, and they ruined it. I only give it a 4/10 because I did enjoy the first half - a solid 8/10. The 2nd half is more like a 2/10. So yeah - if someone gave you a sandwich with random splotches of mold on it, would you eat it? You can't cut it in half and only eat the good parts. You've got to eat ALL of it. Don't go into this anime without expecting to be let down.",

The story focuses on a new character Nina this time around and the old characters such as Favaro and Kaiser, while still important to the story, they play more of a supporting role this season. I thought the story was enjoyable overall although I'm probably being more lenient than most others. The writing in the story does have it's issues, especially in the second half of the season.\r\nThe art and the animation were outstanding and I feel as if it was a step up from what the first seasonwas if I'm remembering it right. Also the soundtrack did a fabulous job of setting the atmosphere for the anime. The characters were good but the way some of them were handled could have been better.\\n\r\nOverall I had a great time with Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul and I thought it was near the level of where the previous season was.",

The Background sounds in fights or in emotional moments enhance the feelings that the show wants you to express.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\n It has some Clishee characters like the King or Azazel but still it has a good main cast Nina which continues the good female part like in the prequel.\\n\r\nEvery characters backgrounds get explained really good so that you feel with them as they die or have epic moments. Same Thing as in the Story Section \\n\r\nthe ending for each character felt a little bit to swift thats why only can give 8 Points.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymend: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the anime not only  because I'm a fan of fantasy but also of great emotional storys and musicial background.Each episode got me really \\n\r\nexcited and through the good animation i felt entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nto summerize the whole show i would say that if you have a thing for fantasy storys with great characters and good animation you should watch this and the prequel.",

Storytelling is great, I don't need to see the first season to understand what's going on. I can see the progress is being made, but not character's developments since it's just the beginning of the show. The humor doesn't feelforceful at all, I've had some good laugh, but shit does get real when it needs to. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is on point. It makes the atmosphere really immersive. There is CGI mostly used for the background characters, but they are definately not perfunetorily, but very detail, lifeful and connect with the scene instead. They really put a lot of budget and effort into this. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is kinda meh. Maybe it's because I've heard to much from top-tier producers. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, this is being the most enjoyable show of this season for me till date. One thing I wound recommend is to wait till it has finished and then watch it all at once, since you would probably forget about it in a week or so to focus on AoT or Hero Academia.\\n\\n",

The beginning and middle were really enjoyable and I was eager to watch the next episode, but the last severalepisodes leading to the end were just plain wtf, and that very last part where they opened it up for a third season SHOULD had made me happy, but instead it gave me the feeling that they were using that as an excuse to be lazy with the ending.

Here though, it just makes me concerned for season 3 considering what they did to Virgin Souls' ending. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, avoid this like a plague, but if you haven't watched the first season, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, then do yourself a favaro and do it.

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was a fun, vibrant, swashbuckling adventure in such a clusterfuck setting. To quote Tolkien's \"On Fairy Stories\", it's a Secondary World that does not inspire Secondary Belief. But it works for the kind of story Genesis attempted. Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul attempts to expound on that simple narrative with a far more ambitious story, one that is set up to fail in the light of the world built in Genesis. The established world simply does not hold up to scrutiny once a more serious narrative repeatedly brings forth its glaring flaws.\r\nVirgin Soul is set 10 years after the events ofGenesis, under a new social equilibrium and power dynamic of a new world order. Enter the ubermensch, super-powered, menacingly armored humans under the control of the king. With humanity's newfound might, they now waged war upon gods and demons. The latter has been soundly defeated years ago and made slaves under the cruel whip of the species they once tormented.\\n\\n\r\nHere, the most glaring problem arises almost immediately. Ethics, morality, socio-economic realities, these are such complicated concepts for a setting with so many holes and so many facets still left unestablished.\\n\\n\r\nThe power dynamics introduced in Genesis is one where humans fight an eternal war with demons, with the occasional help from the gods thrown in. One can infer from the events in Genesis that humans are merely proxy in the wars of the gods and demons. It's so simplistic in nature and now that the wheels had turned, you cannot bring yourself to care. Now humanity has the upper hand and by god, they have every right to hold demons in contempt and to flaunt their power against the gods whose whims and fancy they are no longer under the mercy of.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what is ethics? At what state of social equilibrium is this world under? How do they view slavery? A necessary evil in rebuilding? A proof of humanity's triumph? This should clue you in to how secure or how tenuous the king's hold is and how the events of the story changes that.\\n\\n\r\nOn the side of the gods, their effort to bring humanity back into their fold calls forth into question the benefits of such an arrangement. Aside from ready cannon fodder which seems to be composed entirely of one kingdom, there is no other stated benefit for their leader to be feverish about. There is still the matter of survival, though certain conversations side-line that in favor of the idea that humanity, that the sheep has strayed from the flock and requires a shepherd. Or maybe the gods are the supreme arbiter of the world order? Except that the events of Genesis says otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is faith? How does it work in pantheon of what seems to be a shit-ton of deities? Are angels gods? Are they minor deities? What do they inspire in people? We have a world where deities have physical manifestations. Surely its not your usual Abrahamic belief?\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to be invested in a setting you keep questioning. Other reviewers will say the failure of Virgin Soul lies in the characters or the story. They are wrong. The failure of Virgin Soul lies in the setting that should have given more depth to the story and more nuance to the characters and their decisions.\\n\\n\r\nExploring nuance in the politics and ethics of a setting with the barest of social equilibrium... it's simply isn't done. Especially so when much of the meat of Virgin Soul before the final third of its runtime is an attempt at that.\\n\\n\r\nNot much else can be said about Virgin Soul. If you know your Gaise Macon, your Arthas Menethil, your Lelouch Lamperouge, then you've seen this story done better, even by such an infinitesimal degree.",

            "content": "WOWOWOW I almost missed this in my radar. How is it that it's not listed as ROMANCE being a main component of this anime? I mean, literally it has one of the hottest romances of any anime I've watched!\r\nHonestly the king, Charioce/Chris is to die for...at least he fits my kind of guy to a T. Strong, silent, has a gentle side, easily misunderstood, passionate to his cause, and serious but with a fun side too!\r\nAnd I also love that they made the main female character strong and capable. Not only that but she doesn't do the regular BS of hiding her feelings and beinga coward and being super girly like in most animes. She's honest about her feelings and who she is, she's lively and energetic and full of spunk. At first I didn't like the way she looked (didn't look as beautiful as the other main female characters) but the way she presented her emotions and her frankness really captivated me. Indeed I must admit I enjoyed both main characters a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT! As far as the plot, it made sense to me...even up at the point where Nina is betrayed by Charioce. I not only understood why he did it but admire him for it! I believe he was trying to protect her and everyone else as well as being committed to his original cause. Who likes a wavering heart!\\n\\n\r\nI just couldn't get enough of the moments of Charioce and Nina, I wish there were more! And the end...as sad as it is, I'm glad it's not the usual happy ending where everyone comes out okay and everything is as before.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are drawn so beautifully too that you can't help but have the hots for some of them.",

I'm not into romance anime (Toradora and Lovely Compelx are the only romance shows I ever enjoyed, and I liked the romance in Blood+), but this looked promising, the art was gorgeous. So I watched the anime.\r\nTo make it short, Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul was GREAT. The storytelling was flawless. It was smart and mature. I was constantly on the edge of my seat. I binge watched it in one day and did not skip a second (which is very rare for me). \r\nTosee that the highest rated review for this series on MAL was written by a guy who thinks some (disgusting looking) hentai series is the shit (he gave it a 9 out of 10 and found it intriguing, while Shingeki only deserved 4 stars in his opinion) is disappointing to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all well written and very interesting. They were complex (even Nina) and the interactions were written incredible well. They all had connections to each other and developed deep bonds. It was a joy to see how everything played out. The script writer has a lot of talent when it comes to potraying emotions and writing characters with distinctive personalities. I coudn't list a single thing that disappointed me in this anime. Everything came together so well. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, the world has gone crazy, if a work like this gets such bad reviews. It's like someone telling you, the moon is green. Seriously, it's not. And this series is not bad either, it was amazing.",

            "content": "I finished this a while ago and still have anger and regret, so here's a review\r\nShort hand: If you liked the first season, join the likely growing number of people who will pretend this doesn't exist.\r\nThis contains spoilers, which are crucial, due to the ending of the show affecting it's most important characters.\r\nStory: 3\r\nGenesis told a standard, regular fantasy story and did a good job with it. Angels and demons live with humans and a 3rd party will kill them all, but is sealed...but now it's gonna wake up etc. etc. What made it great was that it took everything in stride and either wentover the top or undermined scenes. It took usual points of a fantasy and spun them to make them fun, for example: the shining, chivalrous ex-knight who fights for the people recruits a little girl who can (and frequently does) make armies of zombies that fight for her. The main character is a complete ass and makes it well known, and only stops screwing with people at the very very end.\\n\r\nTHIS time, nothing is interesting or engaging outside of the first quarter. Nina falls in love with a fantasy genocider, who's reason for fighting the angels and demons gets hand-waved through the show; but characters come later. Plot points move slowly from one to the next, with extremely little tension or motivation except for \"the heroes have to deal with this now\". Important elements get forgotten, there's a ton of fluff along the way due to the doubled episode count, and the few side plots are absolute jokes. There is no character growth, and by the end nothing anybody did matters.\\n\r\nThe writers may have had a plan at the beginning, but whatever it was fell through along the way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nBackgrounds are pretty and character designs are all good, although there's only a small handful of new main characters that matter. However, even though the backgrounds are just as beautiful as the last season, the setting is almost entirely placed in the main castle town instead of showing the gorgeous world like season 1. There's a lot of repetitive brown/grey walls and uninteresting backgrounds. But whenever they leave the town, the new color palettes and scenery are refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nI cannot remember a single song off the ost, nor a single moment where it made the mood. The endings and openings are passable though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nThis one I'll just break down\\n\r\nNina: Our MC and one of the worst characters in the show. It's hard to talk about her without mentioning Charioce. Her personality is very enjoyable, and her power to turn into a dragon only when she falls in love is fun, but it gets wasted completely as things go on. Her literal first love happens to be the king who wants to murder every angel and demon (until the end, apparently) because demons killed his parents (shown in an extremely short scene). But she never, ever strays from loving him, and everybody around her cheers her on. It would be a wonderful love story if he wasn't a horrible tyrant that had no redeeming qualities. Her character through the show completely dives into thinking about him and protecting him, and although she says she'll protect her friends and put them before him, she does the opposite and two die with some conviction shown to change, but not taken. During the end of the first third of the show, it seems like she will have to face the problem of not being able to transform on will, which hurts 2 of her friends. But midway through she instantly discovers how to do it in a quick scene, and the idea dies. There is no real focus on how she fails to protect those she loves, because all of her energy goes towards saving Charioce alone. She ends as she begins; a dumb kid in love, who didn't learn much of anything.\\n\r\nCharioce: The main antagonist/love interest. I'm still wondering what happened with him: did they want to make him sympathetic and failed, or just want the audience to blow through his horrible treatment of people? His own ranks mean nothing to him outside of his personal guard, he immediately imprisoned Jeanne: a hero of the people, allows public slavery and child slavery rings to go about openly, has daily prisoner Colosseum matches to the death that he watches, and uses an army of slaves to build a superweapon for him.  He has no emotions canonically in order to not sway his purpose of using his life to kill Bahamut, but by the end that fails even with Nina's help, so he becomes a failed martyr who couldn't hide his actions under the veil of a heroic death anymore. His motivations and dreams completely fail from his survival, which was meant to be his saving grace as a character. By the end, he's just a blind tyrant that got away with absolutely everything, and got the girl. Stockholm syndrome would be the only way to view him nicely, like how Nina does.\\n\r\nMugaro: A completely wasted opportunity. He's introduced as a child of great power who has been abused by slavers and saved by the minor antagonist of the last season, but is a lawful character. He starts off fine, but once the angels get him back and restore him, his character does a 180 and becomes a complete brat who wants to abuse his power. He rebels and runs away, then gets killed before he can do anything else. Instead of being the one who causes peace between sides, or creates a large 3rd party option between the king and magical beings, he gets shanked by comedic side character 2/3rds through the show. But his death serves no purpose at all, because all actions taken afterwards would've been done regardless, and it honestly just felt like he needed to be removed for the show to proceed. \\n\r\nReturning characters: Because none of them really made any progress at all, from the last season to the end, they're quick to do. Favaro completely supports Nina's stupid actions because of his failure to save Amira being projected onto her. He acts as a father figure, but...supports the obviously bad of idea of saving the king instead of realizing that a first love isn't definitive. Kaisar gets shit on the entire season as much as possible, and then dies pathetically. What should've been a depressing scene is rushed through, as after a minute of only Nina really crying, the scene moves on and Kaisar gets pushed aside. Nina, Dionysus, and the bird get more screentime, but really don't change much. Jeanne suffers a lot, then becomes a peasant again with her (girl)friend Sophiel. Azazel attempts a demon uprising 2 or 3 times and fails, then...gets on better ground with Lucifer after having all of his personal friends die.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nThere are some good comedic moments here and there, but everything feels incredibly padded and dull. Again, there's rarely any tension or motivation and the same kinds of thoughts get hammered in again and again until they serve as filler.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nIf you liked how the original season of Bahamut brought surprises and fun to a standard fantasy cliche, just stay away from this. It's a good time killer, but there are no take aways and no real reason to watch.\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nShingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul turns the phrase \u201ca helping hand\u201d into a reality with Rita and the literal one she keeps at her side. Granted, it\u2019s technically Kaizer\u2019s, but he\u2019s a happy, helpful little guy regardless. As for Virgin Soul itself, it could have also used a helping hand. For, while certain parts receive a thumbs up, earning two (let alone three) thumbs up is sadly not in its palm reading.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe first season of Shingeki no Bahamut (subtitled Genesis) surprised pretty much everyone when it first landed on the community\u2019s lap back in Fall2014. Based on a mobile card game, people (maybe rightfully so) expected failure for the project before it even released. Instead, it shattered preconceptions, becoming one of the best fantasy-adventure anime in recent times with its lovable characters, diverse set pieces, and awesome production values.\\n\\n\r\nThis introduction is necessary because Virgin Soul \u2013 the sequel to the original and the anime-of-the-day today \u2013 incurred expectations in the other direction. People were no longer skeptical of the premise; they wanted more of the same. Strangely enough, the show almost seems to have predicted that these thoughts would be the case, for the anime itself likewise goes in the complete opposite direction.\\n\\n\r\nThe most obvious detail is that the main character is now female (Nina) rather than male (Favaro). Moreover, Nina does not get her own set of new companions but instead shares time alongside both sides: the majority of the major players from the previous season and the new ones from this season.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes much deeper than just the protagonists, though. For instance, the scope of adventure has been tuned way down since nearly the entire story takes place in, around, or goes back to the capital of Anatae rather than across multiple, singular areas. The humans (with Charioce at the helm) square off against the angels and the demons simultaneously rather than everyone eventually working together to save the world. Bahamut himself is now a footnote as the conflicts which matter most are mostly interpersonal rather than situational. And the outcome for the main pairing reverses in the end (with some notable sacrifices as compensation).\\n\\n\r\nOther examples exist, but those presented above should suffice in revealing how Virgin Soul clearly wishes to separate itself from the notion that this sequel is a replica of the original. Better yet, it succeeds.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrower setting provides a more grounded feeling for its scenes and its thematic ideas on racism. The separation of humans, angels, and demons forms separate subplots which explore their sides to a larger degree. The reduced presence of Bahamut in the writing places greater variety and different insights into the plights and the backgrounds of its characters. And the ending as is leads to a definitive conclusion for this specific tale in-universe rather than leaving it open-ended (which the post-credits scene suggests being the case in hindsight).\\n\\n\r\nNot to say that the anime completely foregoes its origins. Screams of \u201cFavaro!\u201d, while not as prominent, still creep in time and again. And the fantastical elements persist within places like Nina\u2019s hometown or in relation to the magical warfare conducted. In this way, the anime appeals to its roots but refuses to succumb to narrative repetition from said roots.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yes, Virgin Soul is very much a new entity. And, as the first half of its run demonstrates, it revels in this differentiation. Unfortunately, with double the number of episodes (yet another distinction between both seasons), the show incurs double the number of chances for potential problems \u2013 problems which it ultimately encounters in the back half of its run.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the show just sort of forgets to explain a lot of its throughputs or outright drops some of its ideas. Particularly, the important thematic concepts with the demons and their mistreatment fizzles out after Azazel\u2019s uprising does the same. Worse still, poor explanations (last-minute or otherwise) come off as either incredibly questionable or ridiculously unreasonable, especially regarding the grand underlying scheme. And the character moments do not have the necessary gravitas to back up the drama and the setup which preceded them.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its shortcomings, the anime still dishes out some ambitious battle scenes, and its strong comedic style weaves in and out of the story per usual. Unfortunately, its follow-through just doesn\u2019t quite reach where it needs to be, leaving the audience wondering what could have been.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nArguably speaking, the artistic merit within Virgin Soul represents its strongest aspect. Two key features of the artistry stick out the most: the background art itself and the cinematic techniques employed.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the fewer number of topographical locations, the anime often includes fantastic set pieces with a large amount of detail and a grand sense of scale. These backgrounds may involve a high-rise view of the capital and its slums. They may also involve picturesque scenes of the nighttime sky. They may even involve establishing shots of heaven or the dragons\u2019 domain. Whatever the case may be, Virgin Soul puts the audience in awe of the beautiful backgrounds it creates from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe cinematic techniques are also a major positive. While not nearly as prevalent as the background art, these moments usually catch the eye quite quickly in how cool, slick, or fun they come off as being. Rotations tracked mid-rotation. Transitions based on fallen items (e.g., a liquor bottle) from one area to the next. Dazzling lights as a perspective filter. And that\u2019s just in the first three episodes. Throughout the entire show, such moments can be found, giving it another step up in the visual department.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the background art and the cinematic techniques, the designs of the characters shine once again. Returning people like Favaro, Kaizer, Rita, Azazel, and Bacchus maintain their same sense of suave, uniqueness, and flair about them. The newcomers \u2013 such as Nina, Charioce, and Sofiel \u2013 do the same with their own adventurous, handsome, or beautiful styles. They\u2019re almost instantly recognizable, and they wear their personalities on their sleeves (in an almost-not-figurative manner), so their looks certainly get the job done and then some.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the actual animation throughout these episodes rarely lets up. The CG motions during action segments can be slightly out-of-place at times, but they do not halt the momentum of the otherwise well-executed artistry. Sword duels, chase scenes, and emotional interactions make up the bulk of the movement present, and, indeed, the show usually refrains from using CG save for the most taxing segments (such as with super-large enemies and the like). At the minimum, Nina\u2019s dragon transformation sticks with traditional 2D animation, giving her moments as a fearsome beast that much more clout.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the backgrounds to the techniques, the designs to the movement, Virgin Soul glistens with polish on an artistic level no matter where one stares.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nLooking back at the previous season, the main quadruple had a meta stance in that Favaro, Kaizer, Rita, and Amira were a ragtag family of sorts. This season does away with having a tightknit group and instead divvies up the focus into sections between the most important players. Unfortunately for the anime, this spells doom for a big chunk of its cast members.\\n\\n\r\nNina is the main protagonist of Virgin Soul, and her expedition away from home marks an important fork in her life\u2019s road as a dragon person. Her super-strength lends her talent at hoisting heavy objects during her construction jobs, and her affable personality makes the townspeople welcome her presence. When she isn\u2019t eating gobs of food or arm-wrestling passersby for cash, she can, if caught in that rare moment, be found transforming into a red, fire-breathing dragon.\\n\\n\r\nHer transformation isn\u2019t exactly voluntary, though. Unlike the rest of her clan who can basically do it at will, Nina must fight back such magic within her. The trigger for this magic? Seeing, thinking, or interacting with an attractive male. Her crush on (unbeknownst to her) Charioce spurs these feelings to an even greater degree.\\n\\n\r\nThus, much of her character revolves around her inability to control her powers and the relationship she holds with Charioce himself. While a nice set of ideas, the execution runs poor. The anime (indirectly) alludes to the fact that her love for Charioce causes her powers to fluctuate between unusable and attainable. However, it comes off more as a plot convenience rather than a source of growth for her given how the explanation behind it remains rather esoteric.\\n\\n\r\nIn the show\u2019s defense, her earlier asides with the stalwart king spark the feeling that these two have a bond in the making. On the other end, however, when the dragon issue is not present, Nina\u2019s attachment to Charioce swings wildly. She hates him. She loves him. She doesn\u2019t know what to think about him. This constant churn fails to do much for her character since it ultimately keeps repeating her same thoughts about the man over and over without adding anything extra afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nWhen neither side is present, she simply coasts along for the ride, having little impact within the events themselves. The anime either defers to other characters instead (because she has next to nothing else going for her) or she cannot contribute to the cause (because she only revolves around her dragon form and her feelings for Charioce). Her mentorship to Favaro and the small tidbits about her father\u2019s death attempt to give her extra layers as a character, but they are not enough to cover her underwhelming role within the story at large.\\n\\n\r\nCharioce does not fare much better. Virgin Soul builds him up as an antagonist but simultaneously humanizes the guy during his undercover stints among the masses. This moral ambiguity sadly goes nowhere because the show refuses to explore more of his character for a vast amount of the season, relegating him to a static situation. Even when it does finally decide to give a morsel, his background (losing a parent, in parallel to Nina) does not equate to much, and his motivations, his justifications only raise an eyebrow to maximum height since he has been so obtuse all along.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the other characters likewise fall apart. Kaisar\u2019s whole arc about honor and doing the right thing goes to waste as he constantly wallows in the same spot. Azazel\u2019s arc has him disappearing for far too long to stay relevant. Mugaro\u2019s arc is mishandled as his supposed drive to help others means nothing in the end. Alessand\u2019s arc has too much back-and-forth. Sofiel\u2019s arc to make amends for her past sins does not reach a satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nRita and Bacchus are mostly excused if only because they serve pure supporting roles throughout the season once again. Favaro, too, for this story (to reiterate earlier talking points) isn\u2019t his own this time around. Perhaps only one worthwhile character, then, exists in all of Virgin Soul: Jeanne d\u2019Arc.\\n\\n\r\nLast season, Jeanne lost sight of her faith and nearly cost everyone everything. In this season, she keeps herself composed as the show places an almost uncanny amount of emphasis on her character in the hopes of detailing how this former saint is now simply a humble lady. Her perseverance. Her sense of powerlessness. Her life as a meager farm woman. Her touching aside with Nina\u2019s mother. Her love and her sacrifices regarding her son Mugaro. Her charge to avenge his death. Out of the entire set of cast members within Virgin Soul (and as her name would perhaps foreshadow), Jeanne\u2019s arc feels the most whole and complete among them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd she\u2019s the only one. Otherwise, Nina, Charioce, and several of the other characters have an inkling sense of purpose and fortitude on a writing level, yet the show cannot capitalize on their merit for the show\u2019s full run.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nVirgin Soul takes a page out of the first season\u2019s book by putting together an opening track whose harsh metal construction rings loud and true. Titled \u201cLET iT END\u201d, the song makes the listener want it to do anything but as its intertwined sludgy and melodic vocals, its slick riffs, and its pounding drums charge up the audience for the spectacles the show prepares to unleash.\\n\\n\r\nIn stark contrast once again (when remembering that first season), the anime\u2019s first ending track goes for a whimsical piece by the name of \u201cHaikei Goodbye Sayonara\u201d. Much like Nina and her goofy depicted sidekicks, this song tags along a lot of fun, mixing in a healthy dose of catchiness and a slight sense of nostalgia for added comfort. Light piano, a simple beat, rapping lyrics, a tonal shift, and floaty noises get at these feelings and more as the track trots and skips along in optimistic fashion from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP, \u201cWalk This Way\u201d, has no affiliation to Aerosmith, and it isn\u2019t as eye-opening as its older brother. However, what the track lacks in \u201870s hard-rock and crushing blasts it makes up for in electronic atmosphere and grandiose vocal delivery. It swells with soaring buildup and high-flying ambience, breaking out into a majestic escape as it flies ahead.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that OP is the weakest of the bunch, for the second ED, \u201cCinderella step\u201d, steps ahead on the ground with EDM and pop in tow. Not that this song outclasses the first OP or the first ED, but the soft vocals, the mellow groove, and the simple jam put the dancing before the walking.\\n\\n\r\nBesides these starters and closers, Virgin Soul also enlists the same swell audio design decisions from before. The voice-acting performances from the returning cast are as top-notch as always. The original soundtrack channels a fervent fantasy feel. The sound-effects across the board give the magic, the duels, and the shenanigans the pomp and circumstance they deserve mid-action.\\n\\n\r\nA specific newcomer also deserves a shout-out: Sumire Morohoshi. Voicing the dragon-girl Nina, Ms. Morohoshi captures the bubbly spirit and springy silliness of the main female lead with ease. Her performance, combined with the OPs, the EDs, and the other music-and-sound elements, makes this portion of the anime one of the strongest it contains.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen trying to follow in the footsteps of giants \u2013 which in this case means the excellent first season of this franchise \u2013 it can often be a tough endeavor. Ideas change. New avenues are sought out. What once was may not be possible anymore, either by design or by some random mutation.\\n\\n\r\nOn this point, and for a sizable chunk of the season, I quite like what I watched. Nina is so happy and so likable that I could not wait to see her next reaction face or her futile attempts at repressing her dragon powers. Bacchus and Hamsa are hilarious, too. They often have been, but their larger screen presence, by themselves and with Nina, gave me extra smiles. Same goes for seeing the old cast again: Favaro\u2019s big dumb grin, Kaizer\u2019s immense sense of pride, Rita\u2019s inherent awesomeness.\\n\\n\r\nI can take it further and write that the whole first half had me hooked. The deeper focus on Jeanne made for an interesting time since the anime put a lot of resources into her, an already-on-the-side character carried over from before. And the initial potential stored within the show, due to the possible interactions and conflicts, had me quite giddy.\\n\\n\r\nAs the episodes progressed, though, I found myself less and less intrigued. Not that it fell apart, but it all started to wane in the second half as the anime lost steam. Lame plot decisions. Dwindling narrative focus. Worsening character moments. The show just didn\u2019t have the tightknit flow required for such a huge undertaking.\\n\\n\r\nInevitable comparisons to the first season also highlight the biggest difference: the original characters are simply better. Nina is a likable lass, but Favaro, Kaiser, and Rita have much more entertaining personalities on their own and much more interesting rapport between themselves versus Nina, Charioce, and Mugaro.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yes, the show sadly ends up not having the same magic, the same lightning in a bottle at its fingertips. However, I commend it for trying to go where it did. And who knows? Given the open-ended conclusion, I\u2019m still hopeful that a continuation, whatever or whenever it may be, will maintain that familiar stride. For, if nothing else, this sequel proves that the series still has the chops for stardom buried within.\\n\\n\r\nShingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul is a bit all over the place in terms of its strengths and its flaws, but the positives still outweigh the negatives. Specifically, impressive artistry and very nice musical options mask the troubles with the character writing and the waning second half of the season. Again, it earns a thumbs-up \u2013 but only tentatively so.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, a narrative which almost completely opposes its previous installment, creating a successful setup but whose follow-through fails\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great, the sweet backdrops, the slick cinematic techniques, the lovely character designs, and the appreciable level of movement put the visuals on a pedestal worth praising\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Nina flounders, Charioce waits too much, and the other vital cast members miss the mark, but Jeanne d\u2019Arc at least has a solid part throughout\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Great, the two new OPs and the two new EDs are diverse and well-composed, and the return to the same audio design decisions and elements keep the ensuing scenes in high spirits\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, while not as giant as before, it was a likable experience all the same\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

You can see the score I gave, you can understand it's an all-time favorite. But I can't ignore the many reviews trashing the show for the perfectly fine choice to sideline the main characters from the previous season in favor of a new protagonist. Characters come and go, seasons change. It's irrational to praise Virgin Soul's fantastic animation, plot, character writing, and thematic focus, then give it a three becausethe old mains don't have as much screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThis show moves. There are many sequences where dialogue simply stops for the viewer to behold an epic or beautiful visual slowly unfold. Characters are constantly animated even in scenes without significant action, and CG is rarely used even in battle scenes. \\n\\n\r\nI could praise it for thousands of words, but that would only waste precious time you could use to watch it instead. If you have any interest in it at all, don't hesitate. The current score is an injustice. Virgin Soul earns a much higher rating. It will exceed your expectations.",

            "content": "In my old age, it is difficult for me to find anime that I get invested in, especially since it's rare for more recent anime to catch my interest. I believe it is partially due to my age, but also because the market is so saturated with slice of life, fanservice anime that can't seem to decide if it wants to be a good story or appeal to its sex-crazed audience. So when a new and fresh anime with a bizarre story comes along, of course I would be immediately interested. \r\nThat's why when my boyfriend introduced me to the series, I was immediately hooked--and why I can say that Virgin Soul is easily the biggest letdown of the year for anime.\\n\\n\r\nI watched Genesis not long after Virgin Soul aired, and while it had its flaws with pacing (I mean, it was only 12 episodes, and only so much can be covered in such a short period of time), worldbuilding and plot, it was still a very enjoyable series with memorable characters. This isn't a review for Genesis, though, so I'll get into Virgin Soul now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nVirgin Soul started off extremely strong. We are immediately thrust into a world where war and slavery is rampant, King Charioce has selfishly stolen the power of the Gods for himself, and demons are taken and tortured by humans. This already sets the series up for a dark and promising story, what a shame it doesn't last. \\n\\n\r\nThen, we meet our protagonist-- Nina, who also happens to be the nail in the coffin for the season. Don't get me wrong, I like Nina. She starts off as an interesting protagonist; she's cute, extremely strong, and while she is a little clumsy, she at least has a semblance of agency. That being said, she does have one fatal flaw: whenever she is around handsome men, she becomes a red dragon. Remember that nail I mentioned before? Here it is. \\n\\n\r\nNow, this in itself is not necesarrily bad; her flaw sets the show up for interesting interactions with Azazel, and it gives us hopes that her power, despite how unpredictable it was, can be used later for action scenes. Unfortunately... that doesn't happen, and the one time we DO see Nina's dragon powers in action, she immediately becomes incapacitated and unable to fight again. Her dragon powers kind of just become a convenient plot device throughout the series to help them fly-- literally.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, remember the characters from Genesis, like Rita, Kaisar, Favaro, etc.? I wouldn't get too attached to them in this season if I were you. Any development they had in Genesis and throughout Virgin Soul is so conveniently thrown away in favor of Charioce's development. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Charioce... He starts off as a villian, then gets written to be a good guy. Yeah, the same guy who tortured and enslaved demons, put them in an arena to fight one another for his own amusement, threatened to have his own knight executed, had a hit put on his love interest, had Jeanne D'arc thrown in jail. He's written as a good guy near the end and not given a single consequence for any of his actions at all. Everyone's development, including Nina's, was thrown in the garbage to make way for Charioce's nonexistent development. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, the nail in the coffin began when Charioce and Nina's \"romance\" began. I say that with quotations because it's one of the most unbelievable and shoehorned romances I've ever seen not just in anime, but in media in general. The romantic subplot wouldn't have been so bad if it stayed exactly that: a subplot. Instead, the entire series gets wrapped up in this unhealthy romance between Charioce and Nina that becomes extremely tedious and frustrating to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAny chance for development for the other characters, any moments for action and worldbuilding were completely neglected, and during the last half of Virgin Soul, it becomes a painfully cringey shoujo anime that no one (except maybe the 5 charioce/nina fans) asked for. \\n\\n\r\nThe action near the end was incredibly underwhelming, and the character deaths were done purely for shock value. No justice was done for anyone except Charioce and Nina-- well, except that Charioce becomes blind and Nina becomes mute. They also get their dance together at the end... yay. I guess.\\n\\n\r\nArt. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation starts off as some of the best animation in anime I've ever seen. The art is fantastic, the emotions are clearly there and get the audience invested, and the palette sets the story up wonderfully. Unfortunately, the art suffers from a common problem in anime: the entire budget is wasted on the first few episodes, and the rest of the series' animation suffers immensely. Even near the end, though, the animation isn't awful, as much as it deteriorates-- it manages to stay consistent at least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSay what you want about the first opening, but the hard rock definitely sets up an interesting and action-filled setting. SiM did an amazing job with the soundtrack there, and while I am not a huge fan of the second opening, it is still pretty catchy and memorable. If it's one good thing I can say about this season, it's that the soundtrack is pretty damn good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing here that I can say that I haven't already said. The characters were interesting, but they get immensely shafted for King Charioce, who barely shows any emotion or personality throughout the series. Lord Lucifer had a grand total of 10 minutes of screentime during the whole season, and he still has more personality than Charioce did in over 20 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with a lot of promise and potential, with characters who are likeable and easy to get invested in. Unfortunately, as I have stated before, all of this is pretty much thrown in the garbage in favor of a terrible romantic subplot. The only way you can find any enjoyment after about episode 14 is if you somehow get invested in Charioce and/or Nina, otherwise it will be really frustrating and annoying to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is the very definition of wasted potential. I honestly have never seen an anime start off so strong, only to drop so harshly in terms of quality. There's a lot that I can say about how bad the writing is, but there isn't anything else I can say that hasn't already been stated ten times over.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this. Seriously. You will get upset and angry at the bad writing, unless you enjoy really poorly written and forced romance.",

            "content": "I wanted to love this so much. The art is incredible and the animation has a unique style that I find very compelling. The show starts with humour and romance and then develops quickly into epic fantasy. \r\nThe only problem was the main character - Nina. During the light-hearted beginning of the anime she is a likeable, happy-go-lucky protagonist akin to the typical hotheaded shounen protagonist. However as the anime quickly develops towards more dark and political themes she becomes incredibly out of place. She remains nothing more than a child throughout the show, seemingly unable to take anything seriously even when the lives ofother character's are at risk. During several tense and important plot points she simply responds to everything with \"I don't understand\" while the rest of the characters move the plot forward around her. Several times when she is given pivotal tasks to complete for the good of the cause she fails to do them simply because she wandered off to do something else without a second thought for the consequences. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it's a shame as most of the other characters are very strong. They are well designed both personality-wise and design-wise, relatable and interesting. While you could try to ignore Nina and focus on the rest of the cast, she is the main character and as such is involved most things. An intense scene will happen and then we'll be back with her, acting moronic and over-reacting to everything she sees in a babyish voice. By comparison, the plot and other characters become harder to take seriously as they are reacting to her as though she is an intelligent, mature adult, and as though she understands the significance of what they are telling her.\\n\\n\r\nThis is particularly potent when it comes to the main romance of the show. Nina develops a romance with a serious, powerful man with the world on his shoulders and an intense drive which pushes the plot forward at every turn. There are some very romantic scenes, but it is simply impossible to buy into - that such a man would have any interest in a juvenile moron that has no awareness of what is going on around her.\\n\\n\r\nOccasionally I took issue with the plot, there are plenty of cliches, deus ex machina, and things that feel contrived just to continue the plot. It's not too difficult to see where the plot is going, but it's an enjoyable ride. Despite going off on the negatives of this show, I don't regret watching it and it did make a special impression on me.",

            "content": "My rating for this anime: 9/10\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nAnimation: 9/10\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nCharacters: 9/10\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is complex and straightforward. Unlike Genesis, the power dynamic changed in Virgin Soul in favor of mankind by the time Charioce XVII, king of mankind ascended the throne. Charioce\u2019s actions resulted in weakening the gods and demons, he raided the gods temples and enslaved demons. His actions were the result of mankind being the weak and oppressed race between two powerful races (Gods and Demons) for centuries if not a millennia.\r\nIn Genesis, it is shown that mankind were neglected by the gods that allowed for mankind\u2019s suffering for centuries under the demons. Despitemankind worshiping the gods, gods think that excessive support to mankind is unwise. The only angel that was fond of humans was Michael and he was the one to bless Jeanne with her holy powers. Michael as he was dying admits that Bahamut\u2019s revival was their punishment for forgetting how to work with mankind and losing Zeus. On the other hand, Demons have been terrorizing mankind for a very long time, attacking their villages and killing it\u2019s inhabitants including little children. Genesis did hint that demons are sadistic creatures shown various times such as when Azazel laughed when he realized he killed Kaisar and Favaro\u2019s fathers, and that he actually killed them for fun. He enjoys torturing people such as when Amira was tortured in his castle. The other demon Cerberus begs Azazel to take a turn at torturing Amira because Pazuzu\u2019s way of torturing was boring while suggesting horrifying ways she would love to try and torture Amira. Even though Bahamut was reviving, none of these races wanted to cooperate until they were forced to since no one can take down Bahamut alone. It is important to watch Genesis to have a background on the story and its characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn Virgin Soul, the main focus of the plot was on the protagonist Nina Drango and the anti-villain Charioce XVII. Charioce\u2019s actions is what moved the plot and the characters throughout the episodes. Whereas, Nina was the character that got involved with everyone and helped us see different POVs and story of each character. Nina Drango is a refreshing character, with a very positive and happy-go-lucky personality. She has the ability to turn into a dragon due to being half dragon-folk. She is from an isolated village where dragon-folk live, they are people that have the ability to transform into a dragon. She is a bounty hunter trained by Favaro that came to royal capital Anatae to earn money for her mother.\\n\\n\r\n    In the first cour, The story focuses on the on-going conflict between gods, demons, and humans and this time humans are seen as the villains for abusing their power. I love how this conflict is the result of the actions of all three sides. Every side thinks they are doing the right thing and no one is willing to compromise. The writers show the brutality and the devastating results of their actions. The first few episodes focused on Azazel\u2019s attempt in freeing the demons and attempting a failed demon rebellion against Charioce. You can agree and disagree with what all three sides stand for yet realize that since none are willing to compromise this conflict will led to further complications. Charioce is willing to make mankind prosper furthermore. The gods believe mankind lost it\u2019s way and they have to redirect them back to the gods even if it means through war. Demonkind have been waiting for the right chance to strike. Charioce was willing to eliminate everyone that stands in his way until he discovered that Nina \u201chis love interest\u201d was involved with them. Because of Nina, he is taking less extreme measures against his opponents rather than killing them as he was willing to in the beginning. His love story with Nina started to build up since episode 3 and it has been confirmed by the director that Charioce in fact fell in love with Nina at first sight.\\n\\n\r\n    In the second cour. Charioce reveals his secret weapon Dromos that he has built from the ancient artifacts he stole from the gods. All characters except for Azazel have seen the capability of the amount of destruction this weapon can do yet none know the real motive behind Charioce\u2019s actions so they decide to stop him. The story starts to hint that Charioce\u2019s goal is in fact to take down Bahamut which explains the reason he needed to build Dromos as it is the only weapon that is on par with Bahamut\u2019s power. Mugaro\u2019s death played a major role in unifying the demons and gods against Charioce who was about to break the seal and release Bahamut. None at this point figured out Charioce\u2019s plan until Bahamut showed up at the battlefield. Gods and demons led by Gabriel and Lucifer tried to contain Bahamut\u2019s blast but they barely did it and Charioce along with Nina put their lives on the line to use Dromos and save the world from Bahamut. Both paid the price by losing one of their most important senses: Charioce lost his right eye (both eyes are blind) and Nina lost her voice. Bahamut caused less destruction than he did 10 years ago and that is because Dromos proved to be far more powerful and took him down easily. The humans and demons are still on bad terms but they are starting to work together to build the capital. Charioce is seen as a hero who defeated Bahamut to his people.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance was a great subplot to the story. The love between Nina and Charioce was simple and genuine. It didn\u2019t require major events or too much screentime, it developed in the most organic way where the development entirely depended on them both without anyone\u2019s interference. Nina and Charioce are polar opposites but complete each other. They have great interactions and it shows us their most vulnerable sides. The romance healed Nina whereas it gave us another dimension to Charioce\u2019s character, he isn\u2019t the ruthless king everyone thought he was but in fact a person that is capable of love and emotions, he is human after all. The relationship gets complicated when both discover their true identity, king Charioce XVII and the red dragon. Despite that, they continued to love each other. Nina sees Chris first before king Charioce, she is conflicted about how a kind man like Chris is capable of doing horrible things as Charioce. Nina accepts both of his sides though she can\u2019t change his past but she can change his present and future. Charioce despite being in love with Nina stayed in character until the end, it truly proven that he is a king with an incredible mental fortitude. Despite the odds being against them, their love won in the end. I loved the symbolism in their relationship such as the dance and chili pepper, things both of them cherish. The body language that each character displayed was wonderful. My only complaint is that I wish we have seen things from Charioce\u2019s POV and his emotions more.\\n\\n\r\n    I think the story is wonderful, sure it had potential to be greater but still was wonderful. The main issue was the pacing and not the story. If the show had 30 episodes I think it would have answered many questions and covered the story better. The story is very well-written but they couldn\u2019t fit it within 24 episodes because the story had to deal with many things that the series didn\u2019t wrap up at the end. Just because the ending was rushed doesn\u2019t make the anime bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was amazing. From Anatae, to dragon village, to land of the gods, and the battlefield animations was just superb. I was always in awe in the beauty of the scenery every episode. Mappa never disappoints when it comes to animation. I will always consider the animation in Shingeki no Bahamut one of the best I\u2019ve seen in anime. The CGI feels off sometimes but it doesn\u2019t bother me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks in Shingeki no Bahamut is perfect. Every new soundtrack presented in the anime amazes me. My favorite is definitely Nina and Charioce\u2019s theme, its such a beautiful melody. I love the battle soundtracks too and the Chorus of Despair version in Virgin Soul is much better than its Genesis version.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was amazing too. Nina\u2019s voice fits her character perfectly and the seiyuu did an excellent job with it. Yuuichirou Umehara brought Charioce\u2019s character with his voice, I can listen to him talk forever. All the Seiyuus did very well especially Rita and Kaisar\u2019s seiyuus. The cast were one of the best seiyuus the industry offers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe variety of characters in this show is amazing. I feel attached and invested in every character in the story. Every character is unique and for some reason I feel connected with them. Main characters, secondary characters, and even background characters left an impact in the show, it shows you how well-written these characters are even if they were not relevant or did not get enough screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters design was perfect. Each character has a special characteristic to them and most are peculiar to anime standards. Naoyuki Onda\u2019s magic never disappoints anyone. Even Genesis characters look much better in Virgin Soul. I\u2019m glad they made the gods less shiny this time even Lucifer, my eyes hurt when I saw Lucifer in Genesis.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis has become one if not my all-time favorite anime. I have enjoyed all 24 episodes without feeling bored. I was invested in the story and I got attached to all the characters. This anime is not perfect but it had almost everything that I\u2019d want in an anime. I\u2019d recommend this anime to everyone. After the anime ended I felt hollow and I still am a little bit, because for months I have been attached to these characters and the story and its difficult to say good bye. Thank you Studio Mappa and Cygames, I hope we got more of Shingeki no Bahamut and I want to see all these characters return to screen sometime soon.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nHaving watched RoB: Genesis, I was a little sceptical going into RoB: Virgin Soul thinking it might not be able to recreate the feel I had with Genesis, but to my surprise it actually managed to be pretty much on par with Genesis, however just like Genesis, Virgin Soul still has it's own problems.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nIt has been 10 years since the events of Genesis and the story concentrates on a new heroine called Nina Drango, a bounty hunter who came to Anatae to look for work, however her simple life suddenly gets a lot more hectic.\r\nI think the main problem Genesis had withit's story was the pacing and how it was set out, Virgin Soul felt much more well put together and coordinated better, the story would shuffle along at a good pace introducing new characters while also reintroducing old ones we all loved in the first series.\\n\r\nThere was even a few surprise's along the way that I really wasn't expecting and this does relate to some characters dying, I ain't gonna spoil who, but there are some moments which felt really emotional.\\n\r\nI also really liked the whole power rivalry between the Gods, Demons and Humans. After being crippled from Bahamut, the Humans are the ones who managed to come out on top and making the Demons their slaves, while the Gods have hidden themselves away waiting for their new saviour to help them bring back the power they once had, throughout the show I was really uncertain who to support, it was mainly the Demons I supported mostly because of the way they are treated, while I disliked the Humans and Gods because of their search for power so they can show who is the strongest. My support went back and forth between the factions and honestly the way they tied it up felt kinda rushed, but it's something I can live with.\\n\r\nI think there are two things really that didn't seem entirely right with the story, the first being the whole romantic sub-plot between Nina and Charioce, where we have the main heroine and villain fall in love, this didn't click for me, I mean it isn't the worst romance I have seen, but it wasn't one I could support. The reason why Favaro and Amira worked in Genesis is due to their characters working well together, here that doesn't seem to be the case especially when between the two Nina was the likeable while Charioce was pretty much an asshole.\\n\r\nThe second reason is the fact that the final episodes felt a bit like a re-repeat of the final episodes for Genesis, but without some certain things, however this still worked for me and managed to end the series well enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Virgin Soul were done pretty damn well, considering how amazing Favaro was as a character in Genesis alongside a few others, Virgin Soul manages to make the older characters better while also bringing in new characters and making them good too, well mostly.\\n\r\nThe two newest main characters are Nina and Charioce, Nina is basically the new Favaro and to be honest if Favaro didn't show up during this series, having Nina as a stand in for him would've been ok because Nina is a very likeable character, she always has this rush going on and is a highly positive person making her a really fun person, she's also pretty badass in a fight much like Favaro except a little clumsier, however the only downside to her character is the fact that whenever she gets turned on by a good looking guy she turns into a dragon, this did start becoming an issue to me until she managed to control her powers eventually.\\n\r\nCharioce is the main villain of the series, he's pretty much a douchebag asshole, well when he's king since sometimes he likes to wear a disguise and sneak out which does bring out a softer side to him, but overall I didn't really like his character and aside from one other new character he was pretty much a dislikeable character, though not a shitty one, I didn't want to gouge my eyes out everytime I saw him.\\n\r\nMugaro is another character who is brought into this series and he is actually a decent character, though there isn't much to describe about him, he is pretty much the cute factor that makes you like him no matter what really and honestly I'm fine with that.\\n\r\nVirgin Soul really does the characters from Genesis justice, it manages to make lesser known characters like Azazel, Jeanne, hell even Bacchus and Hamsa are given more time and are built into much more likeable characters by the end as we get to know more about them and some of the stuff that has happened to them after Genesis can make you feel sorry for some of them.\\n\r\nBut when it comes to our main crew Favaro, Kaisar and Rita, the show manages to make them even better, well it definitely makes Rita and Kaisar better as every scene between them just felt funny and nostalgic reminding you of how things were in Genesis, Favaro doesn't appear until a little later on in the series and even then his screentime is lacking a little compared to the others, but I did like the way they developed his character, some might say he isn't as funny anymore, however when you survived against a giant dragon ans lost someone you care about it's going to change you a lot and I liked how they made him as a mentor to Nina which made them two an awesome duo at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nPossible the weakest part of the show is the artstyle, now luckily they managed to keep the feel of the world like it was in Genesis, the big problems are the increased focus on CGI which didn't look good in certain scenes and looked pretty stupid, along with the fact that the series mainly concentrates it's focus in Anatae and it can get a little boring staring at the same buildings and rooftops after a certain amount of episodes.\\n\r\nAlthough the other locations were interesting, a complex prison brought out a Temple of Doom feel to it which felt nice, we got to see what a village full of dragonfolk would look like and there was more focus on the Gods homeland, which was pretty damn shiny.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhen it came to the op's and ed's it was pretty mixed, but mostly positive. \\n\r\nThe first op was good when it came to the visual's, it fitted the style of the Rage of Bahamut Series, with it's selected red, black, white and gray colours, but the music was a little meh and didn't really get me going until it was about to change.\\n\r\nThe second op pretty much did the opposite where it had good music that gave a heroic tone that really fitted the show, but having a lackluster looking intro which mainly focuses on CGI really.\\n\r\nThe first ed fitted in a way according to Nina's character, while the second ed was actually forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nWhen it came to action, it felt much more spaced out than Genesis, then again Genesis only had 12 episodes whereas Virgin Soul has 24, but the action was pretty damn good my only problems are they either felt short or were just piled on with CGI which didn't help.\\n\r\nThe adventure aspect didn't feel as good either compared to Genesis, even though Genesis felt a lot like LOTR in some way, Virgin Soul just felt like a bunch of stuff happening with the main characters getting caught in the middle of it and have to find a way to get out of it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Virgin Soul is mostly on par with Genesis, both are good and both have their problems, the after credit scene during the final episode does have me hyped in a way that a third season could happen and might focus on the old crew again, if this is the case then it could be a brilliant way to end the story.",

            "content": "(DISCLAIMER) First of all: I have not yet watched the first season. This might seem strange, but it's easily explained by me watching amvs about this anime, copy- and pasting the name and not checking for previous seasons.\r\n(THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE)\r\nSo, I enjoyed this anime a lot more than I probably should have. The strory is very similar to other anime, some social issues get touched upon- plus points for having good and evil/ not likeable characters on every side. About the story there isn't much to say, but I must say that for me it seemed to make sense, the way that thingswere happening. It was easy to just ignore most of the plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nThe world building was as stupid as we usually get for stories like these, where maybe small enviroments like the cities kinda make sense, but we never really get a good grasp of the whole actualy world. We just jump from location to location.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound were decent, in some scenes exceptionally good. Interesting angles, animations- the dance scenes were done amazingly in my opinion. The animation could've been a bit smoother at times in my opinion, didn't bother me too much though. The music amplified emotions and the choral singing was used very well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now Characters: A lot of people might disagree, but I think that Nina's and Charioce's relationship was very interesting. It is one of the key themes and story elements in this anime, so if you do not like this couple at all it could be annoying, for me it was one of the main reasons to keep watching, if not THE reason. Most of the characters are very quirky, they either look weird or act silly, but they still seem grounded in reality to a certain extend. Rita, the zombie-doctor, seems not phased by anything at first and because of that like a character that's difficult to relate to, but then she  reveals herself to be very compassionate and to sincerely care for her friends.\\n\r\nThe main character, Nina, is very light hearted and free spirited, because of which she does not seem to suit the rest of the characters who are dealing with very 'serious' issues right from the beginning and she acts more like comic relief, being the person who accidentaly got caught up in that mess. As the story progresses and she grows close to the other characters, the strengh in her bubbliness and her way of dealing with trauma and personal issues gets shown more clearly, which then makes her a serious character at the end. In these 24 episodes all the characters that from my understanding weren't in the first season, change a lot and some have even drastic character developement.\\n\r\nThe fan service: the clothing was sometimes/ quite often very short and skimpy, which I did not enjoy all that much (as a straight gal), but it didn't make the scenes too laughable. It knows when to fanservice, and during sad sequences cleavage is not too noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally I would in a way compare this to Rokka no Yuusha, because there as well no completely new and exciting themes were discussed, but the one's that were touched upon are explained quite in depth. Also similar to RnY are the characters that we all have seen in one way or another before, but still having facests added that make them unique.\\n\\n\r\nApparently this anime hasn't done very well and the chance of a third season is very low, but I will keep hoping to get something, if only because the romance was interesting and not stereotypical.\\n\\n\r\nYou should definetly give this a go, but if you're coming from the first season you should regard this as a new story with some old characters you already like, and try to give the new characters some time to grow on you.",

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was a show that lived by its characters and died by its plot. The show kind of came out of left field in Fall 2014. It was an adaptation of a mobile game (or gotcha game) and was coming from a fairly new studio Mappa. Although it started under the radar, it did not take long for the show to pick up steam, and it even ended up being one of the most popular and hyped shows of its season. The lead characters, Kaiser and Favaro, were outstanding, and it had several side characters to give them a run for theirmoney. Personally, I think the cast is one the best in anime and at bare minimum one of the most fun. Sadly, the plot could not back up its ridiculously good character lineup. Genesis started as a character driven adventure story, but ended up a rather generic fantasy-action show by the end of its run. Even though I do not think the show is a must watch, I would still recommend it for its quality characters, especially its leads.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, most of the cast is back for another season, Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul. Although Kaiser and Favaro take a back seat in the second season, they are replaced with equally great leads, Nina and Charioce\u2026 or so it seemed. Both Nina and Charioce started off absolutely fantastic, but they end utterly abysmal, as they are some of the most butchered character arcs I have ever seen. Although Nina\u2019s character is totally wrecked by the end of the series, all her faults end up tying back to Charioce, and he does not stop after destroying Nina and himself, as he goes so far to make both Favaro and Kaiser come crashing down with them. Charioce is certainly the most disappointing character I have seen in recent years and is certainly in the running for overall worst character in anime, as he drags multiple otherwise great characters down into the grave with him.\\n\\n\r\nCharioce plays the role of the main villain of Virgin Soul and starts of as a pretty damn good one. Virgin Soul picks up ten years after the events of Genesis, and Charioce has been crowned the new king in the time between them. It is never really made clear how much power he holds as king, but it seems he pretty much has power over the entire human race. Although he is essentially the head pin of humanity, he focuses on furthering his own goals rather helping others, so to call Charioce evil would be an understatement, as he uses his power and charisma to enslave demons, murder, imprison the innocent, kidnap, and manipulate. He is pretty much the ultimate villain, and even if someone this evil may sound more cartoony rather than an actual person, he isn't. The show makes sure that viewer understands he does all these horrible things not because he is some madman, but because he has goals he wants to achieve no matter the cost. Charioce is evil, but even if he has his reasons for being evil, he is still evil.\\n\\n\r\nLet us take a look at how Charioce is introduced at the beginning of Virgin Soul. After the catastrophe of the massive dragon Bahamut, it was Charioce who helped humanity back on its feet after he took the role of King, but to do this, he had to turn his back against their old allies, the angels and cruelly enslaved their old enemies, the demons. Although he built up the humans, he did so on the blood of others. Charioce would do anything and everything to make his dream come true, even if that meant he had to kill and betray countless times to get there, and as the show unfolds, Charioce only adds to the list of atrocities he has committed. A person like this, so tunnel visioned by their ambitions that they throw compassion out the window, makes for a very interesting villain, because it lets you empathize with them even though you know they can never truly be forgiven for their previous actions. In the last act of the anime, it is revealed that Charioce\u2019s goal is to put an end to Bahamut, as the attack ten years ago was responsible for the death of his mother. As it stood, Bahamut would eventually return, so he chooses to resurrect him (killing numerous more people) so that he can finish him once and for all.\\n\\n\r\nIt is all fine and dandy that Virgin Soul wants me to sympathize with Charioce, but it cannot try and tell me that I should forgive him, or should they let not one, but basically their entire cast of characters show him forgiveness. All the horrible things that Charioce did are forgotten about when they find out that Charioce was (kinda) doing a good thing for the world in the end. This is complete bullshit! The ends do not always justify the means. Even if humanity does benefit from Charioce\u2019s plans, he is still only selfishly doing it to get revenge for his mother. Charioce can have his reasons for the crimes he committed, but those reasons should not mean that everything he did should just go away (especially when a lot of it had little to nothing to do with killing Bahamut in the end), and it does not. This one decision Virgin Soul made killed everything the show built up to at that point.\\n\\n\r\nCharioce's redemption also gets to ruin several other characters alongside his own. Nina, the new protagonist of this season, falls in love with Charioce and wants to separate the two sides she sees in him, the first side, the person she loves and the second side, the evil king responsible for countless heartless acts. When Nina finally realizes that her loved one and her enemy are the same person, she somewhat reluctantly decides she still needs to stand against him, even at the cost of letting go of the person she loves. Up to this point, Nina\u2019s character is still quite good, and even if she decided to jump ship and stand next to the king, because said king is also the one she loves, I would not of faulted her character for it. That is not the case though, she decides that no matter what, Charioce must be stopped and his crimes cannot go unpunished, but after hearing a BS excuse for his actions, Nina immediately forgives him going against everything her character just stood for at that point. Forgiving Charioce single-handedly killed Nina\u2019s character arc, and hers was not the only one butchered by this very same action.\\n\\n\r\nFavaro and Kaiser have almost two full seasons of being great characters with firm beliefs and moral standings, but forgiving Charioce made everything come tumbling down for them too. Favaro supports Nina for choosing to choose Charioce over her own identity\u2014dumb but grounded in the idea that love triumphs over all. Favaro chose to selflessly save the world over the girl he loved, Amira, at the climax of the first season, but he tells Nina to put her own love over everything else, because he wishes he could go back and do the same, throwing his previous character arc out of the window. It was certainly disappointing to see Favaro\u2019s character U-turn like this, but it was even more disappointing witnessing Kaiser\u2019s downfall.\\n\\n\r\nKaiser was always a person who stood strongly for his personal idea of justice. At the start of Genesis, Kaiser was a knight who fought against Favaro, because he was a criminal bounty hunter, but after he realizes his adversary is less of a crook than he originally thought, he does not hesitate to jump ship, joining Favaro, and even fight against some of his old allies. The reason Kaiser became a knight in the first place is because he wanted to spend his life fighting for his beliefs, so when he figures out Charioce is not the good-wholesome king he and everyone else thought he was, he quickly starts to rethink his position. Kaiser has always been loyal to justice, not loyal to the king. He jumps ship, in a similar way to Genesis, and joins Favaro and Nina in a rebellion against Charioce, but after finding out that Charioce had \"reasons\" for committing SOME of his crimes, Kaiser instantly forgives him going so far to even (spoilers) give his own life to save his. This completely goes against what Kaiser has stood for this entire time, sparing a mass murder because he is maybe kind of a little bit sorry. Kaiser forgiving Charioce to the extent of laying down his life for him is insanely out of character and goes against all his core beliefs. At least Nina and Favaro were bounty hunters with at least a little moral ambiguity, but Kaiser is literally a knight that is supposed to be fighting for justice.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, not everyone is so quick to jump on the Charioce-forgiveness bandwagon. Two characters, Azazel and Jeanne d\u2019Arc, do not agree with the retribution everyone else seems to be giving Charioce. Both Azazel and Jeanne have one extra thing they hold Charioce responsible for on top of all his other crimes, the death of their son (pretty much adopted son in Azazel\u2019s case), Mugaro. Although Charioce did not directly kill Mugaro (that criminal act goes to one of his men, Alessand) he tried to multiple times, so when Alessand kills him to gain his approval, Azazel and Jeanne still hold him accountable to a large degree. Azazel and Jeanne have every right to hate Charioce for both personal and general reasons\u2026 This is Virgin Soul though, so, of course, the show decides the paint them in wrong and Charioce in the right, because did not you know? Charioce did all those horrible things in an attempt to stop a dormant Bahamut by resurrecting him, killing more in the process. Fuck, man. Can Virgin Soul do anything right?\\n\\n\r\nVirgin Soul was actually a pretty good anime up until Charioce\u2019s redemption, so am I going to hard on a single plot point? Maybe, but they fucked up so hard with Charioce that his problems actually became everyone else\u2019s. Charioce, in my opinion, will most definitely go down as one the biggest blunders in anime history. He had so much potential as a character and lived up to none of it, just like Virgin Soul. Genesis was a really good anime despite having a lot of problems and rather than fixing those problems, Virgin Soul gave us Charioce.",

            "content": "I understand I watched seldom little, but the point is that within 5 episodes, you already know that the writers failed to write something that'll take another 19 episodes to finish.\r\nForemost, the obvious plot issues like a normal girl who can heave multi-ton cargoes to the amazement of her peer humans, but doesn't somehow attract the attention of nobles and warriors or accusations of being a demon herself. Following this, they use her asking about a mural to explain back history, with this information being obviously common knowledge for the setting. It's like an adult asking about that yellow circle being the sun and theperson answering you still taking you seriously.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the \"Rag Demon\" can cut through masses of full plate armor clad enemies with glancing blows and the girl somehow didn't know she wasn't  a human and then explains, \"Ah i did it again!\" referring to turning into a rampaging dragon. The doctor is a little zombie girl and the Rag Demon looks like a career cocaine addict wearing purple lip stick. Overall, the entire design reeks of amateurish and shallow writing accented with eccentric characters to flavor an otherwise bland setting and plot. If anything, it reminds me of Eureka Seven AO, where it's cast is comprised of unstable boys and cute girls which devolves into a circus show of intentionally unconventional dynamics for the sake of \"being original.\"\\n\\n\r\nDespite the atrocious story design, the voice acting isn't bad, and the art is competitive for the anime industry but doesn't rank as great with its budget CG and vanilla fantasy artwork. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this boils down to making it a pass on the watch list.

            "content": "Shingeki no Bahamut, a sequel to Genesis. Oh boy. The hype was real when i heard it was coming out, as i didn't expect a second season. This is my review after watching all the episodes. (Very little spoilers)\r\nStory: 6/10\r\n                 The story ( Not giving too much away) was very... complicated. Based around Nina, a girl who can transform into a dragon with demons, angels and humans thrown into the mix. Sounds lovely right? The first half of the season was paced quite nicely,  so why do igive the story 6/10? \\n\\n\r\nThe second half was lacklustre. From a nice, consistent and smooth plot,  immediately it begins to take a twist into the realms of mind fuckery. Truth was at first i was like \"wow, i did not expect this\". But god did it feel so unnecessary as it inevitably led me to wonder why they didn't do it in such and such a way (Plot holes). The ending itself was very rushed, almost as though they clamped the jigsaw puzzle down together in the last 2 episodes... even then it felt incomplete. They also decided to follow the narrative story telling approach randomly during the second half. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art honestly was very beautiful. Every scene was magical. The transitions between different scenes flowed smooth like the ocean.  One scene in particular ( the dancing scene ) really catches my eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it's very rare that a sequel manages to live up to it's prequel in the case of an OP/ED. Many people seem to not like it, personally, I found it quite nice to listen to, even if it didn't live up to the prequel.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFocusing on Nina and Charioce,  character development was 10/10 for them (not going to spoil anything). HOWEVER,  i  wish they focused on the side characters more (such as Rita and Kaisar) , which again they rarely did in the second half. This is to be expected by viewers to want more from Favaro and Kaisar, even though the show isn't based around them, they ARE still the main characters from the prequel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt never did live up the prequel, mainly with consistency throughout the anime.\\n\r\nMany plot holes.\\n\r\nIt's still one of the better anime this season.\\n\r\nFun to watch, very unique anime.\\n\r\nThe art is so beautiful\\n\r\nI cried, i laughed, i smiled. that's an 8/10 from me =)\\n\\n\r\nTake care and have a good day!@\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "After I watched all episodes of the anime I might update this review but after finishing episode 21 I'm disappointed. I liked the first season it wasn't an outstanding anime but it was fine. The second season isn't. \r\nI'll start with the positive stuff. The art is good and I like the music, which is epic. Sadly the epic sounding songs or should I call it song is often repeated, the other music doesn't really stand out that much. I'm not a big fan of openings and endings in general so I can't give an unbiased rating of those but I wouldn't want tobuy the soundtrack of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow comes the stuff I don't like. First the mc. In the first few episodes she's a likeable goofball. In the later episodes she seems to stupid. The main reason for that is also my main complaint about this anime, Ninas romantic relationship. It feels forced and unnatural. I'll eloborate on this at the end of my review because there will be spoilers. \\n\r\nThe other characters are ok at best. Most of them don't get any character development whatsoever, especially the main characters from the first season, the just happen to be there. The only persons from the first season, up until now, that got a lot of story dedicated to them are Jeanne and Azazel. If you wanted to know more about Kaisa or Favoro or what happened to them after season one don't expect much.\\n\\n\r\nThe story suffers greatly from the romance that's just shoved in your face and sometimes whole episodes feel pointless. The most annoying episode for me is the one with the prison break. At the end of this episode I felt almost offended because half of the episode just wasted my time.\\n\r\nThe plot is also pretty predictable. \\n\\n\r\nWith episode 21 the anime picked up pace and the finale might be awesome but I ask myself is it really worth it to go through 20 episodes with a little really well done action and a lot of awkward romance (partly because it feels really long). The anime isn't really engaging although in the beginning it shows a lot of potential. If you are interessted you should try watching it yourself a review is a personal opinion after all. \\n\\n\\n\r\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSpoilerxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSpoilerxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\n\r\nI really want to talk more about Ninas relationship because it bugs me to no end. Be prepared there are spoilers ahead.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat I hate most about her relationship is that Nina's essentially falling in love with Hitler and the only reason given to the viewer to like him is that he's good looking and nice to Nina. I'm sure they will give him some stupid reason for his actions like he had to do this or the world would have ended but at this point in the anime he has commited genocide on two of the (if you count dragons as one) four different species in his world and also enslaved one of them. Playing ball with some demon kids isn't gonna bring back their parents or stop them from starving to death. The worst part is Nina knows all that but she's soooo in love... \\n\r\nThe Hitler comparison seems harsh but he's deciding humans should be the master race and oppressing and killing all other races and all other humans that have different values than him. He also destroyes a prison killing every person inside after evacuating the guards. Still this happens and isn't even mentioned or anything.\\n\r\nAnother thing that I hate is when the anime is plainly stupid or written in a lazy way. In one episode Jeanne and Nina are visiting heaven. In the city of Angels or gods Nina is like, \"My theres not a lot going on around here.\" The god who's guiding them becomes upset and Jeanne gives a look to Nina that is saying I don't know either, although some episodes before she saw a lot of gods getting slaugthered even screaming no to  kill them.....\\n\r\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

I had no idea until half way through and having discussed the series with a friend that this was a sequel.\r\nThus it goes without saying that this series stands on its own.  Most importantly, it achieves everything that it sets out to achieve.\r\nIt's a Romance.  A very high productionvalue Romace.  It's main character Nina adds much needed levity to a series that would otherwise be waaay too dark for my taste.  But fortunately the series isn't entirely about her.  Charioce is a complex character: he's a terrible guy, with a truly soft spot (such characters have existed in history).  Characterization was only graded an 8 because there were moments when I did think Nina, or some other character could have benefited from a break in their normal routine selves.  \\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters: Kaiser has the only true Arc in the story (ending in a different personality and world view than where he began).  Azazel was the tragic character of this story.  \\n\\n\r\nCould the show have gone deeper?  Probably, but not every series can or should be Game of Thrones, or hyper action hero oriented.  The action is a vehicle for the drama, and the drama never gets so thick that the plot won't move forward (7 Seasons of Game of Thrones and still no Night King).  The balance is there.  Me and my wife binged this in 3 nights.  AMAZING show!  Take it at face value.",

So I\u2019ll get to the point, if you are coming to see this as a sequel then just stop while you still can. As this anime stands, it\u2019s nowhere near good enough to be called a sequel to Genesis. However if you are watching this just to see an anime that is viewed as a stand-alone experience then I would give it a chance. Overall the story is basic and the characters are your run of the mill experience, yes thisincludes the ones coming back from Genesis, sorry not sorry, the music is your standard mix of English and Japanese to form some blend I guess in hopes of making American viewers happy, and the art is still just as good if not better than Genesis. So it\u2019s really a situation of people who came to see this as a continuation of Genesis versus people who just came to watch an anime that isn\u2019t so bad you\u2019ll have to stop midway. And yes, it is definitely made apparent that this was made for the latter. To sum up what I\u2019m saying, watch this with the intent of it being stand-alone, not as a sequel. You\u2019ll only be disappointed.",

            "content": "I watched this anime for two things\r\n* A strong female lead\r\n* An interesting, adventurous storyline\r\nI can't exactly say I didn't get that.\r\nIt might be useful to add that this is the first Shingeki no Bahumut related thing that I have seen, so I have nothing to compare it to.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nAt first, the story is wonderful. Nina meets certain people who end up relying on her power and so on in order to rebel against the king. Just when things started to look really good, and I was certain that this would be a big 10/10 that I could tick off my list, the worst happened.\r\nThestory turned AWAY from the action and intrigue, and decided to focus on ROMANCE.\\n\r\nI knew there would probably be some type of romance subplot, but I didn't think it would suddenly become something that resembled Fushigi Yuugi.\\n\r\nSuddenly, Nina, who can be a clown but very strong-willed about being used just for her power, only cares about her love interest and worrying about the future, when will she see him again, *insert tired groan here*.\\n\r\nThis anime was great, until they hinged the whole story on it's weakest point. I was hoping to see more Azazel but he ended up fading into the background after his plot convenient factor had run its course. It might mention that he's a main character, but don't that fool you about his involvement.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nGorgeous. Stunning. It felt very fluid and unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 \\n\r\nMy impression is that the sound was good for what it was used for. There was nothing extraordinary about it that made me want to listen again and again, but it certainly isn't a boring soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nAs usual, most of my overall score is swayed by the characters, and these ones were... interesting.\\n\r\nWhen she isn't fawning over her ridiculous love story, Nina is actually a pretty cool person. She is stubborn and a bit cocky, but that adds to her likeability; which only makes the love story make me even more frustrated.\\n\r\nShe's proud of her abilities and of her origins, and has no problem showing off her unnatural strength in arm-wrestling matches.\\n\r\nTHIS is the stuff that should have been highlighted more in the anime, instead of reducing her to a snivelling 'girl in love'.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway.\\n\r\nThe most interesting character for me was Mugaro - one of the supporting characters. The subplot surrounding him was very interesting, and a welcomed distraction from Nina's love story dilemma.\\n\r\nHe is the character to whom most have a fondness for, and I think this is one of the things that helps meld this dynamic group of people into a working, functioning group.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the other half to this love story whom I won't name for 'spoiler purposes' although it doesn't matter much.\\n\r\nHe underwent a HUGE personality change - some of it I could keep up with, and some of it just seemed ridiculous. He is introduced as completely ruthless, but is then shown to have a softer side when he meets Nina (in an arm wrestling match of all things). You want me to believe that this man isn't completely cold and cruel when he spends time with a bouncy, energetic girl, that's totally fine.\\n\r\nBut then I'm supposed to believe that in the span of 1-3 episodes, he has completely disposed of his arrogant, 'I am the strongest and I know best' attitude.\\n\r\nThat's pushing it a little too much, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the frustrations that I had, I don't regret watching the show. It might seem like a really bad sequel - and maybe it is, as I said, I haven't watched the previous Shingeki no Bahamut - but I think it does hold it's own as a show; as long as you aren't in it purely for an action/adventure. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nThe bittersweet ending made for a pretty unsatisfying ending. So much happened, and yet the only thing that gets focused on for the most part is this love story. If the romance could have been sidelined then this probably would have been a much better product.\\n\r\nHowever, there was still plenty that I enjoyed (it takes at least 13 episodes before romance really begins to domineer). It could be comedic, which was probably it's saving grace in this score, since the pressure of actually having a good story lightens a little when it is accentuated that Nina is just this powerfully strong disaster that explodes every time a young man makes her heart race.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review will be extremely quick and only highlight what I believe are the major things the anime hit home, following the rubric provided by the website. \r\nStory: Highly disappointing. Genesis did it much better, and this made me think that the creators wanted to mimic the same success by trying to make a formula without soul. Yes, the ideas are still interesting, yes the concept is cool, the world building is nice, just like Genesis. The story started out interesting, with the rag demon and the new primary character (Nina), with appearances from previous characters, but things went south by the second half. Theplot twist was forced, the romance seemed unnatural and was underdeveloped, and they made a really bad move in regards to a certain character and his fate. I would argue they actually did that twice. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm still a fan of the art. I think it's very visually appealing, and the animation is pretty good. There is some 3D animation included, but it blends in quite well and isn't a nuisance. \\n\\n\r\nSound: First OP was good, and I think they should have kept it. I didn't like the second OP. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Flat. A lot of them. They tried to give backstories to flesh them out, but it wasn't all that effective, especially with Charioce. I wasn't a fan of how they played out his duality and the reasoning they gave for their extremely stupid move (the move which drives the entire plot). It's not something a king would do, and make the entire anime suddenly pointless (especially with the revelation at the end). Additionally, they included the old cast (probably for fan-service) but all they had going for them ended up being nostalgia and stereotypes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10. The first half got me excited, I was planning on rating it an 8 or 9, but man that ending killed it for me. Very unsatisfactory.",

Most of the season we don't know what the goal is nor is anything explained until the last 5 episodes and then we rush deaths and fights and endings, nothing is satisfying.\r\nThe art is the saving grace alot of amazing stills, the animation is okbut alot of cgi pulls it back.\\n\\n\r\nI dragged myself through this wondering should i even finish it and why am i doing this, but the are decent episodes in the middle and Favaro,Rita,Kaisar and Bachus are decent returning caracthers though they are changed and not the focus of the story.So id say you will enjoy something in this anime but just not enough to be worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nSolid 4. Can watch it but probably should just rewatch the first season\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is one of those rare times when a sequel improves on the original. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was a decent if rather generic fantasy show (I rated it 7), but suffered from having two caricature characters as male leads (Favaro and Kaisar), and a boring bimbo with demon powers but zero personality as female lead (Amira). At the end of Genesis, Amira stepped out of the story, and this gave room for the writers to introduce a new main girl for Virgin Soul: the half human half dragon Nina Drango. And what an improvement she is! This hilariously optimistic girl is one of myall time favorite anime girls! I'd rate the show a solid 8 just for featuring her, even if it had nothing else going for it!\\n\\n\r\nFortunately it does though. The leading boys have matured substantially here, not necessarily as human beings, but as fictional characters. They are the same as they ever were, but come across far less as silly caricatures of themselves, and much more like real people with depth and motivation. And this is the case for all the supporting characters as well. The story remains melodramatic fantasy fluff basically, but the wealth of good characters makes it enjoyable. There are several supporting characters with little stories of their own woven into the main story. Without spoiling anything I can say that things happen with these characters for better and worse, and you actually care when it does!\\n\\n\r\nBut what really makes this show a joy to watch, is the gorgeous art! The scenery is beautiful to behold, the characters are well designed and unique (in a way that conveys their character, not just makes them look cool), and the animation is fluid and cinematic. Nina was animated with such delicate finesse it reminded me of a high-budget Disney production rather than cheap cookie-cutter anime. The studio has really done a superb job here.\\n\\n\r\nTaste is of course subjective, not everyone will fall in love with Nina Drango like I did, or enjoy the particular silly fantasy story being told, but anyone who is rating this lower than a 7 or a 6 at worst just isn't being honest - this is a very well executed fantasy anime, it is solid entertainment spun out of mediocre source material.",

The story is pretty good and it's a fresh look on the world the previous series dabbled in. There was enough new mixed with the old and the exploration on the characters and their motivations was a welcomed change of pace. It wasn't as action pact as the previous series, but I think it still held itself well. There are also quiet a few emotional moments, too. The ending is a little mixed for me. I like how it turned out for some characters, but some elements could have been better.Despite that, I still think it was a good ending to the series.\\n\\n\r\nI really recommend giving it a watch if you want to see how the previous series's characters develop!",

            "content": "If you can overlook the literally pointless enslavement of demons by humans, then this series ain't so bad. \r\nHowever I disagree with some other reviews that say this is an awful sequel to Genesis. Really, all that happened was we have MORE time to notice the flaw in their writing and planning. \r\n1) the returning characters weren't intended to be the main characters, only as the main supporting cast; they only received more screentime due to it being a long series. 2) the romance ain't different or somehow more focused on than it was in Genesis, except we had more episodes to focus on it.3) the writing is in no way different (let alone worse) than it was in Genesis. \\n\\n\r\nFurther commentary below will contain at least partial spoilers. \\n\\n\r\n-- \\n\\n\r\nSTORY (6/10) \\n\r\nMy primary issue with Rage of Bahamut is the writing team has great setup and main plot, but along the way, they fail hard in pacing and in thinking things beyond character intros. This was an issue in Genesis and is how I'm far from agreeing that Virgin Soul is any worse. In reality: we merely had more time to notice it. \\n\\n\r\nFor Virgin Soul, the writers DID NOT AT ALL plan for the end. Or, kinda, even the middle of the dang story. \\n\\n\r\nOne room for complaint is how it had such a vast established world to use (tho also ignored mostly in Genesis), but instead they opted to keep the setting more-or-less in three areas; the human Capital, the prison at said-Capital, and the God Realm. Had they planned things out for the long-run, then this would've actually been fine. But they didn't. And so we were allowed nonstop reminders of plot holes, failures, and just a bunch of complaints that would require pure spoilers to address. Only pure-ish spoiler I'll give is THE DEMONS AS A WHOLE DIDN'T HAVE A REASON TO BE ENSLAVED \\n\\n\r\n. \\n\\n\r\nART (9/10) \\n\r\nI don't mind the random CGI usage for townies and whatnot. In truth, it was tons better than the CGI they used in Genesis so it's great to see they actually focused on improving it. I also can't mind it when it kept the rest of the art consistent for such a highly detailed series. \\n\\n\r\nSome problems: 1) While I applaud eternally for the beautiful, realistically timed reactions, some pauses before scene changes took far too long. Even if they planned for a commercial break after these moments, it lasted too long. 2) NOT. A. SINGLE. CHARACTER'S physical changes show. You have members who look pretty much the same as they did TEN YEARS AGO, and then members who went to prison and were told they lost weight but not look a pound lighter than when they were sentenced. Honestly, do humans not age?? 3) they they removed the lip colors for the males - I DEMAND EQUALITY IN PRETTY LIPS THANK YOU! They also didn't remove the male lips in the few flashbacks from Genesis either so... yeah, further insult to the flawless beauty that once was! \\n\\n\r\nOther than that tho, there wasn't anything too different from their design quality from Genesis (including the crappy no-bra-yet-pushed-up boobs); everything matched the world well ... Ah, that's a lie; they actually fixed the issue of the Gods' luminescence overload. It was slightly corrected in the few flashbacks from Genesis too, but that could've just been a filter side-effect. But tbh, I would've preferred a tad more luminescence just so they still look \"Godly\" while also being able to make-out their designs outside of close-ups. \\n\\n\r\n. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (5/10) \\n\r\nI don't care about Rage of Bahamut's OST. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't the focus anywhere and it didn't really change my mood whilst watching the scenes. Vocals weren't off-putting either, and the SFX were well used through-out the series. \\n\\n\r\n. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9/10) \\n\r\nThe only poor and inconsistent cast was in the poor writing. Everything else about the characters was actually very smooth and pretty refreshing; returning characters didn't face some sudden change either (tho as it WAS 10yrs later, it's kinda weird how there wasn't any). Really, there was so much room to expand on stuff but they just didn't bother ;; \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I do need to address that unlike Genesis, there was an actual message in Virgin Soul: one doesn't have to be \"perfect\" in order to be loved or any less genuine. Meanwhile, what I got from Genesis was \"it's okay to fall for a literal 5-year-old because she's physically 20\" and the generic trope of not everyone oozing their full potential as if it was a fairytale. Sadly, Virgin Soul's writing didn't really reflect this so I think others will forget this message they even blatantly addressed. \\n\\n\r\n. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (8/10) \\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan on long fight scenes. And that's more-or-less how the series concluded itself, so I wasn't that interested at the end. Not a poor decision to have the concluding fight at the end, but I continuously had to restrain myself from skipping forward even tho I knew I'd miss out on small details. \\n\\n\r\nBut during the majority of the series, I didn't dislike the story or characters enough to be disinterested or upset. Aside from painfully obvious plot holes and forgetting the severity of the events during serious times (not for comedic or other relief from drama), I was able to enjoy it and continue watching despite having work in the morning. But then with how things ended, it was so backwards in some regards that I couldn't ignore how upset I was despite the good aspects ;; \\n\\n\\n\r\n. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (8/10) \\n\r\nIt's seriously just the writing that's so bad about Rage of Bahamut in general. Sure it still puts some other (mainstream) series to shame, but it has so many issues that could've been avoided with some BASIC PLANNING that it's unable to be overlooked. Sadly, Virgin Soul's taking the blame for something that Genesis did as well.",

            "content": "For the most part Virgin Soul seems like its going to be better than Genesis, but then when it finishes, it just feels empty.  Like, it could have delivered more than it did, but it was so dead set on cramming the romance angle into the finish of the story, than truly delivering the realism and great finish it could have and should have had, that the whole ending suffered.  There is a reason that most animes don't have the Protagonist and the Antagonist in the kind of relationship that Nina and Chris were in: It just doesn't work and causes logic holesall throughout the story.  Still, it was a very good anime for the most part, and while the ending was a bit lacking, you'd still very much enjoy the first 21-22 episodes.",

            "content": "I really liked this when it started airing. It was my most looked forward to show weekly. So I'm sad to say that I can't bring myself to give it any higher than a 7, because towards the last few episodes it just wasn't as satisfying to watch anymore.\r\nArt and animation: it's really pretty, and the animation is quite impressive at times. You'll get grand explosions or nice scenery and good facial expressions.\r\nMy enjoyment for it alone made me think it'd be a 8 from the start based on that alone, but it sort of faltered towards the end and therefore it's a 7 now.But overall I had fun watching and it was worth my time - I don't regret watching at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: characters are memorable, at least. Characters from the past season are there and lovable as before - or more now, having matured. But important as they still are the newly introduced characters are the ones the plot revolves around. And that's where the differing opinions come in about whether they are good characters or not. Personally I think they're fine and interesting to watch, and can be pretty quirky. But I have to admit that how much I like the new characters depends on what kind of situations they are put into - their behaviours make me smile sometimes, but at times they give me a headache. Character interactions can be done really really well - that's what I loved about the characters - but I think at parts they can also be cringey or unnatural.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The overall story ends up not being as strong as I'd hoped. There are interesting elements, but it doesn't really get anywhere for some time at the start. But when things started moving midway was when I think the show started becoming really enjoyable. Here's when we watchers eagerly watch on and see how things will be resolved while excitedly discussing whether we think it should end happily/not happily/etc for the characters involved, and why. It was very much enjoyable to see the good/bad sides of the show and the conflicting interests of our cast.\\n\r\nI think how everything got resolved ended up being a bit disappointing. After the whole season of \"who's bad, who's good, what's the right thing to do?\", the resolution ends up being sort of anti-climactic in my opinion. In the finale there were times I thought \"ugh, are you really going to do that?!\". The ending had happy moments, sad moments, and did give us time to have a proper conclusion for everyone. That's one good thing. Whether or not the conclusions were satisfactory or not probably depends on the the individual though. At least, one good thing I'll say is that the ending tries to tie up all the ends and what happens. Most shows just end abruptly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nSo what's good about this show? Well, it's fun, and it gets good near the middle. The characters grow on you, and the character interactions are for the most part, natural and fun. They can be pretty humorous too, with how they act despite being thrown into weird situations. The animation is great as well. Enjoyment wise, I overall rate it quite highly for most of the series. The series also isn't afraid to take risks, and deaths can be commonplace. So it really makes you wonder how dire things can end up being. There are some good twists in there. And some really good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nI think the story could have ended better, it might have been a bit rushed at the end. But there was much time given after the climax for us to understand what happens in the aftermath, so that's good. The romance is also hit and miss, and because it's a important factor/motivation for our MC, the conclusion of the show is something you'll probably either like or dislike.\\n\\n\r\ntldr;\\n\r\nFun? Very much, for the most part\\n\r\nWorth the time? Mostly, imo.\\n\r\nRegret watching? Never.\\n\r\nGood? Middle part > starting > ending, overall ok\\n\r\nWould you like it? Idk, but worth a try really.",
