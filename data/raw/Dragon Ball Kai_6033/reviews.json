            "content": "Next Time On Dragon ball Z...Oops I mean Kai.\r\nMany like me who have seen the original and yet have seen this and thought well Kai is obviously the same isn't it?\r\nWell Yeah thats because it is But there are differences here and there to mention but it isn't as major as a lot of people like to assume so I will be making some comparisons here that you'll expect to see in this review since this is based on my analysis of this show from watching it twice alongside Dragon ball Z.\r\nStory - 9\r\nThe story is sped up much more better compared to the originalfor obvious reasons of course, It sticks to major characters along with the main plot, less over the top screaming (Though there is that occasionally at times) and less deviating to different locations with little going on in them. better direction of how the pacing is handled within the story to how it is in the manga though I would argue that some certain moments in this version like the original happened quite differently in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe short prologue to the beginning of what happened to Goku's father Bardock was a nice touch compared to how the original started off. It sets the story very nicely by showing bardock's assault on frieza's army and also the major difference was a removal of the fillers from the original which I like a lot about this.\\n\\n\r\nNow for me I enjoyed some of the fillers from the original anime such as Gohan surviving out in the wilderness as part of his training or Goku and Piccolo amusing test driving episode or even seeing some of the characters trying to find the dragon balls or just randomly seeing some of the supporting characters in their own segments like Tien, Krillin, Yamcha, Chichi etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe fillers were also placed in some of the right spots in the story to give some fun easy going highlights towards characters and even progression for example gohan on his adventure out in the wilderness by piccolo to adapt to his surroundings and to not be afraid had a nice throwback to the original dragonball that in a way keeps it connected.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Some of the Fillers like these are still a joy to watch personally unlike some certain animes that just shoehorn filler episodes to disrupt the flow of their story and action badly \\n\r\n(cough cough Bleach and Naruto)\\n\\n\r\nThe Filler from the original offered a nice casual distraction away from the main plot but also kept up in the right places as well as still offering the action, drama and humour to the show as a whole, I mean sure the negative to that is filler episode could tend to drag but they were also placed in convenient places that to me made sense and I wish a lot of shonen animes would do this. (I could go, But moving on)\\n\\n\r\nBut to note I also know from the original anime you have fillers that are just too slow and time wasting, For the love of god I totally did not like the whole fake Planet Namek filler and Goku when he fell off snake way when he met those 2 annoying Orges, including the fillers that stretch the length of certain episodes or just random added silly moments which I also wasn't a fan of.\\n\\n\r\nNow with Kai most of these fillers are pretty much gone which really helps viewers to stick with the main plot which in term keeps it more direct and maintains that balance of content and at least help it to not completely drag on for very long which is a major improvement.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 6\\n\r\nHonestly I am however disappointed with Toei animation. \\n\r\nA series that finished a long time ago, that was beloved by loads of fans all round the world gets this reboot in 2009 and did they improve on art and animation? honestly.. Not that much at all. \\n\\n\r\nThis very much annoys me to say this but Dbz kai in terms of its animation capturing the same dated 4:3 ratio like the original did with certain colour correction and contrast but with the very same style of animation which in today standards of art and animation is undeniably lazy from Toei Animation standards considering this reboot came out in 2009!! Just unacceptable. \\n\\n\r\nI have no problem with the art/animation with the original series since it came out in the late 80s/Early 90s, but Come On Now!.. this is practically the same with little certain things that they kinda enhanced which look like anybody could do on PowerPoint! \\n\\n\r\nWhat seems very good from the very opening of truly great animation that would of suited the series as whole for it in this era of animation only comes to slap people in the face when they see this and say where is the improvement on the animation?? (No way only in the opening!?....Really? Surely they had a lot more time right?)\\n\\n\r\nThe original recycled animation has been limited but still not showing enough of that change that should of been implemented with better quality in the first place and some of the uncut blood and violence is replace by bruises which looks silly and yes even though the manga isn't too violent it still looses some of its believability at times when something violent occurs\\n\r\nwhich does make me sympathies with those that did not warm up towards this series but again another thing is at least its not bad compared with the original in terms of missing features to the characters and what not.\\n\\n\r\nAs a really good example look at original JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders reboot. It got an updated look of the animation as well as other features in their new series to bring its source material of the manga to life so why not Dragon ball kai??\\n\\n\r\nI get that the studio works on other different shows in Japan now and then but Is it really that much of a chore for them to do so for their most profitable franchise besides just animating the opening? They might as well just get Madhouse to work on it like they did for Hunter X Hunter 2011 if they aren't really up to the task.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 6\\n\r\nRight Okay..I honestly feel pretty mixed about this one.\\n\r\nWhile Kenji Yamamoto was originally the music composer behind The music of this series but had to be replace because of some corporate music scandal he had done.\\n\\n\r\nbefore this show was release on DVD/bluray to the public they had the music to be replace with the former composer from the original series in 2009 which yet again is a problem, like the animation the music score sounds too dated like I'm watching an old detective show that sounds like 1966 The Green Hornet, The Hell!? seriously its Dragon ball Z!!!\\n\\n\r\nSo Understand that the mixes of genres of this show falls under Battle Shounen, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Martial Arts, \\n\r\nSci Fi, Super Power which adds a lot of variety for this show so It should feel and sound like it has its own uniqueness here especially to other music soundtracks nowadays but it unfortunately doesn't since this anime has more of an out of date feel to it now which does not make me feel invested towards the episodes as much at times.\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE the music composer Kikuchi Shunsuke from the original series I've nothing against him, but his soundtracks for a reboot version/ Remastering of this series up to this point just doesn't really make me feel excited or engage to whats happening on scene especially since certain Iconic soundtracks are not present there like the original show and with this issue I feel, It just doesn't really resonate with me when something is taking place. \\n\\n\r\nOf course I am aware that Kai added a few new music scores in place of the show and they sound good but are only once during different characters moments which makes it pretty pointless honestly.\\n\r\nIt was more better in the original because it was more authentic and done so well for particularly in that time period of anime back then.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Opening Is okay, not really topping the original in anyway since the original Opening sounded so Iconic and with this opening I just felt it was played too much that but could've added more instead of hearing the same opening song throughout 97 episodes and again In no way competes with the opening of Dragon ball Z CHA-LA HEAD-CHA-LA since its so Iconic from the previous installment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting - 9\\n\r\nThe dub and sub on the other hand are probably the highlight of Kai itself especially the dub as it is well handled by funimation. \\n\r\nIt adds a lot more verbal curses than the original from previous works of there own, Good thing about this show its that it sticks closer to the Japanese dialogue of its source material.\\n\\n\r\nFor me the stand out performance from the dub easily was Chris Ayres as Frieza, Sean Schemmel as Goku, Dameon Clarke as Cell and Chris Sabat as Vegeta and Piccolo. I was also very happy that I heard other different voices for a change too, Though I do however miss Kyle Hebert as the narrator for his charismatic energy for the intro but doc Morgan does do a good job also. \\n\\n\r\nOther voices like Colleen Clinkenbeard as Gohan in english is sort of okay but not that good, It can sometimes sound a little jarring and irritating at times especially when she forces her vocals too hard along with the screaming and I preferred her less as gohan as the show went on and I'm not a fan of when she has to voice Kid Goku since its basically the same as another character that she voices such as Luffy and to me it just does not fit for kid goku or gohan since all I'm hearing from her is her performance as luffy.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention she voices 18 who doesn't even sound like she's related to 17 as his twin sister who I felt the original sounded more close to it even in the Japanese, though her little kid version of gohan isn't too bad. There was also a few annoying script changes as well in certain scenes too. But overall a great dub.\\n\\n\r\nNow also, to be fair In comparison to Nozawa's performance as Goku and Gohan I do think it would be unfair to compare voice performance here as some of the Japanese voice actors i feel don't always sound as right in their roles regardless if Akira had a hand in picking certain individuals, but that isn't my place to say because I do at times like their performance.\\n\\n\r\n(P.s I'm Not trying to start a Dub Vs Sub debate here folks)\\n\\n\r\nAlso I like to mention the opening and closings is quite upbeat and laughably offer the best animation of the show by leaps and bounds.\\n\\n\r\nbut yet again, only having 1 opening can be repetitive for 97 episodes, honestly it would of been nice if they had done a few more openings each with a different song but Alas! Its only a minor nitpick. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters - 8\\n\r\nAs Similar to the original, Cool heroes, Wicked villains, Memorable action, Plot as well as a great build up that follows through different stages of the narrative just like the manga counterpart now that the dialogue in this series expresses the show more better. Its demonstrates pretty much the same cast of colourful characters that still represents themselves in their colourful own way the more you watch you start to feel some sort of connection to one of these characters that define a lot of fun traits within the shonen genre and it's easy to see why.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have their own drive about them that strive to be the best of themselves despite their flaws which will resonate sharply with the viewer but it also gives interesting context to prior events that happens within each Arc which becomes clearer even through my 2nd rewatch.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI have to admit the first half I really enjoyed a lot but I felt by the second half it felt like it got a little bit tedious going into Cell's Arc even towards the final third of the show, it weirdly enough ends at Trunks going back to his own timeline to end the chaos without finishing off the rest of the series but It was pretty much a simple yet a decent conclusion until Dragon ball Kai 2014 pretty much wraps up the original series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict - 8\\n\r\nNow there could of been a much more improved version of this no doubt about that, but I feel Dbz kai did a decent job on its reboot to the original despite falling short in places where its production was very lazy which earns this series this rating \\n\\n\r\nIts still a great series for anyone who want an introduction to watching battle shounen anime or just want to check out what the original series of Dragon Ball Z is.\\n\\n\r\nIt sticks close at hand to its source material even if you don't want to fully watch the original at least this is a more condense way to get through with ease and not too long to feel drawn out. Sorry if my review came off being serious but that is how I properly critic and say what I say with honesty.\\n\\n\r\nAlso PLEASE watch Dragon ball if you can, Its basically The prequel of Both Dragon ball Kai & Z since that doesn't get as much love as the sequel does in general. Or if it's not your thing than the Manga would likely be a better option. Until then Thanks for reading. ; )\\n",

            "content": "I am writing this review with mostly one intent in mind: to get across the point of how much is being cut. I know that we were all excited to have the story condensed, but I think that this has gone a bit further than anyone expected. That does not make me upset, as we can all go back and watch the original againl if the original is what we want, but I think that it should be addressed fairly openly. I will also address art, since that is the other big change.\r\nI hope no one minds the spoilers, as I am assuming that mostpeople have seen Dragon Ball Z that are watching this series, and anyone who is not cannot be spoiled very much about what is not there.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nFirst of all, some extraordinarily gratuitous events that needed to be cut, such as Krillin gathering up the gang again to train, have been left out and improved the series. Some cuts, however, have changed the story in an irrevocable manner. None of these are exactly necessary to the plot's core, which is fighting anyway, but they are all central to the development of the story and how the characters call out to us.\\n\\n\r\n- Vegeta and Nappa's apparent saving of and then ruthless destruction of Arlia is left out entirely.\\n\r\n- Goku being captured by and tormented by Princess Snake is entirely left out (a hilarious episode before, I think).\\n\r\n- Goku battling the red and blue demons and taking their fruit, gaining massive strength, are completely left out, so Goku has no apparent power jump just from reaching Kai's planet, changing how important Kai is to him.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, none of these episodes being cut is necessarily awful nor great, but they all matter to how we felt about the characters and the story in the original, I think.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, I think that what we have seen from the Nappa versus everyone fighting so far shows us that the fighting will feel enjoyable, and probably not be condensed quite as much (although I could be wrong). The pacing of that felt really proper to me, so I think we can really look forward to future fights being fleshed out better than in the original.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIn talking about the art, there is not that much that needs to be pointed out, but there are definitely a few big problems. I think that they have done a great job of making it into a widescreen series from what was not widescreen. There are three big types of errors that I have noticed, sadly.\\n\\n\r\n1) There are moment's like Nappa after he stopped flying above Piccolo in episode 10 (19:53 for me) where he looks incredibly blurred for a few seconds. This is not a one time occurrence, and it is really ugly when it happens. Sometimes this is due to original art, but this instance did not seem to be there in the original DVD to me (maybe the bold lines sometimes make it happen). Sometimes blurriness from the old version is cut out though, so this is not always badly done!\\n\r\n2) They somehow really ramped up the brightness for this show, but occasionally something comes out darker than it should be and jars the senses when it switches back to brightness.\\n\r\n3) The bold border lines of each character gets really thick then bulges to being thinner rather at random. This is the one that actually constantly bothers me and merited a 6 for an art rating. I almost hesitate to point this out because it seems to be one of those trends one cannot unnotice after noticing.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the devotion built up for the characters (or dislike of characters like Chi Chi) is still rather consistent with the original, and many of us watched Dragon Ball or the original Dragon Ball Z and already have our feelings set about each character anyway. Whatever may be, this is a good effort, and will make it at least slightly easier to share this show with casual fans, which is a major win for the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone wants a final ruling or something, then I guess that my feeling is this: I would honestly prefer the original by a bit to this point because the original plot never particularly loses steam until the Ginyu Force saga is wrapping up. I am very excited to have Goku versus Freiza and beyond condensed, as there was so much unnecessary (Trunks powering up for a full episode, as good of a joke as it may have provided). I also think that the original art (or previous digitally remastered, less bright, less bold version) is fun in its own right, and probably actually more fun than this to look at when one considers it enough.\\n\\n\r\nIf I got anything drastically wrong, then please let me know and I will attempt to deal with it.",

No more eternal power charging, no more eternal \"he is so strong\" internal monologues a no more feeling that nothing really happened in the last 10chapters. Yeah there are some fun filler missing, like when goku and picolo go to the driving school, but in the end what is gained with the exclusion of the filler is far more than what is lost.\\n\r\nI've read here that the story got cut out, that's not true, they just cut out all the filler that made the original Dragonball anime a pain to whatch for the poeple that have read the original manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10.\\n\r\nThe art in dragonball has allways been decent considering the times when it was released. But just as the new opening makes you believe at first, this could have been a real remake but the only thing we get here are the exact same animation but on a higher resolution, that's all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10.\\n\r\nThe audio has been remade and sounds great. After finishing KAI I watched some episodes of the original anime and the difference was clear.\\n\r\nI also liked some of the aditions to the soundtrack, though not all of them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10.\\n\r\nAt least to this date, this is the best way to watch dragonball.\\n\r\nIf you are a newcomer to the world of dragonball you will be able to see the story and fights just as Toriyama made them in the original manga.\\n\r\nIf you already saw the original anime or manga you will be able to go throught this all time classic once again without having to be tortured by the neverending fillers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nIt's good, but it could have been so much more.\\n\r\nI really would have loved to see a real remake with the kind of animation that we get in the opening of kai.",

            "content": "I should have trusted my instincts when I decided to give Dragonball Kai a watch. It does sound quite intriguing to watch Dragonball Z again, only this time minus the filler episodes that really didn't add much or anything to the storyline; but with one change though, must come many, because for some reason writers always must omit something else that can feel almost equally important as the thing they wanted changed originally. I guess this is just one of those cases where you simply can't satisfy everyone, because DB Kai left me with a very bitter taste, and I actually prefer the original seriesby Funimation than this.\\n\\n\r\nThe story to DB Kai is no different from the original series. The Earth is paid a visit by a being named Raditz whom claims to be Goku's brother; Raditz reveals to him that he's not even of Earth, instead he comes from a different race called the Saiyians whom lived on Planet Vegeta. They eventually battle, and Goku as well as his allies learn that Raditz isn't the only one out there from that race, nor is he even close to the strongest. They then prepare themselves to battle against the last two warriors of the Saiyan race.\\n\\n\r\nI will mention now that the removal of various filler such as Snake Way, Garlic Jr., and various other things was definitely a plus. The show moves quite better without the constant distractions; but the truth is, even without the filler, DB Kai can still be a chore at times with situations dragging along for too much time, and the outcome simply not being a good enough pay off for some of the waiting. In any case, the overall story is fun, and DB Kai works its way up to the final battle against Cell. \\n\\n\r\nDB Kai manages to keep the action well paced enough, and character personalities are fleshed out. However, things could have been so much better had the only change to the show been the various filler. One thing DBZ did well was its voice acting for the English dub and character interactions. Some serious fans will catch the removal of some dialog and it may bother them, it sure as hell bothered me because Vegeta especially had some good lines, like his threat to beat on Yamcha for practically no reason. The changing of voice actors got on my nerves as well; Colleen Clinkenbeard  is annoying as hell as Gohan, and had I never seen this before I would have been wishing for his brutal death at the hands of Frieza. Now speaking of Frieza, they have Chris Ayres playing him. I hate everyone Ayres, Chris and Greg Ayres have a very annoying, whining, saccharine feel that gets on my nerves quick. Colleen Clinkenbeard also voices Android 18, and she just feels all types of wrong here. Meredith McCoy is by far the best to play her; she brought a sinister yet sexy appeal to 18 that carried over to her facial expressions and even fighting. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing DBZ always did amazingly well was introduce intense music scores. Funimation's BGM is probably this anime's best quality and they know it, yet for some reason they use boring elevator music, with no variation or anything new through out the entire duration of the show. Vegeta and Piccolo's addictive themes that described their characters so well? Gone. The terrifying BGM of death when Frieza goes off to kill Vegeta while King Kai narrates this is the evil Prince's last stand? Jettisoned... for some irritating trash that doesn't enhance the scene at all. I can list plenty more examples, but this proves to me that not everyone understands the effect music can have during some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and artwork appears to be remastered, but the only thing actually new is the opening. I don't have much of a problem with this, still this could have been better updated. At least DB Kai delivers the action well enough and there's plenty going on that can turn a new comer into a fan. There's loads of fisticuffs and brutal beatings to go around.\\n\\n\r\nAs I look around there are plenty of people that really enjoyed Kai more than DBZ. I can honestly say that I understand that because it does trim a lot of the fat and focuses more on character and story development, along with action which is the main selling point. Unfortunately for me, I look for other things in my anime and music means a lot to me; a great soundtrack can actually mask flaws in a work, and DBZ was full of them yet the BGM smoothed things out making it more tolerable. In addition, there are things that seems changed for the sake of it. None of the voice actors from the original died while this was in production, so I see no reason for the change in cast, nor the removal of some lines. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my dislike for this remake, if that's what it is, I still recommend it to fans so they can see it for themselves; but I highly advise to be prepared for these various changes. I already know plenty of individuals who had the same issues with this as I did.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHighs: Some of the removal of filler does work, enjoyable action\\n\\n\r\nLows: Altering of cast and BGM is a huge blow for me\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nI mentioned in my review of DBZ that the series had some serious flaws and wasn't a perfect adaptation of Toriyama's original manga. Today I look at Dragon Ball Kai, which actually tries to be much closer to the source material. Does it do well or did DBZ classic do it better? Let's analyze further.\r\nStory and Characters: 8/10\r\nI already reviewed the story of DBZ, so this will largely focus on the differences between Kai and the original DBZ. A massive improvement is the removal of the obnoxious filler that bogged down DBZ. How much filler was in DBZ? An illustrative example would be that 7of the first 16 episodes were entirely filler and not part of the official canon.  In Kai it no longer takes 20 episodes for a planet to explode in supposedly 5 minutes. There are no episodes where characters power up pointlessly for nearly the entire episode. The use of recycled animation simply to take up time is also mercifully decreased. Kai cut out the fat while leaving in all the action, character development, and everything that made the story great in the first place! Other than that, no substantial changes were made to story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the entire series didn't look like the opening theme animation like many fans hoped it would. The art is slightly improved from DBZ in terms of definition and quality, but the animation is still that classic, cheap and sloppy animation that we saw in the early 1990s. The art obviously looks much worse relative to other popular series in the 2010s than it did in the early 1990s when it was being compared against Yu Yu Hakusho and Sailor Moon. One major complaint from some fans was Kai's removal of much of the grit and gore from the original series. Although I also feel it is missing in some scenes, the original manga was NOT a bloodbath and this was in fact more faithful to the original.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe original OST from DBZ (Japanese version anyways) was great and didn't really need much improvement. Having said that, Kai added some nice tracks of its own and did a good job in the music department.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDragonall Kai is indeed more faithful to Toriyama's manga and is in my opinion an improvement. Why it is rated an 8.0 on MAL compared to DBZ's 8.3 is honestly a bit confusing to me. Maybe hours of filler is acceptable as long as a tiny bit more blood is added? I have no idea what our voters were thinking. Obviously this new generation of kids didn't embrace Dragonball to the degree that my generation did, but I don't blame Kai for that. Anime is no longer an oddity and something that kids will watch just because it looks different. Very little anime is currently on American TV and young anime fans watch entirely online, which wasn't an option when I was growing up. If the internet existed in 1998 with the speed to stream videos rather than take 15 minutes of loud dial up sounds just to get on the internet, my 10 year old self probably would have watched something darker and more violent to make myself feel like a badass. I watched DBZ and enjoyed it at least partially because it was the best thing available at that timeslot for a 10 year old boy. Everyone got out of school and rushed home to watch DBZ, because honestly there was nothing better on. I didn't have the option of watching Black Lagoon on my laptop. If I did, than I likely would have made the same choice that the 10 year old punks of 2014 are making.",

Now you canwatch the story quicker than you did before, 194EPs to 98EPs.\\n\\n\r\n It was very enjoyable and characters are as great as they were in the original. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I could give to the Kai haters is the lack of new animation (there are some redone scenes for a variety of reasons, but not the whole show), but I like that because the animation reminds me of the older anime like Yu Yu Hakusho, Original Series of Pokemon, and early One Piece and Case Closed/Detective Conan.\\n\\n\r\n Voice acting is better, but that's only an opinion on both sides.",

            "content": "*NO SPOILERS*\r\nRecently, i came across an internet post of someone saying Dragon Ball Z may be the greatest anime of all time. I replied with something validating and someone responded with, \"There's a hell of a lot of anime better than Dragon Ball, dude.\" This really got me thinking, Dragon Ball isn't even my favorite series, so why did i think that statement could be valid? \r\nWell, It's about objectivity. I've always thought there was something to be said about media that's easy to digest, stuff with relatively simple plots and a good mix of action and nonaction (example:\"The Princess Bride\"), I think Dragon Balleasily fits within this category. You'd know it for it's fights and it's yelling, but those fights wouldn't be nearly as iconic without all of the emotion behind them, without each character having their own reason to fight,  without the enemies willing to play by a set of rules - leaving the stakes high but the mood not too dark; Dragon Ball is about a hell of a lot more than fighting.\\n\\n\r\n  I honestly believe that anyone could enjoy it on some level if they just gave it a tiny chance. It may not be your favorite anime, It's not even mine, But how many people will enjoy your Loli Romance Magic robot fighting anime? How many people will enjoy your absurdist existential novel written from the perspective of god? Maybe a lot, if they really wanted to give it a chance, but maybe not, probably not. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it doesn't fit into a specific niche, it just \"is Dragon Ball\", which is a good thing. Watching it is an experience in itself even if you're only thinking about the fact that you're finally enjoying a piece of history and culture that spread across the globe like wildfire. You may think I sound like a crazy mega-weeb talking about it like that, but who in the world doesn't know Goku?\\n",

The evidence is in the dialogue being that it's a lot more true to the manga and Japanese translations.

To me the voices of those characters really matched up well in DBZ. But im really just ranting, For pros, i can say the animation is significantly better and more detailed. If you didn't watch the original DBZ then you will probably be able to enjoy this re-make. But for allof us who enjoyed the original i don't recommend watching this anime.",

Seriously they scream like crazy so on mute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are cool but no development and theyre all good guys who just want to kill the bad guy.

            "content": "Dragon Ball Z, I guess, is one of those animes you really need to have the patience for. Even though it was the first anime I ever saw and got me hooked on other stuff, it was unbearably long and the fights dragged on for dozens of episodes at a time. After browsing through some of Funimation's works however, I came across what was basically 'DBZ without the filler'. So naturally, I gave Kai a shot. And I tell you, it actually does give a new outlook on the DBZ story. \r\nGranted, the fights can and do drag on still for some time, but theamount of filler that's reduced the first six seasons to only 98 episodes is astounding! By episode 13, Goku and Vegeta have already begun their first battle, while in the original dub, that didn't commence until episode 30! For someone who's also read the DBZ manga, Kai is practically a live-saver with its fast-pacing and dialogue that's closer to the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast Funimation provides for Kai is, like most of their projects, top-notch. With more then 100 voice actors at their disposal unlike the late 80s and 90s, the voice actors have much more experience not just with voice acting alone, but with these characters, and it practically feels like a whole new experience. (Especially now that there aren't ten characters all voiced by Chris Sabat.)\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the show wasn't what I had expected, I had figured that the show would be done from scratch like other anime reboots. Unfortunately, the only thing really noticeable about Kai's art from the original's is that the colors have been heightened and sharpened. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, for those willing to give Kai a chance, make sure you find it uncut. I see too many people turn Kai away purely for the fact that they viewed the Nicktoons edit which removes the blood and most of the action. Go out and buy Part 1, experience Kai in uncut-glory! In my opinion, it's defiantly worth it!",

            "content": "The dragonball series (Despite Dragonball GT) has always had an outstanding story, even if it didn't make since sometimes. The story is told in Sagas; the saiyan saga, the namek saga, captain ginyu saga, freezia saga, garlic jr. saga, trunks saga, android saga, imperfect cell saga, perfect cell saga, cell games saga, great saiyanman saga, world tournament saga, babdi saga, majin buu saga, fusion saga, and kid buu saga. These sagas are within what are called arcs; saiyan arc, freezia arc, cell arc, and buu arc. However, this is just a knock-off of the original in my point of view, since it takes away thefiller which made it longer and more satisfying (at least to me). Yet, I cannot bring myself to give the story a bad score since it is the dragonball Z that I've known and love, so it has to be given a ten.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the dragonball series was also special. Over hundreds of characters with such detail to boot, no one character is the exact same. The different environment and animals is also great art that the series has going for it. The wind moves the characters clothing and picks up dirt, such detail! If not a ten I don't know what is! The shear number of characters also earns a ten for character. Although, if I were to rate character development, it would be around a eight or seven since the development is only for few main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is given a great score because although it is awesome and it feels like that your hearing what it would sound like, it could be given a few improvements. Then again, sound is only one thing that makes up an anime and in my opinion that's not even a big part of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment anyone will have by finishing and re-watching this series is outstanding to say the least! I will give it an ten!\\n\\n\r\nOverall this particular version of the series earns a 6, since it doesn't last as long as the original by taking away filler. However, for fans of the series I have to say that if you want to watch dragonball z without the filler you have to watch this!",

The animation is better, it's closer to the manga, and the story and fight scenes run at a better pace. \r\nI love the original DBZ, but in order for it to appeal to kids today, I think they had to make Kai. It doesn't rob from DBZ in any unfortunate way. There are a few things I miss (like the driving episode between Piccolo and Goku) but those are only trifles. \r\nI hope they continue to make more for seasons 7-9, since those are my favorite, I would like to see them reconstructedwith cleaner animation and a little less lag in the fighting sequences and the story. Plus the kids who only have access to Kai aren't getting the full story!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I don't got nuthin' against Kai.",

            "content": "Next Time On Dragon ball Z...Oops I mean Kai.\r\nMany like me who have seen the original and yet have seen this and thought well Kai is obviously the same isn't it?\r\nWell Yeah thats because it is But there are differences here and there to mention but it isn't as major as a lot of people like to assume so I will be making some comparisons here that you'll expect to see in this review since this is based on my analysis of this show from watching it twice alongside Dragon ball Z.\r\nStory - 9\r\nThe story is sped up much more better compared to the originalfor obvious reasons of course, It sticks to major characters along with the main plot, less over the top screaming (Though there is that occasionally at times) and less deviating to different locations with little going on in them. better direction of how the pacing is handled within the story to how it is in the manga though I would argue that some certain moments in this version like the original happened quite differently in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe short prologue to the beginning of what happened to Goku's father Bardock was a nice touch compared to how the original started off. It sets the story very nicely by showing bardock's assault on frieza's army and also the major difference was a removal of the fillers from the original which I like a lot about this.\\n\\n\r\nNow for me I enjoyed some of the fillers from the original anime such as Gohan surviving out in the wilderness as part of his training or Goku and Piccolo amusing test driving episode or even seeing some of the characters trying to find the dragon balls or just randomly seeing some of the supporting characters in their own segments like Tien, Krillin, Yamcha, Chichi etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe fillers were also placed in some of the right spots in the story to give some fun easy going highlights towards characters and even progression for example gohan on his adventure out in the wilderness by piccolo to adapt to his surroundings and to not be afraid had a nice throwback to the original dragonball that in a way keeps it connected.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Some of the Fillers like these are still a joy to watch personally unlike some certain animes that just shoehorn filler episodes to disrupt the flow of their story and action badly \\n\r\n(cough cough Bleach and Naruto)\\n\\n\r\nThe Filler from the original offered a nice casual distraction away from the main plot but also kept up in the right places as well as still offering the action, drama and humour to the show as a whole, I mean sure the negative to that is filler episode could tend to drag but they were also placed in convenient places that to me made sense and I wish a lot of shonen animes would do this. (I could go, But moving on)\\n\\n\r\nBut to note I also know from the original anime you have fillers that are just too slow and time wasting, For the love of god I totally did not like the whole fake Planet Namek filler and Goku when he fell off snake way when he met those 2 annoying Orges, including the fillers that stretch the length of certain episodes or just random added silly moments which I also wasn't a fan of.\\n\\n\r\nNow with Kai most of these fillers are pretty much gone which really helps viewers to stick with the main plot which in term keeps it more direct and maintains that balance of content and at least help it to not completely drag on for very long which is a major improvement.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 6\\n\r\nHonestly I am however disappointed with Toei animation. \\n\r\nA series that finished a long time ago, that was beloved by loads of fans all round the world gets this reboot in 2009 and did they improve on art and animation? honestly.. Not that much at all. \\n\\n\r\nThis very much annoys me to say this but Dbz kai in terms of its animation capturing the same dated 4:3 ratio like the original did with certain colour correction and contrast but with the very same style of animation which in today standards of art and animation is undeniably lazy from Toei Animation standards considering this reboot came out in 2009!! Just unacceptable. \\n\\n\r\nI have no problem with the art/animation with the original series since it came out in the late 80s/Early 90s, but Come On Now!.. this is practically the same with little certain things that they kinda enhanced which look like anybody could do on PowerPoint! \\n\\n\r\nWhat seems very good from the very opening of truly great animation that would of suited the series as whole for it in this era of animation only comes to slap people in the face when they see this and say where is the improvement on the animation?? (No way only in the opening!?....Really? Surely they had a lot more time right?)\\n\\n\r\nThe original recycled animation has been limited but still not showing enough of that change that should of been implemented with better quality in the first place and some of the uncut blood and violence is replace by bruises which looks silly and yes even though the manga isn't too violent it still looses some of its believability at times when something violent occurs\\n\r\nwhich does make me sympathies with those that did not warm up towards this series but again another thing is at least its not bad compared with the original in terms of missing features to the characters and what not.\\n\\n\r\nAs a really good example look at original JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders reboot. It got an updated look of the animation as well as other features in their new series to bring its source material of the manga to life so why not Dragon ball kai??\\n\\n\r\nI get that the studio works on other different shows in Japan now and then but Is it really that much of a chore for them to do so for their most profitable franchise besides just animating the opening? They might as well just get Madhouse to work on it like they did for Hunter X Hunter 2011 if they aren't really up to the task.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 6\\n\r\nRight Okay..I honestly feel pretty mixed about this one.\\n\r\nWhile Kenji Yamamoto was originally the music composer behind The music of this series but had to be replace because of some corporate music scandal he had done.\\n\\n\r\nbefore this show was release on DVD/bluray to the public they had the music to be replace with the former composer from the original series in 2009 which yet again is a problem, like the animation the music score sounds too dated like I'm watching an old detective show that sounds like 1966 The Green Hornet, The Hell!? seriously its Dragon ball Z!!!\\n\\n\r\nSo Understand that the mixes of genres of this show falls under Battle Shounen, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Martial Arts, \\n\r\nSci Fi, Super Power which adds a lot of variety for this show so It should feel and sound like it has its own uniqueness here especially to other music soundtracks nowadays but it unfortunately doesn't since this anime has more of an out of date feel to it now which does not make me feel invested towards the episodes as much at times.\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE the music composer Kikuchi Shunsuke from the original series I've nothing against him, but his soundtracks for a reboot version/ Remastering of this series up to this point just doesn't really make me feel excited or engage to whats happening on scene especially since certain Iconic soundtracks are not present there like the original show and with this issue I feel, It just doesn't really resonate with me when something is taking place. \\n\\n\r\nOf course I am aware that Kai added a few new music scores in place of the show and they sound good but are only once during different characters moments which makes it pretty pointless honestly.\\n\r\nIt was more better in the original because it was more authentic and done so well for particularly in that time period of anime back then.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Opening Is okay, not really topping the original in anyway since the original Opening sounded so Iconic and with this opening I just felt it was played too much that but could've added more instead of hearing the same opening song throughout 97 episodes and again In no way competes with the opening of Dragon ball Z CHA-LA HEAD-CHA-LA since its so Iconic from the previous installment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting - 9\\n\r\nThe dub and sub on the other hand are probably the highlight of Kai itself especially the dub as it is well handled by funimation. \\n\r\nIt adds a lot more verbal curses than the original from previous works of there own, Good thing about this show its that it sticks closer to the Japanese dialogue of its source material.\\n\\n\r\nFor me the stand out performance from the dub easily was Chris Ayres as Frieza, Sean Schemmel as Goku, Dameon Clarke as Cell and Chris Sabat as Vegeta and Piccolo. I was also very happy that I heard other different voices for a change too, Though I do however miss Kyle Hebert as the narrator for his charismatic energy for the intro but doc Morgan does do a good job also. \\n\\n\r\nOther voices like Colleen Clinkenbeard as Gohan in english is sort of okay but not that good, It can sometimes sound a little jarring and irritating at times especially when she forces her vocals too hard along with the screaming and I preferred her less as gohan as the show went on and I'm not a fan of when she has to voice Kid Goku since its basically the same as another character that she voices such as Luffy and to me it just does not fit for kid goku or gohan since all I'm hearing from her is her performance as luffy.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention she voices 18 who doesn't even sound like she's related to 17 as his twin sister who I felt the original sounded more close to it even in the Japanese, though her little kid version of gohan isn't too bad. There was also a few annoying script changes as well in certain scenes too. But overall a great dub.\\n\\n\r\nNow also, to be fair In comparison to Nozawa's performance as Goku and Gohan I do think it would be unfair to compare voice performance here as some of the Japanese voice actors i feel don't always sound as right in their roles regardless if Akira had a hand in picking certain individuals, but that isn't my place to say because I do at times like their performance.\\n\\n\r\n(P.s I'm Not trying to start a Dub Vs Sub debate here folks)\\n\\n\r\nAlso I like to mention the opening and closings is quite upbeat and laughably offer the best animation of the show by leaps and bounds.\\n\\n\r\nbut yet again, only having 1 opening can be repetitive for 97 episodes, honestly it would of been nice if they had done a few more openings each with a different song but Alas! Its only a minor nitpick. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters - 8\\n\r\nAs Similar to the original, Cool heroes, Wicked villains, Memorable action, Plot as well as a great build up that follows through different stages of the narrative just like the manga counterpart now that the dialogue in this series expresses the show more better. Its demonstrates pretty much the same cast of colourful characters that still represents themselves in their colourful own way the more you watch you start to feel some sort of connection to one of these characters that define a lot of fun traits within the shonen genre and it's easy to see why.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have their own drive about them that strive to be the best of themselves despite their flaws which will resonate sharply with the viewer but it also gives interesting context to prior events that happens within each Arc which becomes clearer even through my 2nd rewatch.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI have to admit the first half I really enjoyed a lot but I felt by the second half it felt like it got a little bit tedious going into Cell's Arc even towards the final third of the show, it weirdly enough ends at Trunks going back to his own timeline to end the chaos without finishing off the rest of the series but It was pretty much a simple yet a decent conclusion until Dragon ball Kai 2014 pretty much wraps up the original series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict - 8\\n\r\nNow there could of been a much more improved version of this no doubt about that, but I feel Dbz kai did a decent job on its reboot to the original despite falling short in places where its production was very lazy which earns this series this rating \\n\\n\r\nIts still a great series for anyone who want an introduction to watching battle shounen anime or just want to check out what the original series of Dragon Ball Z is.\\n\\n\r\nIt sticks close at hand to its source material even if you don't want to fully watch the original at least this is a more condense way to get through with ease and not too long to feel drawn out. Sorry if my review came off being serious but that is how I properly critic and say what I say with honesty.\\n\\n\r\nAlso PLEASE watch Dragon ball if you can, Its basically The prequel of Both Dragon ball Kai & Z since that doesn't get as much love as the sequel does in general. Or if it's not your thing than the Manga would likely be a better option. Until then Thanks for reading. ; )\\n",

            "content": "I am writing this review with mostly one intent in mind: to get across the point of how much is being cut. I know that we were all excited to have the story condensed, but I think that this has gone a bit further than anyone expected. That does not make me upset, as we can all go back and watch the original againl if the original is what we want, but I think that it should be addressed fairly openly. I will also address art, since that is the other big change.\r\nI hope no one minds the spoilers, as I am assuming that mostpeople have seen Dragon Ball Z that are watching this series, and anyone who is not cannot be spoiled very much about what is not there.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nFirst of all, some extraordinarily gratuitous events that needed to be cut, such as Krillin gathering up the gang again to train, have been left out and improved the series. Some cuts, however, have changed the story in an irrevocable manner. None of these are exactly necessary to the plot's core, which is fighting anyway, but they are all central to the development of the story and how the characters call out to us.\\n\\n\r\n- Vegeta and Nappa's apparent saving of and then ruthless destruction of Arlia is left out entirely.\\n\r\n- Goku being captured by and tormented by Princess Snake is entirely left out (a hilarious episode before, I think).\\n\r\n- Goku battling the red and blue demons and taking their fruit, gaining massive strength, are completely left out, so Goku has no apparent power jump just from reaching Kai's planet, changing how important Kai is to him.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, none of these episodes being cut is necessarily awful nor great, but they all matter to how we felt about the characters and the story in the original, I think.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, I think that what we have seen from the Nappa versus everyone fighting so far shows us that the fighting will feel enjoyable, and probably not be condensed quite as much (although I could be wrong). The pacing of that felt really proper to me, so I think we can really look forward to future fights being fleshed out better than in the original.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIn talking about the art, there is not that much that needs to be pointed out, but there are definitely a few big problems. I think that they have done a great job of making it into a widescreen series from what was not widescreen. There are three big types of errors that I have noticed, sadly.\\n\\n\r\n1) There are moment's like Nappa after he stopped flying above Piccolo in episode 10 (19:53 for me) where he looks incredibly blurred for a few seconds. This is not a one time occurrence, and it is really ugly when it happens. Sometimes this is due to original art, but this instance did not seem to be there in the original DVD to me (maybe the bold lines sometimes make it happen). Sometimes blurriness from the old version is cut out though, so this is not always badly done!\\n\r\n2) They somehow really ramped up the brightness for this show, but occasionally something comes out darker than it should be and jars the senses when it switches back to brightness.\\n\r\n3) The bold border lines of each character gets really thick then bulges to being thinner rather at random. This is the one that actually constantly bothers me and merited a 6 for an art rating. I almost hesitate to point this out because it seems to be one of those trends one cannot unnotice after noticing.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the devotion built up for the characters (or dislike of characters like Chi Chi) is still rather consistent with the original, and many of us watched Dragon Ball or the original Dragon Ball Z and already have our feelings set about each character anyway. Whatever may be, this is a good effort, and will make it at least slightly easier to share this show with casual fans, which is a major win for the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone wants a final ruling or something, then I guess that my feeling is this: I would honestly prefer the original by a bit to this point because the original plot never particularly loses steam until the Ginyu Force saga is wrapping up. I am very excited to have Goku versus Freiza and beyond condensed, as there was so much unnecessary (Trunks powering up for a full episode, as good of a joke as it may have provided). I also think that the original art (or previous digitally remastered, less bright, less bold version) is fun in its own right, and probably actually more fun than this to look at when one considers it enough.\\n\\n\r\nIf I got anything drastically wrong, then please let me know and I will attempt to deal with it.",

No more eternal power charging, no more eternal \"he is so strong\" internal monologues a no more feeling that nothing really happened in the last 10chapters. Yeah there are some fun filler missing, like when goku and picolo go to the driving school, but in the end what is gained with the exclusion of the filler is far more than what is lost.\\n\r\nI've read here that the story got cut out, that's not true, they just cut out all the filler that made the original Dragonball anime a pain to whatch for the poeple that have read the original manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10.\\n\r\nThe art in dragonball has allways been decent considering the times when it was released. But just as the new opening makes you believe at first, this could have been a real remake but the only thing we get here are the exact same animation but on a higher resolution, that's all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10.\\n\r\nThe audio has been remade and sounds great.

            "content": "I should have trusted my instincts when I decided to give Dragonball Kai a watch. It does sound quite intriguing to watch Dragonball Z again, only this time minus the filler episodes that really didn't add much or anything to the storyline; but with one change though, must come many, because for some reason writers always must omit something else that can feel almost equally important as the thing they wanted changed originally. I guess this is just one of those cases where you simply can't satisfy everyone, because DB Kai left me with a very bitter taste, and I actually prefer the original seriesby Funimation than this.\\n\\n\r\nThe story to DB Kai is no different from the original series. The Earth is paid a visit by a being named Raditz whom claims to be Goku's brother; Raditz reveals to him that he's not even of Earth, instead he comes from a different race called the Saiyians whom lived on Planet Vegeta. They eventually battle, and Goku as well as his allies learn that Raditz isn't the only one out there from that race, nor is he even close to the strongest. They then prepare themselves to battle against the last two warriors of the Saiyan race.\\n\\n\r\nI will mention now that the removal of various filler such as Snake Way, Garlic Jr., and various other things was definitely a plus. The show moves quite better without the constant distractions; but the truth is, even without the filler, DB Kai can still be a chore at times with situations dragging along for too much time, and the outcome simply not being a good enough pay off for some of the waiting. In any case, the overall story is fun, and DB Kai works its way up to the final battle against Cell. \\n\\n\r\nDB Kai manages to keep the action well paced enough, and character personalities are fleshed out. However, things could have been so much better had the only change to the show been the various filler. One thing DBZ did well was its voice acting for the English dub and character interactions. Some serious fans will catch the removal of some dialog and it may bother them, it sure as hell bothered me because Vegeta especially had some good lines, like his threat to beat on Yamcha for practically no reason. The changing of voice actors got on my nerves as well; Colleen Clinkenbeard  is annoying as hell as Gohan, and had I never seen this before I would have been wishing for his brutal death at the hands of Frieza. Now speaking of Frieza, they have Chris Ayres playing him. I hate everyone Ayres, Chris and Greg Ayres have a very annoying, whining, saccharine feel that gets on my nerves quick. Colleen Clinkenbeard also voices Android 18, and she just feels all types of wrong here. Meredith McCoy is by far the best to play her; she brought a sinister yet sexy appeal to 18 that carried over to her facial expressions and even fighting. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing DBZ always did amazingly well was introduce intense music scores. Funimation's BGM is probably this anime's best quality and they know it, yet for some reason they use boring elevator music, with no variation or anything new through out the entire duration of the show. Vegeta and Piccolo's addictive themes that described their characters so well? Gone. The terrifying BGM of death when Frieza goes off to kill Vegeta while King Kai narrates this is the evil Prince's last stand? Jettisoned... for some irritating trash that doesn't enhance the scene at all. I can list plenty more examples, but this proves to me that not everyone understands the effect music can have during some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and artwork appears to be remastered, but the only thing actually new is the opening. I don't have much of a problem with this, still this could have been better updated. At least DB Kai delivers the action well enough and there's plenty going on that can turn a new comer into a fan. There's loads of fisticuffs and brutal beatings to go around.\\n\\n\r\nAs I look around there are plenty of people that really enjoyed Kai more than DBZ. I can honestly say that I understand that because it does trim a lot of the fat and focuses more on character and story development, along with action which is the main selling point. Unfortunately for me, I look for other things in my anime and music means a lot to me; a great soundtrack can actually mask flaws in a work, and DBZ was full of them yet the BGM smoothed things out making it more tolerable. In addition, there are things that seems changed for the sake of it. None of the voice actors from the original died while this was in production, so I see no reason for the change in cast, nor the removal of some lines. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my dislike for this remake, if that's what it is, I still recommend it to fans so they can see it for themselves; but I highly advise to be prepared for these various changes. I already know plenty of individuals who had the same issues with this as I did.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHighs: Some of the removal of filler does work, enjoyable action\\n\\n\r\nLows: Altering of cast and BGM is a huge blow for me\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nI mentioned in my review of DBZ that the series had some serious flaws and wasn't a perfect adaptation of Toriyama's original manga. Today I look at Dragon Ball Kai, which actually tries to be much closer to the source material. Does it do well or did DBZ classic do it better? Let's analyze further.\r\nStory and Characters: 8/10\r\nI already reviewed the story of DBZ, so this will largely focus on the differences between Kai and the original DBZ. A massive improvement is the removal of the obnoxious filler that bogged down DBZ. How much filler was in DBZ? An illustrative example would be that 7of the first 16 episodes were entirely filler and not part of the official canon.  In Kai it no longer takes 20 episodes for a planet to explode in supposedly 5 minutes. There are no episodes where characters power up pointlessly for nearly the entire episode. The use of recycled animation simply to take up time is also mercifully decreased. Kai cut out the fat while leaving in all the action, character development, and everything that made the story great in the first place! Other than that, no substantial changes were made to story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the entire series didn't look like the opening theme animation like many fans hoped it would. The art is slightly improved from DBZ in terms of definition and quality, but the animation is still that classic, cheap and sloppy animation that we saw in the early 1990s. The art obviously looks much worse relative to other popular series in the 2010s than it did in the early 1990s when it was being compared against Yu Yu Hakusho and Sailor Moon. One major complaint from some fans was Kai's removal of much of the grit and gore from the original series. Although I also feel it is missing in some scenes, the original manga was NOT a bloodbath and this was in fact more faithful to the original.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe original OST from DBZ (Japanese version anyways) was great and didn't really need much improvement. Having said that, Kai added some nice tracks of its own and did a good job in the music department.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDragonall Kai is indeed more faithful to Toriyama's manga and is in my opinion an improvement. Why it is rated an 8.0 on MAL compared to DBZ's 8.3 is honestly a bit confusing to me. Maybe hours of filler is acceptable as long as a tiny bit more blood is added? I have no idea what our voters were thinking. Obviously this new generation of kids didn't embrace Dragonball to the degree that my generation did, but I don't blame Kai for that. Anime is no longer an oddity and something that kids will watch just because it looks different. Very little anime is currently on American TV and young anime fans watch entirely online, which wasn't an option when I was growing up. If the internet existed in 1998 with the speed to stream videos rather than take 15 minutes of loud dial up sounds just to get on the internet, my 10 year old self probably would have watched something darker and more violent to make myself feel like a badass. I watched DBZ and enjoyed it at least partially because it was the best thing available at that timeslot for a 10 year old boy. Everyone got out of school and rushed home to watch DBZ, because honestly there was nothing better on. I didn't have the option of watching Black Lagoon on my laptop. If I did, than I likely would have made the same choice that the 10 year old punks of 2014 are making.",

This review comes from someone who watched a lot of the Cell and Buu Saga EPs as a kid.\r\nThe only complaint people have that I have talk to is that \"oh no they took out the Rock music that FUNimation put in the original, which I could care less about because they kept the Japanese music this time which never would piss me off.\r\nThe story follows manga much better than the original with less AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, but with more fighting and no filler episodes. Now you canwatch the story quicker than you did before, 194EPs to 98EPs.\\n\\n\r\n It was very enjoyable and characters are as great as they were in the original. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I could give to the Kai haters is the lack of new animation (there are some redone scenes for a variety of reasons, but not the whole show), but I like that because the animation reminds me of the older anime like Yu Yu Hakusho, Original Series of Pokemon, and early One Piece and Case Closed/Detective Conan.\\n\\n\r\n Voice acting is better, but that's only an opinion on both sides.",

            "content": "*NO SPOILERS*\r\nRecently, i came across an internet post of someone saying Dragon Ball Z may be the greatest anime of all time. I replied with something validating and someone responded with, \"There's a hell of a lot of anime better than Dragon Ball, dude.\" This really got me thinking, Dragon Ball isn't even my favorite series, so why did i think that statement could be valid? \r\nWell, It's about objectivity. I've always thought there was something to be said about media that's easy to digest, stuff with relatively simple plots and a good mix of action and nonaction (example:\"The Princess Bride\"), I think Dragon Balleasily fits within this category. You'd know it for it's fights and it's yelling, but those fights wouldn't be nearly as iconic without all of the emotion behind them, without each character having their own reason to fight,  without the enemies willing to play by a set of rules - leaving the stakes high but the mood not too dark; Dragon Ball is about a hell of a lot more than fighting.\\n\\n\r\n  I honestly believe that anyone could enjoy it on some level if they just gave it a tiny chance. It may not be your favorite anime, It's not even mine, But how many people will enjoy your Loli Romance Magic robot fighting anime? How many people will enjoy your absurdist existential novel written from the perspective of god? Maybe a lot, if they really wanted to give it a chance, but maybe not, probably not. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it doesn't fit into a specific niche, it just \"is Dragon Ball\", which is a good thing. Watching it is an experience in itself even if you're only thinking about the fact that you're finally enjoying a piece of history and culture that spread across the globe like wildfire. You may think I sound like a crazy mega-weeb talking about it like that, but who in the world doesn't know Goku?\\n",

The evidence is in the dialogue being that it's a lot more true to the manga and Japanese translations.

To me the voices of those characters really matched up well in DBZ. But im really just ranting, For pros, i can say the animation is significantly better and more detailed. If you didn't watch the original DBZ then you will probably be able to enjoy this re-make. But for allof us who enjoyed the original i don't recommend watching this anime.",

Big aliens from his past keep coming along to put him in his place, but he gets new powers just like Itchygo did. If you have narcolepsy dont watch this showbecause theres so many lights you never stop shaking. \\n\\n\r\nArt in show isnt very good and colors are really weird like they feel all floral which makes me think theres gay agenda in this show. They always fight men and become shirtless and theres no women characters at all really who get naked. \\n\\n\r\nSound is better off muted because it could cure a deaf person with no ears. Seriously they scream like crazy so on mute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are cool but no development and theyre all good guys who just want to kill the bad guy. Sometimes you feel they might be kind of gay for each other and one guy's name starts with a V and ends in an A and I can't say it here. I was like, really!?\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is crazy but its really fun to watch even though its pretty dumb and sometimes seems gay.

Even though it was the first anime I ever saw and got me hooked on other stuff, it was unbearably long and the fights dragged on for dozens of episodes at a time. After browsing through some of Funimation's works however, I came across what was basically 'DBZ without the filler'. So naturally, I gave Kai a shot. And I tell you, it actually does give a new outlook on the DBZ story. \r\nGranted, the fights can and do drag on still for some time, but theamount of filler that's reduced the first six seasons to only 98 episodes is astounding! By episode 13, Goku and Vegeta have already begun their first battle, while in the original dub, that didn't commence until episode 30! For someone who's also read the DBZ manga, Kai is practically a live-saver with its fast-pacing and dialogue that's closer to the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast Funimation provides for Kai is, like most of their projects, top-notch. With more then 100 voice actors at their disposal unlike the late 80s and 90s, the voice actors have much more experience not just with voice acting alone, but with these characters, and it practically feels like a whole new experience. (Especially now that there aren't ten characters all voiced by Chris Sabat.)\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the show wasn't what I had expected, I had figured that the show would be done from scratch like other anime reboots. Unfortunately, the only thing really noticeable about Kai's art from the original's is that the colors have been heightened and sharpened. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, for those willing to give Kai a chance, make sure you find it uncut. I see too many people turn Kai away purely for the fact that they viewed the Nicktoons edit which removes the blood and most of the action. Go out and buy Part 1, experience Kai in uncut-glory! In my opinion, it's defiantly worth it!",

The story is told in Sagas; the saiyan saga, the namek saga, captain ginyu saga, freezia saga, garlic jr. saga, trunks saga, android saga, imperfect cell saga, perfect cell saga, cell games saga, great saiyanman saga, world tournament saga, babdi saga, majin buu saga, fusion saga, and kid buu saga. These sagas are within what are called arcs; saiyan arc, freezia arc, cell arc, and buu arc. However, this is just a knock-off of the original in my point of view, since it takes away thefiller which made it longer and more satisfying (at least to me). Yet, I cannot bring myself to give the story a bad score since it is the dragonball Z that I've known and love, so it has to be given a ten.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the dragonball series was also special. Over hundreds of characters with such detail to boot, no one character is the exact same. The different environment and animals is also great art that the series has going for it. The wind moves the characters clothing and picks up dirt, such detail! If not a ten I don't know what is! The shear number of characters also earns a ten for character. Although, if I were to rate character development, it would be around a eight or seven since the development is only for few main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is given a great score because although it is awesome and it feels like that your hearing what it would sound like, it could be given a few improvements. Then again, sound is only one thing that makes up an anime and in my opinion that's not even a big part of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment anyone will have by finishing and re-watching this series is outstanding to say the least! I will give it an ten!\\n\\n\r\nOverall this particular version of the series earns a 6, since it doesn't last as long as the original by taking away filler. However, for fans of the series I have to say that if you want to watch dragonball z without the filler you have to watch this!",

The animation is better, it's closer to the manga, and the story and fight scenes run at a better pace. \r\nI love the original DBZ, but in order for it to appeal to kids today, I think they had to make Kai. It doesn't rob from DBZ in any unfortunate way. There are a few things I miss (like the driving episode between Piccolo and Goku) but those are only trifles. \r\nI hope they continue to make more for seasons 7-9, since those are my favorite, I would like to see them reconstructedwith cleaner animation and a little less lag in the fighting sequences and the story. Plus the kids who only have access to Kai aren't getting the full story!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I don't got nuthin' against Kai.",

There is absolutely no reason as to why this show's mean score on the website is lower than the original DBZ...sigh*\r\nAnyways...the review (DB Kai 2014 is also factored in this review)\r\nStory: 7\r\nFundamentally, it's the exact same story as Z except that all that padding and filler dragging the story down is gone, and that massively improves the story's narrative and also has a better flow to it. The pacing issues I had with the Freeza arc and the Artificial Humans arc has been severely diminished. Most of the other issues are still present in their respective arc, the last2 arcs respectively.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Action: 8\\n\r\nVisually, it's much more appealing, but because this is Toei, there are animation issues. The scenes in Z where there was awkward animation are also present in this except they're much more noticeable due to the cleaner visuals. In short: it looks better, but the animations issues haven't changed at all.\\n\\n\r\nActions sequences look much better with the cleaner visuals and the fights themselves are still amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nOST completely dumps on anything Z had to offer; not to say Z had a bad OST, not at all, in fact, the OST in Z is really good. It's just that the OST in Kai is so much better.\\n\r\nAlso, the English dub of this show is absolutely fantastic; I can safely say that it doesn't matter which dub of the show you watch, b/c it's fantastic either way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nSame issues as Z except there's less character development due to the filler being cut out completely.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI've personally enjoyed this more than Z. The show didn't feel like it was dragging on it's feet and the fight scenes look much better as well as a superior narrative.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nObjectively, this is the definitive version of Z, but all the people that talk about nothing but the canon of the series do not like this version...why?\\n\\n\r\nThis video perfectly explains the fandom better than I can: \\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuPPbNmZPxk",

            "content": "[This review is for the Japanese version of Dragon Ball Kai.]\r\nDISCLAIMER: This is a review from the perspective of a \"first time watcher\" of the show. I read the manga when I was extremely young and, while watching the show, had very little memory of it save for the first two arcs. In short, I don't feel nostalgic about this show in the slightest.\r\n[Story \u2013 6/10]: The storytelling of the show lacks some of the depth that I've come to expect from other series that I've watched. A villain that's stronger than the previous villain shows up, both the good guys and the villain powerup several times, good guy eventually beats the villain, rinse and repeat. It's still enjoyable to a degree but leaves very little room for further analyzation. Everything is, more or less, exactly how it appears on the screen.\\n\\n\r\n[Art \u2013 10/10]: Toriyama's character designs, as well as the style of animation, are something I enjoyed a lot. Everyone had a unique and interesting look about them. The older style of animation is also a breath of fresh air from modern animation which looks almost a little too artificial to me sometimes.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound \u2013 3/10]: Sadly, this show suffers from Kenji Yamamoto and his plagiarism scandal. Not to mention that really none of the plagiarised soundtracks even stuck out to me that much in the first place.\\n\\n\r\n[Character \u2013 7/10]: While not every character gets the same amount of care and attention, everyone is still interesting in their own way and I never found myself getting bored of the main cast. My only criticism is that the villains of the show are all essentially the same: powerful and evil. I've come to expect more depth from villains based on previous experiences and was sad to find it relatively lacking in this show.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment \u2013 8/10]: I binged half the show over the course of a few days and found myself often speculating on what was going to happen next. The show, despite its flaws with storytelling, is still a very enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall \u2013 7/10]: In conclusion, the flaws and strengths of this show balance each other out to create a decent, enjoyable viewing experience, even if much of the hype behind the show is propelled purely by the nostalgia of older viewers that grew up watching this.",

            "content": "Here's my review exclusively of the very first Vegeta Saga section of Dragon Ball Kai:\r\nI mostly put this on as background noise while I did other things throughout the day, because hey, it's Dragon Ball Z, the good kind of silly trashy shounen entertainment, but in condensed form so I can get through the story way faster. The nostalgia was admittedly very strong here and it was nearly overpowering.\r\nHowever, it seems that Dragon Ball Kai, at least in the first story, fails at its mission to tell a more fun, more speedy version of the original anime. Fails pretty badly, in fact. The entire philosophyhere seems to be to cut out... just the exact stuff that doesn't move the plot forward, except for the major exception of fight scenes. This is a major problem for a couple reasons:\\n\\n\r\n1) We lose tons of character moments! The Z Warriors, our buds whose tragic and sometimes silly deaths are supposed to be very dramatic, don't work very well when we glossed completely over all of their training and don't get a clear sense of how powerful any of them actually are. A lot of the sillier, quieter moments that make the series as fun as it is are lost, because I guess they were scenes original to the anime. Sure, it's \"filler\", but when it's legitimately important to the characters, it's not exactly useless.\\n\r\nWorst of all, we lose that really fun episode where Nappa and Vegeta go to the bug planet and kill a bunch of aliens. That one was really good!\\n\\n\r\n2) They didn't cut down the main fight at all! The original anime had 25-30 episodes on the Vegeta Saga, and one of the main complaints against it is that the actual fight between the Z Warriors and Vegeta/Nappa is WAY too long. Well that doesn't change here. It takes SEVENTEEN EPISODES to get to the end of the battle, and around ten of them alone are just the one fight. A faster battle would have been way more tense, but for some reason they kept it in with few to no edits that I could notice, other than cutting out some of the obvious filler (Nappa fighting the Navy, for example).\\n\\n\r\nI can't imagine the rest of the series is going to be much different than this, so I'm very disappointed in how Dragon Ball Kai turned out, but hey, it's still the same stupid fun Dragon Ball has to offer, just with way more focus on the fighting than on the silliness or the characters. \\n\\n\r\nMy verdict, based solely on this first story arc: Don't watch Kai the first time around! Watch the original series, just... put it on 1.5x speed or something lol",

The characters don't stare at each other and take 1 minute to land a punch and now transformations don't take up 50 episodes! 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Overall rating is 9/10.

In comparison to the original, this version felt dry and lacked the charm Dragon ball Z had. The plot moves quickly and does not have unique episodes that added to character development like goku and piccolo driving a car. The sound felt dated for an anime reboot or remaster with music that does not match the time we are in. The characters are still great and the plot still focuses to the manga adaptation. In theend it lacks special qualities and feels rushed or like a bad essay turned in badly made. Try this version if you do not have the patience for the original, and a rushed job at that.",

            "content": "This is the definitive version of Dragon Ball's anime post the wedding of ChiChi and Son Goku. I would recommend skipping some parts of the first episode as it has spoilers. The anime picks up a couple of years after Dragon Ball volume 16/ Dragon Ball anime episode 153. Goku has a son named after his grandpa Gohan. Goku meets his brother Raditz and learns he is an alien from the Saiyan race. They fight and Goku dies along with his brother. In a year the Saiyans Vegeta and Nappa. After that there is Freeza and Cell sagas. The anime has some filler kept inbut most is gone. I would recommend watching the Saiyan saga filler as it was supervised by Toriyama except the Arcosian  shit. Otherwise watch KAi. THe dub is amazing. Its the definitive English Dub. The problem is that it is reframed for 16:9 on Tv  but is 4:3 on BluRay. so based on how you watch it you will have either more or less of the picture.",

            "content": "As children most of us watched Dragonball Z. Goku and his friends taking on enemies with the power that could destroy an entire planet on accident. Only problem is that Toei, masters of wasting time, knew how to drag out the series and at certain points it felt like Goku would charge an attack for an entire 12 episodes. Now with all the excess time cut out of the series and all non-canon arcs removed you now have Dragon Ball Kai. Although I watched parts of DBZ on tv as a child I remembered minor details of how everything went down. I went into DragonBall Kai to expect a mediocre Shounen, which actually turned out more than pleasant. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story of Dragon Ball Kai starts with a short arc that leads into a huge saga spanning over 50ish episodes. Our protagonist Son Goku must deal with aliens called 'Saiyans' who come to destroy earth, this encounter leads him into an ordeal he least expected as he is pitted against the ruler of the universe.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Toei Animation, for the time the original DBZ aired the art was actually good, but now that we have studios like Madhouse, Shaft, Kyoto etc etc etc. This art is actually very bad for the time it was released. I felt like they could have tried to improve the art like how they did the art for Dragon Ball Super.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Dragon Ball Kai has a nice set of characters to get along with. You have the kind hearted warrior Goku, the timid but strong Gohan, the evil nature of Vegeta, and also the determined Piccolo. They all have great development over the course of the series as their interactions with other characters changes their personality for the better (typically).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I thought the Dragon Ball franchise's* only appeal is the high paced fighting and insane powers, but the way these intense fights are brought into being are done through great plot development. For example in the first Saga, you have Krillin and Gohan on a planet surrounded by many enemies and also under pursuit by somebody far stronger than them. They have a goal of collecting Dragon Balls while remaining completely under the radar. Watching this simple 'scavenger hunt' develop into a battle that determines the fate of the universe was extremely enjoyable. It was refreshing to know that combat wasn't the only thing this series had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: You see the score up top, I gave Dragon Ball Kai a 9/10 in comparison to shows such as Fairy Tail that merely does the same thing every arc (Fight enemy > lose > get back up > rematch > win). Even if majority of its fans are here just because of the combat it doesn't knock down the actual quality of the show. \\n\\n\r\n^.^ \\n\\n",

Great for  short attention span people who like to get around the depth of the story that included many others than just Goku and Gohan and Vegeta.  The orig. did drag on at times and some of the fights like with Freeza on a planet that took so many eps to explode in the alloted 5 min. was stretching things quite a bit. \r\n It has it's good parts and not so good parts. Most stories do. \r\n  But what wasdone to the orig. to make this one went way too far cutting it up and I guess it would be ok for people who never saw the first one. I hated it because of this. In some area's I do concede that they shortened area's that it didn't hurt to shorten but they went about it with reckless abandon cutting the depth out of the series.  Most of the times I watched it I left mad, not happy. This seems to be counter to why anyone would want to watch it.",

Just cutting out filler and using remastered footage is incredibly lazy and should not qualify as a new adaptation. Also, some parts are censored even in the uncut versions that aren't subtle and don't make much sense visually. When Piccolo shoots a Special Beam Cannon into Goku's and Raditz's chest, the hole shown in both the manga and original anime is replaced by something completely different that I can't for the life of me make out what thehell it's supposed to be. When Krillin shot a ki blast through Vegeta, there was no hole to be seen. The soundtrack is repetitive and forgettable, using the same generic track at least once every episode no matter the scene or whether it fits or not. Although they made many stupid changes, they made a major improvement in terms of voice acting and dialogue, especially in the dub. However, the dub can't seem to choose whether it wants to use the Japanese names or use the translations. They keep Japanese names for attacks but still uses the dub names like Krillin as opposed to Kuririn. While it's good for people new to Dragon Ball Z, it fails to set itself apart and compete with the original adaptation and suffers because of it.",

            "content": "Dragon Ball Z is one of my favourite series, it has been since I was a kid. Growing up watching Goku, Gohan and Vegeta fight Cell and Majin Buu is still one of my most prominent memories (because they didn't show anything earlier on morning kids TV lol) and when I finally got around to watching DBZ when I was older, the 291 (I think) episode run which is rampant with pointless filler did make it harder to want to rewatch after the first time (and it took like a month), so I was so happy when I was Dragon Ball Kai. I really enjoyedit too, the fights were just the same and just as good, the redubbing made it closer to the original BUT I will say if you do plan on watching it, watch the uncut version.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 8\\n\r\nIt's DBZ, it's story is always going to be a little weaker compared to some other shows and shounens. Kai is lucky in a sense since it's missing the worst of the sagas, the Buu/Fusion saga and the Android/Cell saga is still, in my opinion, the best. The filler being cut also makes each part run more smoothly, as we're not sent on \"side quests\" throughout an arc and the fights/action happens faster which is always better then dragging it out like the original did.\\n\\n\r\nART - 9\\n\r\nI've always loved the DBZ art style, it's pretty unique and I'm glad they just chose to remaster instead of re-do it. Don't really have any issues with the art.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\r\nThey used the Japanese soundtracks this time which I prefer far more than the original soundtracks in the original Funimation dub (ALso, this is based on the dub, not sub). The original music in DBZ was kind of over the top for me, so this is a nice change. The VAs are at their best in this too and I saw some interviews saying they had more a clue this time round and it really shows. I also prefer the newer cast over the older cast, Gohan's voice to me in the original DBZ was grating and Freeza's new VA is honestly the best Freeza I've heard. The OP (English version) is also my favourite Dragon Ball opening ever too, so bonus points for that. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10\\n\r\nThis is biased honestly because I love DBZ so much to the point that I don't really hate any characters. DBZ is basically the Gohan and Vegeta show with Goku showing up to save the day, and since Vegeta is my favourite character I am perfectly okay with that. The dub always has made a habit of making Goku more of a hero than he is originally and I think that still sticks with Kai, so there's that. Since the filler was cu so were a lot of the annoying filler characters so that makes it more enjoyable in my mind too. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\r\nIt's DBZ, what can I say. I love the show so obviously I enjoyed it. As I mentioned, having the filler cut out made it so much more enjoyable to watch because the action happened so much faster. I've watched Kai countless times now, especially the Android/Cell Saga as it's my favourite and it doesn't take like a week to watch now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10\\n\r\nHonestly, this is an incredibly biased review as I've said. I love DBZ and Kai made it possible to watch the best bits without all the filler in between. It also made it much easier to watch and the 97 episode run is a lot more appealing than 291. If I were to recommend DBZ to anyone, of course I'd tell them to watch the original if they had the time, but Kai tells the main story points and kept the feeling of DBZ to me, so I would always say to watch Kai.",
