To my surprise, what was supposed to be a filler series to pass the time for me ended up being one of the most enjoyable of spring 2010.\r\nThere isnt much of a story really. Takanashi justs goes to work at a family restaurant full of weird and unique co-workers and takes it from there for the rest of the series. However even with the lack of a real story, Working!! makes up for easily with their characters. Even with the lack of plot, ahandful of the characters were well done in the sense that they achieve what this anime was ment to do, to make us laugh. There were quite a bit of running gags, but still has more then enough to keep you watching.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime with very minimal plot, it does a very outstanding job in entertaining its viewers and is definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "Working!! is an example of an anime that\u2019s been done countless times before and will be again.  Admittedly I was expecting this but was attracted to the series cute looking characters and the slice of life pacing.  While the series gets off to a slow start things did manage to improve greatly only to end in the dustbin of history thanks to the douchebaggery of its  narcissistic cast of asshats.\r\nThe premise of Working!! puts us into the inner workings of a family restaurant.  The employees run the gambit of strangeness and mental issues to setup all the outstanding and original comedythat awaits us.  That\u2019s sarcasm by the way.  At the start of the show the restaurant is shorthanded and the search for a new part timer to help out ends with our typical over burdened high schooler, this time named Souta Takanashi.  Apparently the financial distress of Japanese families is quite high and even though he lives in a modest house with three working age sisters and an alleged mother (I am assuming she existed, they said she did kind of like my Papa told me Santa Claus lived in the North Pole when I was five...) that they must put their high school younger brother to work to make ends meet.  It\u2019s such a romantic setting that can only occur in Asia apparently.  The bastion of child labor and exploitation... oh wait I was talking about our lovely heartfelt slave err labor anime!\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning the show is decidedly unimpressive.  The cast comes off completely stereotypical and clich\u00e9d from the start.  Every character type is represented there has ever been there, in all their glory.  Now this isn\u2019t exactly new ground here, we see this in practically everything and at this point there basically are no original characters anymore.  But these characters for the most part come off as bland copies, devoid of personality and psychotic misfits I would sooner see hauled off by a van with padded walls driven by guys in lab coats.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this starts to change and by mid series things start to actually get pretty fun and amusing.  Characters which are annoying take a back seat and others which initially were the worst actually develop into pretty solid and interesting personalities.  I found it unusual that I could have such a completely different opinion of certain characters in such few episodes from the beginning to the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThings really fall apart though in the last episode.  I was well on my way to having an average to above average experience with this anime until once again the characters that made watching this show such a pain in the beginning, bring it down into the sewer.  I always find it strange how people who claim to all be \"friends\" in some of these shows can do the things they do to each other, even in fun and for their own selfish amusement.  There are some lines that just can\u2019t be crossed however and over the years I have found I have grown tired of humiliation and deviant behavior being used for laughs.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is ripe with love and hate characters.  On the positive side is our lead, Takanashi.  At first I found him to be an initial source of annoyance as he looked to be your typical lolicon.  Thankfully this wasn\u2019t the case and he manages to develop into a pretty nice leading man and one whom the viewer can relate and root for.  He is a bit strange in his own right, which is love of cute things but this is mostly harmless and for the most part is the only voice of reason and sanity.\\n\\n\r\nNext to him would be another character who I thought would be irritating, Inami, who contrary to what the viewer might think from the start is actually the lead heroine.  She suffers from a fear of men which makes her want to punch any man she sees.  This of course causes a lot of problems in a working environment populated by both men and women and results in quite a few punches to the face of our unfortunate leading man.  Despite this, as the reasons for her fears is revealed and her struggles with conquering them makes her ultimately a very interesting and satisfying character.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad would be pretty much everyone else.  Characters initially amusing like the cute and adorable Taneshima become narcissistic perverts and contribute to my eventual disdain for this title.  Others are just completely boring and unamusing.  This would include characters such as the one dimensional restaurant manager, head waitress, and kitchen staff as well as Takanashi's useless sisters.  While there are a few laughs with them along the way, they\u2019re totally devoid of likability.  Their contribution, through their selfish behavior, to ruining what should have been a touching final episode and the culmination of the series makes me despise them even more.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the real positives though is what initially attracted me to Working!!  The artwork is really good.  Despite my negative feelings for many of the characters, their designs were very good.  I thought the humor was expressed very effectively through the animation when it was actually funny.  The OP animation was also really cute and charming, even though the music itself was a bit ordinary.  Vocally the acting is pretty average all around with nothing exceptionally bad or good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Working!! is just too uneven an experience to be considered even average.  Was I too harsh with this?  Perhaps, but at this point I feel I have grown tired of certain anime fetishes.  Incest, psychologic trauma from horribly inexcusable parenting, and cross-dressing are just a few.  While there is nothing incestuous in this the other two are on display proudly.  Is Working!! worth watching?  I think that depends.  If you\u2019re a relatively new or inexperienced anime viewer this will likely be amusing to you and the things that stand out as clich\u00e9d won\u2019t seem so much so.  Anyone else should give it a pass, I sure wish I had.\\n",

            "content": "Uninspiring and rather dull.\r\nWorking!! (please note the two exclamation marks) is a slice of life, comedy show about people who work at a family restaurant, you know, one of those restaurants that serve mediocre food. It is only befitting that this show is as bad as the food presumably served at the mediocre restaurant.\r\nWith no plot whatsoever this anime is as episodic as it can possibly be, yet it's not. It's not episodic because in an episodic anime there would be a plot outline for each episode, or for the episodes included in an arc. In Working!! there exist no plot whatsoever. I honestly believedthat the male phobia thing that one of the female protagonists suffer from was a gimmick, a passing feature used for some comic relief in an otherwise rather un-comical show. I was mistaken. It's the main focal point of many of the events that take place in many of the episodes in this anime and it's just..., uninspiring.\\n\\n\r\nA few points of interest were to be found though, the supporting character Yamada is the most entertaining character in the show and there is no competition. Most characters were dull and the producers really tried to make them more interesting with some eccentric appealing attributes, it didn't work though. I understand that this anime was supposed to be a bit parodical, a bit sarcastic, a bit funny, but the problem is; it's not. Somewhere along the way of production they got a serious case of carebear flu and decided to take the production seriously.\\n\\n\r\nHalfassed, fake and poor screenplay for the most part with no plot summarizes this stellar production from A-1 Pictures Inc.\\n\\n\r\nHaters gonna hate.",

            "content": "Working!, a popular anime adapted from a 4koma which is riding on the \"moe\" wave was one of the better shows of the Spring 2010 season.\r\nWe start off the story with a young man named Souta Takanashi or more commonly known as Shinra or Lelouch. This young man is looking for a job to support his dysfunctional family filled with eccentric women. He is forced to help put food on the table for his underprivileged family and begins working a restaurant called the Wagnaria (Denny's) and meets a large array of hilarious characters. Takanashi needs to support his family because of the troubles at home.His mother works long hours and his father is dead yet due to his mother being an office lady she doesn't make enough to feed the family. Takanashi must take care of his 4 eccentric sisters by working at the restaurant. His oldest sister, Kazue, despite being a lawyer and in her 30's lives at home after going through a divorce and losing custody of her kids because she got home late and beat them. It's a miracle that she still can practice law and beat her kids but that's Japan's problem. Takanashi also needs to support his depressed siste, Izumi, who's liable to kill herself at any given moment and is too depressed to walk. Despite being nearly 30 she still lives at home and complains about the colorful world and keeps to her dark room. (If I could pick a girl from the show to be my wife, I'd take her..she'd fit my dark and brooding vampiric lifestyle perfectly). On top of that he has to take care of his drunken sister, Kozue, who despite somehow holding down a job spends all of her money on liquor and abortions for all the times she has unprotected sex with various men. To top it all off Takanashi's youngest sister Nazuna is manipulative and a dominatrix despite being in elementary school. As you can see Takanashi's family circumstances are very dark and upsetting which is the undertone for this series. I personally found the darkness and depth of this show to be excellent since I am a dark person myself and I like to sit in a dark corner at Starbucks and drink black coffee.\\n\\n\r\nWhile at work Takanashi's life is just as hard. He has to deal with a group of mentally unstable and eccentric people that are most likely on drugs (it's just like Denny's here in the US, the one by me was shut down because they were cooking meth in the basement). Takanashi is repeatedly beaten and abused by Mahiru Inami, a self proclaimed \"androphobe\" but in reality is just tweaking from her lack of meth at work. He also has to deal with the two strongest men in Ikebukuro, Satou and Souma who happen to the cooks. They do nothing but troll him and make fun of him and offer little consideration for Takanashi's home issues. He also has to work with a mentally challenged yet well endowed short girl named Poplar who can't do anything right yet somehow still has a job and a Zange clone who's also mentally challenged named Yamada. To top it off there's the two lesbian crew leaders named Kyouko and Yachiyo who service each other throughout the day. As you can see Takanashi's working life is not much better than his home life and the eccentric and most likely drugged up people he works with don't help his situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe character depth and story of this show is very good and it gives off a very dark and deep theme. I like that in a show and I like to watch Takanashi suffer in his daily struggles that are shown in the show and to watch my 2d wife (waifu) Izumi. I give the story and characters an 8/10 because they were dark and depressing. However, there was too much fun in the series and it could have been better if there was more dramatic moments and if there were some tragedies.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art was good so I give them a 9/10..they could have been drawn in a much darker setting but every Denny's I've been to is very bright to show off the cockroaches anyways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rate this show an 8/10..I really enjoyed the characters and their back stories and I really liked how the show related to a dark and foreboding creature like myself. I would definitely watch this on my windows powered laptop at Starbucks and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a dark and depressing show mixed with some comedy for extra enjoyment. I feel this show is the highlight of the spring season and I like the direction Japan is going with these depressing, vampire orientated shows as of late. However, this show was not without flaws..there could have been some gore added to it like with Satou and Souma in the kitchen having accidents and Poplar accidentally impaling herself on a broken glass shard. A little blood in a dark show like this goes a long way and I feel that it needed some sanguine goodness to be a 10/10.",

            "content": "Looking at what I should expect for the Spring 2010 anime season through a calendar released by a source I don't know, one particular show had caught my interest.  The little plot summary read, \"The story is set in a family restaurant named \"Wagnaria\", in the northern Japanese prefecture of Hokkaido.  Sota works part-time there among the restaurant's high-spirited and strange staff.\"  Reading that and looking at the picture of that anime had made me want to watch it.  After watching that first episode, I knew that I'd enjoy Working!!\r\nStory:  After reading that little plot synopsis, you would think thatthere's an interesting story behind Working!!  Unfortunately, there isn't, but that's what made Working!! enjoyable since it IS a Slice of Life anime.  The story kicks off with our adorable busty loli, Poplar Taneshima, greeting some customers on a normal work day.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is a bit short-staffed, so it's up to Poplar to gather some new recruits since the manager, Kyouko Shirafuji, is as lazy as a sloth.  After asking many people to see if they would like a part-time job, but only to get that offer rejected, she suddenly bumps into our main protagonist, Souta Takanashi.  Though he thinks Poplar is a small child and is lost, Poplar retorts saying she's 17 years old and is looking for part-timers for her job.  Knowing that he'll work with Poplar since he believes she's cute, Takanashi gladly accepts.  From there on, Takanashi's life has became a bit more crazier now that he's working at Wagnaria.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The art is nothing too extraordinary.  Colorful and sharp, the art is nice to look at.  Looking back, it feels like art you would expect from a Comedy and Slice of Life anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  About everyone who's watched Working!! will always know the first few lines of the opening by heart.  It is honestly one of the most catchy and probably addicting openings I've heard.  The ending sounds great as well.  The voice actors do a terrific job in playing their character.  The male VAs, to me, felt it was like an ensemble cast.  With Jun Fukuyama (DRRR!!, Geass), Daisuke Ono (DRRR!!, TMoHS), and Hiroshi Kamiya (DRRR!!, SZS) as Takanashi, Satou, and Souma respectively.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters, to me, were the main enjoyment of the show.  Like what the little plot synopsis said in the beginning of this review, \"...high-spirited and strange staff.\", strange is the key word.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, Takanashi may look like a normal person, but the truth is that he loves small and cute things, ranging from little children, animals, and toys, which is pretty much why he started working due to Poplar being small and cute.  When he revealed this information to Satou and Kyouko, they thought that he was a lolicon which Takanashi strictly objects.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have the highly eccentric and adorable Poplar.  Again, you would think she's normal, but it's revealed that she has a very strong desire of becoming taller.  Because of her small height, she is easily mistaken as an elementary or middle school student, thus making her very sensitive whenever her height is discussed.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strangest characters in Working!! is the timid Mahiru Inami.  Inami is introduced as an androphobic (fear of male) girl.  Whenever a male approaches her, she punches them without hesitation due to a belief that every man is ready to attack her.  Though she has this condition, she is still able to work at Wagnaria, but only serving the female customers.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko and Yachiyo Todoroki are what I consider the yuri couple of the show.  Kyouko, as we know, is the lazy manager of Wagnaria, who does nothing but eat, usually the parfaits that Yachiyo brings her.  Yachiyo herself is strange overall.  She is always, and I mean ALWAYS carries with her a katana, which many are intimidated by that.  She also has a deep connection with Kyouko.  If Kyouko is away or is taken away from her, she gets sad and angry to a point where she would kill the person who took her away from her with her katana.\\n\\n\r\nNext up are the chefs of Wagnaria, Jun Satou and Hiroomi Souma.  Satou is probably the more sane one out of the main cast.  He's known as an intimidating, yet helpful individual.  However, he is in love with Yachiyo, but does not show it.  He also enjoys teasing Poplar, usually concerning her height or messing with her hair.  Though he may look always cheerful, deep down, Souma is the most deceiving of the cast.  He enjoys teasing some of the staff, with the exception of Inami, and somehow always gets his hand on some sort of information that is secretive to some of the staff.  Ironically, both characters remind me of Shizuo and Izaya of Durarara!!  Both are voiced by the same actor and both almost have identical personalities, with Satou and Shizuo being intimidating and having blonde hair, and Souma and Izaya being very deceitful and are always able to get their hand on some information.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, we have Aoi Yamada.  Though she's introduced late in the series, she appears regularly throughout the show.  She's usually unhelpful and clumsy when it comes to work, but very curious as to what happens in and out her workstation.  She also has a strong desire of having the ideal family.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  From beginning to end, I enjoyed Working!!  Whether it be Takanashi \"trying\" to cure Inami's androphobia, the strange diversity that occurs in the Takanashi household, or the usual, but sometimes, strange happenings inside Wagnaria, there's always something to enjoy when watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nScores-\\n\r\nStory- 7\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nCharacter- 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  I really enjoyed watching Working!!  It was an unexpected hit for me for the spring season.  The opening just sucks me in and prepares me for something that I'll enjoy from beginning to end.  With just only 13 episodes, I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't longer since I found it to have a lot of potential, but nonetheless, those 13 episodes were great to watch.  If you're considering watching Working!!, be in mind that it IS slice of life, meaning that it has almost no plot, and if you're one to watch for plot or just don't like slice of life, then Working!! isn't for you.  For those that enjoy slice of life, Working!! is definitely worth looking into.",

            "content": "It's sad how something that started out looking so promising became watching endless eight with slight variations to each episode. \r\nWhat happens in every episode is as follows:\r\nTakanashi likes something cute, like Taneshima, and goes into trance mode upon seeing it.\r\nInami resists punching guys, but punches Takanashi anyway.\r\nTaneshima mispronounces Takanashi.\r\nKyouko sits there waiting for Yachiyo to serve her.\r\nYachiyo goes gaga over Kyouko, and complains to Satou, who has romantic feelings for Yachyo, and thus gets jealous.\r\nYachiyo draws her katana and threatens to cut anything that gets in the way of her and Kyouko.\r\nSouma gets dirt on everyone and blackmails them to do his work.\r\nThere areother factors that might be added in, like the addition of Takanashi's family, the long lost manager of the restaurant that went out looking for his wife, and, more recently, the addition of a runaway who tries to get her perfect family.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I am a great fan of episodic anime. Just take a look at my favourite list (Aria, Hidamari Sketch, Lucky Star). The major problem is that, without a plot, what needs to be done is to create likable characters and situations that one can really enjoy. I initially liked what they did with Inami, that her man-phobia is affecting the entire restaurant, but there comes a time when a situation gets overused. Yachiyo started as my 2nd favourite character, behind Inami, but, as above, she does nothing different every episode.No one likes to see an overused plot element. It's boring, repetitive, and it makes even 24 minutes weekly a drag to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, which other characters are actually likable? Taneshima was supposed to be the lead female, but, obviously, she has been pushed aside by Inami. So, what does Taneshima actually add to the story? She is the most boring lead I have ever seen. Usually with leads, you either like them or hate them. Taneshima does next to nothing each episode, so people can't actually decide if they like her or not. Same goes to the non-main males in the series. For example, the only thing we know about Souma is his blackmailing intent. How interesting does that make a person? We only know ONE thing about him. There is absolutely no character development.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise, I skip though the opening every week. I mean, seriously, that opening is even more annoying than K-ON!!'s (the 2nd season, btw). Nothing special in terms of voice acting, and art is pretty dull for a 2010 anime.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, Working!! does have its entertaining moments, but unless you really have nothing better to do, or watch it in fast forward like I do, my advice is not to watch it. There are plenty of better episodic comedy/slice of life anime out there. Repetitive attempts at humour really makes this a poor anime.",

Watching the very first episode ofthis anime, I can already conclude that this won't be another failed attempt of comedy anime. It starts out with a very non-comical tone that makes the show more unexpected. Then Popura shows up like a gradeschooler and then it suddenly gave the show a hilarious kick. \\n\\n\r\n                I don't judge anime on how majestic it is but rather how it works in its chosen genre. So far, I give this show an 8. It really has this intelligent sense of humor that's a little far from Baka to Test and K-On that features a lighter sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\nStory - I've only seen 1 ep so hahah not yet :) but the idea of a guy working in a diner w/ a bizarre staff, I'd give it an 8\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9 - really good art, as expected from the people who made Sora no Woto\\n\\n\r\nSound -7 - so far, I can't really decide the score so an ordinary 7 for me. Not yet sure about the opening\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8 - A nice bunch of characters that's not in the moe fandom. A loli that for once isn't a tsundere( jk exaggerating), a boss that isn't drunk or a loli/shotacon, a simple girl with a SWORD AND a girl that's super AFRAID of men hahah for me, the characters are pure genius\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8 - A comedy but really with sense. A good ol 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I give it an 8. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're up for a fresh new comedy anime with more unusual characters and seemingly good story. You should watch this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Since this is a new anime and only four episodes are out so far, it's a little hard to write a full blown-review. But it's a funny show, so I thought I'd give it a try.\r\nBasically, the only relatively normal characters in the story are Takanashi and Sato, and the other blue-haired guy who's name escapes me. Takanashi is actually very funny to watch, his reactions to the other employees (Such his fear of Yachiyo and his annoyance towards Inami and her brutal ways)  is most of the comedy anyway. Taneshima is cute and bubbly and really does remind you of a middle-schooler, whichis sad considering she's 17. Yachiyo seems like a bit of an air-head but it's semi-tolerable, but then again it's part of the wackyness of the show. The only character that really annoys me is Inami. I just want to punch her (hehehe). \\n\r\nOverall, the show provides a good set of main characters and eventually, each character gets a bit of story time and they get developed, although if you're expecting a whole lot of depth and character development, you're watching the wrong anime. \\n\r\nThe comedy is oddball and it can be VERY funny at times, but it can also be very annoying. Overall, I enjoy it as a slice-of-life and it's really a nice distraction where you can just enjoy it and let the time pass you by. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8- Very good, consistent. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6- Nothing out of the ordinary here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: A good well-rounded cast. I'm sure you'll find a character to like, one to hate and one that you're on the fence about :D\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7- Basic slice-of-life with odd characters. Don't expect anything with depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7-8- If you're into slice-of-life comedies, you'll enjoy it. Again, the humor is a bit off sometimes, but overall, worth watching for a easy, feel-good time.",

            "content": "'Working!!' is flawed. If I had to guess, a lot of people will lose interest and move on after trying a few episodes. This is because your enjoyment of 'Working!!' will almost entirely depend on whether you enjoy seeing its various characters interact. In fact, I'm very glad that the opening song is so damn addictive - because that's the reason I stuck with the show long enough for it to actually begin growing on me. \r\nFor better or worse, 'Working!!' introduces its characters slowly and gradually. Better, because getting to know these people feels very organic and natural, and worse, because in the beginning,you don't know anyone and many of the characters (especially at first sight) seem like stereotypical archetypes, and will come across as cliched - even annoying. For example, Popura seems like your generic busty loli. Satou seems like the usual scary-eyed dude with a golden heart. \\n\\n\r\nAnd Inami - oh Inami. She's genuinely annoying and even frustrating to watch. At least, until you get to know more about her character. Her 'condition' is often used as a joke, and initially seems to be nothing more than a cheap way to include slapstick in the show. But later on, this begins to actually influence the plot. And that's when her condition, and Inami herself, get interesting. Something similar happens to all the characters - to some extent, at least. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, the show is slice of life; and because of that, you only learn about the people when some event happens and you're around to see it. They don't just open their mouths and let their life stories pour out on you. There's a constant sense of discovering new things about the various people. The problem is, I get the feeling only some viewers will reach that point. \\n\\n\r\nTime for some specifics: \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6\\n\r\nThe show is slice of life, so it doesn't have much of a story to speak of. People work at a restaurant, and stuff happens. You may or may not care. \\n\\n\r\nART: 7 \\n\r\nThe visuals are appropriate; the art is crisp and colorful, and easy on the eyes.  They don't do anything to wow you, but there's also no need to. The art isn't the star here, and for what it's worth, it does what it needs to do. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8 \\n\r\nThe opening song is audio-crack. I'm not usually a fan of such energetic and cutesy songs, but this particular one's so damn charming that I immediately became hooked. The voice acting is great and hits all the right notes, and all of the characters sound spot-on. The BGM isn't too memorable, mainly because the story isn't very dramatic. Although, at one point, it did sound completely appropriate (near the end of episode 9). \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8 \\n\r\nThis one's highly subjective. If I'd written this about a month ago, I would have scored this much lower. At least for me, the characters grew on me over the episodes, and rather well. I actually began to enjoy watching Popura, even though I hate most characters in other shows that look and sound even remotely like her. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\r\nAlso highly subjective. I tried to balance the fact that not everybody will enjoy this show. If the characters hit the right notes in you, you'll laugh with them. If not, you'll scoff at their futile attempts at making you care. Another factor is whether you enjoy slice of life in general. If not, you'll probably be bored rather quickly. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7 \\n\r\nIn the end, the later episodes of 'Working!!' are much, much more enjoyable than the earlier ones, because of the simple fact that you feel like you know about these people - and when stuff happens to them, you actually give a crap. The jokes get funnier, the events have more significance, and the interaction between characters is no longer boring and meaningless. But again - that's only if the people grow on you. If they don't, you probably won't find much to like.",

So apparently Takanashi got dragged into this job because of his affection towards \"Cute and Smallthings\" referring to Taneshima ... because he dislikes old people. Whole story mainly takes place in this Family Restaurant which has alot of strange employers starting from ones who carry katanas ... going on to violent type ... phobia type ... easygoing and so on... Takanashi gets used to the job very fast because of the friendly atmosphere but it ain't going to be so easy to work there as it seems.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: art is pretty new school no exaggeration with women bodies and such jsut normal atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well as i said before alot of different people from ones with weapons , easy going till the violent type and phobia.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As for 1st episode i enjoyed this anime really much because of the warm atmosphere good anime to get off ecchi season :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: As far as i see its should be a good anime if they won't ruin it halfway.",

            "content": "What do you get when you mix a lolicon, a loli, a violent androphobic (man-phobic), a sadist, a lesbian,  a lazy manager, a run away, and a bully( for lack of a better word).\r\nApparently something really funny, because that's what we get in Working!!, a show about... well these eight characters working at a family restaurant.\r\nBefore I get into the rest of the review, a small warning: if you do indeed decide to watch this show, and get specifically annoyed at the interactions between characters, especially Takanashi and Taneshima or Inami, stop. You almost definitely will hate the show.p It's the main source ofcomedy in the show, and you will see it repeat over, and over, and over....\\n\\n\r\nSo Working!! is really a hit or miss; try at least 2 episodes (3 is better) if it sounds promising.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the actual review:\\n\\n\r\nSo, we're at the family restaurant Wagnaria, where most of the early story will take place. It's overall a fairly good story. It's not really what you watch the show, and very little happens over the course of the show, but it still is, in the end, a fairly good story..\\n\\n\r\nSo, what is the story? Well basically, it's just developments between all of the character (with very little else changing)so again, stay away if you end up not liking them. We see, as we get to know all of the character, different sides of them, and we see these sides interacting, pushing their relationships forward.This show is not about conquering the world, or even a city; it's a simple interaction between some... interesting character, as we watch their bonds of relationships (not all romantic) bloom.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, the real strength of this show lies in the characters. We get to see very many different characters, and we learn about them as the show moves along. In this regard, the show is outstanding: we get to see a lot of characters, whose types are often quite original, interact in very believable ways. While I won't say all of the characters are miraculous creations, they all really bring something special to the show and are able to complete its full comedic scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all also played very well: their voices matched up perfectly with the emotions that you would think that they would feel in any situation. This was another great aspect of the show: all of the voice actors were able to capture the complex emotions that some of the characters would have been feeling for moments, and then were again able to change back instantaneously, as if they were actually in the scenes themselves. The sound effects weren't quite as good, but we do still occasionally here a shattering plate, running water, or the expected chorus of murmurs that would fill a restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nIf we combine these aspects of the sound with what I think is one of the best OPs of all time, and an ending amazing in its own regard (though not as good), I think the sound is great.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the visual part of this audiovisual feast, the art was, well good. There wasn't anything that really set it leaps and bounds apart from other anime, but at the same time, the characters were well drown, and our scenery usually had believable people in a restaurant, acting,  well believably. So, overall, the art wasn't great, but it defiantly was still good and did not detract from the general experience of watching Working!!\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of general experiences , mine was great! I personally thoroughly enjoyed all of the characters, their interactions, and everything about the show. You'll probably be similar to me if you like the first couple of episodes, or like the character types.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in summary:\\n\r\nif you don't like the characters after the first few episodes, DON'T WATCH THIS. I can't stress this point enough. But at the same time, don't can this show if anything in it sounds at all interesting. There's a huge chance you'll really love this show if you don't get annoyed by the characters. So, give it a try, watch a few episodes, and see if you find the characters interesting: it's a really well done anime, and again, if you like the characters, you'll like the anime. \\n\\n\r\nBriefer Summary\\n\r\nStory: Good (7)\\n\r\nArt: Good (7)\\n\r\nSound: Great (9)\\n\r\nCharacters: Outstanding (10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great (for me) (9)\\n\\n\r\nBye Working!! I really want to see more of you!!",

            "content": "~ Work it off! ~\r\nA relaxing anime that attends to the plights of the working lifestyle, by making light of them...\r\nWorking!! is an uplifting, quirky, and goofy documentation of everyday working life. It's a\r\ndedicated slice of life anime with no trickery whatsoever, and as such: it embraces a very simple concept.\r\nContrary to being escapist, everything about Working!! is refreshingly realistic and down-to-earth. It\r\ngoes without saying that \"minimalist-styled\" titles such as Working receive very conflicting responses, as\r\nmany fail to/refuse to acknowledge the technical merit within; just because \"there's no story\": which in itself is a common misconception. Therefore, the audience that can appreciate the relatability aspectof this 13 episode series are likely to enjoy, while those craving a more far-fetched form of escapism might want to look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nIt's questionable why people find such pleasure in watching something as down-to-earth as Working!!, while one of the main pull factors of anime as a medium remains: escapism potential - usually entailing distant worlds and superpowers etc. I'd like to think it's because the relatable nature of a show like Working!!, brings about a whole new form of escapism...\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of the premise and the entire vision behind the show, Wagnaria is far from an ordinary family restaurant. It's interesting, it's fun, it's entertaining, warming, and cosy: everything that working in the real world ISN'T. It's not often that i can say so about \"ordinary life\" documentaries, but Working!! is actually rather innovative in the way in which it brings all of these cosy escapist fantasies to life, to something that the mature majority of us can relate to: working life - which makes evident that the show's target audience is beyond 15 (approximately)\\n\\n\r\nWhile catering (get it?) primarily to the relatable experiences of adults, Working!! retains its innocent and goofy charm to awaken the child within. It has extremely heavy ties to the very ordinary working lifestyle most of us are fed up with at present, and so by exposing the entertaining side of such a systematic routine... It not only makes light of the situations that arise at Wagnaria... It makes light of life as a whole, and proudly emanates a carefree vibe that makes the show a great way to wind down. It is therefore essentially:, escapism into an optimistic life perspective...\\n\\n\r\nThose who desire to indulge in the sugar-coated viewpoint that Working!! brings forth, are unlikely to demand a gripping plot line, and this is appropriate as it would only contradict the show's uplifting, and enjoyably carefree aura. The premise is therefore as simple as possible: Souta (our male protagonist) begins working at Wagnaria - a friendly family restaurant. Throughout, nothing threatens to dramatically shape this plot-line and so the show is infinitely more invested in the character development, which leads me swiftly on...\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is EVERYTHING to a dedicated SoL such as Working!!, and so the consideration in this department scales closely to the show's overall quality. Thankfully, Working!! delivers on this front by introducing us to a wide variety of vastly differing personalities that make Wagnaria the unique place it is...\\n\\n\r\nWhile the design of our protagonist: Souta has his amusing quirks, he is the POV character to act as the gateway into the audience's reliability. Therefore he's a relatively blank-slate compared to his co-workers.  Which helps to document the rest of the characters, as he maintains a relatively impartial social standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nFrom Souta's viewpoint, we're introduced to a colourful selection of personalities...\\n\r\nFrom the androphobic antics of Inami, to the hilariously flawed management personal of Wagnaria. Often such diversity leads to more interesting and unpredictable interactions, and so Working!! gave itself a head start through character design: to make the personalities as individual and interesting as possible. In turn, this gives the whole show an unbeatably natural and yet appropriately intreeging chemistry that makes it an entertaining watch, despite its simplicity. The unique nature of each character comes with a few prominent quirks which make the employees all very charming and likable. This is paramount obviously to Working!!'s success, and gives each character an amusingly emphasized and familiar \"presence\" that the viewer can immerse themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nWorking!! actually undertones a lot of drama as well such as androphobia and love interests. This furthers the depth of the characters with a more conventional \"backstory\" style, and while it's not ALL fun and games when it comes to these matters... Working!! maintains a balance between substance, casual and comedic interactions, to make it into a happy outlook on working life, while being as unpredictable as possible - in spite of the repetitive nature of employment. It's varied, and therefore a bit chaotic at times, as is representative of real life - another point to serve its relatability aspect...\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation is very expressive in terms of comedic visual effects, and the overall standard of the animation is high. In the sound department, we're greeted with a calming and very \"family workplace\" feeling atmospheric score, which accurately conveys the show's carefree atmosphere. To accompany this, an OP and an ED track that really emphasizes the \"fun\" of the character chemistry., and therefore couldn't be more appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nDownsides?\\n\r\nFrom a critical point of view, i must say that it's obvious how there's no interesting plot line to accompany the show. Furthermore, the art is very generic, which isn't helped by the highly excessive usage of cliche anime comedy visual effects, which become more tiresome than expressive or powerful after a while.\\n\\n\r\nWorking!! is undoubtedly a very cheesy setup, but it's an example of pure SoL splender that stays true to its branding. It's highly considered anime on most fronts in my opinion., and I found it to be an entertaining and calming outlook on working life - that really lifts my spirits and removes my stresses - the realistic and yet entertaining character chemistry being the strong suit...\\n\\n\r\n~ From far away I can see a small distant utopia ~",

            "content": "This is my first review so please be gentle, take it easy, etc. etc etc.\r\nFrom the director of both Sketchbook, Kaleido Star and Aria comes Working!!, a story about a relatively normal dude named Takanashi and the crazy shenanigans of his equally crazy co-workers playing out at the family restaurant Wagnaria.\r\nOther than that there's not much to say about the story of this anime; yup, it's just another light-hearted slice-of-life, again.\r\nPresentation-wise Working!! is excellent, A-1 has done a great job with both animation and sound. The music of the show fits like a glove, and the OP is incredibly catchy (WAN WAN), the ED... notso much, but who cares. Most of the seiyuu also do a great job voicing the rather large cast of likeable characters. \\n\r\nThis isn't really related, but Kamiya Hiroshi (Souma) and Ono Daisuke (Satou) do roles in Working!! which are incredibly similar to the roles they do in DRRR!! as Izaya and Shizuo respectively. I'd always humour myself with the thought of Izaya and Shizuo working out their disagreements after each episode, and then go to their part-time job at Wagnaria. \\n\r\nAlso, double exclamation marks seems to be a trend in anime titles these days.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress, let's just take a look at Working!!s problems, namely the script. It's sad when a bad script ruins what would usually be a much better anime. What is the problem with it? Well, the comedy of the show mostly depends on the quirks of the characters. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself, but when you get the nth \"ZOMG SHE HAS A KATANA WITH HER AT WORK\"-joke it gets kinda tiresome, there's a lot of crummy slapstick too. Furthermore, the later episodes mainly focuses on the romantic relationship between two characters whose names shall not be revealed in this review, which is rather badly done. Fortunately, the characters and quirks are many, and the romance episodes are relatively few. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all Working!! is a enjoyable series with excellent presentation, a nice cast of characters, and a rather lacklustre script which is partially saved by good direction.\\n\r\nPeople who like slice-of-life will probably enjoy this, and vice versa for people who dislike it.",

            "content": "Slice of life has to me always, always been a rather interesting genre of anime.  Since life is comprised up of many aspects, the amount of possible interpretations of life for an anime are almost limitless.  Today, i will be reviewing an anime that talks about the high-school part time job, in the most literal title of all time, Working!!\r\nStory (7.00/10):  The story of working!! is pretty much how it sounds, working.  Our main protagonist Takanashi Souta is stopped on his way from school by a small little girl named Popura (that's how you spell her name in Romaji, don't tryand tell me otherwise), urging him to come to the place where she works and help out there as a part timer.  After some rather simple convincing, our main protagonist does come and work at the family restaurant known as Wagnaria, where he meets a bunch of oddballs.\\n\\n\r\nAs a base concrete idea, this story has really no originality.  Throughout all of anime, the idea of a main protagonist meeting a bunch of oddball characters has been explored many times by other anime.  That's not to say the idea is stale and bad, as many shows, like this one, have actually made use of the idea in a beneficial nature, but the fact remains, that the idea is overused and quite common in anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as a plot line, this anime surprisingly has one.  Not a very noticeable one that you notice straight from the beginning, mind you, but a plot line nonetheless.  The anime does this weird sort of set up, where practically the first half of the show is built in an episodic format where the topics and plot points of the show scatter around depending on which episode you're watching, and then ending off in the second half with a cute, but somewhat unnecessary romantic plot line.  While I am a huge fan of romantic subplot and romantic storylines, focusing quite a substantial amount of screentime on it felt a little off, as I felt like I was watching a completely different anime altogether.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt like the story of Working!! was enjoyable, even with its slight story flaws and overused base story idea.  Nothing felt rushed into terms of story pacing, and the anime did a great job at exploring the main characters by giving most of them a episode that was practically devoted to them in the first few episodes, which I felt was a very good way at giving the audience a way of knowing who the characters were and what they had that was unique to them.  For an ending, it could be better.  There wasn't really a resolution I felt to the series, and nothing really stood out as extraordinary when the series ended. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Introduction episodes for main characters\\n\r\n+  Good story pacing\\n\r\n-   Bland base plot idea\\n\r\n-   No real resolution in the end\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.33/10):  For most slice of life's, good and memorable characters are usually required to make the show interesting and overall a good show in general.  And Working!!, certainly has that.  \\n\\n\r\nFor the main cast, we vary from all different ends of the spectrum.  We have the main protagonist obsessed with cute things, Takanashi Souta, Taneshima Popura, who is ironically nicknamed Poplar, given her size, (Poplar trees are quite tall in nature.) and Mahiru Inami, which to me, has a personality who reminds me of Arashiko from MM!  (Basically, she has a fear of men, and instinctively punches them in the face if they get too close.)  As well, as a whole other smorgasbord of characters of whom all have quite interesting and memorable personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of supporting cast, we don't have as large of a cast as other animes, but for what we do get, we get characters who are quite memorable to some extent.  Character's like Souta's family of four sisters, Inami's parents, and some random ones that appear for periods of time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show uses its characters well, making its bland plot idea very flavorful and colorful due to the fact that the characters that live in this world are very out there in terms of personalities, and create some great and wonderful funny moments.  The interactions between these characters are very prominent in the series and as such, make the series what it is.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are however, some downfalls.  The biggest one I see, is the fact that the anime sometimes doesn't do a good job on utilizing its main characters to their fullest capacity.  What I mean by this, is the fact that they don't use all of their main characters as well as they could.  Towards the end, the story rather than focusing on all 8 of the main characters as they had done previously, only really focused on 2 characters, making everyone else feel somewhat obsolete and pushed into the supporting character roles.  To say that they didn't get any proper screen time is an overstatement, but I would've personally liked to have seen more of the other characters rather than the two that the series focused on at the end.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+  Memorable main cast\\n\r\n+  Good supporting cast\\n\r\n-   Little screen time for most of the main cast towards the end\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.34/10):  Working!! was animated by A-1 pictures, who you may know for animating anime such as Anohana, Oreimo, and the ever debated Sword Art Online.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, the anime gives off a light feel to it.  Everything from the background to the actual characters themselves are drawn in this semi-neon color palette where everything gives off a shade of white.  Everything looks rather simple, which for me, fits perfectly with the simple and easy storyline that the anime is following. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we get chibi moments for whenever the comedy occurs.  All of these parts drawn in this style have your ordinary chibi feel to it where they all have a rather simple style to follow.  Not to say it's bad, but it doesn't really look out of this world amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the anime features some pretty energetic and surprisingly catchy and memorable tracks for their opening and ending songs.  Their not bad in terms of listening to them, as they are quite catchy and energetic, but on the wow factor of anime songs, there are certainly more well known tracks out there to listen to.  But for what it's worth, they are good songs.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good light colored art\\n\r\n+  Catchy songs\\n\r\n-   Somewhat generic looking chibi art\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.45/10):  For slice of life's, I always look for something unique to really grip me into the show.  There has to be something great and memorable to watch, if I'm going to continue watching it.  For this show, it was definitely the memorable characters.  \\n\\n\r\nTo say that I loved this show to death, is an overstatement.  To say I liked this show?  I'll give it that.  It's not a complicated show and it's not too simple.  Working!! has that very simple idea of slice of life animes that I like, combined with a more deeper connection between characters that you get more out of most slice of life animes.  It has that very nice feel good feel to it where you can watch one episode or two at a time, then continue it without problem some other time.  It's not complex, it's not simple, it's just a very charming little show that talks about the ins and outs of people at a workplace.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (7.73/10)",

            "content": "The story starts with Sota Takanashi, a sixteen-year-old high school student. He is recruited by Popura Taneshima, an adorable but extremely short seventeen-year-old high school student, to work at the family restaurant Wagnaria, hence the American title. Takanashi accepts her request but is dragged into unforeseen working conditions. Wagnaria is just a normal family restaurant, but the employees aren't exactly what he expects them to be.\r\nWagnaria's employees act as a dysfunctional but comical family. Popura is small enough to be mistaken as an elementary school girl, which is ironic because she was named after the poplar tree so she would grow tall. There's Inami Mahiruwho appears to be a normal seventeen-year-old girl but has sever androphobia. Her androphobia will cause her to punch any male that comes near her regardless of species, which tends to be, for better or worse, Takanashi. The Manager, Kyoko Shirafuji, is rather apathetic towards anything in the restaurant besides eating parfaits and whatever Wagnaria serves. Then there is Yachiyo Todoroki who has an obsessive admiration of the manager and carries around a katana while serving her customers.\\n\\n\r\nFor Takanashi's fellow male employees, there's Jun Sato, and Hiroomi Soma. Jun Sato has a threatening appearance and acts quite intimidating, but is actually a very helpful guy. He often finds creative ways to tease or play pranks on Popura about her height. On the other hand, Hiroomi Soma may look like an easygoing cook, but he tends to blackmail his fellow co-worker into doing his job. He has a knack for getting information about others, and is curious about what his fellow workers are doing.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi's fellow co-workers may seem like an odd bunch, but Takanashi himself is unaware of his own strange behavior. One thing I applaud of this series is that they introduce a new term for those who are misinterpreted as lolicons. What Takatsu introduces is the new term \"mini-con\", which is someone with an obsessive preference for anything that is small like puppies, kittens, children, and even water fleas. Takanashi adds more variety to the Wagnaria oddity.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that I loved most about this series is the voice actors. Coincidentally, or maybe not, all three male characters are voiced by seiyuus from Durarara!! in practically the same roles. We have Jun Fukuyama acting as Takanashi, who has that same perverted role he did for Shinra, Hiroshi Kamiya for Soma, the sadistic and know-it-all type as Izaya, and Daisuke Ono who plays the silent giant similar to Shizuo.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu for the female characters aren't in the same situation as the males, but I have to say they were very amusing. We have Kana Asumi for Popura, who nearly has the same lines as Yuno in Hidamari Sketch. She provides this cute mascot-ish feel to Popura, making her action more adorable. Kumiko Watanabe performs Kyoko Shirafuji whose attitude is completely different from her performance as Keroro from Keroro Gunso, which surprised me. We have Eri Kitamura for Yachiyo Todoroki, which was quite new to me as I usually see her voice acting characters that are more energetic or youthful. Kitamura plays a more lady-like and mature role for Yachiyo, showing Kitamura's new and interesting voice acting talents. Saki Fujita, who voiced the virtual idol, Hatsune Miku, plays the role of Mahiru Inami. Fujita does a great job switching from a shy and timid teenager to flustered, and sometime violent, androphobic.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed most out of this series is that it made me actually want to work in this kind of environment. I kid you not, I wouldn't mind cleaning up the messes these characters bring as long as I got to mess around with them. Last time I checked, family restaurants, or any other type of restaurant, don't have cute midget waitresses, katana-wielding waitresses, or even a blackmailing cook to serve people. I enjoyed Takatsu-sensei's sense of comedy which, to me, wasn't annoying or unbearable to watch, but was actually nicely done and didn't really offend anyone. I also loved how Popura keeps on saying \"I'm not short!\" throughout the whole series, despite her own humiliation when she contradicts herself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I liked was the character designs by A-1 pictures. The character designs by Takatsu-sensei were simple and sketchy. For an anime, the characters would need details to make them alive, but at a minimum to stay close the original work. Looking at the manga and anime, I wasn't disappointed in the design and was really happy to see them being animated. I really compliment A-1 for the character designs and making Takatsu sensei's work come alive.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pull out something I didn't enjoy about this anime, I would say it was the tempo of each episode. Although the manga was a pretty simple 4-koma anime, I felt that this series took too long to develop. I felt like the anime took its time to fill the gap between each 4-koma of the manga so that the story would make sense. 4-koma manga are usually fast paced and need to shorten its storytelling to get to the point. Although I felt the anime's storytelling was time consuming, it was something that couldn't be helped when you're transferring several short chapters from a six-page manga to a full 30 minute animation.\\n\\n\r\nThere is just so much more I could talk about that makes the series both hilarious and charming, but I'll resist spoiling it. I would recommend anyone, literally anyone, to watch this anime. I would have to say this show was one of the funnier and entertaining series that aired in spring 2010. If you're interested in something with a story, you'll likely find what you're looking for around the last few episodes, but I would say the giggles packed into the anime will make up for it. There are even more characters to come in this series that will make Working!! more fun to watch. If you're into slice-of-life type storytelling, get yourself to watch Wagnaria!! now! I would overall recommend this series to anyone looking for a fun show bundled with laughs.",

            "content": "Working!! is a rather simple concept anime series. It is grounded on a set amount of characters and their interaction in and outside the workplace. I honestly thought this was going to be one of those more forgettable series as the premise of people working in one place with little plot development didn\u2019t intrigue me. This series however flipped all my expectations around with its shear simplicity and honesty. \r\nFirstly I would say the characters in this series are unique which gives the series its anchor. The interaction between these characters are very naturally presented that it was a pleasure to watch. All characters inthis series are great and well developed from the start thus even with the lack of character development throughout the series it was still enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is as it is stated in the synopsis and it is just as simple as that. It is just things that revolve around the daily lives of the characters. The art was decent it isn\u2019t significantly great but it isn\u2019t bad either. I honestly don\u2019t have anything to complain about the art as it served its purpose well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for this series was really really good. The opening theme and ending theme fit the show perfectly! It was a real treat to listen to. This is one of the few series where I don\u2019t skip the themes because it is so enjoyable. The instrumental music inside the show was also really good it was well composed and is a great standalone listen. I am very picky about music in general but this series hit all the right notes. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor of this show for me was very very high. I thoroughly enjoyed watching every single episode and laughing at all those jokes/ slapstick/ impromptu moments. This show was a true enjoyment to watch and I salute the writers and the directors for this aspect as it isn\u2019t easy to pull off a non plot driven show. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review and I decided to write it as I truly enjoyed this series :)\\n",

For an anime viewer that shuffles between shows, Working!! could easily be dropped after 3 episodes if you are sufficiently impatient. \r\nFortunately, as the web of characters are built up, the pace becomes better and the story more enjoyable. The characters may not strike you as interesting from the start, but at the end, they become some of the most enduring ones. Some of the interactions may be repetitive but they reinforce the character's personality and background. In fact, this repetition creates a sense of familiarity for the following episodes. \r\nOverall, it is a good anime.

Working!! was just an anime I came across after searching animes made by A-1 Pictures. I liked A-1 Pictures animes (AnoHana, A.Z (S1 only), Shigatsu, etc.). This anime didn't disappoint me and I actually enjoyed it. To the review!\r\nStory: 7\r\nTo cut it short, it has no story or objective whatsoever. The anime was just short clips of the daily lives of employees of Wagnaria!! family restaurant. Although there was no story, as the anime progressed, the relationships between the employees deepened and showshow strong their bonds are. Can't really judge the story since there isn't much to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nFor a 2010 anime, the art is really good. It can be compared to KyoAni's K-ON!! since it was made in the same year. The movements aren't rigid and it shows that they put a lot of time to it. Since this anime has lots of punching scenes, it shows flowing movements of the punch and I acknowledge this piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nYes, I love the sound. The OP, the OST, the ED, everything. As written before I wrote part of the lyrics to the OP. The song is catchy and is cozy addition to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThis is what made the anime very enjoyable, yes, the characters. It's not your usual type of family restaurant workers. They all have quirks and some of them tend to be extreme. One of them, has a severe case of androphobia (afraid of male) and she punches any male she comes in contact if they are close. It might seem these people don't get along, but actually they do. They make one hell of a kitchen crew (I dote on Popura-chan, especially when teased by Satou-san ^_^).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nWell, I was hooked, but it wasn't something to die for. It's an anime that creates a cozy atmosphere where you sit on your bed eating ice cream while watching Working!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nSomething to pass time, if time does not pass you.",

            "content": "Let's cut to the chase: Working!! was definitely an enjoyable watch. Despite lacking a strong plot, Working!! made up with an interesting cast of characters, and plenty of comedy.\r\nStory: 7\r\nSet in a family restaurant, Working!! focuses on the relationships and troubles of the staff working there. Although there is almost no plot, it's obvious that Working!! wasn't created with the intention of providing a gripping story for the viewer. Claustrophobics beware though; most of the story takes place inside Wagnaria.\r\nArt: 8\r\nColourful and bright, the pallet used gave the anime a warm and happy atmosphere. The character designs complemented the respective personalities and traits of eachcharacter, and were skilfully implemented. The restaurant interior was quite detailed, although many locations were recurring, so I'm not surprised if they reused cells.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OP was... fun and cute. You'll probably be humming someone -WAN-WAN after watching this. The soundtrack was good, although not a tear jerking musical masterpiece, it did match the atmosphere and enhance the overall enjoyment. The seiyuu's were all great, and they matched the characters well. Fun fact: the voice actor for Inami is Saki Fujita, which Hatsune Miku was sampled from.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis is where Working!! really shone. The characters were all highly unique, with no obvious stereotypes (e.g. tsundere), and used each of their individual traits to a comedic effect. Not only are each and every character unique and interesting, they are all shown to a reasonable degree of depth, which made this show much more than just a boring animated sitcom.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe show was definitely enjoyable. The plethora of characters and their amusing reactions and interactions kept a smile on my face throughout every episode. Certainly a great watch for someone looking for a light hearted anime.",

            "content": "Review: Working!!\r\n\"Why is this rated a 7.82!? This anime is great!\"\r\nStory (7/10): Concerning of plot, the story has no framework. The anime just revolves many main characters and involves their everyday lives of 'working' in a restaurant. Besides that point, each of their personalities pale in comparison from each other. As a result their personalities mix in oddly well making their everyday lives pleasantly humorous to watch. If there was a framework to follow on however, it isn't until one of the the main character steps into play. Her androphobia, and the cause behind it. Androphobia is the fear of men and the fact ofthe matter is, she has to constantly have to deal with it with everyday life. Despite her fear of men, she works at Wagnaria where it is inevitable where there may be men at. With the help of main characters however, they push her to get over her fear of androphobia. Through hilarious trials and consequences, the main characters help her inch away out of her fear of men. Even though there may be a little to no plot, the anime is enjoyable to watch nevertheless. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): Like the name clearly states, A-1 Pictures. Nothing is better than A-1 really. The art direction for the opening theme coming into this anime is eye-catching and amusing to see. That can be said with the ending theme following of the anime. To mention, A-1 did a excellent job in catching every detail that it had to offer to the character designs to the scenery. With this particular anime being the based on a 4-koma manga, the animation is grand and the manga pales in comparison. That's all I have to say!\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): Ono Daisuke, Kamiya Hiroshi, and Fukuyama Jun are all in one place as they voice all the male main characters in the series. With that being the case, it is particularly interesting to hear their voices. Since they are known voicing many characters from all different series people all know and love. I can quite say all the voice actors did their voice roles well. Especially, when it came to one of the main heroines, Taneshima. To mention, her voice is irresistibly cute. For the music however, the opening coming into this can compare to opening themes such as Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu and Nicjijou. Catchy and up-lifting. For the the ending theme however, the ending theme is soothingly jazzy hearing all the male 'seiyuu' mentioned above sing the ending theme at each episode which was a highlight of this anime. The music was one of its strong points as it created a 'fun atmosphere' for this anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): The character lineup was definitely bizarre and large in comparison to some anime. Not to mention that one character looked like Sanji out of One Piece. It refreshing to see some characters were not being used out of the anime trope. However, there were a few characters that used the anime trope, but weren't overused to the point it became a nuisance. They were original as each of them had a quirk or trademark to remember them by. The large lineup and the liveliness of the characters is also one of its strong points making the anime enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (7/10): Managed to binge-watch this anime throughout one go. It's easy and fun to watch since it's a refreshing anime to watch. There wasn't a boring moment when it came to this anime. Definitely humorous and laughed out loud. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: (8/10): Season two will be on a look out since this was a refreshing anime to watch. Despite the story, the characters and how they interact with each other in their everyday life is amusing. Each character and their own little quirky personalities are rememberable despite having so many characters. It's what this makes this anime look forward to. The art direction from A-1 Pictures could not have been better as the character designs and scenery had little to none flaws at all. With Ono Daisuke, Kamiya Hiroshi and Fukuyama Jun singing karaoke at the end at each episode and the comedic relief this anime comes out with is relaxing. Overall, this anime is perfect if done with watching a favorite anime, having a bad day, or have an anime to watch on the weekend! Definitely recommend this anime to watch!\\n\\n\r\nRAW SCORE: 7.8/8.0\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 8.0/10.0",

To my surprise, what was supposed to be a filler series to pass the time for me ended up being one of the most enjoyable of spring 2010.\r\nThere isnt much of a story really. Takanashi justs goes to work at a family restaurant full of weird and unique co-workers and takes it from there for the rest of the series. However even with the lack of a real story, Working!! makes up for easily with their characters. Even with the lack of plot, ahandful of the characters were well done in the sense that they achieve what this anime was ment to do, to make us laugh. There were quite a bit of running gags, but still has more then enough to keep you watching.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime with very minimal plot, it does a very outstanding job in entertaining its viewers and is definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "Working!! is an example of an anime that\u2019s been done countless times before and will be again.  Admittedly I was expecting this but was attracted to the series cute looking characters and the slice of life pacing.  While the series gets off to a slow start things did manage to improve greatly only to end in the dustbin of history thanks to the douchebaggery of its  narcissistic cast of asshats.\r\nThe premise of Working!! puts us into the inner workings of a family restaurant.  The employees run the gambit of strangeness and mental issues to setup all the outstanding and original comedythat awaits us.  That\u2019s sarcasm by the way.  At the start of the show the restaurant is shorthanded and the search for a new part timer to help out ends with our typical over burdened high schooler, this time named Souta Takanashi.  Apparently the financial distress of Japanese families is quite high and even though he lives in a modest house with three working age sisters and an alleged mother (I am assuming she existed, they said she did kind of like my Papa told me Santa Claus lived in the North Pole when I was five...) that they must put their high school younger brother to work to make ends meet.  It\u2019s such a romantic setting that can only occur in Asia apparently.  The bastion of child labor and exploitation... oh wait I was talking about our lovely heartfelt slave err labor anime!\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning the show is decidedly unimpressive.  The cast comes off completely stereotypical and clich\u00e9d from the start.  Every character type is represented there has ever been there, in all their glory.  Now this isn\u2019t exactly new ground here, we see this in practically everything and at this point there basically are no original characters anymore.  But these characters for the most part come off as bland copies, devoid of personality and psychotic misfits I would sooner see hauled off by a van with padded walls driven by guys in lab coats.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this starts to change and by mid series things start to actually get pretty fun and amusing.  Characters which are annoying take a back seat and others which initially were the worst actually develop into pretty solid and interesting personalities.  I found it unusual that I could have such a completely different opinion of certain characters in such few episodes from the beginning to the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThings really fall apart though in the last episode.  I was well on my way to having an average to above average experience with this anime until once again the characters that made watching this show such a pain in the beginning, bring it down into the sewer.  I always find it strange how people who claim to all be \"friends\" in some of these shows can do the things they do to each other, even in fun and for their own selfish amusement.  There are some lines that just can\u2019t be crossed however and over the years I have found I have grown tired of humiliation and deviant behavior being used for laughs.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is ripe with love and hate characters.  On the positive side is our lead, Takanashi.  At first I found him to be an initial source of annoyance as he looked to be your typical lolicon.  Thankfully this wasn\u2019t the case and he manages to develop into a pretty nice leading man and one whom the viewer can relate and root for.  He is a bit strange in his own right, which is love of cute things but this is mostly harmless and for the most part is the only voice of reason and sanity.\\n\\n\r\nNext to him would be another character who I thought would be irritating, Inami, who contrary to what the viewer might think from the start is actually the lead heroine.  She suffers from a fear of men which makes her want to punch any man she sees.  This of course causes a lot of problems in a working environment populated by both men and women and results in quite a few punches to the face of our unfortunate leading man.  Despite this, as the reasons for her fears is revealed and her struggles with conquering them makes her ultimately a very interesting and satisfying character.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad would be pretty much everyone else.  Characters initially amusing like the cute and adorable Taneshima become narcissistic perverts and contribute to my eventual disdain for this title.  Others are just completely boring and unamusing.  This would include characters such as the one dimensional restaurant manager, head waitress, and kitchen staff as well as Takanashi's useless sisters.  While there are a few laughs with them along the way, they\u2019re totally devoid of likability.  Their contribution, through their selfish behavior, to ruining what should have been a touching final episode and the culmination of the series makes me despise them even more.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the real positives though is what initially attracted me to Working!!  The artwork is really good.  Despite my negative feelings for many of the characters, their designs were very good.  I thought the humor was expressed very effectively through the animation when it was actually funny.  The OP animation was also really cute and charming, even though the music itself was a bit ordinary.  Vocally the acting is pretty average all around with nothing exceptionally bad or good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Working!! is just too uneven an experience to be considered even average.  Was I too harsh with this?  Perhaps, but at this point I feel I have grown tired of certain anime fetishes.  Incest, psychologic trauma from horribly inexcusable parenting, and cross-dressing are just a few.  While there is nothing incestuous in this the other two are on display proudly.  Is Working!! worth watching?  I think that depends.  If you\u2019re a relatively new or inexperienced anime viewer this will likely be amusing to you and the things that stand out as clich\u00e9d won\u2019t seem so much so.  Anyone else should give it a pass, I sure wish I had.\\n",

(please note the two exclamation marks) is a slice of life, comedy show about people who work at a family restaurant, you know, one of those restaurants that serve mediocre food. It is only befitting that this show is as bad as the food presumably served at the mediocre restaurant.\r\nWith no plot whatsoever this anime is as episodic as it can possibly be, yet it's not. It's not episodic because in an episodic anime there would be a plot outline for each episode, or for the episodes included in an arc. In Working!! there exist no plot whatsoever. I honestly believedthat the male phobia thing that one of the female protagonists suffer from was a gimmick, a passing feature used for some comic relief in an otherwise rather un-comical show. I was mistaken. It's the main focal point of many of the events that take place in many of the episodes in this anime and it's just..., uninspiring.\\n\\n\r\nA few points of interest were to be found though, the supporting character Yamada is the most entertaining character in the show and there is no competition. Most characters were dull and the producers really tried to make them more interesting with some eccentric appealing attributes, it didn't work though. I understand that this anime was supposed to be a bit parodical, a bit sarcastic, a bit funny, but the problem is; it's not. Somewhere along the way of production they got a serious case of carebear flu and decided to take the production seriously.\\n\\n\r\nHalfassed, fake and poor screenplay for the most part with no plot summarizes this stellar production from A-1 Pictures Inc.\\n\\n\r\nHaters gonna hate.",

            "content": "Working!, a popular anime adapted from a 4koma which is riding on the \"moe\" wave was one of the better shows of the Spring 2010 season.\r\nWe start off the story with a young man named Souta Takanashi or more commonly known as Shinra or Lelouch. This young man is looking for a job to support his dysfunctional family filled with eccentric women. He is forced to help put food on the table for his underprivileged family and begins working a restaurant called the Wagnaria (Denny's) and meets a large array of hilarious characters. Takanashi needs to support his family because of the troubles at home.His mother works long hours and his father is dead yet due to his mother being an office lady she doesn't make enough to feed the family. Takanashi must take care of his 4 eccentric sisters by working at the restaurant. His oldest sister, Kazue, despite being a lawyer and in her 30's lives at home after going through a divorce and losing custody of her kids because she got home late and beat them. It's a miracle that she still can practice law and beat her kids but that's Japan's problem. Takanashi also needs to support his depressed siste, Izumi, who's liable to kill herself at any given moment and is too depressed to walk. Despite being nearly 30 she still lives at home and complains about the colorful world and keeps to her dark room. (If I could pick a girl from the show to be my wife, I'd take her..she'd fit my dark and brooding vampiric lifestyle perfectly). On top of that he has to take care of his drunken sister, Kozue, who despite somehow holding down a job spends all of her money on liquor and abortions for all the times she has unprotected sex with various men. To top it all off Takanashi's youngest sister Nazuna is manipulative and a dominatrix despite being in elementary school. As you can see Takanashi's family circumstances are very dark and upsetting which is the undertone for this series. I personally found the darkness and depth of this show to be excellent since I am a dark person myself and I like to sit in a dark corner at Starbucks and drink black coffee.\\n\\n\r\nWhile at work Takanashi's life is just as hard. He has to deal with a group of mentally unstable and eccentric people that are most likely on drugs (it's just like Denny's here in the US, the one by me was shut down because they were cooking meth in the basement). Takanashi is repeatedly beaten and abused by Mahiru Inami, a self proclaimed \"androphobe\" but in reality is just tweaking from her lack of meth at work. He also has to deal with the two strongest men in Ikebukuro, Satou and Souma who happen to the cooks. They do nothing but troll him and make fun of him and offer little consideration for Takanashi's home issues. He also has to work with a mentally challenged yet well endowed short girl named Poplar who can't do anything right yet somehow still has a job and a Zange clone who's also mentally challenged named Yamada. To top it off there's the two lesbian crew leaders named Kyouko and Yachiyo who service each other throughout the day. As you can see Takanashi's working life is not much better than his home life and the eccentric and most likely drugged up people he works with don't help his situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe character depth and story of this show is very good and it gives off a very dark and deep theme. I like that in a show and I like to watch Takanashi suffer in his daily struggles that are shown in the show and to watch my 2d wife (waifu) Izumi. I give the story and characters an 8/10 because they were dark and depressing. However, there was too much fun in the series and it could have been better if there was more dramatic moments and if there were some tragedies.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art was good so I give them a 9/10..they could have been drawn in a much darker setting but every Denny's I've been to is very bright to show off the cockroaches anyways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rate this show an 8/10..I really enjoyed the characters and their back stories and I really liked how the show related to a dark and foreboding creature like myself. I would definitely watch this on my windows powered laptop at Starbucks and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a dark and depressing show mixed with some comedy for extra enjoyment. I feel this show is the highlight of the spring season and I like the direction Japan is going with these depressing, vampire orientated shows as of late. However, this show was not without flaws..there could have been some gore added to it like with Satou and Souma in the kitchen having accidents and Poplar accidentally impaling herself on a broken glass shard. A little blood in a dark show like this goes a long way and I feel that it needed some sanguine goodness to be a 10/10.",

            "content": "Looking at what I should expect for the Spring 2010 anime season through a calendar released by a source I don't know, one particular show had caught my interest.  The little plot summary read, \"The story is set in a family restaurant named \"Wagnaria\", in the northern Japanese prefecture of Hokkaido.  Sota works part-time there among the restaurant's high-spirited and strange staff.\"  Reading that and looking at the picture of that anime had made me want to watch it.  After watching that first episode, I knew that I'd enjoy Working!!\r\nStory:  After reading that little plot synopsis, you would think thatthere's an interesting story behind Working!!  Unfortunately, there isn't, but that's what made Working!! enjoyable since it IS a Slice of Life anime.  The story kicks off with our adorable busty loli, Poplar Taneshima, greeting some customers on a normal work day.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is a bit short-staffed, so it's up to Poplar to gather some new recruits since the manager, Kyouko Shirafuji, is as lazy as a sloth.  After asking many people to see if they would like a part-time job, but only to get that offer rejected, she suddenly bumps into our main protagonist, Souta Takanashi.  Though he thinks Poplar is a small child and is lost, Poplar retorts saying she's 17 years old and is looking for part-timers for her job.  Knowing that he'll work with Poplar since he believes she's cute, Takanashi gladly accepts.  From there on, Takanashi's life has became a bit more crazier now that he's working at Wagnaria.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The art is nothing too extraordinary.  Colorful and sharp, the art is nice to look at.  Looking back, it feels like art you would expect from a Comedy and Slice of Life anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  About everyone who's watched Working!! will always know the first few lines of the opening by heart.  It is honestly one of the most catchy and probably addicting openings I've heard.  The ending sounds great as well.  The voice actors do a terrific job in playing their character.  The male VAs, to me, felt it was like an ensemble cast.  With Jun Fukuyama (DRRR!!, Geass), Daisuke Ono (DRRR!!, TMoHS), and Hiroshi Kamiya (DRRR!!, SZS) as Takanashi, Satou, and Souma respectively.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters, to me, were the main enjoyment of the show.  Like what the little plot synopsis said in the beginning of this review, \"...high-spirited and strange staff.\", strange is the key word.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, Takanashi may look like a normal person, but the truth is that he loves small and cute things, ranging from little children, animals, and toys, which is pretty much why he started working due to Poplar being small and cute.  When he revealed this information to Satou and Kyouko, they thought that he was a lolicon which Takanashi strictly objects.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have the highly eccentric and adorable Poplar.  Again, you would think she's normal, but it's revealed that she has a very strong desire of becoming taller.  Because of her small height, she is easily mistaken as an elementary or middle school student, thus making her very sensitive whenever her height is discussed.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strangest characters in Working!! is the timid Mahiru Inami.  Inami is introduced as an androphobic (fear of male) girl.  Whenever a male approaches her, she punches them without hesitation due to a belief that every man is ready to attack her.  Though she has this condition, she is still able to work at Wagnaria, but only serving the female customers.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko and Yachiyo Todoroki are what I consider the yuri couple of the show.  Kyouko, as we know, is the lazy manager of Wagnaria, who does nothing but eat, usually the parfaits that Yachiyo brings her.  Yachiyo herself is strange overall.  She is always, and I mean ALWAYS carries with her a katana, which many are intimidated by that.  She also has a deep connection with Kyouko.  If Kyouko is away or is taken away from her, she gets sad and angry to a point where she would kill the person who took her away from her with her katana.\\n\\n\r\nNext up are the chefs of Wagnaria, Jun Satou and Hiroomi Souma.  Satou is probably the more sane one out of the main cast.  He's known as an intimidating, yet helpful individual.  However, he is in love with Yachiyo, but does not show it.  He also enjoys teasing Poplar, usually concerning her height or messing with her hair.  Though he may look always cheerful, deep down, Souma is the most deceiving of the cast.  He enjoys teasing some of the staff, with the exception of Inami, and somehow always gets his hand on some sort of information that is secretive to some of the staff.  Ironically, both characters remind me of Shizuo and Izaya of Durarara!!  Both are voiced by the same actor and both almost have identical personalities, with Satou and Shizuo being intimidating and having blonde hair, and Souma and Izaya being very deceitful and are always able to get their hand on some information.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, we have Aoi Yamada.  Though she's introduced late in the series, she appears regularly throughout the show.  She's usually unhelpful and clumsy when it comes to work, but very curious as to what happens in and out her workstation.  She also has a strong desire of having the ideal family.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  From beginning to end, I enjoyed Working!!  Whether it be Takanashi \"trying\" to cure Inami's androphobia, the strange diversity that occurs in the Takanashi household, or the usual, but sometimes, strange happenings inside Wagnaria, there's always something to enjoy when watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nScores-\\n\r\nStory- 7\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nCharacter- 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  I really enjoyed watching Working!!  It was an unexpected hit for me for the spring season.  The opening just sucks me in and prepares me for something that I'll enjoy from beginning to end.  With just only 13 episodes, I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't longer since I found it to have a lot of potential, but nonetheless, those 13 episodes were great to watch.  If you're considering watching Working!!, be in mind that it IS slice of life, meaning that it has almost no plot, and if you're one to watch for plot or just don't like slice of life, then Working!! isn't for you.  For those that enjoy slice of life, Working!! is definitely worth looking into.",

            "content": "It's sad how something that started out looking so promising became watching endless eight with slight variations to each episode. \r\nWhat happens in every episode is as follows:\r\nTakanashi likes something cute, like Taneshima, and goes into trance mode upon seeing it.\r\nInami resists punching guys, but punches Takanashi anyway.\r\nTaneshima mispronounces Takanashi.\r\nKyouko sits there waiting for Yachiyo to serve her.\r\nYachiyo goes gaga over Kyouko, and complains to Satou, who has romantic feelings for Yachyo, and thus gets jealous.\r\nYachiyo draws her katana and threatens to cut anything that gets in the way of her and Kyouko.\r\nSouma gets dirt on everyone and blackmails them to do his work.\r\nThere areother factors that might be added in, like the addition of Takanashi's family, the long lost manager of the restaurant that went out looking for his wife, and, more recently, the addition of a runaway who tries to get her perfect family.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I am a great fan of episodic anime. Just take a look at my favourite list (Aria, Hidamari Sketch, Lucky Star). The major problem is that, without a plot, what needs to be done is to create likable characters and situations that one can really enjoy. I initially liked what they did with Inami, that her man-phobia is affecting the entire restaurant, but there comes a time when a situation gets overused. Yachiyo started as my 2nd favourite character, behind Inami, but, as above, she does nothing different every episode.No one likes to see an overused plot element. It's boring, repetitive, and it makes even 24 minutes weekly a drag to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, which other characters are actually likable? Taneshima was supposed to be the lead female, but, obviously, she has been pushed aside by Inami. So, what does Taneshima actually add to the story? She is the most boring lead I have ever seen. Usually with leads, you either like them or hate them. Taneshima does next to nothing each episode, so people can't actually decide if they like her or not. Same goes to the non-main males in the series. For example, the only thing we know about Souma is his blackmailing intent. How interesting does that make a person? We only know ONE thing about him. There is absolutely no character development.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise, I skip though the opening every week. I mean, seriously, that opening is even more annoying than K-ON!!'s (the 2nd season, btw). Nothing special in terms of voice acting, and art is pretty dull for a 2010 anime.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, Working!! does have its entertaining moments, but unless you really have nothing better to do, or watch it in fast forward like I do, my advice is not to watch it. There are plenty of better episodic comedy/slice of life anime out there. Repetitive attempts at humour really makes this a poor anime.",

Watching the very first episode ofthis anime, I can already conclude that this won't be another failed attempt of comedy anime. It starts out with a very non-comical tone that makes the show more unexpected. Then Popura shows up like a gradeschooler and then it suddenly gave the show a hilarious kick. \\n\\n\r\n                I don't judge anime on how majestic it is but rather how it works in its chosen genre. So far, I give this show an 8. It really has this intelligent sense of humor that's a little far from Baka to Test and K-On that features a lighter sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\nStory - I've only seen 1 ep so hahah not yet :) but the idea of a guy working in a diner w/ a bizarre staff, I'd give it an 8\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9 - really good art, as expected from the people who made Sora no Woto\\n\\n\r\nSound -7 - so far, I can't really decide the score so an ordinary 7 for me. Not yet sure about the opening\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8 - A nice bunch of characters that's not in the moe fandom. A loli that for once isn't a tsundere( jk exaggerating), a boss that isn't drunk or a loli/shotacon, a simple girl with a SWORD AND a girl that's super AFRAID of men hahah for me, the characters are pure genius\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8 - A comedy but really with sense. A good ol 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I give it an 8. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're up for a fresh new comedy anime with more unusual characters and seemingly good story. You should watch this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Since this is a new anime and only four episodes are out so far, it's a little hard to write a full blown-review. But it's a funny show, so I thought I'd give it a try.\r\nBasically, the only relatively normal characters in the story are Takanashi and Sato, and the other blue-haired guy who's name escapes me. Takanashi is actually very funny to watch, his reactions to the other employees (Such his fear of Yachiyo and his annoyance towards Inami and her brutal ways)  is most of the comedy anyway. Taneshima is cute and bubbly and really does remind you of a middle-schooler, whichis sad considering she's 17. Yachiyo seems like a bit of an air-head but it's semi-tolerable, but then again it's part of the wackyness of the show. The only character that really annoys me is Inami. I just want to punch her (hehehe). \\n\r\nOverall, the show provides a good set of main characters and eventually, each character gets a bit of story time and they get developed, although if you're expecting a whole lot of depth and character development, you're watching the wrong anime. \\n\r\nThe comedy is oddball and it can be VERY funny at times, but it can also be very annoying. Overall, I enjoy it as a slice-of-life and it's really a nice distraction where you can just enjoy it and let the time pass you by. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8- Very good, consistent. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6- Nothing out of the ordinary here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: A good well-rounded cast. I'm sure you'll find a character to like, one to hate and one that you're on the fence about :D\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7- Basic slice-of-life with odd characters. Don't expect anything with depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7-8- If you're into slice-of-life comedies, you'll enjoy it. Again, the humor is a bit off sometimes, but overall, worth watching for a easy, feel-good time.",

            "content": "'Working!!' is flawed. If I had to guess, a lot of people will lose interest and move on after trying a few episodes. This is because your enjoyment of 'Working!!' will almost entirely depend on whether you enjoy seeing its various characters interact. In fact, I'm very glad that the opening song is so damn addictive - because that's the reason I stuck with the show long enough for it to actually begin growing on me. \r\nFor better or worse, 'Working!!' introduces its characters slowly and gradually. Better, because getting to know these people feels very organic and natural, and worse, because in the beginning,you don't know anyone and many of the characters (especially at first sight) seem like stereotypical archetypes, and will come across as cliched - even annoying. For example, Popura seems like your generic busty loli. Satou seems like the usual scary-eyed dude with a golden heart. \\n\\n\r\nAnd Inami - oh Inami. She's genuinely annoying and even frustrating to watch. At least, until you get to know more about her character. Her 'condition' is often used as a joke, and initially seems to be nothing more than a cheap way to include slapstick in the show. But later on, this begins to actually influence the plot. And that's when her condition, and Inami herself, get interesting. Something similar happens to all the characters - to some extent, at least. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, the show is slice of life; and because of that, you only learn about the people when some event happens and you're around to see it. They don't just open their mouths and let their life stories pour out on you. There's a constant sense of discovering new things about the various people. The problem is, I get the feeling only some viewers will reach that point. \\n\\n\r\nTime for some specifics: \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6\\n\r\nThe show is slice of life, so it doesn't have much of a story to speak of. People work at a restaurant, and stuff happens. You may or may not care. \\n\\n\r\nART: 7 \\n\r\nThe visuals are appropriate; the art is crisp and colorful, and easy on the eyes.  They don't do anything to wow you, but there's also no need to. The art isn't the star here, and for what it's worth, it does what it needs to do. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8 \\n\r\nThe opening song is audio-crack. I'm not usually a fan of such energetic and cutesy songs, but this particular one's so damn charming that I immediately became hooked. The voice acting is great and hits all the right notes, and all of the characters sound spot-on. The BGM isn't too memorable, mainly because the story isn't very dramatic. Although, at one point, it did sound completely appropriate (near the end of episode 9). \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8 \\n\r\nThis one's highly subjective. If I'd written this about a month ago, I would have scored this much lower. At least for me, the characters grew on me over the episodes, and rather well. I actually began to enjoy watching Popura, even though I hate most characters in other shows that look and sound even remotely like her. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\r\nAlso highly subjective. I tried to balance the fact that not everybody will enjoy this show. If the characters hit the right notes in you, you'll laugh with them. If not, you'll scoff at their futile attempts at making you care. Another factor is whether you enjoy slice of life in general. If not, you'll probably be bored rather quickly. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7 \\n\r\nIn the end, the later episodes of 'Working!!' are much, much more enjoyable than the earlier ones, because of the simple fact that you feel like you know about these people - and when stuff happens to them, you actually give a crap. The jokes get funnier, the events have more significance, and the interaction between characters is no longer boring and meaningless. But again - that's only if the people grow on you. If they don't, you probably won't find much to like.",

So apparently Takanashi got dragged into this job because of his affection towards \"Cute and Smallthings\" referring to Taneshima ... because he dislikes old people. Whole story mainly takes place in this Family Restaurant which has alot of strange employers starting from ones who carry katanas ... going on to violent type ... phobia type ... easygoing and so on... Takanashi gets used to the job very fast because of the friendly atmosphere but it ain't going to be so easy to work there as it seems.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: art is pretty new school no exaggeration with women bodies and such jsut normal atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well as i said before alot of different people from ones with weapons , easy going till the violent type and phobia.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As for 1st episode i enjoyed this anime really much because of the warm atmosphere good anime to get off ecchi season :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: As far as i see its should be a good anime if they won't ruin it halfway.",

            "content": "What do you get when you mix a lolicon, a loli, a violent androphobic (man-phobic), a sadist, a lesbian,  a lazy manager, a run away, and a bully( for lack of a better word).\r\nApparently something really funny, because that's what we get in Working!!, a show about... well these eight characters working at a family restaurant.\r\nBefore I get into the rest of the review, a small warning: if you do indeed decide to watch this show, and get specifically annoyed at the interactions between characters, especially Takanashi and Taneshima or Inami, stop. You almost definitely will hate the show.p It's the main source ofcomedy in the show, and you will see it repeat over, and over, and over....\\n\\n\r\nSo Working!! is really a hit or miss; try at least 2 episodes (3 is better) if it sounds promising.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the actual review:\\n\\n\r\nSo, we're at the family restaurant Wagnaria, where most of the early story will take place. It's overall a fairly good story. It's not really what you watch the show, and very little happens over the course of the show, but it still is, in the end, a fairly good story..\\n\\n\r\nSo, what is the story? Well basically, it's just developments between all of the character (with very little else changing)so again, stay away if you end up not liking them. We see, as we get to know all of the character, different sides of them, and we see these sides interacting, pushing their relationships forward.This show is not about conquering the world, or even a city; it's a simple interaction between some... interesting character, as we watch their bonds of relationships (not all romantic) bloom.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, the real strength of this show lies in the characters. We get to see very many different characters, and we learn about them as the show moves along. In this regard, the show is outstanding: we get to see a lot of characters, whose types are often quite original, interact in very believable ways. While I won't say all of the characters are miraculous creations, they all really bring something special to the show and are able to complete its full comedic scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all also played very well: their voices matched up perfectly with the emotions that you would think that they would feel in any situation. This was another great aspect of the show: all of the voice actors were able to capture the complex emotions that some of the characters would have been feeling for moments, and then were again able to change back instantaneously, as if they were actually in the scenes themselves. The sound effects weren't quite as good, but we do still occasionally here a shattering plate, running water, or the expected chorus of murmurs that would fill a restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nIf we combine these aspects of the sound with what I think is one of the best OPs of all time, and an ending amazing in its own regard (though not as good), I think the sound is great.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the visual part of this audiovisual feast, the art was, well good. There wasn't anything that really set it leaps and bounds apart from other anime, but at the same time, the characters were well drown, and our scenery usually had believable people in a restaurant, acting,  well believably. So, overall, the art wasn't great, but it defiantly was still good and did not detract from the general experience of watching Working!!\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of general experiences , mine was great! I personally thoroughly enjoyed all of the characters, their interactions, and everything about the show. You'll probably be similar to me if you like the first couple of episodes, or like the character types.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in summary:\\n\r\nif you don't like the characters after the first few episodes, DON'T WATCH THIS. I can't stress this point enough. But at the same time, don't can this show if anything in it sounds at all interesting. There's a huge chance you'll really love this show if you don't get annoyed by the characters. So, give it a try, watch a few episodes, and see if you find the characters interesting: it's a really well done anime, and again, if you like the characters, you'll like the anime. \\n\\n\r\nBriefer Summary\\n\r\nStory: Good (7)\\n\r\nArt: Good (7)\\n\r\nSound: Great (9)\\n\r\nCharacters: Outstanding (10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great (for me) (9)\\n\\n\r\nBye Working!! I really want to see more of you!!",

            "content": "~ Work it off! ~\r\nA relaxing anime that attends to the plights of the working lifestyle, by making light of them...\r\nWorking!! is an uplifting, quirky, and goofy documentation of everyday working life. It's a\r\ndedicated slice of life anime with no trickery whatsoever, and as such: it embraces a very simple concept.\r\nContrary to being escapist, everything about Working!! is refreshingly realistic and down-to-earth. It\r\ngoes without saying that \"minimalist-styled\" titles such as Working receive very conflicting responses, as\r\nmany fail to/refuse to acknowledge the technical merit within; just because \"there's no story\": which in itself is a common misconception. Therefore, the audience that can appreciate the relatability aspectof this 13 episode series are likely to enjoy, while those craving a more far-fetched form of escapism might want to look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nIt's questionable why people find such pleasure in watching something as down-to-earth as Working!!, while one of the main pull factors of anime as a medium remains: escapism potential - usually entailing distant worlds and superpowers etc. I'd like to think it's because the relatable nature of a show like Working!!, brings about a whole new form of escapism...\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of the premise and the entire vision behind the show, Wagnaria is far from an ordinary family restaurant. It's interesting, it's fun, it's entertaining, warming, and cosy: everything that working in the real world ISN'T. It's not often that i can say so about \"ordinary life\" documentaries, but Working!! is actually rather innovative in the way in which it brings all of these cosy escapist fantasies to life, to something that the mature majority of us can relate to: working life - which makes evident that the show's target audience is beyond 15 (approximately)\\n\\n\r\nWhile catering (get it?) primarily to the relatable experiences of adults, Working!! retains its innocent and goofy charm to awaken the child within. It has extremely heavy ties to the very ordinary working lifestyle most of us are fed up with at present, and so by exposing the entertaining side of such a systematic routine... It not only makes light of the situations that arise at Wagnaria... It makes light of life as a whole, and proudly emanates a carefree vibe that makes the show a great way to wind down. It is therefore essentially:, escapism into an optimistic life perspective...\\n\\n\r\nThose who desire to indulge in the sugar-coated viewpoint that Working!! brings forth, are unlikely to demand a gripping plot line, and this is appropriate as it would only contradict the show's uplifting, and enjoyably carefree aura. The premise is therefore as simple as possible: Souta (our male protagonist) begins working at Wagnaria - a friendly family restaurant. Throughout, nothing threatens to dramatically shape this plot-line and so the show is infinitely more invested in the character development, which leads me swiftly on...\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is EVERYTHING to a dedicated SoL such as Working!!, and so the consideration in this department scales closely to the show's overall quality. Thankfully, Working!! delivers on this front by introducing us to a wide variety of vastly differing personalities that make Wagnaria the unique place it is...\\n\\n\r\nWhile the design of our protagonist: Souta has his amusing quirks, he is the POV character to act as the gateway into the audience's reliability. Therefore he's a relatively blank-slate compared to his co-workers.  Which helps to document the rest of the characters, as he maintains a relatively impartial social standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nFrom Souta's viewpoint, we're introduced to a colourful selection of personalities...\\n\r\nFrom the androphobic antics of Inami, to the hilariously flawed management personal of Wagnaria. Often such diversity leads to more interesting and unpredictable interactions, and so Working!! gave itself a head start through character design: to make the personalities as individual and interesting as possible. In turn, this gives the whole show an unbeatably natural and yet appropriately intreeging chemistry that makes it an entertaining watch, despite its simplicity. The unique nature of each character comes with a few prominent quirks which make the employees all very charming and likable. This is paramount obviously to Working!!'s success, and gives each character an amusingly emphasized and familiar \"presence\" that the viewer can immerse themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nWorking!! actually undertones a lot of drama as well such as androphobia and love interests. This furthers the depth of the characters with a more conventional \"backstory\" style, and while it's not ALL fun and games when it comes to these matters... Working!! maintains a balance between substance, casual and comedic interactions, to make it into a happy outlook on working life, while being as unpredictable as possible - in spite of the repetitive nature of employment. It's varied, and therefore a bit chaotic at times, as is representative of real life - another point to serve its relatability aspect...\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation is very expressive in terms of comedic visual effects, and the overall standard of the animation is high. In the sound department, we're greeted with a calming and very \"family workplace\" feeling atmospheric score, which accurately conveys the show's carefree atmosphere. To accompany this, an OP and an ED track that really emphasizes the \"fun\" of the character chemistry., and therefore couldn't be more appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nDownsides?\\n\r\nFrom a critical point of view, i must say that it's obvious how there's no interesting plot line to accompany the show. Furthermore, the art is very generic, which isn't helped by the highly excessive usage of cliche anime comedy visual effects, which become more tiresome than expressive or powerful after a while.\\n\\n\r\nWorking!! is undoubtedly a very cheesy setup, but it's an example of pure SoL splender that stays true to its branding. It's highly considered anime on most fronts in my opinion., and I found it to be an entertaining and calming outlook on working life - that really lifts my spirits and removes my stresses - the realistic and yet entertaining character chemistry being the strong suit...\\n\\n\r\n~ From far away I can see a small distant utopia ~",

            "content": "This is my first review so please be gentle, take it easy, etc. etc etc.\r\nFrom the director of both Sketchbook, Kaleido Star and Aria comes Working!!, a story about a relatively normal dude named Takanashi and the crazy shenanigans of his equally crazy co-workers playing out at the family restaurant Wagnaria.\r\nOther than that there's not much to say about the story of this anime; yup, it's just another light-hearted slice-of-life, again.\r\nPresentation-wise Working!! is excellent, A-1 has done a great job with both animation and sound. The music of the show fits like a glove, and the OP is incredibly catchy (WAN WAN), the ED... notso much, but who cares. Most of the seiyuu also do a great job voicing the rather large cast of likeable characters. \\n\r\nThis isn't really related, but Kamiya Hiroshi (Souma) and Ono Daisuke (Satou) do roles in Working!! which are incredibly similar to the roles they do in DRRR!! as Izaya and Shizuo respectively. I'd always humour myself with the thought of Izaya and Shizuo working out their disagreements after each episode, and then go to their part-time job at Wagnaria. \\n\r\nAlso, double exclamation marks seems to be a trend in anime titles these days.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress, let's just take a look at Working!!s problems, namely the script. It's sad when a bad script ruins what would usually be a much better anime. What is the problem with it? Well, the comedy of the show mostly depends on the quirks of the characters. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself, but when you get the nth \"ZOMG SHE HAS A KATANA WITH HER AT WORK\"-joke it gets kinda tiresome, there's a lot of crummy slapstick too. Furthermore, the later episodes mainly focuses on the romantic relationship between two characters whose names shall not be revealed in this review, which is rather badly done. Fortunately, the characters and quirks are many, and the romance episodes are relatively few. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all Working!! is a enjoyable series with excellent presentation, a nice cast of characters, and a rather lacklustre script which is partially saved by good direction.\\n\r\nPeople who like slice-of-life will probably enjoy this, and vice versa for people who dislike it.",

            "content": "Slice of life has to me always, always been a rather interesting genre of anime.  Since life is comprised up of many aspects, the amount of possible interpretations of life for an anime are almost limitless.  Today, i will be reviewing an anime that talks about the high-school part time job, in the most literal title of all time, Working!!\r\nStory (7.00/10):  The story of working!! is pretty much how it sounds, working.  Our main protagonist Takanashi Souta is stopped on his way from school by a small little girl named Popura (that's how you spell her name in Romaji, don't tryand tell me otherwise), urging him to come to the place where she works and help out there as a part timer.  After some rather simple convincing, our main protagonist does come and work at the family restaurant known as Wagnaria, where he meets a bunch of oddballs.\\n\\n\r\nAs a base concrete idea, this story has really no originality.  Throughout all of anime, the idea of a main protagonist meeting a bunch of oddball characters has been explored many times by other anime.  That's not to say the idea is stale and bad, as many shows, like this one, have actually made use of the idea in a beneficial nature, but the fact remains, that the idea is overused and quite common in anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as a plot line, this anime surprisingly has one.  Not a very noticeable one that you notice straight from the beginning, mind you, but a plot line nonetheless.  The anime does this weird sort of set up, where practically the first half of the show is built in an episodic format where the topics and plot points of the show scatter around depending on which episode you're watching, and then ending off in the second half with a cute, but somewhat unnecessary romantic plot line.  While I am a huge fan of romantic subplot and romantic storylines, focusing quite a substantial amount of screentime on it felt a little off, as I felt like I was watching a completely different anime altogether.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt like the story of Working!! was enjoyable, even with its slight story flaws and overused base story idea.  Nothing felt rushed into terms of story pacing, and the anime did a great job at exploring the main characters by giving most of them a episode that was practically devoted to them in the first few episodes, which I felt was a very good way at giving the audience a way of knowing who the characters were and what they had that was unique to them.  For an ending, it could be better.  There wasn't really a resolution I felt to the series, and nothing really stood out as extraordinary when the series ended. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Introduction episodes for main characters\\n\r\n+  Good story pacing\\n\r\n-   Bland base plot idea\\n\r\n-   No real resolution in the end\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.33/10):  For most slice of life's, good and memorable characters are usually required to make the show interesting and overall a good show in general.  And Working!!, certainly has that.  \\n\\n\r\nFor the main cast, we vary from all different ends of the spectrum.  We have the main protagonist obsessed with cute things, Takanashi Souta, Taneshima Popura, who is ironically nicknamed Poplar, given her size, (Poplar trees are quite tall in nature.) and Mahiru Inami, which to me, has a personality who reminds me of Arashiko from MM!  (Basically, she has a fear of men, and instinctively punches them in the face if they get too close.)  As well, as a whole other smorgasbord of characters of whom all have quite interesting and memorable personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of supporting cast, we don't have as large of a cast as other animes, but for what we do get, we get characters who are quite memorable to some extent.  Character's like Souta's family of four sisters, Inami's parents, and some random ones that appear for periods of time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show uses its characters well, making its bland plot idea very flavorful and colorful due to the fact that the characters that live in this world are very out there in terms of personalities, and create some great and wonderful funny moments.  The interactions between these characters are very prominent in the series and as such, make the series what it is.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are however, some downfalls.  The biggest one I see, is the fact that the anime sometimes doesn't do a good job on utilizing its main characters to their fullest capacity.  What I mean by this, is the fact that they don't use all of their main characters as well as they could.  Towards the end, the story rather than focusing on all 8 of the main characters as they had done previously, only really focused on 2 characters, making everyone else feel somewhat obsolete and pushed into the supporting character roles.  To say that they didn't get any proper screen time is an overstatement, but I would've personally liked to have seen more of the other characters rather than the two that the series focused on at the end.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+  Memorable main cast\\n\r\n+  Good supporting cast\\n\r\n-   Little screen time for most of the main cast towards the end\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.34/10):  Working!! was animated by A-1 pictures, who you may know for animating anime such as Anohana, Oreimo, and the ever debated Sword Art Online.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, the anime gives off a light feel to it.  Everything from the background to the actual characters themselves are drawn in this semi-neon color palette where everything gives off a shade of white.  Everything looks rather simple, which for me, fits perfectly with the simple and easy storyline that the anime is following. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we get chibi moments for whenever the comedy occurs.  All of these parts drawn in this style have your ordinary chibi feel to it where they all have a rather simple style to follow.  Not to say it's bad, but it doesn't really look out of this world amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the anime features some pretty energetic and surprisingly catchy and memorable tracks for their opening and ending songs.  Their not bad in terms of listening to them, as they are quite catchy and energetic, but on the wow factor of anime songs, there are certainly more well known tracks out there to listen to.  But for what it's worth, they are good songs.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good light colored art\\n\r\n+  Catchy songs\\n\r\n-   Somewhat generic looking chibi art\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.45/10):  For slice of life's, I always look for something unique to really grip me into the show.  There has to be something great and memorable to watch, if I'm going to continue watching it.  For this show, it was definitely the memorable characters.  \\n\\n\r\nTo say that I loved this show to death, is an overstatement.  To say I liked this show?  I'll give it that.  It's not a complicated show and it's not too simple.  Working!! has that very simple idea of slice of life animes that I like, combined with a more deeper connection between characters that you get more out of most slice of life animes.  It has that very nice feel good feel to it where you can watch one episode or two at a time, then continue it without problem some other time.  It's not complex, it's not simple, it's just a very charming little show that talks about the ins and outs of people at a workplace.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (7.73/10)",

            "content": "The story starts with Sota Takanashi, a sixteen-year-old high school student. He is recruited by Popura Taneshima, an adorable but extremely short seventeen-year-old high school student, to work at the family restaurant Wagnaria, hence the American title. Takanashi accepts her request but is dragged into unforeseen working conditions. Wagnaria is just a normal family restaurant, but the employees aren't exactly what he expects them to be.\r\nWagnaria's employees act as a dysfunctional but comical family. Popura is small enough to be mistaken as an elementary school girl, which is ironic because she was named after the poplar tree so she would grow tall. There's Inami Mahiruwho appears to be a normal seventeen-year-old girl but has sever androphobia. Her androphobia will cause her to punch any male that comes near her regardless of species, which tends to be, for better or worse, Takanashi. The Manager, Kyoko Shirafuji, is rather apathetic towards anything in the restaurant besides eating parfaits and whatever Wagnaria serves. Then there is Yachiyo Todoroki who has an obsessive admiration of the manager and carries around a katana while serving her customers.\\n\\n\r\nFor Takanashi's fellow male employees, there's Jun Sato, and Hiroomi Soma. Jun Sato has a threatening appearance and acts quite intimidating, but is actually a very helpful guy. He often finds creative ways to tease or play pranks on Popura about her height. On the other hand, Hiroomi Soma may look like an easygoing cook, but he tends to blackmail his fellow co-worker into doing his job. He has a knack for getting information about others, and is curious about what his fellow workers are doing.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi's fellow co-workers may seem like an odd bunch, but Takanashi himself is unaware of his own strange behavior. One thing I applaud of this series is that they introduce a new term for those who are misinterpreted as lolicons. What Takatsu introduces is the new term \"mini-con\", which is someone with an obsessive preference for anything that is small like puppies, kittens, children, and even water fleas. Takanashi adds more variety to the Wagnaria oddity.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that I loved most about this series is the voice actors. Coincidentally, or maybe not, all three male characters are voiced by seiyuus from Durarara!! in practically the same roles. We have Jun Fukuyama acting as Takanashi, who has that same perverted role he did for Shinra, Hiroshi Kamiya for Soma, the sadistic and know-it-all type as Izaya, and Daisuke Ono who plays the silent giant similar to Shizuo.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu for the female characters aren't in the same situation as the males, but I have to say they were very amusing. We have Kana Asumi for Popura, who nearly has the same lines as Yuno in Hidamari Sketch. She provides this cute mascot-ish feel to Popura, making her action more adorable. Kumiko Watanabe performs Kyoko Shirafuji whose attitude is completely different from her performance as Keroro from Keroro Gunso, which surprised me. We have Eri Kitamura for Yachiyo Todoroki, which was quite new to me as I usually see her voice acting characters that are more energetic or youthful. Kitamura plays a more lady-like and mature role for Yachiyo, showing Kitamura's new and interesting voice acting talents. Saki Fujita, who voiced the virtual idol, Hatsune Miku, plays the role of Mahiru Inami. Fujita does a great job switching from a shy and timid teenager to flustered, and sometime violent, androphobic.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed most out of this series is that it made me actually want to work in this kind of environment. I kid you not, I wouldn't mind cleaning up the messes these characters bring as long as I got to mess around with them. Last time I checked, family restaurants, or any other type of restaurant, don't have cute midget waitresses, katana-wielding waitresses, or even a blackmailing cook to serve people. I enjoyed Takatsu-sensei's sense of comedy which, to me, wasn't annoying or unbearable to watch, but was actually nicely done and didn't really offend anyone. I also loved how Popura keeps on saying \"I'm not short!\" throughout the whole series, despite her own humiliation when she contradicts herself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I liked was the character designs by A-1 pictures. The character designs by Takatsu-sensei were simple and sketchy. For an anime, the characters would need details to make them alive, but at a minimum to stay close the original work. Looking at the manga and anime, I wasn't disappointed in the design and was really happy to see them being animated. I really compliment A-1 for the character designs and making Takatsu sensei's work come alive.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pull out something I didn't enjoy about this anime, I would say it was the tempo of each episode. Although the manga was a pretty simple 4-koma anime, I felt that this series took too long to develop. I felt like the anime took its time to fill the gap between each 4-koma of the manga so that the story would make sense. 4-koma manga are usually fast paced and need to shorten its storytelling to get to the point. Although I felt the anime's storytelling was time consuming, it was something that couldn't be helped when you're transferring several short chapters from a six-page manga to a full 30 minute animation.\\n\\n\r\nThere is just so much more I could talk about that makes the series both hilarious and charming, but I'll resist spoiling it. I would recommend anyone, literally anyone, to watch this anime. I would have to say this show was one of the funnier and entertaining series that aired in spring 2010. If you're interested in something with a story, you'll likely find what you're looking for around the last few episodes, but I would say the giggles packed into the anime will make up for it. There are even more characters to come in this series that will make Working!! more fun to watch. If you're into slice-of-life type storytelling, get yourself to watch Wagnaria!! now! I would overall recommend this series to anyone looking for a fun show bundled with laughs.",

            "content": "Working!! is a rather simple concept anime series. It is grounded on a set amount of characters and their interaction in and outside the workplace. I honestly thought this was going to be one of those more forgettable series as the premise of people working in one place with little plot development didn\u2019t intrigue me. This series however flipped all my expectations around with its shear simplicity and honesty. \r\nFirstly I would say the characters in this series are unique which gives the series its anchor. The interaction between these characters are very naturally presented that it was a pleasure to watch. All characters inthis series are great and well developed from the start thus even with the lack of character development throughout the series it was still enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is as it is stated in the synopsis and it is just as simple as that. It is just things that revolve around the daily lives of the characters. The art was decent it isn\u2019t significantly great but it isn\u2019t bad either. I honestly don\u2019t have anything to complain about the art as it served its purpose well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for this series was really really good. The opening theme and ending theme fit the show perfectly! It was a real treat to listen to. This is one of the few series where I don\u2019t skip the themes because it is so enjoyable. The instrumental music inside the show was also really good it was well composed and is a great standalone listen. I am very picky about music in general but this series hit all the right notes. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor of this show for me was very very high. I thoroughly enjoyed watching every single episode and laughing at all those jokes/ slapstick/ impromptu moments. This show was a true enjoyment to watch and I salute the writers and the directors for this aspect as it isn\u2019t easy to pull off a non plot driven show. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review and I decided to write it as I truly enjoyed this series :)\\n",

            "content": "Working!! suffers from a slow buildup. For an anime viewer that shuffles between shows, Working!! could easily be dropped after 3 episodes if you are sufficiently impatient. \r\nFortunately, as the web of characters are built up, the pace becomes better and the story more enjoyable. The characters may not strike you as interesting from the start, but at the end, they become some of the most enduring ones. Some of the interactions may be repetitive but they reinforce the character's personality and background. In fact, this repetition creates a sense of familiarity for the following episodes. \r\nOverall, it is a good anime. This premier seasonhas set the foundation for the next few seasons and shows. \\n\\n",

Working!! was just an anime I came across after searching animes made by A-1 Pictures. I liked A-1 Pictures animes (AnoHana, A.Z (S1 only), Shigatsu, etc.). This anime didn't disappoint me and I actually enjoyed it. To the review!\r\nStory: 7\r\nTo cut it short, it has no story or objective whatsoever. The anime was just short clips of the daily lives of employees of Wagnaria!! family restaurant. Although there was no story, as the anime progressed, the relationships between the employees deepened and showshow strong their bonds are. Can't really judge the story since there isn't much to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nFor a 2010 anime, the art is really good. It can be compared to KyoAni's K-ON!! since it was made in the same year. The movements aren't rigid and it shows that they put a lot of time to it. Since this anime has lots of punching scenes, it shows flowing movements of the punch and I acknowledge this piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nYes, I love the sound. The OP, the OST, the ED, everything. As written before I wrote part of the lyrics to the OP. The song is catchy and is cozy addition to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThis is what made the anime very enjoyable, yes, the characters. It's not your usual type of family restaurant workers. They all have quirks and some of them tend to be extreme. One of them, has a severe case of androphobia (afraid of male) and she punches any male she comes in contact if they are close. It might seem these people don't get along, but actually they do. They make one hell of a kitchen crew (I dote on Popura-chan, especially when teased by Satou-san ^_^).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nWell, I was hooked, but it wasn't something to die for. It's an anime that creates a cozy atmosphere where you sit on your bed eating ice cream while watching Working!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nSomething to pass time, if time does not pass you.",

            "content": "Let's cut to the chase: Working!! was definitely an enjoyable watch. Despite lacking a strong plot, Working!! made up with an interesting cast of characters, and plenty of comedy.\r\nStory: 7\r\nSet in a family restaurant, Working!! focuses on the relationships and troubles of the staff working there. Although there is almost no plot, it's obvious that Working!! wasn't created with the intention of providing a gripping story for the viewer. Claustrophobics beware though; most of the story takes place inside Wagnaria.\r\nArt: 8\r\nColourful and bright, the pallet used gave the anime a warm and happy atmosphere. The character designs complemented the respective personalities and traits of eachcharacter, and were skilfully implemented. The restaurant interior was quite detailed, although many locations were recurring, so I'm not surprised if they reused cells.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OP was... fun and cute. You'll probably be humming someone -WAN-WAN after watching this. The soundtrack was good, although not a tear jerking musical masterpiece, it did match the atmosphere and enhance the overall enjoyment. The seiyuu's were all great, and they matched the characters well. Fun fact: the voice actor for Inami is Saki Fujita, which Hatsune Miku was sampled from.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis is where Working!! really shone. The characters were all highly unique, with no obvious stereotypes (e.g. tsundere), and used each of their individual traits to a comedic effect. Not only are each and every character unique and interesting, they are all shown to a reasonable degree of depth, which made this show much more than just a boring animated sitcom.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe show was definitely enjoyable. The plethora of characters and their amusing reactions and interactions kept a smile on my face throughout every episode. Certainly a great watch for someone looking for a light hearted anime.",

            "content": "Review: Working!!\r\n\"Why is this rated a 7.82!? This anime is great!\"\r\nStory (7/10): Concerning of plot, the story has no framework. The anime just revolves many main characters and involves their everyday lives of 'working' in a restaurant. Besides that point, each of their personalities pale in comparison from each other. As a result their personalities mix in oddly well making their everyday lives pleasantly humorous to watch. If there was a framework to follow on however, it isn't until one of the the main character steps into play. Her androphobia, and the cause behind it. Androphobia is the fear of men and the fact ofthe matter is, she has to constantly have to deal with it with everyday life. Despite her fear of men, she works at Wagnaria where it is inevitable where there may be men at. With the help of main characters however, they push her to get over her fear of androphobia. Through hilarious trials and consequences, the main characters help her inch away out of her fear of men. Even though there may be a little to no plot, the anime is enjoyable to watch nevertheless. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): Like the name clearly states, A-1 Pictures. Nothing is better than A-1 really. The art direction for the opening theme coming into this anime is eye-catching and amusing to see. That can be said with the ending theme following of the anime. To mention, A-1 did a excellent job in catching every detail that it had to offer to the character designs to the scenery. With this particular anime being the based on a 4-koma manga, the animation is grand and the manga pales in comparison. That's all I have to say!\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): Ono Daisuke, Kamiya Hiroshi, and Fukuyama Jun are all in one place as they voice all the male main characters in the series. With that being the case, it is particularly interesting to hear their voices. Since they are known voicing many characters from all different series people all know and love. I can quite say all the voice actors did their voice roles well. Especially, when it came to one of the main heroines, Taneshima. To mention, her voice is irresistibly cute. For the music however, the opening coming into this can compare to opening themes such as Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu and Nicjijou. Catchy and up-lifting. For the the ending theme however, the ending theme is soothingly jazzy hearing all the male 'seiyuu' mentioned above sing the ending theme at each episode which was a highlight of this anime. The music was one of its strong points as it created a 'fun atmosphere' for this anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): The character lineup was definitely bizarre and large in comparison to some anime. Not to mention that one character looked like Sanji out of One Piece. It refreshing to see some characters were not being used out of the anime trope. However, there were a few characters that used the anime trope, but weren't overused to the point it became a nuisance. They were original as each of them had a quirk or trademark to remember them by. The large lineup and the liveliness of the characters is also one of its strong points making the anime enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (7/10): Managed to binge-watch this anime throughout one go. It's easy and fun to watch since it's a refreshing anime to watch. There wasn't a boring moment when it came to this anime. Definitely humorous and laughed out loud. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: (8/10): Season two will be on a look out since this was a refreshing anime to watch. Despite the story, the characters and how they interact with each other in their everyday life is amusing. Each character and their own little quirky personalities are rememberable despite having so many characters. It's what this makes this anime look forward to. The art direction from A-1 Pictures could not have been better as the character designs and scenery had little to none flaws at all. With Ono Daisuke, Kamiya Hiroshi and Fukuyama Jun singing karaoke at the end at each episode and the comedic relief this anime comes out with is relaxing. Overall, this anime is perfect if done with watching a favorite anime, having a bad day, or have an anime to watch on the weekend! Definitely recommend this anime to watch!\\n\\n\r\nRAW SCORE: 7.8/8.0\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 8.0/10.0",

            "content": "Working!! is a slice of life anime. And like most every anime, it would be most fitting to throw a \"bizarre\" somewhere in that description. So Working!! is a \"bizarre\" slice of life anime. It follows a small, somewhat dysfunctional  group of characters running a restaurant together. Each with their own little quirky personality.\r\nThe big idea with this show is the plot never really goes anywhere. We simply get taken through some time at the restaraunt. And that's fine. No one says there needs to be a big developed plot. One of my favourite anime (School Rumble) has hardly any closure in it's storyfor 2 full seasons! But without some grander goal, the job of entertaining and captivating the viewer is on the dialogue and interactions of the characters. And this is where I run into my problems with Working!!\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, everyone's got their little quirk. There's the lolicon, the loli, the irrational fear, the deceivingly kind, the calm and collected, the... well you get my point. It's literally a shmorgusboard (that is totally how you spell that word) of archetypes all crammed into one dysfunctional restaurant. But surprisingly, despite what seems like an effort to appeal to all audiences, they manage to fit everyone together fairly well.\\n\\n\r\nSo where do I have a problem with Working!! if they do everything well?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just filler to me. It's just a bunch of episodes which are fairly amusing, and I know if I watch it I'd laugh and enjoy it. But I found it really hard to motivate myself to watch all of it. It just doesn't provide that kind of drive, and is (in my opinion) difficult to marathon, despite only being a half series. The comedy is textbook, so much so that anyone who's watched their fair share of anime can predict the plays before they happen. Some of the jokes get repeated a bit too often, and lose their punch (even the punches lose their punch, baha! You'll get that if you watch it).\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the show itself is fine. And I don't feel bland is the appropriate adjective for Working!!, as it is genuinely entertaining. It's just a bit mundane is all.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, you could devote ~280 minutes of your life to far worse than Working!!",

            "content": "This anime is you slice of life anime, where the main character isn't the only strange person in the story. Every character has its individuality that makes it unique. I laughed so hard during this anime that I couldn't breathe!\r\nThe main character S\u014dta Takanashi, is a 16 year old boy who is infatuated with cute things, and while walking to home one day, he bumps into a small girl who happens to be one  year older but has the appearance of a elementary schooler! Her name is Popura Taneshima, and she is handing out flyers for hiring employees to help at the restaurant sheworks at. He accepts her offer since she is cute and small, but soon finds out there is more to it than meets the eye. \\n\\n\r\nHe meets his fellow coworkers, Ky\u014dko Shirafuji, an ex delinquent boss, who is now the Manager of Waganaria, the name of the restaurant. Yachiyo Todoroki, a 20 year old girl who carries around a katana and has an almost lesbian-like love for the manager. Jun Sat\u014d, an imposing 20 year old who is secretely in love with Yachiyo, but knows that Yachiyo likes Kyoko. Hiroomi S\u014dma, a laid back character who often blackmails his fellow coworkers to do his work, but does it kindly, not menacingly. Mahiru Inami, a girl who has a severe case of androphobia, fear of men, and often hits the main character on a daily basis. Other characters include Hy\u014dgo Otoo and Aoi Yamada, Otoo being the head of the place, and most of the time out looking for his missing wife, and Aoi being a young girl who ran away from home and was found by Otoo, altough through entire story denies she has.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is your average slice of life theme with a few twists that make it more original. Art is so good, I have no complaints! I sometime here random beeps and whistles in the anime, of which i don't know the source, but it doesnt happen often, so I usually ignore it. The characters are good, but sometimes i wish Sota would just hold back a punch or dodge one at least! I laughed so hard I almost crapped my pants, so enjoyment is awesome! my overall would be a 9.5/10",

I didn't like the first episode because it felt like it was going to be a super heavy lolicon because of emphasis on Popura's shortness and Takanashi's love of well...children. I meandered through the first couple episodes, all grumbles and eye rolls. \r\nSomewhere around episode 3 or 4 I started enjoying things, as other characters got involved, like Takanashi's family, which is great, and Inami in general, who I think is a great character. By episode 8, I was fully invested and loving it, forgetting all of my initial worries. \r\nAll in all I thought itwas a good slice of life in the end, not earth-shattering, but fun to pass the time, with enough characters that you'll find at least one to like. A good filler show for chill summers.",

            "content": "My best friend and I were actually looking forward to Working!! A lot when we were getting ready to watch it. We thought that it would be a slice of life series we would enjoy so much....but it fell apart and for my friend and I there was one BIG problem. The main female character is supposed to be Popura (Poplar) Taneshima...it even says so on her information. The role of the main female character though seems to go over to Mahiru Inami....and that didn't go over well with us. The series starts and Popura needs to find someone else to work at the restaurantshe works at and ends up finding the main male character Souta Takanashi and bringing him along. He takes the job and then meets all of the quirky characters who work there where not one single person is normal but the characters personalities is one of the things that makes the series good, nobody is the same. Though there are again problems with this. Popura who is SUPPOSED to be the main girl character is very small and always called an elementary student...which makes no sense with her character design because to be blunt she has a large chest which I think obviously shows she's seventeen. Also they make her seem too childish and dumb at times when she herself said she's a science student and good at math so there's no WAY she's dumb. But again instead the role of main female character seems to go to Inami...who must be the most annoying character. She suffers from a phobia of men and has extreme strength so when she meets Souta she punches him again...and again...and AGAIN and it gets awfully repetitive with her doing the same thing. She's also one of those characters who blushes at everything and stutters and is overly obsessed with chest sizes. I personally couldn't stand how much the series focused on her, it literally gave both my friend and I a head ache. However all of the other characters even the not so important ones are great and really add feeling into the show. For those who are fans of Daisuke Ono, Jun Fukuyama and Hiroshi Kamiya all three of them have a great roll in the series. The humor in the series is great for the most part except the parts that are supposed to be \"funny\" or \"cute\" with Inami. For my friend and this series started as a 9 on episode one...then it just went down from there but it's not TERRIBLE it's just not the best. i love the opening and ending, i love the art, and I love most of the characters. My friend and I still plan to watch season two which will hopefully focus more on who the ACTUAL main female character is.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS AHEAD*** (hahahahhaha, spoilers in SoL, hahahha) \r\nWhat do you call occurrence whereas every single one of your side characters is more interesting than your main girl? It's called having shit taste so kill her off and focus on more interesting stuff you wanker. \r\nThat about sums up my initial thoughts after finishing Working!!. And now, let's go in deep, because stating the obvious is never enough. \r\nThis anime is 100% episodic without any underlying plot whatsoever - unless you mean to tell me that their \"attempts\" to \"cure\" Inami's \"illness\" can be considered underlying plot - meaning that there is no story. Every episodedeals with different issues or whatever, some introducing new characters, butchering existing ones and so on. So I won't rant about the story mainly because there's literally nothing to rant about. Meh. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound were fair - not exceptional, just fair. There are some animation issues here and there but for the most part it was consistent in being above average. One that really stuck with me though happens in the last episode, near the beginning, when Inami is preparing for a \"date\". The mirror shot of her is so godawful I have a feeling 13y old intern animated it. \\n\\n\r\nSound is a tad bit worse than art overall, but it wasn't half-bad. Music is meh, opening and ending weren't particularly catching either, but voice actors held up their part so it's all fine and good. \\n\\n\r\nNow that we moved from the shit I don't really care about, let's talk some characters. Mmm. Tasty. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off we have Inami. I'm not one of the people who find abusive comedy funny, or abusive characters funny or interesting, so you can already tell this bitch didn't really sit well with me. I figured she would be the first girl to receive and arc, it would take like 3 episodes or something to resolve her issues, but god fucking no it had to take up the entire god fucking season. I mean, holy crap what the flying fuck? Her character is flat out not interesting, nor are her problems. First off, they're not represented in a serious matter so that you are given a chance to actually explore mentality of people with this illness, and when it comes to comedy it's just the same fucking joke over and over and over again. How many times can you find a guy getting punched in the face funny? Just how many fucking times? \\n\\n\r\nShe's literally my primary reason for disliking this show. Strip away her fucking illness and she's your everyday fucking wall. Instead of having thrown her into the background after resolving her \"issues\" within first 4 episodes, we're strung along for 13 episodes of this mayhem-bringing bitch that most people actually find TOLERABLE, FUNNY and INTERESTING. Why? Because she supposedly likes our MC or because she can't help but hit guys? What kind of a shitty ass excuse is that? I literally put more effort into my high school math than she did into \"curing\" her \"illness\". For 13 whole fucking episodes there is NO progress. No. Fucking. Progress. Watching her punch our MC, either due to her \"illness\" or \"shyness\" over and over again isn't fucking funny. It's just annoying, unnecessary and irrelevant. Instead of focusing onto the far superior side characters, who are better in virtually every aspect you can think of, this bitch takes so much screen time you begin to realize that there's no way that the writer isn't a heavy M. Take any, and I mean ANY side character who's gotten more than 30 seconds of screen time, and there would have been far more interesting to explore. Starting with other employees to MC's fucking sisters. Fuck. This. Type. Of. A. Character. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're gonna pretend like her problems are fucking serious, don't use her problems as fucking comedic relief moments in your shitty excuse of a story. And no, 9th episode did abso-fucking-loutely nothing for me. Yes, her father was a cunt, so what? In any sane world she wouldn't be working part-time in a fucking FAMILY restaurant - she'd be locked up in a fucking asylum because that's where she fucking belongs. \\n\\n\r\nNow, most people will obviously rant about the side characters. Why? Because they're underdeveloped. And why are they underdeveloped? Because that bitch takes about every inch of screen time she can fucking take. Every single side characters they introduced fell right with me and, episode after fucking episode, I kept hoping they'd expand more on them, but why the fuck would they do that when they can focus their attention to the psychotic excuse of a fucking character. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as I ranted on about the show, I actually had a fun time with Working!!. As I said, my primary source of disdain is the main girl and each time when the show would focus on the interactions of side characters I had a blast. The reason, though, that I was never really able to get into them is because they virtually get 0 development and focus. The most you'll find here is a dude confessing to girl, which is then completely, and I mean COMPLETELY disregarded as the focus moves back onto our favorite psychotic failed-abortion. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love shows with abusive MC, kind of like Louise in ZnT, you'll have cum stains all over your monitor after you've finished watching this. If, on other hand, you'd at least want some kind of fucking development and seriousness regarding the \"issue\", you'll have lost all your hope halfway through. \\n\\n\r\nktxbai.",

            "content": "I really really wish my workplace has loli girls, girls with swords, girls who punches men, manager who slacks off and an annoying girl who lives in the attic of our store (if we have one). I will have the most easiest money-making job ever. \r\n[Story]: (?/10)\r\nThe show is set in a family restaurant named Wagnaria in the northern Japanese prefecture of Hokkaido. Souta, a new employee in Wagnaria, now works part-time among the restaurant's high-spirited, mysterious, yet cool staffers.\r\nBefore I get on to my review, I will no longer rate the \"Story\" category when reviewing slice-of-life anime. Most slice-of-life animes out there basically hasa non-existing plot so it's not fair to rate the story with a low score. My Overall rating will be mostly based on Enjoyment and Characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the show is the main protagonist gets a new part-time job from a loli 17 year old girl who he has never met before. From there, he meets his co-workers who are all a bunch of weirdos but those weirdos are the reason why the show is funny in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the show's fanservice is non-existent. There's absolutely no fanservice...in a slice of life show. I never thought this day would come. There was one hotspring episode but there was no scene of them going inside the hotspring and getting naked. It just time-skipped\\n\\n\r\nI want to talk about the comedy of the show before I wrap this category up. The comedy is......decent but not great. The problem is it got too repetitive. For example, Inami constantly punches Saito because of her \"disorder\". This was funny for the first few episodes but it got too repetitive. I admit though, I was still laughing in the second half of the show when they were still using the joke but not as much as the first time I saw it.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying the jokes were bad, however. Most of the jokes in the show were pretty funny like Houma constantly blackmailing his co-workers, Popura being made fun of because her size, Sota's creepy obsession, etc. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe visuals and animation of the show looks pretty decent. The character design looks average and the character expressions are f*cking glorious. The expressions that they make are hilarious. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (7/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fairly average to say the least. They weren't memorable to listen to nor were they forgettable. It's a decent soundtrack. Now for the OP and ED theme song.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"SOMEONE ELSE\" by Popura Taneshima, Mahiru Inami, and Yachiyo Todoroki and the ED theme songs are \"Heart no Edge ni Idomou Go to Heart Edge\" by Souta Takanashi, Jun Satou, and Souma Hiroomi and \"Golden Day\" by Mahiru Inami. The OP theme song is pretty catchy as hell. I mean, I don't love the song and there are times where I want to skip the OP but can't. It's very catchy and I sometimes hum the song. Someone needs to help me stop. I'm not a fan of male J-Pop band so hearing the 1st ED theme song makes me cringe. The 2nd ED theme song, however, is a lot better than the 1st ED theme song and it's unfortunate that it only played 1 episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are....ehh, I guess they're ok. I didn't hate any of the VA's here. The VA that I love the most is Yamada's VA. I just love her voice when she acts all childish towards her co-workers. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nNo.High.School.Students.Finally...Oh wait, most characters are high school students but what makes this different from other slice-of-life animes is the fact that the show doesn't take place in a high school setting. It takes place in a work-place environment. Just like most slice-of-life out there, the show relies on character interactions to move the plot...I mean, the show forward and for the show to have a comedy. When these characters get together, it can lead to funny situations. Not only that, but you also see minor character development. By watching the show from the first episode to the last episode, you will see some notable changes in the characters and these changes are very obvious when it comes to Inami.  \\n\\n\r\nTime to introduce the MAIN characters. First, we have Sota who is a lolicon but he said he's not because he also loves cute and small things like pets, those cute toys, and those little germ-like creatures..I forget what they were called. Then, we have Poplar who is a 17 year old teenage girl but she is somehow the height of a kid. This is why she gets made fun of most of the time. Then, we have Inami who is suffering from a phobia called \"androphobia\" and this is the first I knew of this phobia. Her phobia causes her to become scared of men and punch them if they get near her. Sato suffers the most because of her phobia. Apparently, her dad is an overprotective/pedophile/perverted asshole  nd told lies to her daughter (back when she was just a kid) about men and how \"scary\" they were.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the female casts are Kyouko, Yamada and Yachiyo. Kyouka is the manager of the restaurant and all she does in the store is eat and be a lazy ass. Yamada is a character later introduced in the show and she is apparently \"lost\". More like she ran away because she probably finds her parents annoying or something. She now lives in the attic of the restaurant. Yachiyo is a girl who was constantly bullied back when she was a little kid, hence the reason why she carries a sword. She likes making food, particularly parfait, to Kyouko. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the male casts are Jun and Hiroomi. I'll skip Jun because there's nothing interesting about him. Hiroomi, on the other hand, is one of the most interesting characters in the show. The guy likes to blackmail his co-workers. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     \\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7/10)\\n\r\nI'm a fan of slice-of-life animes but for whatever reason, I didn't enjoy this show that much when compared to other slice-of-life animes out there. By the time I'm writing this review, I haven't watched second season yet and I probably won't for a long time. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Working!!\" is a decent slice-of-life anime. It's not particularly the best slice-of-life show but it is watchable. The show didn't have the best comedy out there but it still made me laugh despite the constant uses of the same joke. The character interactions is, honestly, the best part of the show but that's pretty much it. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7.1/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Visuals and Animation\\n\r\n+Catchy Opening Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Great Character Interactions and Minor Character Development\\n\r\n+Decent Comedy\\n\r\n+Fanservice-Free show\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Jokes gets repetitive",

            "content": "Wow, can you guess? Rabb2t reviews another anime!\r\nStory: The story and plot of Working!! is much like the previous Slice of Life animes that I've reviewed. It has charm in the details that are part of the story, but overall the main story isn't much. It follows random antics that occur throughout the year in a restaurant. However, this still allows for lots of charm to be put into a plot, which Working!! does pretty well. The small details in plot lead into character, but occasionally some do not, like the scenes where Souta crossdresses. You expect something like that to be a recurring gag,but it becomes a plot device that helps build character.\\n\\n\r\nArt: For something from 2010, the art is actually quite good. It's shown a bit of age, but the art still has some effects and visuals that look pretty good by today's standards. Some of the light effects look great, and the occasional chibi character fits the mood of the anime. Overall, however, it's pretty standard.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound in Working!! is something that I liked a lot. Something I found to like hearing every episode is the reactions the characters had to each other. Souta reacting to him getting punched by Inami was always something funny, and her reactions somehow never got old. The chill attitude of Satou also helped bring out his character too. Music wise, I found the background music to be something I really liked in particular. The piano accompanied the setting of a family diner well, and the tame drumset also allowed for an overall chill and quiet mood to settle in. The opening of this anime was also a treat, being upbeat and getting you ready for the antics of the episode, and the ending's rock and roll style was a nice touch to ease you out of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in this anime were pretty charming, although I did feel they could have used a bit more development, which probably was helped in the next 2 seasons. All the characters have distinct personalities, but outside of maybe 2 or 3 main qualities, they were a bit static. For instance, the manager. She starts off as someone who doesn't work in general, but then she's told to try to do some work. That fails, and she ends up being the same as she was in the beginning. The only things that seem to change happens after the introduction of Yamada. After she comes to work at the restaurant, all sorts of new things happen. The unrequited love Satou has for Todoroki is shown, Inami's androphobia is slightly lessened, etc. This all allows for a good basis of change that's more for series with more than 2 seasons, which I think works for this series, but it's something I'm not entirely used to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Let me say that I enjoyed this anime. It has distinct characters all clashing and mixing together to create a dysfunctional cast of oddballs, which all create some funny scenes. I can't say much else except for that although characters were more on the building stage, I still found the show to have a charm that was enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: So, what's my overall thoughts on this show? I found it charming, with personality being shown in every character and scene. It's something extremely light-hearted, being a show that really anyone could watch. It's not too serious, and humour is not all over the place. I'd recommend this anime for those who enjoy Slice of Life + Comedy duos. Anyways, those are my thoughts, so see for yourself!",

            "content": "This will be a review of all the seasons, including the 14th episode (1 hour special) of the last season\r\nI'll start off with saying this : i recommend this anime pretty much for everyone, i truly conciser it to be one of the best in the genre (whatever genre that is). \r\nNow let's go down to why i consider it great, as well as why it got the score it did (around 8/10)\r\nThe \"Working!!\" series is a really fun and pleasant watch, unlike a lot of other anime there's pretty much never a dull or boring moment, pretty much all the characters are appealing andeasy to relate to (the least appealing one for me was Minami, but that's before she developed as a character), the comedy is good and the romance actually makes progress, what's kind of rare in most anime from what i saw so far.\\n\\n\r\nNow what's the bad, or rather mediocre part? Well, first off, the art. While its not bad, its not anything special as well, a solid 7 i'd say. The story? Almost nonexistent, most of the anime is about daily interactions and gags between the odd individuals in the show, and that's where most of the fun factor comes from. Other than that there's the fact its overall pretty mellow and smeared : the show is pretty much evenly spread out between light romance, light comedy, story and daily life, so while it almost always has something to entertain and interest you with, the focus on each of the elements is very light, so don't expect 'rolling on the floor' level comedy or amazing romance... Same goes for the other elements. They are there in moderation, and they are all pretty good, but not good enough to compete with shows dedicated to those elements specifically, rather the show's best point is bringing them all together to bring all the elements into a fun combo.\\n\\n\r\nSo, again, i recommend this to anyone, especially those who are looking for something \"Fun\" to watch, i think this anime is best described by that exact word.",

The funniest part of the show would actually be the opening video. \\n\r\nThat is best part of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSomething that would have been nice that would fit into the plot would be that because of all the hectic things happening at the restaurant was there they were at risk of closing. \\n\r\nI mean how many plates broke in this show anyways, haha. \\n\r\nInstead we are given hints that the manager just extorts people for money. \\n\r\nSince she is a former delinquent but that isn\u2019t enough to suffice for that. \\n\\n\r\nSo I am torn on giving this show a 6 or a 7.\\n\r\nThe story is the lowest end here with the Sound and Art being the high end.\\n\r\nBut is just an opening enough for me to consider this show above average? I think not. So I would have to rate this show a 6 out of 10. \\n\r\nThe show has two more seasons to build on anything but the way this show ended doesn't give me any promise. \\n\\n",

It's so good that the comedy is funny and hilarious. It got me hooked after two episodes.\r\nThe biggest plus is the comedy. It is one of the funniest anime I've ever seen. Worth the laughs and the good time of each character. It felt like I'm part of the staff. The romance is also present and it is good and funny at the same time. The characters are great and they have given proper screentime. TheOP song is so good. I love listening to that all night. The story is pretty amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIn my conclusion, it is my favorite slice of life anime. I highly recommend this anime if you have nothing to watch and tired of seeing action, ecchi and other genre. It is worth your time.",

            "content": "Wagnaria. Better known as Working!! was a very fresh intake on the slice of life field. It had great potential to be one of the best and unique SOLs out there but sadly later on that potential was severely wasted. Beneath the Moe and fun characters lay a sadly large amount of boring times as well.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nI'd say it was good. It as mentioned before was a very unique take on the SOL genre as very few of them ever go beyond the walls of high school and this was about working (as if the name didn't mention that :P). It started off really wellwith our 'better than most other' MC Souta Takanashi joining the small but successful (?) restaurant Wagnaria. Throw in a bunch of complete wierdos and you've got your story. Being a SOL I didn't expect much story and that's exactly what happened. Inami's androphobia was severely overused as a gag as well as a plot point and personally I grew fed up of it. At first it wasn't that bad as it was mainly about Takanashi and Poplar but unfortunately the folks decided to make resident kickboxing chapion Inami the main focus. I'm perfectly fine with TsunDeres hitting boys from time to time don't get me wrong, but for this anime as well as many others it was TOO MUCH. As I said before the story later on was a disappointing set of androphobic tropes which I got tired of. You here for the story? Enjoy the first few episodes then. Nothing beyond is good...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good I could say. Although a bit blurry at times (I watched it at 720p and yet it happened) and so a few scenes felt tired or washed out IYKWIM. Other than that the character design was great except for Inami. She somehow didn't look good at all in almost all the scenes, perhaps because the folks didn't know how to  ake her face seen good so they put blushes on her face THROUGH THE WHOLE DURATION OF THE ANIME. To think A-1 pictures made this...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA well chosen cast thankfully boosted the anime's overall appeal in the sound category. The characters were well voiced and sounded perfect for their looks. Poplar and even Kyouko perfected the moe aspect of their characters and Takanashi's voice fit well with his above average personality. The OP was terribly catchy and a joy to listen to while the ED was quite forgettable... Bonus points for that amazing OP though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI was severely tempted to rate it an 8 but alas, why did A-1 pictures change the MC from Poplar to Inami I'll never know, what I do know is it had a negative effect. Let's start with our MC, Takanashi was thankfully a refreshing take as well on the megane wearing dense MC type in which he was at least one or two steps ahead of the other MCs of his type especially because there was a specific reason to what he did everytime... (Remembers disappointing last arc...) well ALMOST everytime. Moving on to Poplar, I felt bad for her mainly because the focus was taken away from a good character to a complete disgrace (looking at you Ms KickBoxer), Poplar was the Moe face of the anime and her personality as well was well done, made me say \"Sasuga Moe desho!\" as she wasn't only a Moe piece of glass to be decorated, she had a sensible personality within her as well. Inami was a complete disgrace of a Tsundere, 'nuff said. Her androphobia was enough to make me hate her completely throughout the anime. Satou... Satou was imo the best character of the whole anime. Period. He wasn't dense, he wasn't generic. He was the character you always wished for to be an MC. Yashiyo and Kyouko were great as well for comedic purposes but they didn't serve much of a purpose and Yamada and Souma were ok as well. Only one character should have been killed off, and that is our unfortunate UFC champion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless being a SOL it had it's sweet and fun moments. Working was an anime that though story wise I dragged my tired and fed up self onward, comedy wise and SOL wise it was well done and I enjoyed that aspect of the anime. I came expecting a half decent story and well, I got what I wanted to no use complaining. It was different. And that's what I wanted and expected the most. Which is the reason I rate it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.6\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Working was a refreshing take on the SOL genre and it had great potential to be something better but sadly it reverted to a shadow of itself, and though it didn't fall back hard, it certainly hurt it's chances to be better received. I myself am shocked it rounded off to 8 as it certainly felt a 7 to me. And if a high rater like me thought it to be somewhere between 7-8 then God knows what the normal raters would rate. Sends me chills up my spine. In the end, Working is an anime that can be really enjoyed by those who are looking for an SOL that's something different from most other anime in it's genre. Definitely a fun anime to try out (if you have the time to try out new stuff!)\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Once again, a boy takes the crown as best character, Satou best boy <3. He was the perfect husbando!!!",

            "content": "Now here's an anime that really made me question... \"What do I look for in an anime.\" Up until now... I have generally followed a simple rule of thumb that states, \"Slice of life is generally terrible.\" And have stuck to that moral for quite a long time (with a few small exceptions). So I have really no idea what compelled me to watch a show that appeared to be, in all aspects, a 100% authentic slice of life, right down to the core. And watch it I did...  After 3 or 4 episodes, it dawned on me that I was actually enjoying it.Stunned by this revelation, I decided to delve in a little deeper and see why I liked this particular anime; if perhaps I could actually enjoy slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nSo anyways... here's Working!!. As most any anime with this kind of standing goes, plot is pretty irrelevant. Its not trying to convey a moral or story, its just an anime that's meant to give us a good time, maybe a laugh, or some form of nostalgic feeling. What really matters is the characters... and whether you can a). be entertained by them or b). relate to them. For me, I was actually fairly refreshed with the characters of Working!!. They weren't exactly standout-ish characters, but they had a fairly original feeling about them (even though their general outline has been done before). I'll give you an example of what I mean. When I first saw Poplar (the short one) I immediatly said \"She is going to have a inferiority complex, and every joke around her will be about how she is shorter than she should be\". And lo and behold I was mostly right (although around about episode 8 this starts to change). But I was oddly amused with its approach in this field. Rather than making fun of the fact that she was short, it more made fun of the fact that she tried to be big. That may not seem like much... but it made a world of difference for me.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every character in the show did this to me. To put it simply... they were fairly generic characters, but were put in a different light than they usually are portrayed as. Another example is the main? girl Inami. At first you think... bah its that girl... u know the one who hits the guy repeatedly for no real good reason. But, whats fairly different about Inami, is that she really doesn't want to hit men... she just does out of instinct. They even give a kinda okay explanation as to why she must hit men, and it helped me a lot in warming up to her character. All in all... the cast isn't going to be winning awards anytime soon... but I found them a much more able bunch than I first gave them credit for.\\n\\n\r\nHmmm.... well there's not much let to say after that long winded speech on characters. As I said, characterization is really the MOST important thing in this slice of life comedy. I can't really say if you'll find it funny or not, cause everyone has a pretty unique sense of comedy... But I personally found the jokes hit and miss. A lot of run on gags get going after a while, and it can get tiring, but it still gave me a couple chuckles every episode.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's my opinion on Working!!. Its not a spectacular, and you could easily hate it a lot more than I did... But for what its worth, I found it quite enjoyable, and it helped re-kindle a interest in anime that I thought was starting to die out. If you do watch it, at least give it a bit of a chance before you decide your opinion on it.\\n\\n\r\nOh and one final note, this is the ONLY anime where I have ever caught myself softly attempting to sing along with the opening... Its that annoyingly catchy.",

            "content": "\"A slice of life!\" would completely explain this anime in a short and simple notation. It's basically about the antics of the employees of a certain family restaurant with having no particular plot whatsoever. It really gives that feel of life as a working student. Of course, watching people work for the next 30 minutes wouldn't be so exciting.... So how about this? We add an androphobic girl that can turn your face inside-out, a teenager who is obsessed with small things, a manager that doesn't do zilch, a shady person who knows everybody's secrets, a dumbfounded, lethal waitress that adores the manager, and apoor cook who's stuck in the friend zone, and a bunch of other weird characters, and mix them all in strange situations as they do their work at the same time. Sound good?\\n\\n\r\nI honestly can't explain Working!! without mentioning the characters that make up the backbone of the entire anime. There isn't really much of a plot in Working!! So as a slice of life anime, it's a little strange. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it. Although I did encounter some problems along the way.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, There isn't really a plot in this. It's just about well... people working. Sometimes the plot form the episodes connect, sometimes they don't. It's a pretty light anime, so don't expect any deep plot-lines. There are \"action\" scenes though... But their a little one-sided *chuckle*\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty decent as well. The character's were draw pretty well, though it's not really anything special. \\n\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs were pretty good, but once again, not that great. \\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, characters.\\n\r\nWorking!! wouldn't be anything special if it wasn't for the characters. This is probably the only thing that separates it from other \"working\" anime. They are all most certainly unique and you will never have any trouble differentiating them either. The character development its done cleanly so there won't be that many confusing parts.\\n\\n\r\nThere is something that bothers me though. I don't know why, but I have this sort of loathing feeling for Takanashi. I really don't know why. He just gives me this strange, heavy sensation. Oh well, it's probably nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a pretty fun anime. You will definitely not get enough of the crew's antics. I recommend this for those who want something light and smooth to watch.",

Almost no one is normal\r\n+ The situational humor really appealed to me\r\n+ Visual gags and reaction shots play out well in certain context.\r\n+ The important roles get the some exposition.\r\nCONS/What I disliked:\r\n- Not a strong plot. This is a Slice-of-Life show after all\r\n- It's cuteness can get overindulgent\r\n- These characters aren't necessarily \"flat\", but they are just 2-Dimensional for the most part. Example (Sp) Inaminever stops punching or Kyoko wont stop being excessively  lazy , etc.\\n\r\n- (Sp) The last minute introduction of Maya Matsumoto caught me off guard and I still don't get why Yamada even exists. Not enough info about her and overall found her unappealing.\\n\r\n- No real resolution. It kinda just ends. (I'm not taking S2 into account)\\n\\n\r\nFinal Note:\\n\r\nLighthearted is a good word to describe this show. This isn't a bad show by any means, but it doesn't try to aim for being great either. \\n\\n\r\nRecommends:\\n\r\nFans of the Slice-of Life Genre\\n\r\nPeople that like characters that look Kawaii as F***!!!",

It really is.\r\nOur main cast is the staff of a restaurant, usually focusing around main lead and the eventual pairing he has with one of the other staff members.\r\nOf course, each have their unique traits, habits, work ethics and ideas. Typical usage of the many character tropes we come to expect in anime.\r\nBut the charisma and interactions between characters is what makes this whole show an enjoyable roll ofcomedy. Mostly surrounding their job and working at the restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nIt differs in the sense that sitcoms usually have one episode as its own, whereas things will continue from episode to episode for about 4 of them. This does allow character progression and building.\\n\\n\r\nIt's great they have this too, because there are so many things that each person has that can't really be done up so simple and short.\\n\\n\r\nLove at the work place. Dealing with customers. Balancing work and home. Trying to be professional but stay themselves at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the cast that makes it all fun. The plot points aren't heavy or critical, but they do allow characters to have some freedom in what they do.\\n\\n\r\nI never tired of seeing them work on the issue of one of the staff have a phobia of men. Holy shit does it make me grin.\\n\\n\r\nFrom season 1 to 3, we learn and get to love each character and their lives in and out of work. And yes, I'd say it gets better as it ages and it all resolves to the end too. Makes me sad I won't see more of it.",

            "content": "tl;dr Pretty vanilla show overall, and I did not feel it offered anything especially unique or memorable. At the same time it was very enjoyable, and I think that aspect of Working!! is really playing to its strengths in developing something unique in its own way.\r\nStory: 7\r\nOverall plot was fairly typical, and nothing was exceptionally unrealistic (barring things that typically beg some suspension disbelief to drive any series). I can't say anything particularly stood out to me as a prime story point, but I also can't really say there was anything I particularly felt was done poorly.\r\nStill, to me the story merits a 7 becauseI felt those traits were intentional. In an anime literally titled \"Working!!\" it made sense to me that things were portrayed in a fairly vanilla light. Some scenes could have easily been made significantly more dramatic, but in some sense that would feel too typical, especially because in real life, things do not slow down with dramatic music and closeups on people's faces. When something happens in a restaurant, people typically kinda just look over from their seats.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nUse of chibi images and dramatic backgrounds didn't feel force nor overused. Nothing especially notable about style in my opinion, but it was consistent in portrayal of characters and such. Consistency alone without doing anything particularly disruptive to me is worth a rating of \"Good\" here. Following the idea above that the vanilla characteristics of this series work to its benefit as it represents working, I feel similarly here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nNo particular background track stood out to me, and I tend to make an effort to pay attention to something like that, though I will say I found the opening theme oddly catchy. It may feel inconsistent for me to give a 6 to yet another fairly plain, typical aspect of this show, but I will defend the rating of \"Fair\" with noting that in the presence of a work of fiction (namely an animation that puts together moving visuals and sound), I personally feel there is some responsibility to do something that adds flavor or mood to scenes. Still, nothing was disruptive or poorly done in my opinion, so maintaining the overall feel of this show by not trying to do anything particularly flashy pushes this above average for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nCharacters didn't seem to break the mold much and they all sort of felt to remain just as you expect; however, there was definitely some character development as the series progressed--enough that I am confident in saying the characters were good. It felt to me like how you spend a year or so in school with someone and even without much interaction you feel you get to know them better.\\n\\n\r\nI felt this characteristic augmented this series in a lot of ways. Even so, what makes me leave it at 7 rather than an 8 is there were definitely times when I was just personally irked by a couple characters. Not necessarily by them not being well done or acting out of character, but in the sense that I just personally would be very annoyed if I were anyone in that restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8, Overall: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis review follows the second time I watched this series after forgetting I watched it at all a while back and only remembering some character traits. I would say I enjoyed it quite a lot, especially considering with the overall atmosphere of this show it was a good fit for watching when I was in the mood for a slice of life type of kickback. I personally really appreciate when a series can be consistent the whole way through, and this did a very good job of that.",

            "content": "The \"Working!!\" series is one of those anime's like Azumanga Daioh and School Rumble that doesn't quite have a central plot/storyline, but instead focuses on the daily lives and interactions between the characters.  In this case it follows the daily lives of several part time employees of a small restaurant.  Now if you haven't seen Azumanga Daioh or School Rumble, having no plot may sound like a turn off, but the writers did a good job with character design where each one has their own personality and quirks.  With the anime centering around their daily lives at the restaurant it makes fora very enjoyable and entertaining workplace dynamic.  \\n\r\nOn top of this, this anime is also a slight Romantic Comedy as some romance will develop between some of the characters through the course of the series.  One of the things I liked about this series is that its not a very heavy Rom Com where the emotional scenes aren't very heavy and dramatic.  Its a Comedy first and a Rom Com/Drama second.  Not that I don't like a healthy dose of drama and heavy feels and getting my heart ripped out when one of the characters gets their heart broken.  But by toning down drama, Working was able to maintain a level of levity and humor that made it overall more enjoyable.\\n\r\nThe writers also did a good job of giving the viewer a satisfying amount of closure at the end.  More often then not an anime will allude to two characters possibly living happily ever after, only to end on an ambiguous note of whether they actually ended up together.  Working is one of the few anime's where at the end I wasn't left wondering whether a certain characters feelings reciprocated by their love interest.\\n\r\nWhile I very much enjoyed Working it is not without its faults.  There were a couple episodes that I felt dragged and were a bit boring.  I came very close to fast forwarding through those episodes.  Also the characters can be a bit silly sometimes as the comedy is a bit slap stick.  Some scenes can come off a bit cheesy.  Aside from that though, over all Working was a great series.  If you can power through a couple slow episodes and look past some cheesy moments you'll find this anime very fun and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - if you are looking for a light comedy with a bit of Rom Com, I highly recommend watching this anime\\n",

            "content": "That Popura army from the opening can invade my country any day.\r\nStory:\r\nWorking is a romantic comedy that didn\u2019t forget that it\u2019s a comedy, which is an accomplishment in itself. The main focus is on the humor, though the romance part is featured prominently, especially in the latter episodes. As a non-fan of tsundere antics, I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of the man-hitting girl plot that takes the majority of airtime, but I have to say, they did a good job in playing it equally straight and for laughs. It also works because the characters make it work, but that is something I\u2019m gonna discuss alittle later. Something else I found Working did astonishingly well was the romantic development. There was no crushing-into-each-other-at-the-first-day-of-school kind of meeting between the characters, but specific events that made them feel the way they do. While we\u2019re at it, the setting this time is NOT school, but a restaurant. Nowadays, that is almost revolutionary. But all that good writing would be for nothing if the jokes aren\u2019t good. So, are they? Yes, most of them. Inami punching Takanashi gets old real quick, but everything else was really funny.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAs it\u2019s the case in almost every comedy anime, the character design is rather simplistic, but as I\u2019ve already stated a million times, that\u2019s absolutely okay, as it usually works well with the comedic effects. This also counts for Working, so I have no reason to complain. What really threw me off-guard however, was the high amount of movement this anime had. The characters are nearly always in motion, which looked quite amazing.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening song is the reason I started watching this anime. It\u2019s incredibly catchy and absolutely hits my personal taste. The ending song was also pretty good, as was the episode 9 special ending, which was surprisingly sweet. The voice acting was good all throughout the cast, everybody was able to hit their characters the way they should be.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAt first I thought that Popura would be the female lead. I mean, she is cute and funny, what is not to like? But because of the romantic developments slowly moving into the focus, she was cast aside more and more. The lack of screen time almost turned her into a one joke-character, but fortunately, the writing was good enough to not let that happen. The actual main characters, Takanashi and Inami, were a likeable couple the viewer can root for to get together. As I already mentioned, the violence joke got old after a while, but the way it was handled made it bearable and turned it into an at least interesting plot point. Shout out to Mahirus Dad for being a worse father than Gendo Ikari. The secondary couple (Satou and Todoroki) was surprisingly sweet. Satou is an obvious expy of Sanji, but a lot more down to earth and not woman-crazy, even in the face of the one he likes. Todoroki was a sweet girl with a violence trigger when it comes to Kyouko-san and easy to fool. An interesting mix that worked really well within these two. I hope they get more time and development in the next season (which I\u2019m sure they will). The rest of the Wagnaria staff was also quite entertaining. Souma, the manipulative bastard, Yamada, the annoying little brat and antidote to Souma and the already mentioned cutie pie Popura. The only one who fell a little flat was Kyouko, who turned out to be the aforementioned one joke-character. The rest of the supporting cast did what they needed to, but weren\u2019t all that memorable.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWorking was a very funny watch, more than I expected. Although, I don\u2019t really know what I expected\u2026but anyway. The characters were all either very likeable or unimportant enough to look over, the humor worked out most of the time and the romantic developments were written well and believable. If there\u2019s something I\u2019d feel the show could improve on, it would be less punching and more of the other characters (for me, more Popura please). If you are tired of the high school setting or simply want a romantic comedy that is both, romantic and funny, Working is what I'd recommend.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8.8/10",

            "content": "Working!! is a slice-of-life anime about the employees of a family restaurant, Wagnaria. And... that's just about it for the story. There's not much plot (if there is any), and for the first few episodes, each scene practically has nothing to do with the next, filled with the most random conversations. The characters are introduced, and it's as if the 'plot' is being set up. For the second half of the anime, this is when the episodes seem more linear, giving each episode a solid story, instead of giving it just the random scenes we saw in the start. The story seems to start tofocus on Inami's phobia of men and how Takanashi tries to help her overcome it. Despite the fact that it now has a story that it sticks to, it's still a very light-hearted, and never touches into anything deeper than comedy. The plot never moves, and even after the last episodes, nothing has changed between the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. The character designs are all fantastic, and I'm amazed by how much detail the animators give each character to give them their personality. The movements are very fresh and crisp, making the characters seem as lively as they should be. The anime showcases some lively and upbeat songs as well, and while it's nothing unique, it can be quite catchy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the main focus of the show. We are given their personalities and some basic background, and the show works from there. We never find out anything 'deep' about them, but in a light-hearted comedy like this, that's justified. All the characters all have one (or two) strange quirks to them that makes them unique from everyone else, and it seems as if every reaction they show is based on this quirk. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is quite enjoyable if you're looking for something to rest your mind on from all the stress of your day. It's refreshing to watch, and it seems to give you the illusion that there's no such thing as real-life problems (unless you think a co-worker hitting you all the time because you're a guy is a plausible thing to worry about). If you enjoy shows that make you feel less stressed and helps you forget about everyday problems, then you will enjoy this. For example, if you liked anime like Azumanga Daioh and Minami-ke, you will enjoy this.",

Nevertheless, for a person who demands a solid storyline, this may just not be your ideal anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really captivated my mind and heart about this anime is the character development which can be seen through Izami and Sota and its gags XD which are kinda funny as it is something that someone of my age can relate to. Working!! offers a genre different from the mainstream manga/anime which results to elation for some who are really bored from the \"fighting and acquiring of new skills\" such as Bleach and Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line is that this is a spectacular and a \"getaway\" anime for those who are bored and want something different. Although it may seem very short, I felt that 13 episodes are more than enough, since the author will eventually run out of gags and repetitions will cause it to lose its novelty. Working!! is a heartwarming anime which somehow relieves stress to young people with its liveliness and sarcastic jokes. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, i truly enjoyed watching Working!! and somehow feel sad to finish it so quick. \\n\\n",

            "content": "As it is with all things, there is a certain stereotype that goes with each different type of anime out there today.  Harems typically toss character out of the window, action/mecha often defy logic and the romance genre generally contains unrealistic scenarios for plot development.  Not to say that this is a necessarily bad thing, of course; they serve their respective categories well.  However it is true that an anime viewer usually goes into a type of show expecting something.  Working!! both followed and diverged from this.\r\n     When it comes to thestorytelling element of this show, it doesn't exactly shine, but that's fine.  A show about part timers and their numerous exploits is bound to be lacking when it comes to plot, and in this case it actually becomes a selling point.  The premise is just enough to set up the characters to have all the fun they possibly can at the workplace.  There is no general cohesive plotline, just a real mish-mash of many moments among the characters.\\n\\n\r\n     The art also wasn't spectacular, but once again this is tolerable.  For an anime that was released in 2010 with what was likely an initially low budget, the artists seem to have done their best.  Character designs are not exactly innovative but they are diverse enough to keep the interest going.  Not to mention that the second season of the anime offered an overhaul on the presentability with improved animation quality.\\n\\n\r\n     Now I'll come out and say this bluntly-the music in this anime is almost subpar.  I am aware of the massive popularity with the first season's opening garnered, but beyond that sound is not used very often to accentuate high points in the show (as few as they are).  All the OP does is set the tone for a bright and bubbly experience, but beyond that it does nothing.\\n\\n\r\n     Despite these inefficiencies, however, I still enjoyed the show, and that was due to the chemistry.  As re-hashed as they may be, the workers of Working!! play off each other very well.  Whether it be a running gag or a sudden punchline, the anime at least does a good job on delivering the comedic aspect of the show.  Upon reflection, I found that the majority of the anime's humor relied heavily of a multitude of running gags; such as the boss's obsession with Yachio's parfait and a punching problem from a certain meek girl.  However, this does not make them dull.  Rather, it shows the quality of said gags since they can be used so often with continued success.\\n\\n\r\n     Overall, Working!! was an enjoyable but slightly flawed anime, though I can't really blame it due to its rather unspectacular premise.  I feel that the creators did well considering what they had to work with.  I give the show a 7/10 overall.\\n\\n\r\n~Kurai Shiko",

( or Wagnaria if you prefer that title)\r\n NOTE : This is only a review for the first season and not the entire series. ( although I'd love to do that)\r\nStory 7/10 - Being a slice-of-life anime , Working! really doesn't have the grandest of stories, but nonetheless it is a good story that does it's job of entertaining you well,and that is at least deserving of a 7-out-of-10 from me\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 - One thing I do like about Working! is it's art style. mainly the character designs which are all pretty unique , apart from Sanji 2.0 , or rather Satou Jun. The environment is well done as well, although in this season the inside of the restaurant isn't very detailed\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 - I don't really have any complaints with the BGM of the series as it did it's job well enough. The REAL impressive part are the opening and ending themes which are both very catchy and are some of my favorites. The voice actors also do a fantastic job at voicing their characters as they made the characters all the more lovable, and none of the young female characters ever came off as annoying\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 - The real powerhouse of this anime are the charcters, who, in their own right, are all very distinct,enjoyable,quirky, and fun to watch. Even the main male character , who you would think would be the \"straight man\" in this group of quirky characters , is quite quirky himself, which I found to be very entertaining\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 - In all, Working! is a very funny and enjoyable anime , and also a great start to the series as a whole , as it introduces and develops the main characters that appear in the next two seasons \\n\\n\r\n                                              Overall - 9/10",

            "content": "When you're cycling through anime looking for something to watch. A lot of you might just skim and pass over Working!!. I looked it over quite a few times and always went on to something else. This ended up turning into one of my favorite Slice-of-life/Comedies.\r\nStory -  \"Synopsis\"\r\nBasically a high school senpai named \"Popura\" who looks like an elementary school student invites \"Souta\" to work at a restaurant with her. The story develops slowly over time. It's more or less a comedy not concentrated on the story, but the characters instead. So I gave the story a bit lower score then most everything elsebecause it doesn't sound interesting. But, the other categories makes up for that.\\n\\n\r\nArt - \\n\r\nThe art is normal. Not great, not bad. To be honest I really like it and think it's very good. The characters are drawn to my liking. No characters except maybe one of Souta's sisters is ecchi. Very good anime in this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound -\\n\r\nThe opening and ending aren't bad at all. Better then most of the anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - \\n\r\nThis is where this anime shines. The character development even for the side characters of the anime play a big part.\\n\\n\r\nInami, Mahiru\\n\r\nA 17 year old high school girl who has androphobia (scared of men) and beats the hell out of them when she is around them. She is forced to work with Souta and they start to develop a excruciating bond with each other.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi, Souta\\n\r\nA 16 year old who is highly addicted to cute things and kids under the age of 12. Popura is the only exception to this category. He doesn't hold back with opinions and adapts very quickly to his surroundings. \\n\\n\r\nSatou, Jun\\n\r\nA 20 year old who has a very strong love from Yachiyo. He is very intimidating and often picks on Popura whenever something goes wrong or aggravates him. (usually to do with Yachiyo)\\n\\n\r\nTodoroki, Yachiyo\\n\r\nA 20 year old who carries around a katana on her side and usually scares the customers she greets at the tables. For the most part she is normal unless it comes to protecting the manager Kyouko.\\n\\n\r\nSouma, Hiroomi\\n\r\nA chef and man of mystery. He knows everything about everyone but, no one knows much about him.\\n\\n\r\nShirafuji, Kyouko\\n\r\nA manager who doesn't know or do much. She is very dependent on the people around her. She comes off as very intimidating as well. She is part of a type of gang.\\n\\n\r\nYamada, Aoi\\n\r\nA girl who says she is 16 because Souta is 16, She is mysterious and is said to have run away from home. She often screws up and can never do much right. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - \\n\r\nI laugh a lot and I find this anime very enjoyable. Each episode brings something a bit new and unique to the table. I also like to watch the relationships develop between the characters. Certain parts can have you laughing out loud.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - \\n\r\nOne of the best Slice-of-life/Comedies out there. Don't pass it up. I didn't elaborate on things in this review specifically so I don't ruin the amazing feeling this anime can give off while your watching it. Give it a chance and enjoy it. :)\\n\\n\\n",

The show uses many kinds of humor, some more culture specific than others, and should appeal to many kinds of people. The characters interact in surprisingly believable ways considering how much the show focuses on humor.\r\nLike many comedy anime, Working!! throws a group of characters together to create a situation for humor. However, in most cases, this effort seems labored and implausible. The approach is basically: 1. Create weirdos with the most extreme quirks you can. 2. Make up a reason for them to be stuck together. 3. Do a bunch of random stuff and hope some ofit gets a laugh. Working!! doesn\u2019t discard the formula. It just does the whole thing better. It uses characters more like real people instead of freaks you would only see in an anime. They come together as coworkers (much less contrived). The humor comes from their interactions, instead of whatever random events a mangaka decided to shoehorn them into so he could make his deadlines.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, the characters drive the show. They make the story. Their flaws and insecurities create misunderstandings and humor. Frankly, I\u2019ll be breaking this show down by character because I couldn\u2019t come up with any other way to do it justice.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi Souta looks like he\u2019ll become the main character, but he never really does. Living with three large, selfish sisters led him to obsess over their opposite: small, vulnerable, and cute things.  He comes to Wagnaria when a tiny high school girl (Taneshima) approaches him about the job.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi Sisters: Souta\u2019s three older sisters cause him no end of trouble. One does nothing but drink and cling to him after her latest boyfriend rejects her. One works as a lawyer. She seems to live with the rest of the family after her personality led to divorce. The last one is a novelist, and she needs Souta to care for her constantly because she can hardly stand on her own legs, much less take care of herself. His younger sister is the reliable one. She works hard to support her brother (which is also worrying in ways you\u2019ll need to watch the show to find out).\\n\\n\r\nTaneshima Popura is short. She\u2019s also na\u00efve. She\u2019ll do anything to grow, so the kitchen staffers love to feed her bad ideas. Souta dotes on her, always calling her small and cute and prompting pouty displeasure.\\n\\n\r\nInami Mahiru is the sweetest, gentlest girl you\u2019ll ever meet. She\u2019s shy, demure, and prone to girlish embarrassment. \u2026as long as she doesn\u2019t see a man. Her androphobia reaches unheard of extremes, often resulting in injuries and broken furniture.\\n\\n\r\nSatou Jun works in the kitchen. He\u2019s tall, and he looks a little rough, but he\u2019s a nice guy. His usual no nonsense attitude conflicts with the manager\u2019s eating habits. He\u2019s also unlucky in love.\\n\\n\r\nSouma Hiroomi works with Satou in the kitchen. Outside the kitchen, he only works when he feels like it. People often take over whatever he\u2019s working on. (Watch the show to find out why.) He enjoys watching whatever interesting things happen to his coworkers.\\n\\n\r\n(Manager) Shirafuji Kyouko eats constantly, and she's so bad at work she helps out by slacking off. She basically aged out of juvenile delinquency.\\n\\n\r\nTodoroki Yachiyo carries a sword. For some reason, she\u2019s completely oblivious to others\u2019 reactions to it. She obsesses over the manager constantly, making her food from the company stores. She misses important things about her coworkers because she thinks so much about Kyouko.\\n\\n\r\nOtoo Hyougo is a business manager. He comes around occasionally, but usually he\u2019s off on personal business.\\n\\n\r\nMatsumoto Maya is the normal one. Sort of.",

At first glance by the MyAnimeList.net description I was unsure if I would like it, however I always test 1-2 episodes before dropping the heavy hammer of a negative verdict as often the description does not do the series justice.\r\nAs often is the case the description in my eyes did not do justice to this anime series.  I watched 1 episode and found myself laughing out loud at this series.  Over the next 24 hours I could not get enough and despite working and spending timewith the family I blew through season 1.  I found this series to be a hillarious depiction of life, focusing on the personality differences of people working together and their interactions or lack of interactions depending on how these personalities coexist.  Of course hillarity ensued over the course of a few episodes and just when I thought I had seen all that I could they added a waitress who is so scared of men she hits them and runs away screaming!  My stomach began to ache as the laughter poured out of me as situation and personalities continuously piled one on top of another.\\n\\n\r\nCurrently only season 1 has aired however season 2 has been announced however it will feature a new director and lead script writer, and the date has yet to be confirmed for airing.

            "content": "The anime is a very avarage anime interms of slice of life. It has it's common slice of life unique charecters that interact in a resturant. The comedy is i guess meh. If you have seen a couple of slice of life anime , You can expect the same from this anime. Although the anime has one problems - taking on plot threads that should not be in a light hearted anime.The anime takes on themes that are frankly not suitable for a slice of life anime. One of things about Slice \r\nof life is that the unique and crazy charecters just exist as ifthey are normal beings. Their craziness is never shown to be something rare or something we need to dive into. The slice of life animes just give you a crazy charecter with their quirks and tells you to accept it. This anime does not do it and from there comes it's biggest problem , It tries to tell you WHY a charecter is like the way they are. Inami for example could have been a funny interesting charecter but the anime suddenly goes way too serious and shows how her father was a psychopath and traumatised her childhood. This trauma results in her androphobia. While this would work in more serious anime , In a comedy anime it does not work . It does not work because in a 12 episode anime it takes on subject that is needs at least 2 or 3 episodes to solve.\\n\\n\r\n This anime moves on quickly from that plot and the result ? a forced unfunny ending to the plot thread with the father getting a slap on the wrist at best. \\n\r\nThere is also the protagonists life. His life is misarable and despite the anime forcing the comedic view point i could not find anything humorous about his life. His life should have been made much simpler. \\n\r\nthe charecter having multiple big sisters added nothing substantial to the story except some moments here and there.Due to this anime's inability to signal it's comedic moments we are always faced with confusing moments about whether what was happening was serious or not. The sister moments are something like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist always talks like he is quite depressed that he is the least talented of the bunch and has to handle all the houses work without any love given to him. Since the anime does not signal when the humor starts with art style change or voice change there is drastic changes in the mood about when something is serious or not.Often the change does not work at all and you just feel like the anime is forcing a comedic view in a serious matter and failing at it.\\n\\n",

There's not much of a story like \"The hero wins against evil\", or \"they try to achieve something\" but despite the lack of story, they keep it going with their every day life. Which honestly was pretty cool. This is mainly comedy & slice of life. Then i'd say romance and sort of \"acton\" haha you'll see what I mean. Man this anime reminded me of KILL ME BABY (another anime) which youmight like if you like this one. Same thing, no story but filled with their everyday life and such. I can now properly say in this anime there are unique characters!! (HOORRRAAY) well i don't know if you might have seen it somewhere else but some characters were unique to me. Although it's only 13 episodes, there are 3 seasons O.o so not so short. \\n\\n\r\nGive it a try if you're looking for some gags. \\n\\n\r\n**Hahah hope you enjoy the relationship between Satou & Popura/Yachiyo as much as I did xD **",

            "content": "Working!! is a fun, mindless slice-of-life show that revolves around the characters and their relationships while working in a family diner. While it's not the \"greatest\" show out there, it still pleases.\r\nThe story itself is... well, there is no real story to the show. It's more like a compilation of moments and interactions. There is some driving force behind character motives, but everything seems to be more or less melodrama. Plot devices are used freely, but not creatively -- the main character joins the store because... the girl asking him is cute?\r\nAnimation is very solid. It gets the job done, and is fluid at times,but nothing great or eye-catching. Backgrounds are detailed enough to portray depth, but nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music, the opening is very catchy, which might be a nuisance for some. I, however, enjoyed it. It embodies the show rather well. Soundtrack isn't anything spectacular, but acts as decent background music to portray tone. I didn't particularly take note of any stand-out tracks. The ending is solid. The show is (currently) only offered in Japanese dub; the voice acting performances were solid.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the characters are really what drive the show. Now, I'd be hard-pressed to say that most of these characters are really good on their own, the show relies on them interacting with the rest of the staff to provide comedy and \"plot.\" Takanashi is your generic, clueless main character. Just forget about him. Taneshima is cute, and energetic. Inami is the main source of \"driven plot\" for the show, with her attempting to overcome her \"androphobia\". I personally found her cute and entertaining, though the show's constant use of her as a vessel to try and make things interesting got tiring after a while. Todoroki is interesting, though I don't think we get enough of her background that's hung in front of us for several episodes... Yamada is hilarious. Besides them, I couldn't really care about the other characters. Souma is just a pain in the side; I dislike his character \"development\". And, on that topic, we do actually see some development in these characters. Not so much their traits, but there relationships. I'm glad the show was able to at least pull that off.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, for a slice-of-life show about more or less \"nothing specific\", I more or less enjoyed Working!!. It made me laugh out loud at times, and was just clever enough to scrape by. I think I'll watch the second season to see how things pan out... eventually.",

            "content": "I don't know why, I don't know how, but \"Working!!\" (or \"Wagnaria!!\") managed to reach the top of the podium and become my favorite anime. I was a mostly shonen watcher when my friend told me about this comedy/slice of life anime named \"Working!!\". Well, it seemed nice and I decided to watch it. For my and his surprise, I ended up liking it a lot, much more than him, who showed me the series.\r\nAlthough it has not one of the greatest plots ever (actually, doesn't even have a real, complex, totally continuous plot), the anime surprised me. As a seinen, it actually didn't haveanything bad related to blood or sexual themes, as anyone could expect. It's just an anime with a simple (but unusual) story, good gags and romantic moments. But that's what made it special: simple, but inovattive. \\n\\n\r\nIt was one of the first anime to portray a character who suffer from androphobia (fear of men), which generated good jokes and romantic expectations. It also has several unusual characters that combined make a 100% crazy environment. It explores themes such as bosses who gain money without working at all; a person who just cares about cute things and about girls under 12 years old; a guy that knows everything about everybody and uses their secrets to manipulate them... It's a wide variety of characters. \\n\\n\r\nThere are no villains, there is no big action... It's just a story that asks: what would happen if we picked up the strangest people in the world and put them all together working in a familiar restaurant? Well, it would certainly be less funny than this fictional story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what made me like it even more was the expectative about the relationships between the characters. Will they be together at least? Will somebody discover that his friend is in love with him? With all those strange people, it's more complicated than you can possibly imagine. After two seasons of 13 episodes each and no question ever answered, I still hope for a season 3 coming soon!!!\\n\\n\r\nI didn't even gave the best rating possible because I know it wouldn't be fair, but, for some reason, I like it more than many other anime that I know that are better!

            "content": "-This review is based on my opinion of the show and you don't have to agree or disagree with it.\r\n-This review will review all 3 seasons plus the special of the Working!! series.\r\nWorking is a slice of life and comedy anime. The story is set in a restaurant named Wagnaria and shows all of it's employees and their interactions with each other to create the comedy.\r\nAs it is a slice of life anime, it doesn't really have a story. Working just follows our characters and their everyday life working in Wagnaria. This anime does have character development. Season 1 is focused on introducing the charactersand their running jokes. Season 2 feels the same as season 1 and still keeps up the comedy. Season 3, however, have more character development then the previous seasons. The special is a nice wrap up to conclude the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this anime is good but not that amazing. All of the characters have their running gags. There are some of the jokes that i like but what i don't like is that the running jokes are overused. Some of them may be funny at first or still be funny later but i don't really like seeing the same joke being used too much. Thankfully, they don't use the joke too repetitively after some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 starts to resolve all of the character's problem that was given from the past 2 seasons. I liked seeing the character development. You can see the character development clearly between seasons especially at season 3 where the resolve all of the problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice and just fits the scenes. Nothing too notable from here.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the openings and endings in the series were sung by the series' characters. The openings was sung by the females and the ending by the males. I like when openings or endings is sung by the characters because it adds to the feeling of the opening/ending. The opening and ending has the same feeling from all seasons. The opening is upbeat and fun and the ending is a bit slower.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters has their obvious ups and downs. Some running jokes are created by the interaction of 2 characters. Even though the running jokes are overused, it's nice that they modify it to keep them funny sometimes. The side characters also have their own distinct qualities and running gags and their own share of development. Some of the characters may seem just plain dumb reacting at some situations but i think that's the part of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series for some of it's comedy and the character development that i see at the last season. The jokes may be too repetitive at times but sometimes made funnier with the characters' reaction. Season 3 and the special is really nice to add the character development and to finish all of the problems that the the characters had.\\n\\n\r\nI think that this anime's comedy is fine and can be enjoyed by others as well. It is worth it to watch until the end to to see all the development at Season 3. Overall it's a nice comedy anime that sometimes gets too repetitive with the jokes but still tried to make them funny. It shows the character development and ends everything at the end, not leaving anything unanswered.",

            "content": "Working!!, just as the name says, it is about a group of characters working. The workplace is a family restaurant, Wagnaria and the anime revolves around the workers of the restaurant. The workers are the waiters, waitresses, chef and manager. Some family members of the main characters also make it into the to increase the fun.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe main character, well there are a lot of them, but the one who gets the most screen time and from whose perspective the story is told, is Takanashi Souta, a 16 year old high school student with a \"festish\" for small cute things. His days are filled byworking in the restaurant, co-existing with the weird workforce and trying not to die by the hands of a fellow worker.\\n\r\nThere isn't much of an objective aside from working daily. Each episode is full of comedy which makes you eager to watch the next. Oh, and might I mention there is also some romance in the restaurant. Nothing serious like a romance anime ut still, it is something that'll make you root for the couple.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nThe animation, character design and artwork of this anime was really good. I was expecting something about average but this anime does a really really well job on the animation and artwork.\\n\r\nThe characters are very well designed and I can guarantee that art and animation won't be something to keep you away from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nThe opening theme \"Working!!\" is pretty upbeat and catchy. It's perfect for a comedy anime such as this.\\n\r\nAs for the ending, it also matches the comedy and atmosphere of the show nicely.\\n\r\nNow I won't say the songs are something that you will download and listen to, but it's something that you won't mind spending 1 minute and 30 seconds listening to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nThe characters are all this show is about. From start to end, the show revolves around the characters, their behaviours, their impulses, their getup and their relations.\\n\r\nIt would be too long if I start explaining each and every character because almost all of them can be counted as the main characters.\\n\r\nI will only say that all of them are unique and will leave you laughing. Sure, some characters might not be much likeable in the beginning but eventually you'll come to like them too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nI'm a big big fan of slice of life romcom anime. Though this was purely a comedy anime, certain romance aspects also make their way into the show and you can't help but root for the couples.\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime and watched it non stop from start to end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a really good slice of life comedy anime and you should definitely watch it if you're looking for some good comedy anime with good animation and characters.",

The story is enjoyable, If you're bored about ecchi, action, etc, you may see this anime. The comedy parts arent different from other animes, but at the moment you enjoy them.\r\nThe art and animation wasn't great or amazing: As simple as tjis. was ok. I really like the character design, specially from Taneshima. \r\nSound. The ending was very good,but I really didn't like the opening. Talking about the opening was funny, but after 12 episodes (chapter 13 doesm't have the opening secuense) you get annoyed about it.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the ending of episode 9 It was better than the original one (but if you dont like sweet and romantic music you will not like it).\\n\\n\r\nThe character was so so. The character I ,ike the most aren't the princicpal ones. The sisters of takanashi zare my fav characters.But in general all was esteretipical characters. Inami was the different one, I havent seen a character like her.\\n\\n\r\nAbout enjoyment was goo, not a great anime, only good. You can see this in a sunday evening if you are bored and you dont know how to see.",

            "content": "Contrary to what this anime portrays, working actually sucks. Especially at a restaurant where you are typically working with a bunch of people you  grow to hate, nothing is particularly cohesive because of the mutual hate of everyone, and you\u2019re working so why the hell would you be happy? On top of that it\u2019s hard to find a restaurant full of cute chicks, let alone a restaurant that will hire someone who is androphobic and a manager who eats the food supply. So Working!! is a complete work of fiction with absolutely no basis in reality. If it were to be realistic and afactual slice-of-life, it would have ended with the main character using his paycheck to buy some marijuana and light up behind the restaurant while he\u2019s on breaks.\\n\\n\r\nWorking!! is about Souta Takanashi, a guy who likes tiny things and, let\u2019s face it, is probably a pedophile and a candidate for the sex offenders list when he turns eighteen. He gets recruited by the cute and tiny Poplar Taneshima to work at a family restaurant called Wagnaria, where only the weird are allowed to work. He only decides to work there because he appears to have a love for Poplar that transcends human comprehension. What appears to be the start of a love story between Souta and Poplar turns into MM! starring an androphobic girl who wants to cure her illness because she is falling in love with Souta. While this happens though Souta must take care of his crazy sisters who all seem to suffer from various symptoms of uselessness and that\u2019s on top of working at the worst family restaurant in Japan. A family restaurant where your father has the potential to get beaten by an androphobic red-head, you are in fear of your life because of a long haired waitress who carries a katana, and if you don\u2019t pay a tip you will more than likely get beaten up in a back alley because of the connections of an insane manager.\\n\\n\r\nThe androphobia is something that gets turned into the focal point of the anime. At first it just seems to be a quirky little character driven adventure in a rather strange restaurant. But what it winds up being is an MM! style, \u201cLet\u2019s go on a date and cure your androphobia\u201d based plot that isn\u2019t all that exciting. This is not helped by the fact that the androphobic character, Mahiru Minami, isn\u2019t a great character to watch and the plot never really progresses through her getting over her fear of men, it just seems to be there to kill time. Which is sad because there are a lot of great characters that could have been worked with and could have had a bigger role. I felt that the sudden change of focus from Poplar to Mahiru was too fast. I would have been fine with it if the series started with Mahiru and Souta meeting and the androphobia being there and the series telling me that that would be the focus. The fact that it didn\u2019t and shifted direction halfway through was awkward.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the show seems to use the same jokes again and again and again. Mahiru\u2019s tendency to punch men. Souta liking tiny things. Souta cross dressing. Poplar is short. The chef, Jun Satou, being in a one sided love with Yachiyo. Satou\u2019s sister drinks a lot. The jokes don\u2019t fall flat all the time, but seem a little overused. Which is why it is sad that the plot and the script couldn\u2019t have been helped through more silly banter between the silly characters. If androphobia had  been nothing more than a side plot, the anime would have probably been a lot better. But the moment that became the main conflict, the anime suffered.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty unexciting. The characters look okay, but the colors aren\u2019t crisp and it all looks fairly dated.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good. The theme song is pretty awesome and catchy. The end\u2019s Japanese Elvis homage is pretty entertaining. Music during the show suits the mood and voice actors are good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a major part of what makes Working!! so good, and yet so average. Souta is your typical romantic/comedy/slice-of-life main male character, with the personality of a cardboard box. As does all main characters of the genre he has a particular complex that is exploited religiously and he overall never is real entertaining but for maybe two or three times.\\n\\n\r\nPoplar is a clumsy, tiny seventeen year old who is adorable and funny. As stated previously, her shortness is continuously exploited by Jun, the badass chef who seems to be Sanji\u2019s (One Piece) brother. Jun is in love with Yachiyo, who is in love with the manager, making things difficult. Yachiyo doesn\u2019t have a lot of character, she is just the manager\u2019s play thing, but the fact she carries around a katana and waits on people amused the hell out of me for no particular reason. I also found the one sided romance between Jun and her pretty cute. I just can\u2019t get over how much Jun is like Sanji though. A chef. A blond. A chain smoker. I mean, come on\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAoi Yamada is a younger teen who joins the restaurant crew half-way through but doesn\u2019t seem to be anything more than your clumsy little loli girl. She\u2019s as useless as Mahiru,  another character who is flat and boring and yet is still the focus of the anime. And that\u2019s the biggest problem of Working!! is focusing on the most boring characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I also had a problem with the introduction of Maya Matsumoto on the last episode. She had been working at Wagnaria the whole series, yet doesn\u2019t get a line until the end?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Working!! suffers from one problem, and that problem is Mahiru. If she weren\u2019t the focus of the whole series, then it would be a pretty entertaining and all around fun little romp. But because the cool characters (Jun, Yachiyo, and the manager) aren\u2019t focused on that much, the series loses a lot of points for me.\\n\\n\r\nWorking!! is, nonetheless, not a bad way to spend a boring afternoon. It does have some entertaining characters and Wagnaria is a place you\u2019ll look forward to returning to again and again with every episode. It\u2019s just that shift in focus that really ruins it and leaves it unable to be considered great. It is instead, just average.",

            "content": "The anime series of \u2018working!!\u2019 is absolutely exceeding the quality of the mange series. In Japanese forum it has been said that the quality of anime all thanks to the Anime Producers but not to the original author of manga. As my personal opinion I need to admit that it is actually true that the quality of Anime is overwhelming that of manga, however, there is still a major flaw to this anime series which is the length. It was just too short to construct the convincing structure of a season. This was of course not a special matter to this anime but also tothe entire 2010 spring anime series which mostly ended around 13 episodes. It was most likely an anime launched to target the fans of manga series who know the original story; and I suggest that was why it was too short. Observing the popularity of the anime and the manga, the possibility of season 2 seems positive as long as the original author stays healthy enough to continue writing. I cross my fingers for the season 2.\\n\\n\r\nExcepting the length of series the aggregate quality of the anime was quite fine as the quality drove me buy the manga series to read the episodes left out from the original lines in the anime series.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of some other reviews I read, other reviewers were pretty dissatisfied with the lack of completeness in the series, meanwhile, as I mentioned it was just too short to conclude as an anime series. If this could have episodes around 24, it definitely had become a rewarding one. \\n\\n\r\nThe type of this anime is hard to define though something closer to Minami-ke as you find on the similar anime lists. I would say this is an epic for that type.",

This anime is all about characters and their bizarre behaviour. It is best if I go through each one:\r\nSouta - a 16 year old high school student who has a worryingly liking for cute things and hates anyone over 12 years old. Who is recruited off the street. Is actually tough from getting beatenup by is sisters so is able to take being punched by Inami. Amazingly is the only responsible member of his family.\\n\\n\r\nPopura - an extremely short 17 year old high school student who always gets mistaken for an elementary school student who has a very sunny personality. Often bullied by the head chef who rearranges her hair in to bizarre styles.\\n\\n\r\nInami - who has androphobia (fear of men) and instinctively punches any man extremely hard if they get too close. Is attracted to Sota.\\n\\n\r\nKyoko - The ex delinquent manager of Wagnaria who does no work. She justifies it by saying \" I'm no good at anything so if you think about it my job is to do nothing\". Spends her time mainly eating parfait, \"Yachiyo parfait!\". She uses her dilenquent contacts to deal with problem customers.\\n\\n\r\nYachiyo - known as Chief is the head waitress who hero worships the manager and always carries a katana which scares the customers.\\n\\n\r\nJun - the head chef who is in love with Yachiyo but can't bring himself to tell her. Bullies Popura in frustration after talking to  Yachiyo.\\n\\n\r\nHiroomi - the outwardly easy going assistant chef who is really a minipulative sadist using peoples embarrassing secrets to torture them. Is terrified of Inami and unable to blackmail Jun.\\n\\n\r\nAoi - the useless runaway waitress who lives in the attic at Wagnaria.\\n\\n\r\nHiyogo - the corporate manager who spends his time looking for his missing wife who got lost buying some milk.\\n\\n\r\nSota's sisters - Kazue the aggressive divorced lawyer, Izumi the reclusive romance author with writers block, Kozue hard drinking defence instructor and Nazuna the elementary school student who is as tall as Sota.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the anime funny is that they all think they are the only normal ones working at Wagnaria and the bizarre goings one.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much else to say apart from watch it.",

            "content": "Please be easy for me......\r\nThis anime is slice of life and a lot of comedy anime and this anime does not have a strong storyline as it just how you pass your day as usual.First it just about a guy who work in a restaurant,that must be boring to hear but you must feel the 'inside' or enjoyment of this anime,even it has a comman story.\r\nPersonality or Characters is one subject that make the story of this common story line become intersting,like Inami-chan who has an anphobehia(if i right) or fear of men,how she serve men  and treated her fear of men.\r\nComedy and 'slapsticks'are also have a big role in this story,it has a good humour and maybe a little too much of slapsticks but it can cheered you up.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is recommend for people who want to relaxs and don't want to think a for a character progressment or story progessment and just want a SIMPLE,HUMOROUS,RELAXING ANIME(not like Naruto,Clannad and Bleach)\\n\\n\r\nSorry if i used sooooooo much of comma and spelling mistakes.",
