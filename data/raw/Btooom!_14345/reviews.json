            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nIn my effort to find animes that don't star some stupid little high school boy I decided to focus as much as I could on finding animes starring adults. My search didn't take that long surprisingly when I came across of a description \"A 22 year old...\" that my friend was how I discovered BTOOM!\r\nI decided to give the anime a shot to see if I like it and ended up watching the whole thing in two days. :D Let me first talk about all the things I liked about it.\r\nThe story is about a guy who sits at home playing videosgames all day, he's one of the top players in a game called BTOOM! Eventually he gets kidnapped and taken to an Island where he has to play the game to survive and win back his freedom. I immediately thought of myself and my Killzone 3 addiction. lol! So I can sort of relate to the main protagonist. I also love stories like \"The Hunger Games\" where people are forced to fight each other for their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are a the biggest draw for me as they are all real people...or they feel like real people and not just a bunch of anime archetypes thrown together. The main character, Ryouta is just a regular guy who is very selfish and tends to think only about how things affect him. He's not some goody two shoes but he's not the devil as well. What was interesting to me more than anything was finding out that everyone on the Island was sent there by someone they know and we do get a glimpse into the reasons why some of the characters are there and with the others you can sort of see why, based on their actions, why someone would send them. In other words, some are more deserving of their spot there than others and with Ryouta, it's up to you to decide if he should really be there or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe next main character is Himiko/Emilia a highschool girl who also played the game somewhat and even married Ryouta in the game. When I first saw this character I rolled my eyes because I wanted to avoid the high school kid thing but I was wrong. This girl is as real as it can get and someone I found myself rooting for and relating to a great deal. I love how her character was handled in some of the situations she was in. She was almost raped twice and it made her grow mistrusting of men in general, something that I know a lot of women go through. She just did bounce back and become some sex kitten, nor was she a damsel. she fought to maintain her purity in a world where men were eager to take it away from her. Even if it meant sacrificing her own life. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the characters, even the ones I didn't root for all had something about them that made me feel a certain way about them whether it was love, hate, disgust, etc.The anime did not pull its punches showing how horrible some of these characters are and for a story premise about how these people were chosen by someone \"who wants them to disappear\" that's how it should be. The story is filled with betrayals and so on that constantly remind you of why they are there.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the slow development of the relationship between Ryouta and Himiko. He's not some stupid shy little boy and she's not some super bitch or super sickly sweet chick. They are just two people thrown into a nightmare and they are trying to survive.\\n\\n\r\nNow what I didn't like about it:\\n\\n\r\nFirst I was happy that Himiko was called a foreigner. she was a character with blond hair and blue eyes, it makes sense. Then later she calls herself Japanese?? I don't know many Japanese girls named Emilia or at least that's not a common Japanese name. Why can't she just be a foreigner living in Japan?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime suffers from not being longer than 12 episodes. I would have liked to know more about the other characters and what was going on with the people behind BTOOM and this island version of it. It sort of reminded me of \"Cabin in the Woods\" the way they were monitoring them all. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime did way too many 'That could have been messy\" moments. For example: Himiko manages to toss a bomb off of her while the timer was at 1 sec. That is ridiculous considering the fact that we have seen other characters die from the same bomb type from a farther distance and I doubt she was able to throw it that far that fast in 1 sec. This also happens to the Ryouta a lot. Too many close calls takes away from the suspense of having them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall feelings:\\n\\n\r\nI really like this anime. I love the characters in it ad I really want to get to know more about them. When I finished the last episode I looked for a season 2 because there is just no way this anime is over. It pretty much finishes in the middle! However, sadly I read that it was one of the worst selling animes of 2012. *SMH* of course it is. Why am I not the least bit surprised that this anime was a poor seller. It isn't starring some idiotic high school boy who spends all day blushing at chicks and riding mechs. It isn't starring an equally annoying anime girl who is so sweet she might as well p*$$ maple syrup or a girl who is so emotionally devoid of life she might as well be a sockt puppet. Everybody's problems can't be solve by saying \"Believe in me/us/him/her\".\\n\\n\r\nOh well, I won't hold my breath for another season and considering where it stops off at you would probably be better off not even watching it. here is a manga though so I'll check it out.",

Ry\u014dta is one of the world's best Btoom players, an online multiplayer where the objective is to seek out and destroy your opponents using BIMS (bombs). However, after being kidnapped and transported to a secluded island, he is forced to play the game for real.\r\nThe story entails a mix of survival and psychological.

From the unique BIM variants, to the psychotic inhabitants trying to blow you apart at any opportunity.\r\nArt: 8\r\nIn terms of art, Btooom! has a lot going for it.The scenery is superbly detailed, and the lighting is magnificent. My only negative comment so far is blood lacks detail.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe voice acting is what you'd expect from the majority of anime. Unfortunately, the soundtrack isn't anything impressive.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe story has your typically pathetic protagonist that we all hate to relate to. Being a psychological drama, the show is full of gritty characters with rather interesting and unpredictable personalities. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIt's rare to come across an anime with so much to offer it's audience. Explosive action, great characters, and a story that will actually keep you guessing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nFans of Mirai Nikki, Gantz and Deadman Wonderland will be in for a treat that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.",

            "content": "\"This is where tomorrow brings a new game. It's time to learn that pain is gain. Ready FIGHT!\"\r\nSurvival games have been very prominent in Japan. Normally, survival games will involve who gets killed and who will become the last man standing. Some of the survival games like Mirai Nikki, Fate/Zero, Danganronpa and others. \r\nSTORY (5):\r\nRyota Sakamoto is a NEET which stands for Not educated, employed or trained. He plays a new game called BTOOOM! and he became one of the top players. One day, he woke up in a deserted tropical island and he realized that he is trapped in a real-life game BTOOOM withother players including Himiko, Ryota's in-game wife.\\n\\n\r\nEach players have a green gem which represents their life and if the gem is removed, the player might die. Basically, it is like a survival game. In order to win, you have to collect all the gems and make it out alive.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, it is your typical survival game.\\n\\n\r\nART (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good. It portrays a dark and serious tone.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6):\\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening song \"No pain, no game\" while I liked the ending \"Aozora\". The opening plays like a rock and roll tune. The ending gives a smooth tune.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are by far the weakest. Ryota and Himiko were predictable. Ryota can sometimes be a badass. Himiko is a typical damsel in distress. Although I sincerely understood her past when rape is a terrible thing to go through.\\n\\n\r\nKosuke Kira was a tragic character who lived a tragic life in his childhood.\\n\\n\r\nMasashi Miyamoto looks like a soldier with a magenta pirate hat.\\n\\n\r\nKiyoshi Taira was a good character who helped Ryota and Himiko survive through this game. Although he didn't leave much impression.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, it is sad to say that the characters are bland and uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (5):\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this show a lot but I did appreciate the way how they make use of people being trapped into a virtual game where the only way to win is to be the last man standing.\\n\\n\r\nEven the ending leaves no resolution to the plot. Normally, I see this in most anime I watched. There was no resolution.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all I have to say. If you enjoy survival games, you might enjoy this too.\\n\\n\r\nI am giving this anime a 5 out of 10.",

            "content": "That feeling when you get when you realized your life is now fucked up, turned from virtual fun into a bloody reality, and your only chance to survive is to trust in no one (I mean it here) but yourself. With only your disposal \u2013 a package of bombs, a strange gem on your hand, and your own intuition, you realize that your life has been changed forever with your new life now residing on a strange island in the middle of nowhere...\r\nSo, what should you choose to do?\r\nA) Panic! Scream and hope someone will help you out\r\nB) Try to team up with someone andtrust in him or her and hope that they will not betray you. \\n\r\nC) Do the opposite of choice B. In other words, when you find the first opportunity, KILL THEM after you've gained their trust\\n\r\nD) Just try to survive. Your life belongs to you and yours only\\n\\n\r\nThese all sound pretty horrifying, right? Well, that's Btooom! for you. \\n\\n\r\nBtooom! is survival horror themed anime series based off the manga of the same name. It doesn't take long for the characters in the series to realize their lives have changed forever to be quite honest. The series takes itself from the very beginning and presents a game senario where in order to survive, you must kill seven other people before they can kill you. It's survival of the fittest and it's a every one for themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe basis of the series is actually based off a game from the anime series itself called Btooom. But now, our 22-years old main protagonist Ryota Sakamoto's life has changed forever when he realizes the new situation of his reality. In fact, he used to be an pro gamer from the game itself. However, his new life puts on the edge between survival and death. The difference? It's real. In other words, there's no pause button, no restart, or bonus lives. No, now you're dead, YOU'RE DEAD.\\n\\n\r\nThe influence of the series seems to be based off of the classic deserted island theme. Only this time, the island itself becomes a battlefield for survival. And of course, series with themes like this isn't new especially in today's anime industry. Series like Mirai Nikki, Deadman Wonderland, and Gantz all have these themes where survival is absolute. Even in manga series, these themes are present such as Psyren, Mahou Shoujo of the End, and Cage of Eden. The fact is that these series all share a common factor in which an ordinary main male protagonist's lives are changed forever after a certain event. These events turn from peculiar, to dangerous, to tragic, to emotional, and one which will leave a memory in their minds for the rest of their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThose characters/contestants:\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's hard to describe them all but let's look at some of the most prominent ones, shall we? We begin with the main male protagonist -  \\n\\n\r\nRyota Sakamoto. He is a 22 year old young man who has achieved mastery and fame in the Btooom world. In the game, he is ruthless but yet cunning as well as being infamous for his skills. In real life though, he is described as a NEET. In other words, he has almost no life but rather chooses to spent them playing the game. Yet, he is a brilliant, caring, loyal, and courageous young man if we look at him carefully especially during his time of playing the real Btooom game in the anime series.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there's Himiko (also known as Hemilia). She is the main female protagonist with a pair of big boobs but with a small interest in the opposite sex. As a matter of fact, she hates the male population in general for fear of her past. It's for this reason that she carries a stun gun throughout the series as a warning sign to any men who dares to approach her. In her mind, every men in the game (and possibly on the planet) is her enemy and that she is their prey. This is especially true in the beginning episodes where some of flashbacks are shown in a dark fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe other contestants of the Btooom game all have different ideologies, goals, and personalities as we see the series progresses. What they all have share in similarities is their desire to win the game and get off the island. As such, most of them are willing to hurt, betray, and even kill to ensure that their goal is achieved; well, most of them anyways. For people like Kiyoshi Taira, there seems to be hope and friendship. But for others, there exists hatred, dominance, power, and intellect as part of their characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, Kousuke Kira, a young boy at the age of only 14 holds a hatred for his father due to his childhood. It turned him into a child murderer and one that lacks empathy. Then, there's Masahito Date who is willing to do anything to ensure his successes throughout the game and becomes its victor. Then, there are some others who uses their brains rather than their brawns such as Nobutaka Oda who has mastered his usage of the Remote Control type BIM. The point is that every one the island wants to get out of it and return to their lives. \\n\\n\r\nYet, they know their lives won't be the same again...\\n\\n\r\nThe games' concept involves survival and thus, there are some science fiction themes mixed in with the brutality of violence, strategy, and a little bit of luck. After all, a game is never easy when there are others with skills that matches your own. To add to the game, there are the BIMs or bombs that players use as their main weapons of destruction. These bombs all have different abilities that can lead to the death of an opponent. It reflects the science fiction side of the series. The horror side? Those would be some of the flashbacks of the characters as well as the reality of what the players face. They realize that it's not a game anymore and once they're dead, it's game over forever.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the series isn't as good as it sounds. Make no mistake because every survival series has a lack of something that should have been there. In this case, Btooom has them too. The series lacks a diversity in which how the game is played. In other words, there is only bombs that are the primary weapons for the contestants. It does play on its main title as \u201cBtooom!\u201d seems to be synonymous to \u201cBOOM!\u201d That's of course what happens when one of those BIMs goes off and your body splatters. As gruesome as it sounds, the series tries too hard occasionally. Furthermore, the main male protagonist often comes with cases of deus ex machina. It's almost as if he is protected by the \u201cmain protagonist should not die\u201d shield. Other problems I've run into the series is that the seemingly rushed sequences. Some of the contestants are killed off in a single episode with little to no screen time given beyond their performance in the game. In other words, they don't stand out as much as the main protagonists. In the end, they're just more like  obstacles for them to get by and almost a way for them to \u201clevel up\u201d or gain experience in the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is fine but nothing unique. What it does reflect though is the nature of the game of Btooom and its survival themes. These include the abandoned buildings, the tropical forests, the shallow waters, the high mountain cliffs, and other things you typically see on an abandoned island.  In fact, most of the characters' outfits reflects this as well in their casual wear and their battle scarred clothing. Most of them are dressed in ways in which they are of themselves which means that none of them were prepared for a real life version of Btooom. And of course, the battlefield has left ashes and bombs going off is usually visually represented with its spectacular explosions. Nothing else is more than that though as I found the artwork to be typical but gets to the point.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is presented with its action paced OST. In most scenes involving action, there is the rhythm. There is hardly any comedic or lighthearted soundtrack in this series as it doesn't fit within those grounds. Yet, it does occasionally have emotional melody especially for flashback scenes of the contestants; more often these are represented as being tragic. The OP song, \"No pain, No game\" by Nano is a classic for this series. That's right, no pain means no game and in the world of Btooom, there's both of that. On the other hand, the ED song, \"Aozora \" by May'n is presented in a more soft paced style especially featuring one of the main characters, Himiko.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Btooom is one of those survival horror series that can be enjoyable but at the same time, becomes frustrating with its strange twists. The cliffhangers and occasionally plot twists have become predictable especially in later episodes. At the same time, there is a feeling of explosiveness (more than just the BIMs) when we watch the action scenes. It's not intelligent but packs that feeling of survival horror where your life really is at stake here. In the world of Btooom, it ultimately comes down to how to play the game. If you play your cards right, you'll win. If not, then game over for you and no second chances.\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nSometimes the decisions we make aren't always the right ones. During the process, though, we often think that there is zero chance that we are doing could be wrong. But as we all know, \"hindsight is 20/20.\" Most of the time, our choices not only cause a radical affect on ourselves but also on the people around us. Taking this in stride, BTOOOM! is an anime about bombs, psychology, and a host of problems that make the entire experience less than favorable.\r\nSTORY\r\nBTOOOM! is a tale involving Sakamoto, one of the best players to play the game the animeis titled after. After a small series of events, he finds himself trapped on an island with other people, having to play the game outside of the virtual world.\\n\\n\r\nThe pivotal aspect of the show that it explores is the way in which characters interact with one another after being placed into such a situation. Many ideas are brought to light and are put into play: how to trust, and not trust, certain people, learning to cope with hope and despair, and choosing the morally sound decision in a particular situation. A lot of the characters represent these varying sides to a degree, and for the most part, it works. But it's a difficult sell because for most of us it is completely unrelatable. Not just having to fight for our lives; predicaments such as dealing with terrible parents or lying to make events happen in our favor are not things that we've all dealt with. I'm not saying that there aren't people like this, as they certainly do exist, it's just attempting to cover so many bases at once is beyond the show's capabilities.\\n\\n\r\nOne major issue that the show has is in the game itself. The issue is that it is too simple. Essentially, it involves two key components: bombs and radar. The show incorporates a sizable amount of different bomb types and some tricks involving the radar. But beyond that, there isn't much to go off of. To combat this, the show tries too hard to make the fights seem too dire. What is presented, then, are a lot of overly dramatic scenarios without much weight behind them. It becomes way too predictable what is going to happen the more the show progresses. And while it tries to be \"cool,\" the lameness of the game and the overly-simplistic battles come off as boring and silly instead.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to fan-service, I'm not one to complain. I often don't mind if it's there or not. However, BTOOOM!'s use of it is rather strange. On the one hand, certain aspects make sense such as Himiko's sexual assault. On the other hand, certain aspects don't make sense, such as the river scene or later on when she is passed out. These are blatant attempts at showing off her body that were sorely out of place.\\n\\n\r\nAt it's core, the premise of the show is quite inane. Basically, any single person can be chosen to be selected for this game for potentially any reason. In other words, it's required of the audience to suspend some belief throughout the show; how the government would allow this, how a gaming company could possibly undertake such an event, etc. The argument here is that for a lot of shows we need to do exactly this. But BTOOOM!'s problem is that it takes itself so seriously that it is quite hard to do. In other words, the show has a huge issue when it comes to being \"super edgy.\" Many instances happen \"at the last second\" or characters escape \"by the skin of their teeth.\" This happens a lot throughout the show, so at some point you become desensitized to it. At that point, you mostly start to laugh at the absurdity of it all.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the art and animation for the show is quite lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the art-style, it mostly sticks to foliage and ruined buildings. It all seems appropriate given the setting and the island the cast is placed in. The characters, however, are pretty much cardboard cutouts. In other words, they are not very imaginative; Sakamoto is skinny with brown hair, Himiko is blonde with big boobs, Date is an older gentleman with glasses, etc. These design choices were most likely chosen to coincide with the \"mature\" vibe the show was attempting to give off, but instead it just makes everyone rather boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, the explosions from the bombs, such as the \"timers\" and the \"poisons\" are nicely animated, given the subject matter. However, both during and outside of the battles, the animation is rather poor. The show loves to do zoom-ins, single face shots, and jittery camera work. Even when the show gives the close-ups nice detail for the teeth, facial contours, and shading, it usually just sticks to mouth movements instead of eye or facial movements.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe psychological aspect to BTOOOM! is at least above average, but the same cannot be said for its characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the worst characters in the show is Sakamoto. A NEET by day, he is the \"10th best BTOOOM! player\" in the world. Yet, even after learning what he was thrown into, he acts as one of the dumbest. Even from the get-go, he doesn't understand or even recognize the bombs and the radar that he discovered he had. Alongside being stupid, he generally contradicts himself; he doesn't want to kill people because it isn't the right thing to do, but sometimes he tries to and other times he doesn't. Essentially, it just depends on the situation at hand.\\n\\n\r\nHimiko is a young woman, who is both beautiful and troubled. Early on, she had the potential to be a rather strong character. Her early background and initial time on the island set her up to be someone who could have overcome her trust issues and have her see some actual character development. Instead, the show chooses to place her in this quasi-state of trust and doubt that doesn't make much sense. She starts off hating men, not wanting to believe anything they have to offer. But by the end, rather than having her become independent or strong enough to deal with issues on her own, she relies solely on Sakamoto, the type of person she previously deplored.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast are mainly used to highlight the different psychological aspects detailed earlier: Taira with worry, Date with doubt, Miyamoto with disregarding morality. For the most part, the supporting cast are better than Sakamoto and Himiko (the mains). However, these characters are simply used to showcase their psychological aspects and nothing more. Among all of them, I would consider Taira the best member of the entire cast, but he is quickly cast aside and only taken back into account at the show's conclusion, which is a massive blunder.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nBTOOOM! suffers a \"Mirai Nikki\" with its OP, in that the OP somehow outclasses the entire anime. The guitar, roughness of the lyrics, and range of the vocals make it great to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is supposed to contrast what BTOOOM! offers. Instead of being dark and tense, it is quite light and soft. It does its job well, even if I don't particularly like the song.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the show is rather forgetful. Nothing notable stands out. The same can be said for the voice-acting. No one in particular does an outstanding job, despite the crazy situations the cast find themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI didn't know what to expect when going into this one. Honestly, I just thought that the title was kind of hilarious. I didn't expect one bit that the show would look so heavily at the psychology behind such a situation. While perhaps not executed as nicely as something like NGE, I think anything trying to go at least a bit more mature is a good step in the right direction.\\n\\n\r\nYet, I often found myself cringing during every episode; Sakamoto \"marrying\" Himiko in the game, Sakamoto jumping sideways during his fight with the young kid, and especially the introduction of the \"giant lizards.\" These parts made me laugh and shake my head all at the same time, because I couldn't believe that the show was making these parts seem \"awesome\" when in fact they were quite ludicrous.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also suffers from a terrible case of continuity issues. A large selection of the scenes depict many near-death-experiences. But the next shots, or at least the explanations behind them, show that they had a lot more time than what is initially perceived. In other words, the anime is trying to make us unfairly feel tension in these moments. I never felt this way during these moments, perhaps because the same trick was used over and over.\\n\\n\r\nI think BTOOOM! had a lot of potential in every department. I'm not sure what happened along the way, but something clearly wasn't done right. Whether this be the world itself being too simplistic or the characters being wholly uninteresting, something better could have been done. Instead, the show activated a \"cracker\" and forgot to throw it, blowing itself up in the process.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, the psychology works but everything else doesn't\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, art style fits the show's tone yet the actual animation is lackluster\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, lame, boring, one-dimensional, or a combination of the three\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, fitting ED, average soundtrack and VAs\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, has its moments but mired in silliness\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "When I started watching this anime I did not expect much, maybe it was going to be another sword art online? I was soon proved very wrong. First of all the anime takes place in the real world and not a virtual reality, so somewhat of the opposite of sword art online. We all love a good old game of kill or be killed btooom! offers another one, always been a fan of those sort of animes so it was a good choice for me to pick up. If you are into animes such as mirai nikki or danganropa then consider giving Btooom a tryas well.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Take a handful of psychopaths and some average day human beings, toss them in an island and tell them to kill each other that will get an interesting result. Some of the average day human beings can even find out another psychopath side of themselves. If you were given the option of kill or be killed what would you do? how would you react? This anime explores human nature, how humans can become insane when put into insane situations. Very interesting anime to watch, brief story as that's all the anime is about the kill game. Minor spoiler alert:   ( To twist everything up they were picked to be there by someone they know). \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is what you would expect from a recent anime, modern anime art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Music is decent, not much to say here except good explosion noses form bombs. Opening is decently catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in Btooom! range from psychopaths to normal innocents, this is what makes the anime so interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very enjoyable and interesting series to watch. There is a few slow bits and flashbacks which aren't very action packed but still interesting to watch and find out things about the island and the people. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I reccomend this anime to everyone, it's 12 episodes so not too long and it's well worth it, also good chances of a season 2.",

            "content": "As my expectations for starting the show \"Btooom!\" were relatively low, running into this action packed Dark Thriller, was actually quite a blast, It is hard to put away, despite the noticeable harsh flaws, it has great character backgrounds, and throughout most of the time, great execution.\r\nStory:10, Like most popular shows recently, it is resolved around a video game. In this show, its resolved around a game called Btooom, a game where you attempt to kill a team of other players with bombs, obviously not sounding very exciting, that quickly jumps into a real life psychological triller death match on a island, leading you tofeel concern for many of the players at multiple times, leading to a great ride.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8, Not being this shows strong point, the art was actually pretty good, the way they added the Ecchi, in this type of show was where it lacked, and aside from that, the non main character design was poor.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9, Unlike most masterpieces that can use sound to overly make a show more and more amazing, this show still used Sound in the casual way, for expense, nothing bad to say about it, but i have certainly seen better. At the very least, the Opening Song, is one of the best Opening's I have ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:5, This is the part where this show was lacking the hardest, its not that the characters weren't lovable, or had good backgrounds, its more of the fact, that throughout the series, It was like the characters has the inability to pickup on the most obvious details, this literally make me want to scream.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7,  This was both a good, and bad. The good coming from a game about bombs, literally turning into a suspenseful dark as fuck, fun ride, I had no expectations for the way the bombs could be used as good fight scenes, during the beginning of the show, but as you get going, you can see, they really did that well.\\n\r\nThe problem was the needless fan service and needless rape, now, sure it brought decent backstory's and traumatized the characters in a positive way. but it could have been done far better, to a non aggravating standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7/10,  Despite the rather mediocre execution, Btooom, was an extremely good marathon, and i would love to see a second season, It's honestly underrated on MAL, and the reasons for that stand out, but at the same time, it has its own personal redeeming factors in the midst of that. The background stories were great, and if future seasons are released, should show greatly in the future.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: Greatly surpassed my expectations, fun ride, worth even a rewatch some time, and i can't wait for the next season.\\n\\n\r\nFEEDBACK: I would definitely appreciate feedback; it would help me to become a better writer.\\n\\n\r\n#AnimeX",

(cough cough, Sword Art online, Mirai Nikki, battle royal Cough, Cough)\r\nART: 9/10\r\nThe art used in this series is not like the type of art from anime today.

            "content": "Popular anime with the concept of survival game (example: Mirai Nikki, etc) gave birth to a lot of anime who want to be famous too without changing the concept but change it slightly to create originality.They try to be great as their successor. One of those anime is Btooom! , came from studio Madhouse (king of anime studio) makes this anime has a heavy burden to be displayed. A lot of people expecting Madhouse's greatness, which make Btooom! looks very small in their eyes. Btooom!tells us a story of 22 years old Sakamoto Ryouta, this guy is the top scorer of the game Btooom! placed# 10 worldwide ranking. He somehow stranded on an island in the south (The island is somewhere in Indonesia because there are Komodo Dragon in the island). He had a bag with strange equipment (like a bomb), his goal there is to survive a game of death in order to get out of from the island. The concept is the same as the others survival game, they're using some kind of bomb with different types. There is some element of romance in this story that makes this story becomes a little more colorful.\\n\\n\r\nA story definitely has flaws somewhere, no exception in BTOOOM !. Honestly, with this concept Btooom! already able to compete others anime with the excitement that presented in this mind battle.The individual psychological element also exposed pretty well, also the pacing fairly balanced but not perfect. However, this anime has a lot of flaws, one of them is the flashback. It is true, the flashback creates a story or a character more interesting than before. We can know the characters past from there, but the flashback in Btooom! greatly reduce the intense tension that exists and disrupt the plot. There is some fan service anime that came out of it, the bad thing is, they using the main heroine forced to do fan service alone and using it as a plot device. Another downside is the cliff-hanging ending that and not too satisfying, either because of lack of episodes / costs or because the manga still ongoing which makes you all become disappointed because of the ending. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation looks very different from other anime, some characters are drawn in a semi-realistic design, but there is some are not and even though there are some people who said that the character designs like-pieces of cardboard,  but, at least, it still tolerable. Set in the tropical forest, the environment is very beautiful, shiny, and semi-realistic. The explosion of the bomb and other visual effects are also quite good. In terms of sound, Btooom! above average. Opening song \"No Pain no Game\" sung by nano is quite popular among fans and really good to hear. There is nothing wrong of how the seiyuu dubbing the characters, and the sound effects are quite adequate.\\n\\n\r\nFlashback is indeed one of Btooom! flaws in terms of the story, but also gives the power to explore the existing character. We have our protagonist Sakamoto Ryouta, a professional video game player and selfish until the massive character development  happened to him makes to be more concerned with other people. Our female lead, Himiko also got some character development that could sufficient be seen as the story goes. Furthermore, there is some people who also trapped on the island are getting a little character development. We can see the reason why they can be stranded on the island.\\n\\n\r\nBtooom! may be highly favored by fans but may not be preferred by some people. But if you are looking for a unique battle setting that using strategy, and if you are a fan of survival game, this anime is the right choice for you. Although not great, Btooom! managed to attract its audience with the typical concept.",

            "content": "From the summary, I immediately thought that Btooom would be a crossbreed of Sword Art Online (which I watched first) and Battle Royale (live action movie, never read the mangas). As I liked BR a lot and thought SAO was decent, I had some expectations for Btooom, which it spectacularly failed to meet.\r\nAnd the main reason is that both the protagonists are weak minded fools who become dumber and more useless as the show goes on. \r\nRyota, the main male protagonist, is a mixture of so many conflicting character traits he is like 3 different people. He is  rude and violent towards his parentspunching his stepdad and driving his mom to suicide with his attitude, yet he is kind and tries to talk to everyone throwing a bomb at him. He is a hypocrite spouting his pacifist routine crap - he wants to leave the game peacefully by collecting 7 chips from people that are dead - conveniently ignoring the dead people that he himself killed part. He is the \"best\" Btooom player in Japan, yet every fight is a \"oh so this IS a bomb, I thought it was another toy\" discovery for him. He is a shut-in who forsook the real world for the virtual world, yet the only person who is seeking companionship and acceptance, in of all things, a murder game. Yet the most unbelievable trait he has is that he becomes more and more trusting of people in this game of deceit the more he gets betrayed.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female protagonist Himiko on the other hand, is at least consistent - she wants to die instead of being raped, and she retains her fear of men until the last episode. However, she spends the first half of the show wanting to die, and the last half of the show wondering why she hasn't killed herself yet. As for her positive traits - resourcefulness, an experienced Btooom player, an agile and athletic person, possessing an ability to read and distrust the other players Ryota doesn't have, yet she doesn't actually use any of them, and is content with being the background eye candy and letting the party almost die over and over because of her unwillingness to actually do anything. She actually stands willingly without fighting back several times in the story because it is far more tiring to try to live than accepting torture and a slow death.\\n\\n\r\nBoth Btooom main characters started and ended the 12 episodes in a gray area of undecisiveness, naivete, hypocrisy, retardedness, an inability to learn anything new, and a severe lack of conviction and willingness to act bordering on suicidal fatalism.",

There have been several attempts at such a union, and why not? Should be easy enough. For me, though, these shows never quite hit their mark. However I think I've come across one particular show that did - well, mostly.\r\nStory: 7\r\n\"Btooom!\" as I stated blends the two concepts of Anime and videogames together to form its narrative. Unlike other attempts at this such as \"Sword Art Online\"/\".Hack Sign\" \"Btooom!\" does something different.  Instead of bringing the players intothe game the show brings the game into reality (there is a difference). This works greatly in the shows favor by showing the blurred line between the virtual world, and physical. Anyone who has had a \"addiction\" to gamming, specifically online, knows exactly what I mean. Having the characters being placed in a game like scenario while staying in reality is just more interesting.  The idea of a \"survival game\" has been done before throughout the medium; so I wouldn't blame someone if they said \"the whole idea seems tired at this point\", but what \"Btooom!\" has going for it is its setting. The lush tropical island is ideal for something like this, and is a beautiful paradise filled with danger- human or otherwise. One problem that I had with the show is the jarring fan service. It was just tone conflicting, and destroyed any idea of taking some parts/characters seriously. The show is still a lot of fun, but just seems unsure of itself. Now for the elephant in the room, which is the ending. There isn't one. Of course this is due to the fact that the Anime only adapted a few chapters of the Manga, and not the whole thing (which isn't finished yet). This might be a problem for some people, and I completely understand. I however don't mind seeing as I can just read the rest of the story from the Manga itself, but I thought this was still something worth mentioning. Overall concept is sound, and mostly nails it on the execution. Just some missteps here, and there hold the product back. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe lush, colorful, and vibrant  jungle environment is truly something behold. The sandy shores of paradise is animated beautiful by Madhouse. The character designs themselves were handled well besides for a couple of hiccups (referring to Himiko, but more on that later). No real complaints on this end. My eyes were pleased. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nSo where the OST is concerned it's a mixed bag. Half of it was pretty damn good where the other was...interesting. I personally enjoyed it, but it had this really awkward roaring sax piece that threw me for a loop by how ridiculous it was. However certain action pieces were kept up with some upbeat music, and played off the scenes nicely. The voice acting was also top notch, and no real complaints performance wise. Not much more to say except damn good job. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nSo here is actually one of the best, and worst parts of the show. I'll be breaking this down by focusing on the three main characters: Himiko, Ryouta, and Taira. For the rest of the lot they were a mixed bag of interesting to nonexistent (except for that little kid, sweet Jesus).Anyways so Ryouta is our protagonist for this tale, and I must say I was impressed. Unlike most shows of this breed where the main characters are normal, functioning humans \"Btooom!\" showcases what people who dive an inhuman amount of time into online gaming actually are like. NEETs, losers, social outcasts, people who make the game their life. Online gaming is used as a sort of escape from ones reality for some. Seeing this represented through Ryouta was refreshing. You usually don't see such a realistic take on a matter such as this in the medium. This is a nice transition actually into talking about Himiko. Himiko is actually the biggest problem with the show. The root of the matter is she helps reinforce the clash in tones that I mentioned earlier. Spoilers aside to be short she has this aversion to men, and has a pretty damn good reason why. The issues are in the writer trying to pull something serious using this character. She is over sexualized to a point where it devalues her character so that us as the audience can't take any of her actions seriously. Slight spoiler, but I will be as vague as possible. There is one instance where a character throws a grenade at Himiko, and it ends up bouncing off of her breast with a jiggle/moan. This is one of many instances where the Author undermines any chance of the audience being able to take her serious. We are left at going strictly by face value, which leaves us with basically just a heroine that Ryouta is meant to conquer. This is a shame actually because I find the relationship between Ryouta, and Himiko to be well crafted. For people who use online gaming to escape from reality these online relationships are the real deal. Starved of social interaction true bonds can actually be found via online gaming, which is why the understanding shared between both characters is a solid base for such a romance to exist. I just wish there was more to her as a character than this relationship with Ryouta, and that any attempt to add more to her is undermined by her being over sexualized. Now with that out of the we finally can talk about Taira. I love this man for being so wonderfully Human. Sadly I can't go to much in-depth without going into spoiler territory, but he was probably the best \"character\" in the show. He is with Ryouta for the entire journey throughout the short 12 episodes, and adds some much needed context to the situation. His interactions off of Ryouta are downright relatable, and believable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nI had a ton of fun with this show, and I'd be lying if I said otherwise. The general concept, and the overall execution of the series was really appealing to me. \"Btooom!\" was actually quite the surprise for me, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4\\n\\n\r\n\"Btooom!\" is a very entertaining show with a cool concept, and for the most part pulled it off really well. With a few tone/character issues, and nonexistent conclusion \"Btooom!\" is held back from being truly great. But despite these complaints I had a damn good time with it, and would recommend it. It was worth the watch, and I'm glad I gave it a shot. As always, thanks for reading. \\n",

            "content": "\u2018It\u2019s just a game, right?\u2019 \u2013 Ryouta Sakamoto\r\nBtooom! is a psychological-action-thriller anime which is set predominately in the serious tone.\r\nThe Story: 7/10\r\n------------------\r\nThe \u2018game-then-not-a-game\u2019 setting in anime has been used quite frequently these past years. They\u2019ve become the main storyline in romances, harems, actions, thrillers and even horrors. Btooom! is another type of example, but it\u2019s the most serious one that makes it different to all the others. The story is set like this: A young adult who plays the game Btooom! suddenly finds himself stranded on a mysterious island equipped with a bag of bombs where they need to kill other people, and take theircrystals which are embedded on one of their hands so that they can then leave the island. Basically. Each of the episodes were fitted together in a continuous story, with episode two being the sole exception. Occasionally there would be various flashbacks in scenes where Ryouta is being hit with memories which he had forgotten or times where it shows Himiko\u2019s past and how she mainly got there (mainly episode two). The story had a fine mix of complexity and simplicity in where rules would be well defined but hard to catch on to and where plot twists can be predictable but not foreseen. The thriller in this series was definitely there, though- it won\u2019t send you being unable to sleep at night and the psychological aspect of the anime was executed very realistic-ly. The action part of the movie is actually quite good as well, as there was a good amount of scenes to help not keep you bored. There is little romance in this anime, but for what it did it was actually quite fitting for the overall story. The ending is quite satisfying but leaves giving a note to the viewer that there might possibly be a season two. Not exactly \u2018cliff-hanger-y\u2019 but enough to make you feel like it could\u2019ve been more. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 8/10\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nThe art is substantial for a modern anime, with crisp visual effects and scenes which always seem to be moving. There is always a dark tone which you can feel in every episode- and it stays there for quite a while, adding to the dark psychological part in the anime. Animation panels were fluid throughout the work and didn\u2019t feel \u2018blocky\u2019 at all. Background scenes were done spectacularly- they were made with a mood much lighter than what the anime was, and that contradicted sometimes with what the main characters were feeling at that moment which feels a bit strange for the viewer. Character designs were done quite well, with all of them feeling different and each matching the characters own personality and lifestyle. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: 7/10\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nThe opening song sets the scene for which direction the anime is going into, though, it\u2019s not particularly special in any way it did a favourable job. Character voice actors fit for the actual cast they were playing. It matched their body type, their personality and even hints about what they were planning and such. Background soundtracks were very fitting for the part they played in the anime- being accompanied by action visuals and stunning explosions which added to the enjoyable factor in this series. The ending theme song is not as particularly as catching as the main opening song, but it leaves you with a very good conclusive feeling to the end of an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 8/10\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nEach character was well rounded; each of them had a strength and a flaw which could also be a part of that strength. Apart from the usual anime \u2018mega jump\u2019 where seemingly life-like characters are able to jump across rooftops and such, none of them really had a super power which made them completely godlike to everyone else. All characters reacted to events in a realistic way. Though, sometimes you really have to wonder if you would do what a member in the cast was doing if you had been in their position. Even so, the reason behind certain things were obscure enough to make you interested and makes you feel engaged in the story, as well as being prudent in the characters engagement with everyone else. Almost every character starts as the most seemingly harmless person in the world. Then, they are met with blood, gore and death. At this point they warp into insanity. In a psychological anime, this is called character development. Antagonists in the anime were just as well developed as the protagonists. Their background is clearly defined and explored as a flashback for the viewer, which shows how and why they were placed into the survival arena. \\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nOthers familiar to the psychological genre will see this probably as nothing more than the average. For the newcomer perhaps, this anime is quite the inauguration into the style. Btooom! comes personally as one of my most favourite psychological anime. The combination of well done psychology, chilly thriller, excellent fight scenes with a unique fighting style and exceptional character development really gets it in the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nThe anime itself has a concept that has been drastically overused throughout past years, but even then this one is the most simplest, yet, most complete one with the survival game setting. And for that, I give it a bright, cheerful, rainbow ice-cream sticker.\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: Although it\u2019s not my first time writing a review, I\u2019m still inexperienced with it (with this review being my first spoiler-free review), so please bear with me.\r\nWhen I heard that Btooom! was going to get an anime adaptation, I got so excited about it, being a fan of the manga. Although I\u2019m not a fan of it since the very first chapter, I could say that I\u2019ve been a fan long before the news about its anime adaptation was announced, having read the manga for the first time when Chapter 13 was just released by the scanlators. The idea of people fighting and killingeach other in an uninhabited place for survival might not be original (think Battle Royale), but having an in-game video game turned to a worst case scenario of a dog-eat-dog world feels fresh. So, how does the anime fare compared to the manga? Quite nice; in fact, it\u2019s very good\u2026although not without faults of its own. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the anime\u2019s length, it\u2019s more or less faithful to the manga. It\u2019s very accurate for a 12-episode anime covering the manga\u2019s first 50 chapters (with the last few of them released in a monthly basis), not counting the credits portion of the 12th episode showing a portion of the 51st chapter. Because of that though, the anime has the action compressed in a single episode, with story arcs lasting for only a few episodes. And despite that, some filler parts were added, although for necessity, as the producers would need to air some material at the episode\u2019s remaining minutes. Perhaps, if the adaptation was given 20+ episodes instead of 12, it would\u2019ve explained the story (and the characters\u2019 back stories) in more detail.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, well I can\u2019t say anything bad about the art actually, as it\u2019s quite close to the manga\u2019s. Okay, maybe except the dye job that Ryouta got, with his hair turning to black from brown-black, but it\u2019s nothing major. The graphic scenes in the manga (involving murder, rape, and of course, dead bodies) were considerably toned down in the anime, most likely to make it more TV-friendly. Not that I have anything against it, but I would find it better if they didn\u2019t do a significant amount of content dilution. But then again, doing that would make the anime have more censored scenes than it already has (which is two scenes, throughout the series).\\n\\n\r\nPeople who like similar anime to this would surely enjoy Btooom!, and the long-time fans would still enjoy the adaptation, if they don\u2019t mind the content distillation.",

            "content": "As a warning, I'm just going to start out with saying anime was pretty bad, and it really didn't even have an ending at all.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe overall concept of Btooom!'s story sounded really cool, and was the sole reason I decided to give it a try. It was a great show idea, and had so much potential, but that's really the only thing keeping the story's rating from dropping below a 4. There were no surprises in the plot, and any questions you may have had were given away within the first few episodes. From then on, it was more or less bland battles wherecharacters tried to \"outwit\" each other with bombs, a lot of drama, and a lot of complaining. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite the predictability and slow scenes, the worst part of the entire plot had to be the underlying messages that were practically stuffed down your throat the entire time. This show is dripping with misandry. Every chance it got, it highlighted the wrongdoing of men, and portrayed them all as disgusting pigs without self control. Even the main hero, who clearly had high morals, was \"tested\" and almost lost control when he came in contact with panties. It felt very out of place, was uncomfortable to watch, and got to the point where it was out of control sexist.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nTo be fair, the art wasn't too bad. It's an interesting style, and better than a lot of anime out there. It also used a lot of diversity between the characters, which was nice. However, there were a lot of panels where the character's faces were really out of whack. And for an action anime, the animation was really plain.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nComplimenting the bland art, was the bland music. There wasn't anything special about it. The opening and ending soundtracks were okay. The background music was a little less okay. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the voice acting was even worse. I only watched the dubbed version, but I can almost guarantee you'd be better off watching the original Japanese. I'm a fan of loose translation when it comes to dubs, because the lines just never sound natural when the translation is too direct. But Btooom! falls really short of this, and most of the character's would say awkward sounding things. Certain words they used just didn't fit into their sentences. It was pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nBut this was by far the worst part of the entire anime. Not only did the characters have absolutely no growth, but they were all absolutely awful to begin with. Just the two main characters alone made me cringe.\\n\\n\r\n I don't generally have a problem with the 'damsel in distress' role, but they went a little overboard with it in Himiko's case. There was almost never a moment when she decided to take action, except for the several times she decided suicide was probably her best option. Other than constantly needing assistance, her only other purpose in the show was to be stuffed into the stereotypical tsundere trope. I usually like those kinds of characters, but again, they took it a little too far. She never, ever stopped yelling, crying, slapping Ryouta for being a \"pervert\", and generally just saying obnoxious things. It was really out of place in an anime with such serious underlying tones.\\n\\n\r\nRyouta was no better. I was very confused with his character. On one hand, in all his flashback's he was portrayed as this angsty teenage boy who was rude to his mom and pretty much an asshole altogether. But on the other, while on the island he did nothing but try to help the other players. His thoughts were always super moral, and kind. There was no amount of time between being at home and being on the island where this change in personalities would have made any sense.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nThis anime was riddled with dramatic irony, and at times it was incredibly frustrating to watch because you knew something the characters did not and it should have been SO OBVIOUS, but it literally took them an entire episode or more to figure it out. And of course, when they finally had the moment of realization, they were painstakingly slow to react.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, some of the fight scenes had pretty cool angles, which was definitely entertaining. And I can't write off that it was a little fun to see who would die next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nOverall, this was a less than mediocre anime, and I do not recommend it. Honestly I don't even know why I finished it, and I will not be re-watching.",

(not a typo), is the story of a 22 year old NEET. 5 years ago, Yagami Light picked up the Death Note, only to find out that it is, in fact, a hoax. As a result of failing to rid the world of criminals, Light's father was buried by the Police forces' busy work schedule. His parents then divorced due to the neglect of the family, with his mother remarrying to another male. In the chaos of the family disputes, Light, bored of life and no longer inspired byhis father to continue pursuing to be a Police Officer, found himself the MMO BtOOB!.\\n\\n\r\nPresent time, Sakamoto (his new surname) Light is the top Japan player for BtOOB!. Being in a totally different family environment allowed him to hone his skills as a gamer, using his innate genius for psychological warfare to rise through the ranks in the MMO quickly. \\n\\n\r\n...and that is the untold synopsis of BtOOB!, which would have made the anime much more awesome if that were true. This anime, in actuality, is disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nBtOOB! (still, not a typo) is a typical island survival series with many problems. \\n\r\nIt is a series you might enjoy if you are willing to look pass the fact that :\\n\\n\r\na) physics in this world is shit.\\n\\n\r\nRight from episode 1, you are introduced to bombs that explode RIGHT IN YOUR FACE, but yet are unable to scathe you in anyway unless it is convenient for the plot. The characters in this show prove themselves to be super human, as you often see them escaping bombs at point-blank that are shown to blow off the walls and entire floors, without a scratch. Despite being a NEET, Sakamoto has seemingly unlimited stamina and is able to perform athletic stuns that even normal people can't do. Like, jump off a wall to a hole in the ceiling and climb up. Then use one hand to pull a full grown woman off the lower floor!\\n\r\nAlso, BIM that bounces off BOOBs.\\n\\n\r\nb) ALL the names of side characters and antagonists come from olden days Japan, because the only way to find names for them is to look through a Japanese history book\\n\\n\r\nGAME TIME! Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btooom! and look at the list of antagonist and side characters. NOW GUESS WHICH JAPANESE HISTORICAL FIGURE IS HE/SHE?\\n\r\nAnswers:\\n\r\nTaira Kiyoshi ----> Taira no Kiyomori\\n\r\nMasashi Miyamoto ---> Musashi Miyamoto\\n\r\nNobutaka Oda -----> Nobunaga Oda\\n\r\nMasahito Date ---->Masamune Date\\n\r\nHidemi Kinoshita ----> Toyotomi Hideyoshi (also known as Kinoshita Tokichiro)\\n\r\n                                   Kinoshita + Hide\\n\r\nYoshiaki Imagawa -----> Yoshimoto Imagawa\\n\r\nYoshihisa Kira ----> Shimazu Yoshihisa \\n\r\n                               Anime char is father of Kosuke Kira, so he changed the \\n\r\n                                surname to fit.\\n\r\nMitsuo Akechi ----> Many from the Akechi clan, all names go by \\n\r\n                                Mitsu(insert) Akechi\\n\r\nShiki Murasaki ----> Shikibu Murasaki (only character with different Kanji)\\n\r\nIsamu Kondo ----> Isami Kondo\\n\r\nMisako Hojo -----> Masako Hojo\\n\r\n..... and the list goes on. Characters are given these names for absolutely no reason, nor is the setting in anyway related to these historial figures. No references to the lives of these historical figures were made, so we can only assume that the Japanese history books were the author's sole source material to create names. In which case, i am interested to know the name of his/her children, considering that the author's Surname is the same as the Inoue clan. \\n\\n\r\nc) Despite being a psychological game, characters are stupid and tricks used are too simplistic to be interesting. \\n\r\nPlaced in a survival island, you would expect to see psychological tricks similar to those seen in Death Note. Especially when interesting varieties of BIMs are introduced. Poison gas BIMs are shown to destroy large quantities of forest life and corrode whole human bodies, but the only strategy shown was ''throw it there! the wind is blowing that way!''. Remote control bombs are present,\\n\r\nbut where they are placed make you question the intelligence of the character. (Seriously, under a pile of wooden planks that stands out in an abandoned building?) Even the basic impact-exploding BIM feels useless due to the fact that characters are never hurt unless it works for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nMany other problems can be found in this anime. Truthfully, it was only enjoyable because of the many problems it had, and i'm tired of listing them after the above wall of text. It is like playing ''spot the mistake'', but over 12 25 minute episodes.",

            "content": "Btooom! An old idea with a twist.\r\nFirst person shooters such as Modern Warfare as well as Halo have been around since the turn of the century. However, even with guns, grenades and carepackages, none have ever decided to remove the most essential element of the games- GUNS.\r\nIf I had to explain what it would be like it would be somehow be similar to Ice cream without ice or chocolate cake without cake. However, it is not as bad as it sounds.\r\nStory-8\r\nAs you know, it is a survival game where only bombs are used. There is a set limit to the number of bombs and theyneed to discover how to use it, the rules of the games and what kind of player they want to be. However, not everything is as simple as it looks as the players are no longer playing for fun, but instead, their lives.\\n\\n\r\nIt quite a unique, fun and enjoyable plot. There are many elements to a survival game that I dislike however the goods rule over the bads. It is still possible to enjoy the storyline and it isn't mindless killing.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\\n\r\nIt is good/ok art but for some reason I always see the characters a bit weird and think they look a bit off. Everything else such as the background or effects/ battlescenes are quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is quite nice and the background music fuses with the scenes for a more pleasant experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have unique traits and have doubt, guilt and suspicion. However, I always seem to find the characters a bit too slow and dislike the fact that they are so hesitant and end up in sticky situations because of it. however, it benefits the plot and increases the character development and strengthens relationships.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely a worthy watch if you like watching warfare and survival type game anime. There is some strategy involved but only about as much as there is in a first person shooter (camping, aiming for the head, scope etc.). If you do not like blood and gore you should not watch it as deaths do occur. However, if you are on the border you should definitely at least give it a shot and you just might like it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! Please send me a message if you spotted an error or something. \\n\\n",

            "content": "*mild spoilers*\r\nThe trouble with 12 episode anime not meant for school children is that they often go a bit too far to make it more \u201cmature\u201d. Which is exactly why I felt the rape scenes, sexual assault and abuses were completely unnecessary; they were included for shock value and judging by the positive reviews of how realistic this anime was, they worked.\r\nI\u2019d have given the anime a solid 8 if not for the extremely annoying female MC. Blonde, blue eyes, big breasts and a chubby face \u2013 the animators thought it\u2019d be enough to make men swoon over this sniveling piece of mess, but nah.The girl was a plot device who showed courage and instantly switched to becoming a damsel in distress whenever the plot required here to do so; there was no consistency in her character development. Also for an anime aiming to be realistic, blue irises 1/3 the size of your eyes and breasts 3/4th the size of your face don\u2019t really make the cut. Nor does the fact that your breasts are so cushion-y that a bomb just happened to BOUNCE off them. Wow. Just, wow.\\n\\n\r\nApart from that, my issue with the anime was how a lot of time was wasted on the flashbacks regarding that one high school friend (which didn\u2019t add anything to the final arc) and the fatty\u2019s (who tagged along with Sakamoto) hallucinations. The doctor too was given an inordinate amount of screen time while characters like the psychopathic boy (the most interesting character, in my opinion) was given very little screen time. And then there\u2019re the other players \u2013 what happened to them? There were scores of people on board the plane and none of their stories were touched upon. I mean, you didn\u2019t have to show them in depth but a 1-2 minute explanation for every 3-4 characters would have sufficed. A 10 second preview of who was left barely did them justice. Then there was the question of the disappearances of these people back in the real world \u2013 why didn\u2019t we get to see the police involved and media creating a storm about so many people disappearing at the same time? Why were the games created in the first place and why did they have multiple rounds to them? Also, what\u2019s up with the ending? It went completely over my head + it was too rushed. It was almost as if in the middle of animating the 12th episode, the animators were told,\u201dHey, we\u2019ve run out of our budget so better end the series here\u201d. A lot of people will defend it as being out of the box or some BS, but truth is that it was ill conceived. \\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019ll give where credit is due. The dub VA for Sakamoto did an excellent job. Kudos. Second, despite people complaining about it, I actually found Sakamoto\u2019s character development quite believable (even though his switch to a selfless good guy was a little too much to digest). The only issue I had was the fact that when he met the annoying blonde for the first time, he was tempted to rape her, which seemed VERY out of character for a NEET like him. I mean, you have to show his moral development but do you HAVE to do it by showing him as an almost rapist? \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, some of the maneuvers and battle moves between the participants were excellent, especially when cunning strategies were used. A lot of them made my jaw drop (which doesn\u2019t happen very often). The music was pretty forgettable while the art did drop in quality from time to time. I expected better from Madhouse, to be honest. But it\u2019s still worth a watch if you\u2019re tired of watching 14 year olds as protagonists in probably 99% of the anime out there.\\n",

            "content": "As a reader of the manga, I came into watching the Btooom! anime expecting alot. When I heard it was being made into an anime I was ecstatic. \r\nThe thing about Btooom! that worried me the most was, nowadays, there are alot of \"I'm in a video game!\" anime out there, so for the anime Btooom! to come out now was pretty risky. But, since Btooom! isn't actually in a video game, it strays from the norm, and presents us with something new and exciting. Btooom! story wise, does have a video game undertone, but also has the psychological thrilling side like Battle Royale. \r\nIalways like it when anime has alot of blood and gore in them, and Btooom! definitely has it's fair share. The story basically has to do with blowing each other up to survive, obviously I'm not going to tell you the whole plot, so if the explosions didn't blow people's limbs off, or even blow people up completely(which happens), then this anime would not be worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great in Btooom!, and the characters are honestly the best thing in Btooom!. Characters ranging from murderers, rapists, otakus, NEETs, businessmen, and normal people like highschoolers, are trapped on the island fighting for their lives. The many professions or backgrounds of the characters really makes it interesting to watch this show, and it keeps you engaged every time they introduce a new character. Probably the best thing about this show is the main protagonist. His name is Ryouta Sakamoto, he is a NEET, and is ranked in the top 10 in the world in the Btooom! video game. It is difficult to find a good main character, but Ryouta definitely fits the bill. He is definitely confused at first, and kind of dumb, but that is explained. Since the survival game is based on Btooom!, he has greater knowledge than most other contestants, which makes him a force to be reckoned with. His character is progressively getting more smart and cunning, which is one aspect that makes a good mc.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good aspect about Btooom! is the realism. The notion \"I'm gonna kill you, cause I want to survive\", is portrayed perfectly, and even though not all the characters think like that, it is still really great to see characters who do think that way. Although there is some rape, which is kind of disturbing, I do think that if they didn't have the rape, then some of the character's back stories wouldn't have been as impactful. I'm not trying to turn people away from this anime, I'm just trying to say that if you can see past the disturbing parts, then you will definitely enjoy this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime is not for the feint of heart. As a Btooom! manga reader, I think that you can believe me when I say that this is a must watch this season, if you are looking for a gory story-driven seinen anime. I haven't seen the whole anime, obviously, so I don't know what my final score will be, but right now it stands firmly as a 7(which on my scale is above average).",

            "content": "I found this anime searching for something like Sword Art Online and this one was one of the top recommendations an many sites. I have to say that it's very different from SAO, it's more like The Hunger Games because the action takes place in the real world. \r\nI sincerely don't know why Btooom is not so popular because it has a pretty interesting story with different types of characters and the animation is really good. As I don't want to give any spoilers I will just say that the game follows the rule \"Kill or be killed.\", so the participants need to kill other7 participants in order to get off the island. The only weapons they have are different types of bombs so you have to be smart enough to have a strategy and know how to use them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are ok. Ryouta, the main character is a smart 22 year old who is used to using the bombs, he's caring and a good person but this feature becomes annoying at times because he puts his faith in other competitors without knowing anything about them while all they want is to get kill him and survive. However, I didn't really like Himiko. In the beginning, when she first meets Ryouta she is presented as a strong badass bitch (which is a good thing), but as the series go on she becomes soft and turns into a completely useless scared girl, letting Ryouta do all the job to keep them alive. Still, she helps him a lot but I really wish she had more confidence in herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was very short, only 12 episodes, but at least it wasn't boring at all. The ending is open, they could easily make season 2 because lot of things are yet to happen. I kinda felt that when the anime was over, the real action was about to begin. Although I don't think there will be a second season, I'll keep my hopes. Btooom wasn't truly a masterpiece, so I rated it 9/10. It had some \"glitches\", but that's all I am going to say. You have to watch it to really understand what I'm saying.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nIn my effort to find animes that don't star some stupid little high school boy I decided to focus as much as I could on finding animes starring adults. My search didn't take that long surprisingly when I came across of a description \"A 22 year old...\" that my friend was how I discovered BTOOM!\r\nI decided to give the anime a shot to see if I like it and ended up watching the whole thing in two days. :D Let me first talk about all the things I liked about it.\r\nThe story is about a guy who sits at home playing videosgames all day, he's one of the top players in a game called BTOOM! Eventually he gets kidnapped and taken to an Island where he has to play the game to survive and win back his freedom. I immediately thought of myself and my Killzone 3 addiction. lol! So I can sort of relate to the main protagonist. I also love stories like \"The Hunger Games\" where people are forced to fight each other for their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are a the biggest draw for me as they are all real people...or they feel like real people and not just a bunch of anime archetypes thrown together. The main character, Ryouta is just a regular guy who is very selfish and tends to think only about how things affect him. He's not some goody two shoes but he's not the devil as well. What was interesting to me more than anything was finding out that everyone on the Island was sent there by someone they know and we do get a glimpse into the reasons why some of the characters are there and with the others you can sort of see why, based on their actions, why someone would send them. In other words, some are more deserving of their spot there than others and with Ryouta, it's up to you to decide if he should really be there or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe next main character is Himiko/Emilia a highschool girl who also played the game somewhat and even married Ryouta in the game. When I first saw this character I rolled my eyes because I wanted to avoid the high school kid thing but I was wrong. This girl is as real as it can get and someone I found myself rooting for and relating to a great deal. I love how her character was handled in some of the situations she was in. She was almost raped twice and it made her grow mistrusting of men in general, something that I know a lot of women go through. She just did bounce back and become some sex kitten, nor was she a damsel. she fought to maintain her purity in a world where men were eager to take it away from her. Even if it meant sacrificing her own life. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the characters, even the ones I didn't root for all had something about them that made me feel a certain way about them whether it was love, hate, disgust, etc.The anime did not pull its punches showing how horrible some of these characters are and for a story premise about how these people were chosen by someone \"who wants them to disappear\" that's how it should be. The story is filled with betrayals and so on that constantly remind you of why they are there.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the slow development of the relationship between Ryouta and Himiko. He's not some stupid shy little boy and she's not some super bitch or super sickly sweet chick. They are just two people thrown into a nightmare and they are trying to survive.\\n\\n\r\nNow what I didn't like about it:\\n\\n\r\nFirst I was happy that Himiko was called a foreigner. she was a character with blond hair and blue eyes, it makes sense. Then later she calls herself Japanese?? I don't know many Japanese girls named Emilia or at least that's not a common Japanese name. Why can't she just be a foreigner living in Japan?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime suffers from not being longer than 12 episodes. I would have liked to know more about the other characters and what was going on with the people behind BTOOM and this island version of it. It sort of reminded me of \"Cabin in the Woods\" the way they were monitoring them all. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime did way too many 'That could have been messy\" moments. For example: Himiko manages to toss a bomb off of her while the timer was at 1 sec. That is ridiculous considering the fact that we have seen other characters die from the same bomb type from a farther distance and I doubt she was able to throw it that far that fast in 1 sec. This also happens to the Ryouta a lot. Too many close calls takes away from the suspense of having them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall feelings:\\n\\n\r\nI really like this anime. I love the characters in it ad I really want to get to know more about them. When I finished the last episode I looked for a season 2 because there is just no way this anime is over. It pretty much finishes in the middle! However, sadly I read that it was one of the worst selling animes of 2012. *SMH* of course it is. Why am I not the least bit surprised that this anime was a poor seller. It isn't starring some idiotic high school boy who spends all day blushing at chicks and riding mechs. It isn't starring an equally annoying anime girl who is so sweet she might as well p*$$ maple syrup or a girl who is so emotionally devoid of life she might as well be a sockt puppet. Everybody's problems can't be solve by saying \"Believe in me/us/him/her\".\\n\\n\r\nOh well, I won't hold my breath for another season and considering where it stops off at you would probably be better off not even watching it. here is a manga though so I'll check it out.",

            "content": "\"This is where tomorrow brings a new game. It's time to learn that pain is gain. Ready FIGHT!\"\r\nSurvival games have been very prominent in Japan. Normally, survival games will involve who gets killed and who will become the last man standing. Some of the survival games like Mirai Nikki, Fate/Zero, Danganronpa and others. \r\nSTORY (5):\r\nRyota Sakamoto is a NEET which stands for Not educated, employed or trained. He plays a new game called BTOOOM! and he became one of the top players. One day, he woke up in a deserted tropical island and he realized that he is trapped in a real-life game BTOOOM withother players including Himiko, Ryota's in-game wife.\\n\\n\r\nEach players have a green gem which represents their life and if the gem is removed, the player might die. Basically, it is like a survival game. In order to win, you have to collect all the gems and make it out alive.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, it is your typical survival game.\\n\\n\r\nART (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good. It portrays a dark and serious tone.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6):\\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening song \"No pain, no game\" while I liked the ending \"Aozora\". The opening plays like a rock and roll tune. The ending gives a smooth tune.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are by far the weakest. Ryota and Himiko were predictable. Ryota can sometimes be a badass. Himiko is a typical damsel in distress. Although I sincerely understood her past when rape is a terrible thing to go through.\\n\\n\r\nKosuke Kira was a tragic character who lived a tragic life in his childhood.\\n\\n\r\nMasashi Miyamoto looks like a soldier with a magenta pirate hat.\\n\\n\r\nKiyoshi Taira was a good character who helped Ryota and Himiko survive through this game. Although he didn't leave much impression.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, it is sad to say that the characters are bland and uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (5):\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this show a lot but I did appreciate the way how they make use of people being trapped into a virtual game where the only way to win is to be the last man standing.\\n\\n\r\nEven the ending leaves no resolution to the plot. Normally, I see this in most anime I watched. There was no resolution.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all I have to say. If you enjoy survival games, you might enjoy this too.\\n\\n\r\nI am giving this anime a 5 out of 10.",

            "content": "That feeling when you get when you realized your life is now fucked up, turned from virtual fun into a bloody reality, and your only chance to survive is to trust in no one (I mean it here) but yourself. With only your disposal \u2013 a package of bombs, a strange gem on your hand, and your own intuition, you realize that your life has been changed forever with your new life now residing on a strange island in the middle of nowhere...\r\nSo, what should you choose to do?\r\nA) Panic! Scream and hope someone will help you out\r\nB) Try to team up with someone andtrust in him or her and hope that they will not betray you. \\n\r\nC) Do the opposite of choice B. In other words, when you find the first opportunity, KILL THEM after you've gained their trust\\n\r\nD) Just try to survive. Your life belongs to you and yours only\\n\\n\r\nThese all sound pretty horrifying, right? Well, that's Btooom! for you. \\n\\n\r\nBtooom! is survival horror themed anime series based off the manga of the same name. It doesn't take long for the characters in the series to realize their lives have changed forever to be quite honest. The series takes itself from the very beginning and presents a game senario where in order to survive, you must kill seven other people before they can kill you. It's survival of the fittest and it's a every one for themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe basis of the series is actually based off a game from the anime series itself called Btooom. But now, our 22-years old main protagonist Ryota Sakamoto's life has changed forever when he realizes the new situation of his reality. In fact, he used to be an pro gamer from the game itself. However, his new life puts on the edge between survival and death. The difference? It's real. In other words, there's no pause button, no restart, or bonus lives. No, now you're dead, YOU'RE DEAD.\\n\\n\r\nThe influence of the series seems to be based off of the classic deserted island theme. Only this time, the island itself becomes a battlefield for survival. And of course, series with themes like this isn't new especially in today's anime industry. Series like Mirai Nikki, Deadman Wonderland, and Gantz all have these themes where survival is absolute. Even in manga series, these themes are present such as Psyren, Mahou Shoujo of the End, and Cage of Eden. The fact is that these series all share a common factor in which an ordinary main male protagonist's lives are changed forever after a certain event. These events turn from peculiar, to dangerous, to tragic, to emotional, and one which will leave a memory in their minds for the rest of their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThose characters/contestants:\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's hard to describe them all but let's look at some of the most prominent ones, shall we? We begin with the main male protagonist -  \\n\\n\r\nRyota Sakamoto. He is a 22 year old young man who has achieved mastery and fame in the Btooom world. In the game, he is ruthless but yet cunning as well as being infamous for his skills. In real life though, he is described as a NEET. In other words, he has almost no life but rather chooses to spent them playing the game. Yet, he is a brilliant, caring, loyal, and courageous young man if we look at him carefully especially during his time of playing the real Btooom game in the anime series.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there's Himiko (also known as Hemilia). She is the main female protagonist with a pair of big boobs but with a small interest in the opposite sex. As a matter of fact, she hates the male population in general for fear of her past. It's for this reason that she carries a stun gun throughout the series as a warning sign to any men who dares to approach her. In her mind, every men in the game (and possibly on the planet) is her enemy and that she is their prey. This is especially true in the beginning episodes where some of flashbacks are shown in a dark fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe other contestants of the Btooom game all have different ideologies, goals, and personalities as we see the series progresses. What they all have share in similarities is their desire to win the game and get off the island. As such, most of them are willing to hurt, betray, and even kill to ensure that their goal is achieved; well, most of them anyways. For people like Kiyoshi Taira, there seems to be hope and friendship. But for others, there exists hatred, dominance, power, and intellect as part of their characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, Kousuke Kira, a young boy at the age of only 14 holds a hatred for his father due to his childhood. It turned him into a child murderer and one that lacks empathy. Then, there's Masahito Date who is willing to do anything to ensure his successes throughout the game and becomes its victor. Then, there are some others who uses their brains rather than their brawns such as Nobutaka Oda who has mastered his usage of the Remote Control type BIM. The point is that every one the island wants to get out of it and return to their lives. \\n\\n\r\nYet, they know their lives won't be the same again...\\n\\n\r\nThe games' concept involves survival and thus, there are some science fiction themes mixed in with the brutality of violence, strategy, and a little bit of luck. After all, a game is never easy when there are others with skills that matches your own. To add to the game, there are the BIMs or bombs that players use as their main weapons of destruction. These bombs all have different abilities that can lead to the death of an opponent. It reflects the science fiction side of the series. The horror side? Those would be some of the flashbacks of the characters as well as the reality of what the players face. They realize that it's not a game anymore and once they're dead, it's game over forever.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the series isn't as good as it sounds. Make no mistake because every survival series has a lack of something that should have been there. In this case, Btooom has them too. The series lacks a diversity in which how the game is played. In other words, there is only bombs that are the primary weapons for the contestants. It does play on its main title as \u201cBtooom!\u201d seems to be synonymous to \u201cBOOM!\u201d That's of course what happens when one of those BIMs goes off and your body splatters. As gruesome as it sounds, the series tries too hard occasionally. Furthermore, the main male protagonist often comes with cases of deus ex machina. It's almost as if he is protected by the \u201cmain protagonist should not die\u201d shield. Other problems I've run into the series is that the seemingly rushed sequences. Some of the contestants are killed off in a single episode with little to no screen time given beyond their performance in the game. In other words, they don't stand out as much as the main protagonists. In the end, they're just more like  obstacles for them to get by and almost a way for them to \u201clevel up\u201d or gain experience in the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is fine but nothing unique. What it does reflect though is the nature of the game of Btooom and its survival themes. These include the abandoned buildings, the tropical forests, the shallow waters, the high mountain cliffs, and other things you typically see on an abandoned island.  In fact, most of the characters' outfits reflects this as well in their casual wear and their battle scarred clothing. Most of them are dressed in ways in which they are of themselves which means that none of them were prepared for a real life version of Btooom. And of course, the battlefield has left ashes and bombs going off is usually visually represented with its spectacular explosions. Nothing else is more than that though as I found the artwork to be typical but gets to the point.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is presented with its action paced OST. In most scenes involving action, there is the rhythm. There is hardly any comedic or lighthearted soundtrack in this series as it doesn't fit within those grounds. Yet, it does occasionally have emotional melody especially for flashback scenes of the contestants; more often these are represented as being tragic. The OP song, \"No pain, No game\" by Nano is a classic for this series. That's right, no pain means no game and in the world of Btooom, there's both of that. On the other hand, the ED song, \"Aozora \" by May'n is presented in a more soft paced style especially featuring one of the main characters, Himiko.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Btooom is one of those survival horror series that can be enjoyable but at the same time, becomes frustrating with its strange twists. The cliffhangers and occasionally plot twists have become predictable especially in later episodes. At the same time, there is a feeling of explosiveness (more than just the BIMs) when we watch the action scenes. It's not intelligent but packs that feeling of survival horror where your life really is at stake here. In the world of Btooom, it ultimately comes down to how to play the game. If you play your cards right, you'll win. If not, then game over for you and no second chances.\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nSometimes the decisions we make aren't always the right ones. During the process, though, we often think that there is zero chance that we are doing could be wrong. But as we all know, \"hindsight is 20/20.\" Most of the time, our choices not only cause a radical affect on ourselves but also on the people around us. Taking this in stride, BTOOOM! is an anime about bombs, psychology, and a host of problems that make the entire experience less than favorable.\r\nSTORY\r\nBTOOOM! is a tale involving Sakamoto, one of the best players to play the game the animeis titled after. After a small series of events, he finds himself trapped on an island with other people, having to play the game outside of the virtual world.\\n\\n\r\nThe pivotal aspect of the show that it explores is the way in which characters interact with one another after being placed into such a situation. Many ideas are brought to light and are put into play: how to trust, and not trust, certain people, learning to cope with hope and despair, and choosing the morally sound decision in a particular situation. A lot of the characters represent these varying sides to a degree, and for the most part, it works. But it's a difficult sell because for most of us it is completely unrelatable. Not just having to fight for our lives; predicaments such as dealing with terrible parents or lying to make events happen in our favor are not things that we've all dealt with. I'm not saying that there aren't people like this, as they certainly do exist, it's just attempting to cover so many bases at once is beyond the show's capabilities.\\n\\n\r\nOne major issue that the show has is in the game itself. The issue is that it is too simple. Essentially, it involves two key components: bombs and radar. The show incorporates a sizable amount of different bomb types and some tricks involving the radar. But beyond that, there isn't much to go off of. To combat this, the show tries too hard to make the fights seem too dire. What is presented, then, are a lot of overly dramatic scenarios without much weight behind them. It becomes way too predictable what is going to happen the more the show progresses. And while it tries to be \"cool,\" the lameness of the game and the overly-simplistic battles come off as boring and silly instead.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to fan-service, I'm not one to complain. I often don't mind if it's there or not. However, BTOOOM!'s use of it is rather strange. On the one hand, certain aspects make sense such as Himiko's sexual assault. On the other hand, certain aspects don't make sense, such as the river scene or later on when she is passed out. These are blatant attempts at showing off her body that were sorely out of place.\\n\\n\r\nAt it's core, the premise of the show is quite inane. Basically, any single person can be chosen to be selected for this game for potentially any reason. In other words, it's required of the audience to suspend some belief throughout the show; how the government would allow this, how a gaming company could possibly undertake such an event, etc. The argument here is that for a lot of shows we need to do exactly this. But BTOOOM!'s problem is that it takes itself so seriously that it is quite hard to do. In other words, the show has a huge issue when it comes to being \"super edgy.\" Many instances happen \"at the last second\" or characters escape \"by the skin of their teeth.\" This happens a lot throughout the show, so at some point you become desensitized to it. At that point, you mostly start to laugh at the absurdity of it all.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the art and animation for the show is quite lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the art-style, it mostly sticks to foliage and ruined buildings. It all seems appropriate given the setting and the island the cast is placed in. The characters, however, are pretty much cardboard cutouts. In other words, they are not very imaginative; Sakamoto is skinny with brown hair, Himiko is blonde with big boobs, Date is an older gentleman with glasses, etc. These design choices were most likely chosen to coincide with the \"mature\" vibe the show was attempting to give off, but instead it just makes everyone rather boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, the explosions from the bombs, such as the \"timers\" and the \"poisons\" are nicely animated, given the subject matter. However, both during and outside of the battles, the animation is rather poor. The show loves to do zoom-ins, single face shots, and jittery camera work. Even when the show gives the close-ups nice detail for the teeth, facial contours, and shading, it usually just sticks to mouth movements instead of eye or facial movements.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe psychological aspect to BTOOOM! is at least above average, but the same cannot be said for its characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the worst characters in the show is Sakamoto. A NEET by day, he is the \"10th best BTOOOM! player\" in the world. Yet, even after learning what he was thrown into, he acts as one of the dumbest. Even from the get-go, he doesn't understand or even recognize the bombs and the radar that he discovered he had. Alongside being stupid, he generally contradicts himself; he doesn't want to kill people because it isn't the right thing to do, but sometimes he tries to and other times he doesn't. Essentially, it just depends on the situation at hand.\\n\\n\r\nHimiko is a young woman, who is both beautiful and troubled. Early on, she had the potential to be a rather strong character. Her early background and initial time on the island set her up to be someone who could have overcome her trust issues and have her see some actual character development. Instead, the show chooses to place her in this quasi-state of trust and doubt that doesn't make much sense. She starts off hating men, not wanting to believe anything they have to offer. But by the end, rather than having her become independent or strong enough to deal with issues on her own, she relies solely on Sakamoto, the type of person she previously deplored.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast are mainly used to highlight the different psychological aspects detailed earlier: Taira with worry, Date with doubt, Miyamoto with disregarding morality. For the most part, the supporting cast are better than Sakamoto and Himiko (the mains). However, these characters are simply used to showcase their psychological aspects and nothing more. Among all of them, I would consider Taira the best member of the entire cast, but he is quickly cast aside and only taken back into account at the show's conclusion, which is a massive blunder.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nBTOOOM! suffers a \"Mirai Nikki\" with its OP, in that the OP somehow outclasses the entire anime. The guitar, roughness of the lyrics, and range of the vocals make it great to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is supposed to contrast what BTOOOM! offers. Instead of being dark and tense, it is quite light and soft. It does its job well, even if I don't particularly like the song.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the show is rather forgetful. Nothing notable stands out. The same can be said for the voice-acting. No one in particular does an outstanding job, despite the crazy situations the cast find themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI didn't know what to expect when going into this one. Honestly, I just thought that the title was kind of hilarious. I didn't expect one bit that the show would look so heavily at the psychology behind such a situation. While perhaps not executed as nicely as something like NGE, I think anything trying to go at least a bit more mature is a good step in the right direction.\\n\\n\r\nYet, I often found myself cringing during every episode; Sakamoto \"marrying\" Himiko in the game, Sakamoto jumping sideways during his fight with the young kid, and especially the introduction of the \"giant lizards.\" These parts made me laugh and shake my head all at the same time, because I couldn't believe that the show was making these parts seem \"awesome\" when in fact they were quite ludicrous.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also suffers from a terrible case of continuity issues. A large selection of the scenes depict many near-death-experiences. But the next shots, or at least the explanations behind them, show that they had a lot more time than what is initially perceived. In other words, the anime is trying to make us unfairly feel tension in these moments. I never felt this way during these moments, perhaps because the same trick was used over and over.\\n\\n\r\nI think BTOOOM! had a lot of potential in every department. I'm not sure what happened along the way, but something clearly wasn't done right. Whether this be the world itself being too simplistic or the characters being wholly uninteresting, something better could have been done. Instead, the show activated a \"cracker\" and forgot to throw it, blowing itself up in the process.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, the psychology works but everything else doesn't\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, art style fits the show's tone yet the actual animation is lackluster\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, lame, boring, one-dimensional, or a combination of the three\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, fitting ED, average soundtrack and VAs\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, has its moments but mired in silliness\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

First of all the anime takes place in the real world and not a virtual reality, so somewhat of the opposite of sword art online. We all love a good old game of kill or be killed btooom! offers another one, always been a fan of those sort of animes so it was a good choice for me to pick up. If you are into animes such as mirai nikki or danganropa then consider giving Btooom a tryas well.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Take a handful of psychopaths and some average day human beings, toss them in an island and tell them to kill each other that will get an interesting result. Some of the average day human beings can even find out another psychopath side of themselves. If you were given the option of kill or be killed what would you do? how would you react? This anime explores human nature, how humans can become insane when put into insane situations. Very interesting anime to watch, brief story as that's all the anime is about the kill game. Minor spoiler alert:   ( To twist everything up they were picked to be there by someone they know). \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is what you would expect from a recent anime, modern anime art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Music is decent, not much to say here except good explosion noses form bombs. Opening is decently catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in Btooom! range from psychopaths to normal innocents, this is what makes the anime so interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very enjoyable and interesting series to watch. There is a few slow bits and flashbacks which aren't very action packed but still interesting to watch and find out things about the island and the people. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I reccomend this anime to everyone, it's 12 episodes so not too long and it's well worth it, also good chances of a season 2.",

In this show, its resolved around a game called Btooom, a game where you attempt to kill a team of other players with bombs, obviously not sounding very exciting, that quickly jumps into a real life psychological triller death match on a island, leading you tofeel concern for many of the players at multiple times, leading to a great ride.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8, Not being this shows strong point, the art was actually pretty good, the way they added the Ecchi, in this type of show was where it lacked, and aside from that, the non main character design was poor.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9, Unlike most masterpieces that can use sound to overly make a show more and more amazing, this show still used Sound in the casual way, for expense, nothing bad to say about it, but i have certainly seen better. At the very least, the Opening Song, is one of the best Opening's I have ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:5, This is the part where this show was lacking the hardest, its not that the characters weren't lovable, or had good backgrounds, its more of the fact, that throughout the series, It was like the characters has the inability to pickup on the most obvious details, this literally make me want to scream.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7,  This was both a good, and bad. The good coming from a game about bombs, literally turning into a suspenseful dark as fuck, fun ride, I had no expectations for the way the bombs could be used as good fight scenes, during the beginning of the show, but as you get going, you can see, they really did that well.\\n\r\nThe problem was the needless fan service and needless rape, now, sure it brought decent backstory's and traumatized the characters in a positive way. but it could have been done far better, to a non aggravating standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7/10,  Despite the rather mediocre execution, Btooom, was an extremely good marathon, and i would love to see a second season, It's honestly underrated on MAL, and the reasons for that stand out, but at the same time, it has its own personal redeeming factors in the midst of that. The background stories were great, and if future seasons are released, should show greatly in the future.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: Greatly surpassed my expectations, fun ride, worth even a rewatch some time, and i can't wait for the next season.\\n\\n\r\nFEEDBACK: I would definitely appreciate feedback; it would help me to become a better writer.\\n\\n\r\n#AnimeX",

(cough cough, Sword Art online, Mirai Nikki, battle royal Cough, Cough)\r\nART: 9/10\r\nThe art used in this series is not like the type of art from anime today.

            "content": "Popular anime with the concept of survival game (example: Mirai Nikki, etc) gave birth to a lot of anime who want to be famous too without changing the concept but change it slightly to create originality.They try to be great as their successor. One of those anime is Btooom! , came from studio Madhouse (king of anime studio) makes this anime has a heavy burden to be displayed. A lot of people expecting Madhouse's greatness, which make Btooom! looks very small in their eyes. Btooom!tells us a story of 22 years old Sakamoto Ryouta, this guy is the top scorer of the game Btooom! placed# 10 worldwide ranking. He somehow stranded on an island in the south (The island is somewhere in Indonesia because there are Komodo Dragon in the island). He had a bag with strange equipment (like a bomb), his goal there is to survive a game of death in order to get out of from the island. The concept is the same as the others survival game, they're using some kind of bomb with different types. There is some element of romance in this story that makes this story becomes a little more colorful.\\n\\n\r\nA story definitely has flaws somewhere, no exception in BTOOOM !. Honestly, with this concept Btooom! already able to compete others anime with the excitement that presented in this mind battle.The individual psychological element also exposed pretty well, also the pacing fairly balanced but not perfect. However, this anime has a lot of flaws, one of them is the flashback. It is true, the flashback creates a story or a character more interesting than before. We can know the characters past from there, but the flashback in Btooom! greatly reduce the intense tension that exists and disrupt the plot. There is some fan service anime that came out of it, the bad thing is, they using the main heroine forced to do fan service alone and using it as a plot device. Another downside is the cliff-hanging ending that and not too satisfying, either because of lack of episodes / costs or because the manga still ongoing which makes you all become disappointed because of the ending. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation looks very different from other anime, some characters are drawn in a semi-realistic design, but there is some are not and even though there are some people who said that the character designs like-pieces of cardboard,  but, at least, it still tolerable. Set in the tropical forest, the environment is very beautiful, shiny, and semi-realistic. The explosion of the bomb and other visual effects are also quite good. In terms of sound, Btooom! above average. Opening song \"No Pain no Game\" sung by nano is quite popular among fans and really good to hear. There is nothing wrong of how the seiyuu dubbing the characters, and the sound effects are quite adequate.\\n\\n\r\nFlashback is indeed one of Btooom! flaws in terms of the story, but also gives the power to explore the existing character. We have our protagonist Sakamoto Ryouta, a professional video game player and selfish until the massive character development  happened to him makes to be more concerned with other people. Our female lead, Himiko also got some character development that could sufficient be seen as the story goes. Furthermore, there is some people who also trapped on the island are getting a little character development. We can see the reason why they can be stranded on the island.\\n\\n\r\nBtooom! may be highly favored by fans but may not be preferred by some people. But if you are looking for a unique battle setting that using strategy, and if you are a fan of survival game, this anime is the right choice for you. Although not great, Btooom! managed to attract its audience with the typical concept.",

            "content": "From the summary, I immediately thought that Btooom would be a crossbreed of Sword Art Online (which I watched first) and Battle Royale (live action movie, never read the mangas). As I liked BR a lot and thought SAO was decent, I had some expectations for Btooom, which it spectacularly failed to meet.\r\nAnd the main reason is that both the protagonists are weak minded fools who become dumber and more useless as the show goes on. \r\nRyota, the main male protagonist, is a mixture of so many conflicting character traits he is like 3 different people. He is  rude and violent towards his parentspunching his stepdad and driving his mom to suicide with his attitude, yet he is kind and tries to talk to everyone throwing a bomb at him. He is a hypocrite spouting his pacifist routine crap - he wants to leave the game peacefully by collecting 7 chips from people that are dead - conveniently ignoring the dead people that he himself killed part. He is the \"best\" Btooom player in Japan, yet every fight is a \"oh so this IS a bomb, I thought it was another toy\" discovery for him. He is a shut-in who forsook the real world for the virtual world, yet the only person who is seeking companionship and acceptance, in of all things, a murder game. Yet the most unbelievable trait he has is that he becomes more and more trusting of people in this game of deceit the more he gets betrayed.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female protagonist Himiko on the other hand, is at least consistent - she wants to die instead of being raped, and she retains her fear of men until the last episode. However, she spends the first half of the show wanting to die, and the last half of the show wondering why she hasn't killed herself yet. As for her positive traits - resourcefulness, an experienced Btooom player, an agile and athletic person, possessing an ability to read and distrust the other players Ryota doesn't have, yet she doesn't actually use any of them, and is content with being the background eye candy and letting the party almost die over and over because of her unwillingness to actually do anything. She actually stands willingly without fighting back several times in the story because it is far more tiring to try to live than accepting torture and a slow death.\\n\\n\r\nBoth Btooom main characters started and ended the 12 episodes in a gray area of undecisiveness, naivete, hypocrisy, retardedness, an inability to learn anything new, and a severe lack of conviction and willingness to act bordering on suicidal fatalism.",

            "content": "Videogames, and Anime seem to go hand in hand. A combination of the two should be a perfect union with the similar niche audience they target. There have been several attempts at such a union, and why not? Should be easy enough. For me, though, these shows never quite hit their mark. However I think I've come across one particular show that did - well, mostly.\r\nStory: 7\r\n\"Btooom!\" as I stated blends the two concepts of Anime and videogames together to form its narrative. Unlike other attempts at this such as \"Sword Art Online\"/\".Hack Sign\" \"Btooom!\" does something different.  Instead of bringing the players intothe game the show brings the game into reality (there is a difference). This works greatly in the shows favor by showing the blurred line between the virtual world, and physical. Anyone who has had a \"addiction\" to gamming, specifically online, knows exactly what I mean. Having the characters being placed in a game like scenario while staying in reality is just more interesting.  The idea of a \"survival game\" has been done before throughout the medium; so I wouldn't blame someone if they said \"the whole idea seems tired at this point\", but what \"Btooom!\" has going for it is its setting. The lush tropical island is ideal for something like this, and is a beautiful paradise filled with danger- human or otherwise. One problem that I had with the show is the jarring fan service. It was just tone conflicting, and destroyed any idea of taking some parts/characters seriously. The show is still a lot of fun, but just seems unsure of itself. Now for the elephant in the room, which is the ending. There isn't one. Of course this is due to the fact that the Anime only adapted a few chapters of the Manga, and not the whole thing (which isn't finished yet). This might be a problem for some people, and I completely understand. I however don't mind seeing as I can just read the rest of the story from the Manga itself, but I thought this was still something worth mentioning. Overall concept is sound, and mostly nails it on the execution. Just some missteps here, and there hold the product back. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe lush, colorful, and vibrant  jungle environment is truly something behold. The sandy shores of paradise is animated beautiful by Madhouse. The character designs themselves were handled well besides for a couple of hiccups (referring to Himiko, but more on that later). No real complaints on this end. My eyes were pleased. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nSo where the OST is concerned it's a mixed bag. Half of it was pretty damn good where the other was...interesting. I personally enjoyed it, but it had this really awkward roaring sax piece that threw me for a loop by how ridiculous it was. However certain action pieces were kept up with some upbeat music, and played off the scenes nicely. The voice acting was also top notch, and no real complaints performance wise. Not much more to say except damn good job. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nSo here is actually one of the best, and worst parts of the show. I'll be breaking this down by focusing on the three main characters: Himiko, Ryouta, and Taira. For the rest of the lot they were a mixed bag of interesting to nonexistent (except for that little kid, sweet Jesus).Anyways so Ryouta is our protagonist for this tale, and I must say I was impressed. Unlike most shows of this breed where the main characters are normal, functioning humans \"Btooom!\" showcases what people who dive an inhuman amount of time into online gaming actually are like. NEETs, losers, social outcasts, people who make the game their life. Online gaming is used as a sort of escape from ones reality for some. Seeing this represented through Ryouta was refreshing. You usually don't see such a realistic take on a matter such as this in the medium. This is a nice transition actually into talking about Himiko. Himiko is actually the biggest problem with the show. The root of the matter is she helps reinforce the clash in tones that I mentioned earlier. Spoilers aside to be short she has this aversion to men, and has a pretty damn good reason why. The issues are in the writer trying to pull something serious using this character. She is over sexualized to a point where it devalues her character so that us as the audience can't take any of her actions seriously. Slight spoiler, but I will be as vague as possible. There is one instance where a character throws a grenade at Himiko, and it ends up bouncing off of her breast with a jiggle/moan. This is one of many instances where the Author undermines any chance of the audience being able to take her serious. We are left at going strictly by face value, which leaves us with basically just a heroine that Ryouta is meant to conquer. This is a shame actually because I find the relationship between Ryouta, and Himiko to be well crafted. For people who use online gaming to escape from reality these online relationships are the real deal. Starved of social interaction true bonds can actually be found via online gaming, which is why the understanding shared between both characters is a solid base for such a romance to exist. I just wish there was more to her as a character than this relationship with Ryouta, and that any attempt to add more to her is undermined by her being over sexualized. Now with that out of the we finally can talk about Taira. I love this man for being so wonderfully Human. Sadly I can't go to much in-depth without going into spoiler territory, but he was probably the best \"character\" in the show. He is with Ryouta for the entire journey throughout the short 12 episodes, and adds some much needed context to the situation. His interactions off of Ryouta are downright relatable, and believable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nI had a ton of fun with this show, and I'd be lying if I said otherwise. The general concept, and the overall execution of the series was really appealing to me. \"Btooom!\" was actually quite the surprise for me, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4\\n\\n\r\n\"Btooom!\" is a very entertaining show with a cool concept, and for the most part pulled it off really well. With a few tone/character issues, and nonexistent conclusion \"Btooom!\" is held back from being truly great. But despite these complaints I had a damn good time with it, and would recommend it. It was worth the watch, and I'm glad I gave it a shot. As always, thanks for reading. \\n",

            "content": "\u2018It\u2019s just a game, right?\u2019 \u2013 Ryouta Sakamoto\r\nBtooom! is a psychological-action-thriller anime which is set predominately in the serious tone.\r\nThe Story: 7/10\r\n------------------\r\nThe \u2018game-then-not-a-game\u2019 setting in anime has been used quite frequently these past years. They\u2019ve become the main storyline in romances, harems, actions, thrillers and even horrors. Btooom! is another type of example, but it\u2019s the most serious one that makes it different to all the others. The story is set like this: A young adult who plays the game Btooom! suddenly finds himself stranded on a mysterious island equipped with a bag of bombs where they need to kill other people, and take theircrystals which are embedded on one of their hands so that they can then leave the island. Basically. Each of the episodes were fitted together in a continuous story, with episode two being the sole exception. Occasionally there would be various flashbacks in scenes where Ryouta is being hit with memories which he had forgotten or times where it shows Himiko\u2019s past and how she mainly got there (mainly episode two). The story had a fine mix of complexity and simplicity in where rules would be well defined but hard to catch on to and where plot twists can be predictable but not foreseen. The thriller in this series was definitely there, though- it won\u2019t send you being unable to sleep at night and the psychological aspect of the anime was executed very realistic-ly. The action part of the movie is actually quite good as well, as there was a good amount of scenes to help not keep you bored. There is little romance in this anime, but for what it did it was actually quite fitting for the overall story. The ending is quite satisfying but leaves giving a note to the viewer that there might possibly be a season two. Not exactly \u2018cliff-hanger-y\u2019 but enough to make you feel like it could\u2019ve been more. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 8/10\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nThe art is substantial for a modern anime, with crisp visual effects and scenes which always seem to be moving. There is always a dark tone which you can feel in every episode- and it stays there for quite a while, adding to the dark psychological part in the anime. Animation panels were fluid throughout the work and didn\u2019t feel \u2018blocky\u2019 at all. Background scenes were done spectacularly- they were made with a mood much lighter than what the anime was, and that contradicted sometimes with what the main characters were feeling at that moment which feels a bit strange for the viewer. Character designs were done quite well, with all of them feeling different and each matching the characters own personality and lifestyle. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: 7/10\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nThe opening song sets the scene for which direction the anime is going into, though, it\u2019s not particularly special in any way it did a favourable job. Character voice actors fit for the actual cast they were playing. It matched their body type, their personality and even hints about what they were planning and such. Background soundtracks were very fitting for the part they played in the anime- being accompanied by action visuals and stunning explosions which added to the enjoyable factor in this series. The ending theme song is not as particularly as catching as the main opening song, but it leaves you with a very good conclusive feeling to the end of an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 8/10\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nEach character was well rounded; each of them had a strength and a flaw which could also be a part of that strength. Apart from the usual anime \u2018mega jump\u2019 where seemingly life-like characters are able to jump across rooftops and such, none of them really had a super power which made them completely godlike to everyone else. All characters reacted to events in a realistic way. Though, sometimes you really have to wonder if you would do what a member in the cast was doing if you had been in their position. Even so, the reason behind certain things were obscure enough to make you interested and makes you feel engaged in the story, as well as being prudent in the characters engagement with everyone else. Almost every character starts as the most seemingly harmless person in the world. Then, they are met with blood, gore and death. At this point they warp into insanity. In a psychological anime, this is called character development. Antagonists in the anime were just as well developed as the protagonists. Their background is clearly defined and explored as a flashback for the viewer, which shows how and why they were placed into the survival arena. \\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nOthers familiar to the psychological genre will see this probably as nothing more than the average. For the newcomer perhaps, this anime is quite the inauguration into the style. Btooom! comes personally as one of my most favourite psychological anime. The combination of well done psychology, chilly thriller, excellent fight scenes with a unique fighting style and exceptional character development really gets it in the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nThe anime itself has a concept that has been drastically overused throughout past years, but even then this one is the most simplest, yet, most complete one with the survival game setting. And for that, I give it a bright, cheerful, rainbow ice-cream sticker.\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: Although it\u2019s not my first time writing a review, I\u2019m still inexperienced with it (with this review being my first spoiler-free review), so please bear with me.\r\nWhen I heard that Btooom! was going to get an anime adaptation, I got so excited about it, being a fan of the manga. Although I\u2019m not a fan of it since the very first chapter, I could say that I\u2019ve been a fan long before the news about its anime adaptation was announced, having read the manga for the first time when Chapter 13 was just released by the scanlators. The idea of people fighting and killingeach other in an uninhabited place for survival might not be original (think Battle Royale), but having an in-game video game turned to a worst case scenario of a dog-eat-dog world feels fresh. So, how does the anime fare compared to the manga? Quite nice; in fact, it\u2019s very good\u2026although not without faults of its own. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the anime\u2019s length, it\u2019s more or less faithful to the manga. It\u2019s very accurate for a 12-episode anime covering the manga\u2019s first 50 chapters (with the last few of them released in a monthly basis), not counting the credits portion of the 12th episode showing a portion of the 51st chapter. Because of that though, the anime has the action compressed in a single episode, with story arcs lasting for only a few episodes. And despite that, some filler parts were added, although for necessity, as the producers would need to air some material at the episode\u2019s remaining minutes. Perhaps, if the adaptation was given 20+ episodes instead of 12, it would\u2019ve explained the story (and the characters\u2019 back stories) in more detail.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, well I can\u2019t say anything bad about the art actually, as it\u2019s quite close to the manga\u2019s. Okay, maybe except the dye job that Ryouta got, with his hair turning to black from brown-black, but it\u2019s nothing major. The graphic scenes in the manga (involving murder, rape, and of course, dead bodies) were considerably toned down in the anime, most likely to make it more TV-friendly. Not that I have anything against it, but I would find it better if they didn\u2019t do a significant amount of content dilution. But then again, doing that would make the anime have more censored scenes than it already has (which is two scenes, throughout the series).\\n\\n\r\nPeople who like similar anime to this would surely enjoy Btooom!, and the long-time fans would still enjoy the adaptation, if they don\u2019t mind the content distillation.",

            "content": "As a warning, I'm just going to start out with saying anime was pretty bad, and it really didn't even have an ending at all.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe overall concept of Btooom!'s story sounded really cool, and was the sole reason I decided to give it a try. It was a great show idea, and had so much potential, but that's really the only thing keeping the story's rating from dropping below a 4. There were no surprises in the plot, and any questions you may have had were given away within the first few episodes. From then on, it was more or less bland battles wherecharacters tried to \"outwit\" each other with bombs, a lot of drama, and a lot of complaining. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite the predictability and slow scenes, the worst part of the entire plot had to be the underlying messages that were practically stuffed down your throat the entire time. This show is dripping with misandry. Every chance it got, it highlighted the wrongdoing of men, and portrayed them all as disgusting pigs without self control. Even the main hero, who clearly had high morals, was \"tested\" and almost lost control when he came in contact with panties. It felt very out of place, was uncomfortable to watch, and got to the point where it was out of control sexist.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nTo be fair, the art wasn't too bad. It's an interesting style, and better than a lot of anime out there. It also used a lot of diversity between the characters, which was nice. However, there were a lot of panels where the character's faces were really out of whack. And for an action anime, the animation was really plain.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nComplimenting the bland art, was the bland music. There wasn't anything special about it. The opening and ending soundtracks were okay. The background music was a little less okay. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the voice acting was even worse. I only watched the dubbed version, but I can almost guarantee you'd be better off watching the original Japanese. I'm a fan of loose translation when it comes to dubs, because the lines just never sound natural when the translation is too direct. But Btooom! falls really short of this, and most of the character's would say awkward sounding things. Certain words they used just didn't fit into their sentences. It was pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nBut this was by far the worst part of the entire anime. Not only did the characters have absolutely no growth, but they were all absolutely awful to begin with. Just the two main characters alone made me cringe.\\n\\n\r\n I don't generally have a problem with the 'damsel in distress' role, but they went a little overboard with it in Himiko's case. There was almost never a moment when she decided to take action, except for the several times she decided suicide was probably her best option. Other than constantly needing assistance, her only other purpose in the show was to be stuffed into the stereotypical tsundere trope. I usually like those kinds of characters, but again, they took it a little too far. She never, ever stopped yelling, crying, slapping Ryouta for being a \"pervert\", and generally just saying obnoxious things. It was really out of place in an anime with such serious underlying tones.\\n\\n\r\nRyouta was no better. I was very confused with his character. On one hand, in all his flashback's he was portrayed as this angsty teenage boy who was rude to his mom and pretty much an asshole altogether. But on the other, while on the island he did nothing but try to help the other players. His thoughts were always super moral, and kind. There was no amount of time between being at home and being on the island where this change in personalities would have made any sense.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nThis anime was riddled with dramatic irony, and at times it was incredibly frustrating to watch because you knew something the characters did not and it should have been SO OBVIOUS, but it literally took them an entire episode or more to figure it out. And of course, when they finally had the moment of realization, they were painstakingly slow to react.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, some of the fight scenes had pretty cool angles, which was definitely entertaining. And I can't write off that it was a little fun to see who would die next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nOverall, this was a less than mediocre anime, and I do not recommend it. Honestly I don't even know why I finished it, and I will not be re-watching.",

(not a typo), is the story of a 22 year old NEET. 5 years ago, Yagami Light picked up the Death Note, only to find out that it is, in fact, a hoax. As a result of failing to rid the world of criminals, Light's father was buried by the Police forces' busy work schedule. His parents then divorced due to the neglect of the family, with his mother remarrying to another male. In the chaos of the family disputes, Light, bored of life and no longer inspired byhis father to continue pursuing to be a Police Officer, found himself the MMO BtOOB!.\\n\\n\r\nPresent time, Sakamoto (his new surname) Light is the top Japan player for BtOOB!. Being in a totally different family environment allowed him to hone his skills as a gamer, using his innate genius for psychological warfare to rise through the ranks in the MMO quickly. \\n\\n\r\n...and that is the untold synopsis of BtOOB!, which would have made the anime much more awesome if that were true. This anime, in actuality, is disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nBtOOB! (still, not a typo) is a typical island survival series with many problems. \\n\r\nIt is a series you might enjoy if you are willing to look pass the fact that :\\n\\n\r\na) physics in this world is shit.\\n\\n\r\nRight from episode 1, you are introduced to bombs that explode RIGHT IN YOUR FACE, but yet are unable to scathe you in anyway unless it is convenient for the plot. The characters in this show prove themselves to be super human, as you often see them escaping bombs at point-blank that are shown to blow off the walls and entire floors, without a scratch. Despite being a NEET, Sakamoto has seemingly unlimited stamina and is able to perform athletic stuns that even normal people can't do. Like, jump off a wall to a hole in the ceiling and climb up. Then use one hand to pull a full grown woman off the lower floor!\\n\r\nAlso, BIM that bounces off BOOBs.\\n\\n\r\nb) ALL the names of side characters and antagonists come from olden days Japan, because the only way to find names for them is to look through a Japanese history book\\n\\n\r\nGAME TIME! Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btooom! and look at the list of antagonist and side characters. NOW GUESS WHICH JAPANESE HISTORICAL FIGURE IS HE/SHE?\\n\r\nAnswers:\\n\r\nTaira Kiyoshi ----> Taira no Kiyomori\\n\r\nMasashi Miyamoto ---> Musashi Miyamoto\\n\r\nNobutaka Oda -----> Nobunaga Oda\\n\r\nMasahito Date ---->Masamune Date\\n\r\nHidemi Kinoshita ----> Toyotomi Hideyoshi (also known as Kinoshita Tokichiro)\\n\r\n                                   Kinoshita + Hide\\n\r\nYoshiaki Imagawa -----> Yoshimoto Imagawa\\n\r\nYoshihisa Kira ----> Shimazu Yoshihisa \\n\r\n                               Anime char is father of Kosuke Kira, so he changed the \\n\r\n                                surname to fit.\\n\r\nMitsuo Akechi ----> Many from the Akechi clan, all names go by \\n\r\n                                Mitsu(insert) Akechi\\n\r\nShiki Murasaki ----> Shikibu Murasaki (only character with different Kanji)\\n\r\nIsamu Kondo ----> Isami Kondo\\n\r\nMisako Hojo -----> Masako Hojo\\n\r\n..... and the list goes on. Characters are given these names for absolutely no reason, nor is the setting in anyway related to these historial figures. No references to the lives of these historical figures were made, so we can only assume that the Japanese history books were the author's sole source material to create names. In which case, i am interested to know the name of his/her children, considering that the author's Surname is the same as the Inoue clan. \\n\\n\r\nc) Despite being a psychological game, characters are stupid and tricks used are too simplistic to be interesting. \\n\r\nPlaced in a survival island, you would expect to see psychological tricks similar to those seen in Death Note. Especially when interesting varieties of BIMs are introduced. Poison gas BIMs are shown to destroy large quantities of forest life and corrode whole human bodies, but the only strategy shown was ''throw it there! the wind is blowing that way!''. Remote control bombs are present,\\n\r\nbut where they are placed make you question the intelligence of the character. (Seriously, under a pile of wooden planks that stands out in an abandoned building?) Even the basic impact-exploding BIM feels useless due to the fact that characters are never hurt unless it works for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nMany other problems can be found in this anime. Truthfully, it was only enjoyable because of the many problems it had, and i'm tired of listing them after the above wall of text. It is like playing ''spot the mistake'', but over 12 25 minute episodes.",

            "content": "Btooom! An old idea with a twist.\r\nFirst person shooters such as Modern Warfare as well as Halo have been around since the turn of the century. However, even with guns, grenades and carepackages, none have ever decided to remove the most essential element of the games- GUNS.\r\nIf I had to explain what it would be like it would be somehow be similar to Ice cream without ice or chocolate cake without cake. However, it is not as bad as it sounds.\r\nStory-8\r\nAs you know, it is a survival game where only bombs are used. There is a set limit to the number of bombs and theyneed to discover how to use it, the rules of the games and what kind of player they want to be. However, not everything is as simple as it looks as the players are no longer playing for fun, but instead, their lives.\\n\\n\r\nIt quite a unique, fun and enjoyable plot. There are many elements to a survival game that I dislike however the goods rule over the bads. It is still possible to enjoy the storyline and it isn't mindless killing.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\\n\r\nIt is good/ok art but for some reason I always see the characters a bit weird and think they look a bit off. Everything else such as the background or effects/ battlescenes are quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is quite nice and the background music fuses with the scenes for a more pleasant experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have unique traits and have doubt, guilt and suspicion. However, I always seem to find the characters a bit too slow and dislike the fact that they are so hesitant and end up in sticky situations because of it. however, it benefits the plot and increases the character development and strengthens relationships.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely a worthy watch if you like watching warfare and survival type game anime. There is some strategy involved but only about as much as there is in a first person shooter (camping, aiming for the head, scope etc.). If you do not like blood and gore you should not watch it as deaths do occur. However, if you are on the border you should definitely at least give it a shot and you just might like it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!

            "content": "*mild spoilers*\r\nThe trouble with 12 episode anime not meant for school children is that they often go a bit too far to make it more \u201cmature\u201d. Which is exactly why I felt the rape scenes, sexual assault and abuses were completely unnecessary; they were included for shock value and judging by the positive reviews of how realistic this anime was, they worked.\r\nI\u2019d have given the anime a solid 8 if not for the extremely annoying female MC. Blonde, blue eyes, big breasts and a chubby face \u2013 the animators thought it\u2019d be enough to make men swoon over this sniveling piece of mess, but nah.The girl was a plot device who showed courage and instantly switched to becoming a damsel in distress whenever the plot required here to do so; there was no consistency in her character development. Also for an anime aiming to be realistic, blue irises 1/3 the size of your eyes and breasts 3/4th the size of your face don\u2019t really make the cut. Nor does the fact that your breasts are so cushion-y that a bomb just happened to BOUNCE off them. Wow. Just, wow.\\n\\n\r\nApart from that, my issue with the anime was how a lot of time was wasted on the flashbacks regarding that one high school friend (which didn\u2019t add anything to the final arc) and the fatty\u2019s (who tagged along with Sakamoto) hallucinations. The doctor too was given an inordinate amount of screen time while characters like the psychopathic boy (the most interesting character, in my opinion) was given very little screen time. And then there\u2019re the other players \u2013 what happened to them? There were scores of people on board the plane and none of their stories were touched upon. I mean, you didn\u2019t have to show them in depth but a 1-2 minute explanation for every 3-4 characters would have sufficed. A 10 second preview of who was left barely did them justice. Then there was the question of the disappearances of these people back in the real world \u2013 why didn\u2019t we get to see the police involved and media creating a storm about so many people disappearing at the same time? Why were the games created in the first place and why did they have multiple rounds to them? Also, what\u2019s up with the ending? It went completely over my head + it was too rushed. It was almost as if in the middle of animating the 12th episode, the animators were told,\u201dHey, we\u2019ve run out of our budget so better end the series here\u201d. A lot of people will defend it as being out of the box or some BS, but truth is that it was ill conceived. \\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019ll give where credit is due. The dub VA for Sakamoto did an excellent job. Kudos. Second, despite people complaining about it, I actually found Sakamoto\u2019s character development quite believable (even though his switch to a selfless good guy was a little too much to digest). The only issue I had was the fact that when he met the annoying blonde for the first time, he was tempted to rape her, which seemed VERY out of character for a NEET like him. I mean, you have to show his moral development but do you HAVE to do it by showing him as an almost rapist? \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, some of the maneuvers and battle moves between the participants were excellent, especially when cunning strategies were used. A lot of them made my jaw drop (which doesn\u2019t happen very often). The music was pretty forgettable while the art did drop in quality from time to time. I expected better from Madhouse, to be honest. But it\u2019s still worth a watch if you\u2019re tired of watching 14 year olds as protagonists in probably 99% of the anime out there.\\n",

            "content": "As a reader of the manga, I came into watching the Btooom! anime expecting alot. When I heard it was being made into an anime I was ecstatic. \r\nThe thing about Btooom! that worried me the most was, nowadays, there are alot of \"I'm in a video game!\" anime out there, so for the anime Btooom! to come out now was pretty risky. But, since Btooom! isn't actually in a video game, it strays from the norm, and presents us with something new and exciting. Btooom! story wise, does have a video game undertone, but also has the psychological thrilling side like Battle Royale. \r\nIalways like it when anime has alot of blood and gore in them, and Btooom! definitely has it's fair share. The story basically has to do with blowing each other up to survive, obviously I'm not going to tell you the whole plot, so if the explosions didn't blow people's limbs off, or even blow people up completely(which happens), then this anime would not be worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great in Btooom!, and the characters are honestly the best thing in Btooom!. Characters ranging from murderers, rapists, otakus, NEETs, businessmen, and normal people like highschoolers, are trapped on the island fighting for their lives. The many professions or backgrounds of the characters really makes it interesting to watch this show, and it keeps you engaged every time they introduce a new character. Probably the best thing about this show is the main protagonist. His name is Ryouta Sakamoto, he is a NEET, and is ranked in the top 10 in the world in the Btooom! video game. It is difficult to find a good main character, but Ryouta definitely fits the bill. He is definitely confused at first, and kind of dumb, but that is explained. Since the survival game is based on Btooom!, he has greater knowledge than most other contestants, which makes him a force to be reckoned with. His character is progressively getting more smart and cunning, which is one aspect that makes a good mc.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good aspect about Btooom! is the realism. The notion \"I'm gonna kill you, cause I want to survive\", is portrayed perfectly, and even though not all the characters think like that, it is still really great to see characters who do think that way. Although there is some rape, which is kind of disturbing, I do think that if they didn't have the rape, then some of the character's back stories wouldn't have been as impactful. I'm not trying to turn people away from this anime, I'm just trying to say that if you can see past the disturbing parts, then you will definitely enjoy this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime is not for the feint of heart. As a Btooom! manga reader, I think that you can believe me when I say that this is a must watch this season, if you are looking for a gory story-driven seinen anime. I haven't seen the whole anime, obviously, so I don't know what my final score will be, but right now it stands firmly as a 7(which on my scale is above average).",

            "content": "I found this anime searching for something like Sword Art Online and this one was one of the top recommendations an many sites. I have to say that it's very different from SAO, it's more like The Hunger Games because the action takes place in the real world. \r\nI sincerely don't know why Btooom is not so popular because it has a pretty interesting story with different types of characters and the animation is really good. As I don't want to give any spoilers I will just say that the game follows the rule \"Kill or be killed.\", so the participants need to kill other7 participants in order to get off the island. The only weapons they have are different types of bombs so you have to be smart enough to have a strategy and know how to use them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are ok. Ryouta, the main character is a smart 22 year old who is used to using the bombs, he's caring and a good person but this feature becomes annoying at times because he puts his faith in other competitors without knowing anything about them while all they want is to get kill him and survive. However, I didn't really like Himiko. In the beginning, when she first meets Ryouta she is presented as a strong badass bitch (which is a good thing), but as the series go on she becomes soft and turns into a completely useless scared girl, letting Ryouta do all the job to keep them alive. Still, she helps him a lot but I really wish she had more confidence in herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was very short, only 12 episodes, but at least it wasn't boring at all. The ending is open, they could easily make season 2 because lot of things are yet to happen. I kinda felt that when the anime was over, the real action was about to begin. Although I don't think there will be a second season, I'll keep my hopes. Btooom wasn't truly a masterpiece, so I rated it 9/10. It had some \"glitches\", but that's all I am going to say. You have to watch it to really understand what I'm saying.",

            "content": "Despite Moral Values which are supposedly instilled in all human beings, Violence and Lust are two sensations that will always be prevalent no matter how much of a saint you claim to be. Taking the violence route, deathmatches  are activities that people enjoy watching to appease this sensation, however since this activity is not something that is practiced in a modern world anywhere, most shows like Mirai Nikki for example will try to involve some sort of supernatural event to give the story more depth. Therefore it was with great surprise when I stumbled upon btooom and discovered it threw away such ethics andpresented itself as a genuine real-world deathmatch, but without this monumental backing, is it something to take seriously?\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto Ryouta is an unemployed 22 year old who spends most of his time alone at home playing the popular online game btooom, which is an online MMO where players use bombs to battle each other. With his skill he has risen to the status of one of the 10 best players in the world. However, one day he awakens to find himself on an island and later on discovers the island is a real world representation of his popular btooom game, with playing the game in real life his only chance of escape. On the surface, the story of btooom seems a bit\u2026silly, attempts at indulging a friend will have them questioning the very concept of the show, \u2018a deathmatch using bombs\u2019 isn\u2019t something that is assured to strike a fancy with most people, however if you should give the show a chance you\u2019ll soon discover it falls under the \u2018don\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u2019 category.\\n\\n\r\nThe rules, mechanics and strategies in btooom unlike the story are actually very well thought of. Firstly we have different types of bombs, the series encourages the use of strategies and an impressive aspect is how a player has to choose his strategy depending on what type of bomb they possess, players have to switch between stealth, guerrilla or trap tactics and even sometimes deception, and most times choosing the right tactic may be the difference between life and death. Players also have surgically attached to their hand a sonar system that when used gives them the ability to detect other players over a certain distance, an impressive fact about this is that you can only detect a moving player, a motionless player will not be detected by the sonar but in turn the player who uses this ability will be detected by other players within its range, motion or motionless. This places the heavy burden of decision making and also brings forth the idea of taking a gamble in order to survive, so players ultimately have to decide whether an action is worth it or not before taking it, a great deal of rationalism is required.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, btooom\u2019s choice of presenting itself in a modern world setting with a slight emphasis on the reality that it is an event that could take place in real life may be its undoing. The series gives us a weak excuse as to how and why they ended up on this island and when viewed from a different angle it won\u2019t be wrong to view the story as a weak idea of giving us a reason to watch people kill each other. However if you were to overlook the weak story introduction, btooom has some interesting concepts.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to leave the island however, a player must gather 8 chips surgically attached to each player and can only be removed when a player dies. This revelation ultimately encourages alliances but the real interesting question the story poses on the players here is; who do you trust? We all know that humans are quick to betray and go for the easy way out and this aspect of the show although not playing too big of a role as it should have, didn\u2019t disappoint. The show introduces the players to us as everyday individuals but it showed very little of the psychological strain brought about by their situation. It did indeed showcase this initially but the characters seem to accept the reality of their situation too quickly and move on while any normal person might breakdown from the experience. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style used in btooom is very good indeed, as expected of powerhouse studio madhouse, the art is very dark as expected to depict the nature of the show and the quality hardly drops for even a second. Character design is also done very well with art style similar to shows like deathnote, all the characters look wonderful and through the art one can already spell out any future intentions a character may harbor. Animation was also quite decent; those of you who will slow motion play an explosion of a bomb will be impressed at the reality of the visuals. The most important factor in the animation aspect of the show is the timings of the bomb, being a manga adaptation, we only see a bomb thrown in one panel and exploding the next but in the anime, timing is an essential issue and it wasn\u2019t something that was slacked on. However there are times when the countdown is slower than usual thereby giving our protagonists the chance to make some last second escapes, a deux ex machine from the animators. The blast range of the explosions also seemed to be disproportional a times, as a bomb of the same type will cover a large blast range in one scene but a smaller one in another. \\n\\n\r\nNano sings the OP theme titled \u2018no pain, no game\u2019, an upbeat j-pop song that went well with the mood of the show. The ED entitled \u2018Aozora (blue sky)\u2019 by May\u2019n is  a slow paced j-pop song that seemed out of place for a show that showcases people trying to end each others lives. Sound effects especially that of the explosions were done well with seemingly tiny variations between the type of bomb used, the sound of the sonar in particular I found to be quite resourceful.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show seemed to lack depth, the series was unable to instill in its viewers a reason to care about them even when thrown in dire situations, it did try to show us a bit of their past but it was mostly an afterthought that did very little to explain why and how they behave in the present. Our protagonist, Ryouta is your average shut-in who believes the whole world is as is viewed on the internet. As such when thrown into this situation he still holds this strong sense to do right and also easily has faith in others and quick to trust, although this quality of his may tend to be a slight annoyance as he puts his faith in people who obviously wish to cause him harm. Himiko, our female protagonist was introduced to us as a school girl with a dark past, the series went a bit overboard to demonstrate to us the harshness of the island as himiko is more than once subject to lustful intentions of some male players in the game and some female viewers may find themselves unhappy with this addition.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it had a somewhat weak story telling initially we can\u2019t deny it has a sense of originality and despite its adopted antics from a few video game mechanics it still manage to feel fresh. If you\u2019re looking for a deathmatch anime, there are better choices but btooom is definitely amongst one of the decent ones. In my opinion though, btooom may have been released for the wrong media type, it is indeed a decent anime but with a few improving of storytelling concepts and certain mechanics, just as depicted in the anime, btooom would have made a wonderful video game.\\n",

            "content": "Now the anime has ended, btw its a good thing the said apocalypse didn't come true  , how did I rate it????????????????I rated every category a 6. So why give it a devil's number? Well, the thing about this anime, is that it gave me more of a mix reaction to it, it something like a that you can't appreciated it fully and you can't hate it totally. Ok so what we have here is an anime whose theme is a mixture of your typical on-line FPS game and it's plot  basically has a lot of  combined similarities  from the movie\"The Condemned\"  and \"The Hunger Games\" which people where sent into some hellish contest where it is a matter of life or death. However the director of this anime, Kotono Watanabe's method of killing were too lame, e.g. a stab from Date's back with a sickle would have already damage his spinal cord, puncture his lungs and cause sever bleeding, instead he was able to move around like he only have a scratch, beside don't we the audience wanna see him suffer an agonizing dead? Here are other lame killing facts in which studio Madhouse should have considered:\\n\\n\r\n1. Komodo dragons, usually do not stalk their prey after they've bitten them, usually when a prey was bitten the komodo dragon simply just follow the scene and it takes 2 weeks before the prey dies of infection from the dragon's bite,  dragons tend to stay away from humans, in fact most encounter are usually accidental, also these big lizards are also scavenger which means that the will also eat the carrion and human corpses.   Oh, and some people do consider the Komodo dragon a delicacy, in fact some people in Komodo Indonesia did one time hunted these big lizards for food.  \\n\\n\r\n2. The Homing BIM should have 2 counter rotating propellers, now, I'm no physicist, but it is a fundamental law that every hovering aircraft be it a toy, a gadget should follow. It is the same principle as a Helicopter. \\n\\n\r\n3. In order for a  corrosive-BIM to be effective on a 6 block radius, the amount of sulfuric acid that should be used would around 30,000 gallons.\\n\\n\r\n4. If someone has to have all 4 fingers cut away simultaneously that person would die from a loss of blood unless the cut fingers were cauterize immediately. And to have one's hand blown up would also kill a person due to massive blood loss so it is quite odd that  Shiki was able to survived after loosing her hand from a self inflicted explosion.   \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters in this anime represent the everyday people whom we know or whom we encounter that we either don't like, don't get along and those that we wanna get even with,  which we wish that they go to hell, like:\\n\\n\r\nKiyoshi Taira: a boss from hell.\\n\\n\r\nMasashi Miyamoto: a toughie, a war freak and a criminal.\\n\\n\r\nNobutaka Oda: Sakamoto's classmate and a typical asshole.\\n\\n\r\nMasahito Date: a malpracticing doctor.\\n\\n\r\nHidemi Kinoshita: a typical everyday bitch.\\n\\n\r\nK\u014dsuke Kira: a delinquent.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuo Akechi: a sex perv.\\n\\n\r\nS\u014dichi Natsume: a defense lawyer in which the police and people seeking justice would love to hate.\\n\\n\r\nHimiko: The campus scapegoat, in which she wasn't suppose to belong in hell.\\n\\n\r\nRy\u014dta Sakamoto: a good for nothing NEET and if I were her mom, I won't even hesitate to nominate him as a way to kick him off the house. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment and overall of this anime maybe a bit lame on the action side but still this is one lame action pack anime that is still worth watching, but not something that deserves a high rating, then again it is also something that should not have a low rating as well. Mainly because Madhouse studio focuses more on the evil of man that the blood and gore. So overall this anime is fairly entertaining. If any of you don't get how I've rated every category of this anime, the here it is again:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Same\\n\\n\r\nSound: Same\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Same rating as the first one.\\n\\n\r\nand so does the enjoyment and overall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYa know if such thing like that does happen in real life then there will be one MAL user in which I'll make a placement for him/her to be nominated to go to that kind of hell. Then again he or she ain't worth it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "So this is my first serious review, and the only reason I'm doing it is because this show was so  good it drove me to write one as I feel like none of the other present reviews quite explain or appreciate the depth of this show.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nSo I know that the videogame-turns-real-life idea has been used quite a bit but never in this way, btooom uses several unorthodox things to develop character and storyline. I'm going to say something that is going to sound very strange. The rape in btooom is amazing. Now I sound like a psycho but I mean it in adifferent way, what I mean is that the social stigma we call rape is displayed amazingly in btooom, it is brought about by male sexual urges and instincts, in an environment where no rules exist males are shown oppressing the weaker females in  the show, this develops a strong character with Himiko (one of the main characters) as her life even prior to the game was destroyed by sexual assault and male lust. Now my favourite part about this is that Himiko has become fearful of all males and cannot trust anyone, but our trusty protagonist is the absolute image of what is just even among chaos, he stands out above the rest as a shining  example of humanity and morality. The juxtaposition of the protagonist and his environment is drastic and constantly displayed. Other things to note about this plot is that it is certainly unfinished and it is absolutely FULL of cliffhangers and it is quite possible for you to dislike the ending because it leaves so much for the second season (which I really want).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art in this show is really good, only thing I would complain about would be the digital painting on some of the bush backdrops, I'm a digital painter myself and I can tell that they didn't spend enough time on them. Other than that, high framerate, cute girls, good breasts and good explosions.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nSound is where this show stands out again, amazing OP and good ED with really upbeat and hyper drum and bass tracks for the fights. Also the sounds of the explosions are done really well. As  far as voice acting goes I think they did a great job as the protagonist sounds great along with the girl and the scenes of crazy people spouting mental stuff sounds like they're actually mental.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are VERY complex, mainly concerning the protagonist and the girl. The girl's side is riddled with her past experiences of sexual assault while the protagonist's is more to do with him being violent and ungrateful nerd who doesn't appreciate what has been done for him. The interactions between these two is what makes the show what it is. I can't think of a more beautiful romance than with a girl who is afraid to open her heart for such reasons, and it being overcome by such a protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThoroughly enjoyable. Great plot, amazing characters, deep themes concerning human instinct and modern human values.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I wasn't really sure I was going to like this anime after the first episode. The main character was a bit of a prick, and I kept drawing parallels to other anime that are also wildly successful. It struck me as a mash-up between No Game No Life and Sword Art Online, with a less interesting focus game. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised as I watched it all. The character's develop in a meaningful way, it's as action packed as anything I've ever seen, thoughtful, and it even manages to tug some heart strings.\r\nStory: The story developed really strongly in a way thatmade it stand out on it's own.  People are thrown onto an island where the only notable prize is survival. Allegiances form and dissolve, enemies are made, fights are had and love is found. Not only does it keep you on the edge of your seat, it also makes you wonder. Why are they there? Who can be trusted? Who is behind this twisted game and why?\\n\\n\r\nIt's not the most original of themes, granted, but it does what it does quite well. The story it tells is to the point and told well, and sets itself apart in a very good way. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint here is it seems to progress a bit too fast. It's a machine-gun of events that simply never relents. If there's not a fight happening, there's about to be one in the interest of survival. If they're eating they're also thinking of the next betrayal, or past trauma. There is zero filler, no smelling of the roses at all. This isn't entirely a bad thing, but I feel like it was 24 episodes worth of events crammed into 12. Still, some people will absolutely love that and I'm certain it was a conscious decision on the creator's part.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the plot armor is strong in this one. Explosions are huge but unless they go off right under the victims feet they appear to do very little. Shrapnel and shock waves don't exist, and the protagonists seem to have some type of super-healing abilities and are almost immune to concussions altogether. Komodo Dragon's and knives seem more powerful than the BIMs massive explosive force as far as that is concerned.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is beautiful. The fight scenes are well choreographed, if a bit lacking in the plausibility department. The characters are great and the environment is stunning. \\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is good, though nothing incredibly notable. The voice acting is done well also (I should mention here I watched the dub), and the sound effects are top-notch. Really nothing to complain about here at all.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Initially, the main protagonist Sakamoto Ryouta really bugged me. That being said, the character development is fantastic. I managed to hate him a little less every episode, and he eventually became a decent human being - if a bit naive. \\n\\n\r\nHimiko, the female protagonist, manages to develop a lot as well. Enduring a hard past and present, learning to want to live again, and learning to trust again. I really enjoyed this character, because she made me feel for her, as well as  root for her.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists range from just-trying-to-survive to completely evil. There's a great range of characters, even if there's not a huge number of them. Everyone has their own story, and while said story isn't always completely explained, it's always apparent in their actions. \\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I definitely enjoyed this series, and eagerly await a second season. It might be a while, especially if they want to keep up with the pace they've set in the first season. I feel it will we well worth the wait however, and I'm excited to see where the story goes next. That's not to say there absolutely must be a second season for this to be enjoyed, because it does stand up on it's own just fine. However, there's not much of a resolution either and doesn't feel anywhere near complete.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Well thought out and well executed, though not without it's flaws. Definitely a good idea to watch if you enjoy survival action anime with a gaming base.\\n\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "Let's start with saying that BTOOOM! is very interesting. I prefer the survival genre too so yeah ^^\r\nStory:\r\nBtooom! doesn't have the most original story, but it's not a complete cliche. Just know that it's a typical survival anime, but a little different. On the other hand, you might think it's quite original because the only weapons they use are bombs.\r\nNow about the good stuff: they worked the story out so well. I can't really explain it myself but the anime is almost perfect with the exception of a few things, but I'll tell you about that later.\r\nArt:\r\nYupp, I gave the art a 10. Why? Well,I just love it. And take a good look at Himiko's face everytime they show it. The way they drew it is very cute but not too much, haha.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI loved the opening music, but disliked the ending music. The opening was very much related to the whole anime itself, but the ending was a bit too soft. \\n\r\nThe sound itself was good, so here you go.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is where it actually gets interesting. The annoying characters get eliminated (IMO...), and the remaining characters  are interesting as hell. ESPECIALLY Kira. Seriously. I love that little psycho. He's creepy, he's cute and he has an interesting story. Sakamoto is also pretty interesting and it's cool to see him change. It kinda surprised me that he was so naive and that he liked helping others so much, cause we saw how he acted towards his family and the change was a bit too early, but it's not so much that you'll be bothered, so don't worry.\\n\r\nHimiko's 'change' had a perfect timing. She doesn't trust men for the half of the anime and after that she really starts trusting Sakamoto bit by bit, but she's still a bit scared of men, and that's perfect. She doesn't overdo it, and that satisfied me very much. She stays who she is. And that's with all the characters. Well, not all, but almost everyone. They stay pure and real. \\n\r\nTo make a long story short: the characters are very interesting, some have an interesting background and they create interesting fights. They're very realistic. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nHell yeah, definitely a 10! Btooom! doesn't fail in entertaining you! It's so nice to watch. I got excited for each episode, haha. Seriously, there's not a SINGLE moment that you'll be bored, I promise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nA 9. Cause btooom! isn't perfect, unfortunately :c\\n\\n\r\nNegative points:\\n\\n\r\n- the ending went way too quick. The ending was good, but too hasty. I just hope there will be a second season, but if not I'm definitely not satisfied with the outcome, just because it's too hasty. I expected like 6 more episodes, too be honest. And btooom! isn't necessarily a slowpoke anime, but no, they could've made even 10 more episodes if you ask me! \\n\\n\r\n- A bit more attention for other characters, thank you? For example: Kira. IMO, he was the most interesting character and we only get a short meeting with one little fight and then we only see him once (actually twice, but the ending doesn't count cause they show everyone who's still alive) more? So hasty, seriously. And Oda seems so important at the last few episodes, but except for Sakamoto's past he isn't important. Don't let them fool you.\\n\\n\r\n- Yes, haste. Haste is btooom!'s worst point. They could've shown us more interesting things with the other characters, and not just Sakamoto and Himiko.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, GREAT anime, but not perfect.",

            "content": "Here we go again with yet another survival game anime and a Battle Royale wannabe. Notice that these types of shows instantly become popular, no matter how badly put together they are. And I'd say this one is definitely bottom of the barrel material.\r\nThis is a spoiler free review.\r\n*Story* 3/10\r\nIt's about an unemployed shut in, in his twenties who does nothing but play a video game called \"Btooom\" all day long and we're told he's one of the best players in the world. One day he suddenly wakes up on a deserted island with a bunch of other people who were kidnapped and forced tofight for their lives in a battle royale that's based on the same video game he was playing. This game is like a 3rd person shooter, but without any guns.. Just bombs.\\n\\n\r\nSo as you can imagine, what follows is a bunch of people with different types of bombs trying to survive and blow each other up. There's a bunch of gore, mayhem and whatnot.\\n\\n\r\nThe first question that comes to mind is - what kind of society do these people live in that allows for something like this to happen in the first place? Well, for all we know they live in modern day Japan.. You know, that first world democracy.. In Battle Royale for example this was accounted for since it was a reality show in a Dystopian setting. Here, dozens of people get kidnapped in broad daylight (without being too secret about it either) and there don't seem to be any repercussions. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, this whole idea of having different types of bombs that are shared randomly amongst the players is just there to give you the illusion of strategy. Since some are clearly more useful than others. For example, you have a timer bomb that only explodes 10 seconds after you press it or a bomb that explodes upon impact or one that simply implodes when you press a button. Heck you even have a homing bomb. If you think that all of these bombs are somehow equally strong just because their radius is different then you should have your head examined. They try to fool you in to thinking that a bomb with a weaker explosion has some sort of disadvantage, when in fact even the bomb with the weakest explosion in this show has more than enough power to instantly kill a man or at the very least disable him and allow you to easily finish him off barehanded. Not to mention that a shorter radius is also effective if you don't wanna hurt yourself of course. Not that it matters anyway, since the bombs' radius is also fairly inconsistent - when they explode next to a main character, nothing happens and they always miraculously survive whether it's because their opponents can't aim or because they dodge it somehow (sometimes in very absurd ways) while the secondary ones are cannon fodder that almost always die instantly. So much for fair game.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that's dumb about it is how the show tries to make a distinction in functionality  between the online game and the real life one and falls flat on its face in that regard. If it were the slightest bit realistic, all of the characters would be deaf from so many explosions blowing up next to their faces by the half way point or having debris of some kind injure them, which never happens of course. Normally I wouldn't nitpick that if it hadn't hammered in how \"THIS IS REAL LIFE! NOT A GAME!\". But the truth is, I've seen videogames from over a decade ago that are more realistic than this. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of all that, it's paced chaotically and it ends in the middle of nowhere while most of everything is left unresolved. Will it get a 2nd season? I don't know, but for now there isn't one so what we have here is 12 episodes that mostly consist of build up with no actual payoff.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Characters* 2/10\\n\\n\r\nYou have the blandest of main characters that can only be described as a self insert protagonist. The evidence is clear that this guy is there just for self insertion and that's the only way to define him. Nothing about his character adds up. When he's first introduced he's just a sensitive and naive shut in that doesn't want to hurt anybody, but then we're shown flashbacks where he's actually a violent thug and an abusive son who hates his parents. One moment he's being polite to an elder he meets on the spot and in the next we see how badly he treated his parents. We're also told that he's one of the best Btooom players in the world and yet when he plays the real life version he seems completely clueless. Which is a poor attempt to let the (just as clueless) audience insert themselves, even at the price of having character inconsistencies. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast aren't much better either. Some of them have random mood swings that come out of thin air that aren't convincing in the slightest. For example, you have this jackass lawyer who's horrified by witnessing a psychotic kid butchering frogs in one episode and in another he becomes a sadistic lunatic himself who's okay with torturing teenage girls. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the main female is a dumb blonde with a certain traumatic past who (of course) eventually sees the light thanks to the none personality of our male lead. And yes, it plays out in the most cliched way imaginable so it's not much of a spoiler. You'll see it coming from a mile away.\\n\\n\r\nThey also try to make you sympathize with a kid rapist and murderer because he has an abusive dad who's slightly less crazy than he is. And much like everything else, also comes off as ridiculous (not to mention downright wrong).\\n\\n\r\nThe only decent character in this show is the father figure Kiyoshi Taira. I won't give anything away, but let's just say that there's a fairly good amount of focus on him, he's not a 1dimenseniol lunatic and his actions actually made him appear relatively complex and interesting. Heck, I even found him kinda sympathizable and his character arc felt complete. \\n\\n\r\nBut unfortunately, one supporting character that was done right can't save an entire cast of bland plot devices and lunatics who kill people without batting an eye. Most of which get no closure or development anyway since the show is incomplete for now. All most of them get is an introduction and some very brief coverage.\\n\\n\r\n*Art* 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork certainly looks quite polished and similar to Death Note's for some reason. The colors are bright and the characters blend very well with the beautiful (albeit repetitive) backgrounds. The character designs themselves are certainly nothing special though, and the animation is far from being lively or fluid. Even the action is rather choppy and the directing seems to be quite amateurish (and I wasn't surprised to later discover that this is indeed this director's first work). Also for a show that's named after an explosion, the explosions in this show are not all that impressive either.\\n\r\nOverall it looks ok I guess and the production values in general are fairly decent, but there's certainly nothing impressive about it for the time it came out, nor does it stand out artistically in any way.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound* 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is a pretty good rock song with a nice range that sets the show's tone quite well and the ending song is much softer and although I wouldn't call it great, it also fits in fairly well. I can't really remember much of the soundtrack, but I guess it got the job done. What I find a little problematic though are the sound effects that are repetitive to the point of becoming a little distracting (albeit sounding quite realistic) and the voice acting is a little over the top and silly at many points.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment* 4/10\\n\\n\r\nMeh.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 3/10\\n\\n\r\nPretty skippable if you ask me.\\n",

            "content": "A show with a lot of promise, BTOOM! does little to showcase that potential depth. \r\nBTOOM! features a slew of characters who were selected by those closest to them to participate in a game called BTOOM! It's a survival challenge, where the participants are armed with miniature explosives called BIMS (basically small bombs with varying effects) and then must kill the other players. Each player has a green gem imbedded in their hand. In order to get off the island, a player must gather 8 gems (seven including their own) and in order to get the gem, that player must first die. For the mostpart, the show follows a guy named Sakamoto, a NEET (not-in-education or work training), who endeavors to escape the island without killing. As the show goes on, Sakamoto meets other players, some who are willing to kill and others who aren't.\\n\r\nThe basic concept of 'kill or be killed' is nothing new, although I like the video game spin on it. The BIMS themselves are neat, making the battles more than just people shooting at each other. I originally wasn't impressed with them as the first few you see are just standard \"time-delay\" or \"explosive\" types. As the show goes on though, more complicated/powerful BIMS are introduced. This makes the confrontations MUCH more complicated and force the characters to think on their feet. \\n\\n\r\nI also really dig the idea that the people who have been forced into this game are being 'punished'. Sakamoto, as a jobless NEET, just plays the video game version of BTOOM! all the time. When his parents try to talk to him about getting a job, he flips out - and so his mother, at her wits end, chooses to just get rid of him. That is some hardcore stuff man. Ultimately, a situation like this really highlights a persons morals and beliefs and, as the audience, I find it very interesting to see people that flawed. No one is perfect and I think BTOOM! generally does a good job of showcasing this.\\n\\n\r\nExcept in regard to our star, Sakamoto. When the show opens, it takes several episodes for Sakamoto to accept his situation. I know, part of this can be written off as shell shock. After all, who would believe that you were kidnapped and are now forced to kill people in order to survive? That's some weirdo crap man. But given that Sakamoto is #3 in Japan for the video game, I can't help but think that he should have acclimated a bit more quickly to the circumstances. During the first confrontation, he continually tries to talk down his opponent, fighting back only by accident really. Eventually, he does kind of find his footing, but he still decides NOT to kill - and I'm not sure why. Thinking back on the show, I see no reason why Sakamoto won't kill anyone else. He's shown to be cold and cruel to his mother during flashbacks and these people are nothing to him. Other than \"killing is wrong and I'm morally above that\", I don't see why Sakamoto is so unwilling. I don't believe that there is any time spent on explaining this - he just decides not to kill.\\n\r\nI also find that Sakamoto feels very...plain...at the start of the show. I feel like he is literally just a stand in for the audience and so lacks any and all depth. Why doesn't he kill? Dunno. When he learns that people are chosen to participate in the game, he immediately realizes why he's there and chooses not to be a jerk anymore. When one of his fellows turns on him, he immediately realizes why - without talking to the other player - and vows to change. There is no learning, there is nothing to him. He just reacts and gets better and better because he's the Main Character. I almost feel like the show is a message to the NEET population of Japan - \"Hey, you can be a better person, just stop playing video games and do something with your life! You might even be able to get a hot blonde with boobs! C'mon kids!\"\\n\r\nOtherwise, I like the job done with Sakamoto throughout the show. He ends up working with two other characters, which both benefits and comes back to bite him in the ass. But I feel like his relationships with these two was very well done. A bit one note, but the acting comes through and makes me believe in them.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few coincidences that line up too perfectly for me in terms of the plotting and that bugs the crap out of me. There are also, in my opinions, a few really dragged out parts of the show that I just wanted to move beyond. The first few episodes really take their time, explaining the cast members and the concept (which should have taken like five seconds), and just dragged. I really didn't find myself engaged until about the second half of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, BTOOOM! is a pretty good show. I don't think it's any amazing or ground breaking, but the characters are interesting, if a bit stiff at the beginning; the conflicts - both with BIMS and with people - are thought out and intriguing; and overall the execution isn't bad. A show worth watching, but nothing special.",

If you answer yes, than this anime is for you.\r\nAre you looking for enjoyable anime with no great plot or twists?\r\nSome gore?\r\nA lot of fanservice?\r\nGo watch BTOOOM then! :D\r\nBasically, a lot of people got letters, asking if there's anyone that they dont want in their lives. And those people who were written, dissapeared. Now, they didn't vanish in thin air,they got transported to an island in the pacific, where they were forced to play a real life version of the game BTOOM!.\r\nAs for the animation, it's not bad, but I mustadmit it bugged me on some occasions. Himiko's face looked... weird in certain cases, like her eyes weren't on the spot or something. Though, those scenes are rare, and the rest of the anime is pretty well animated, I must say. \\n\r\nThe sound, not much I can say about it, really. The opening is pretty mediocre; It's not bad, but it ain't Zankoku Na Tenshi No These either. I liked the ending slightly more. The voice acting is decent, though it could use some fixing on certain parts. \\n\r\nThe story is enjoyable. Nothing to twist your mind around though, but it's fast-paced and easy to comperhend. Though, the thing I hated was the cliffhanger endings between the episodes, and the respawning of the characters. The main character, Ryouta, got hit by one hit kill bombs... AROUND 10 TIMES. He somehow magically survives them all though, when everyone else turns into a dismembered pool (also, there's a guy who snuck a knife in his anus there or something, no idea how he got it when everyone else got only bombs). Not really representative, I must say. It has slight hints of romance flying through at times, and I enjoyed those bits. The ending is begging for season 2, but it's still nice.\\n\r\nNow, for the characters. You have the main male protagonist, Ryouta, and the female protagonist Himiko. Now, what'll happen between them is obvious and I wont mention it, but it's really nice that they actually did something with it, not just leave it hanging. Now, for the character progression. It's not great, but it's decent. It's really obvious on certain parts, but hey, at least there is some. \\n\r\nAnd, for my grand finale, the overview.\\n\r\nCheap entertainment, fanservice, mediocre plot and a lot of action make a decent combination, I must say. This anime, although not great, is pretty enjoyable, and I believe that most people will like it when watching.\\n\r\nPlease, leave your feedback if you have some, I'm still pretty new with writing reviews.\\n\r\nThanks for reading :D",

            "content": "If you're looking for another Sword Art Online or Mirai Nikki, I'm sorry to disappoint you but you will not find that here.\r\nDon't get me wrong though Btooom is great, its a level higher than most of the mediocrity out there, it just doesn't have the breathtaking action & art of SAO nor does it have heavy psychological trauma or unique characters like Yuno.\r\nIf your still reading I'll assume your not looking for the above.\r\nThe story was good but it had a lot more potential, you'd expect a 12 episode series to squeeze as much information into every episode as possible and the pacing wouldbe uncomfortably fast but btooom just seemed to skim over the plot omitting anything unnecessary. Its definitely worth mentioning that there are some twists that make the story very interesting especially for those new to the survival genre but at the same time the story was very simplistic, I suppose this can be seen as good or bad but I prefer more complex. If your looking for something short and light then btooom is the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about the ending and it mostly depends on if there will be a sequel or not. IF there will be one then the ending was good and the set up for the next season is great. IF there will not be another season then the ending was completely anticlimatic. I still have my hopes up though.\\n\\n\r\n[ 8 | 10 ]\\n\\n\r\nI am a fan of color so I will try my best not to sound cynical. I loved the character designs on the two main characters they were executed very well, I also enjoyed the designs of some of the other characters because they were very natural. On the other hand I despised some of the facial expressions some of the characters made, after making that much effort to keep everything as \"human\" as possible so that we could relate to the characters and situations, it was disappointing that they had certain scenes where I would have had no idea how the character was feeling without some context, it was such a waste. The explosions and the fire that ensues were well drawn and I feel they had the appropriate color and weren't exaggerated as most other animes do. The art style is certainly befitting the story it was kept simple and definitely succeeded in matching the characters with they're personalities\\n\\n\r\n[ 8 | 10]\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching anime after anime you begin to become numb when it comes to the opening, but the opening of btoom stands out between episodes I was looking forward to listening to it again and I'd go as far as to say its mp3 material. The voice actors of each character did an AMAZING job at capturing each of their characters, you could not imagine any other voice befitting any of them. There was never any notable background music or noise and I think this was a blessing as it never affected any of the scenes. Sound effects were very good, everything was kept simple and there were no exaggerated super-loud explosions even planes in the sky were at the appropriate noise level it wouldn't be hard to think your inside the anime.\\n\\n\r\n[ 9 | 10 ]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what really carried they anime and I think this is why everything was kept so simple, every character was given a back-story or a flashback of some sort  so you knew exactly what kind of person they were, what they were capable of and there was great suspense when certain characters came into contact with each other you couldn't tell what was going to happen it was exciting. Every great story has a little romance in it Btooom is no exception and how our two MC's think, talk and act around one another is probably the highlight of the anime for me anyway. \\n\\n\r\nOur heroine Himiko is not your average gorgeous, well endowed highschool girl with blonde hair and blue eyes so don't be fooled. After learning of her back-story I really started to feel empathetic towards her and remember myself thinking people can be so cruel. I could safely say shes been through hell and how her character behaves/develops throughout the series is rewarding in its own right and contributes largely to my total score.\\n\\n\r\nRyouta our protagonist is a little older than what most of us are used to I found this refreshing(If I ever come across anything like Shinji from Evangelion again......) a lot of users(myself included) can relate to him with ease. It then comes as no surprise that his character is a little predictable at times and there is an event that happens that almost made me hate me very early into the anime but I let it slide and seems he was behaving very out of character after looking back.\\n\\n\r\n[ 9 | 10 ]\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed every single episode but what really lowered the result was mainly because the cover and synopsis are slightly misleading I was expecting a lot more action and a lot more psychological moments, now they were present there just wasn't enough or it wasn't emphasized enough during the scene. Variety is the spice of life as they say and unfortunately there was about as much variety as there were types of bombs. In terms of plot it was like a harem without the harem at some points and if the characters weren't so great btooom would have been a failure. Its a great piece of work but it had a lot more potential and if they give us a sequel with a much larger budget I reckon it will be a must watch but sadly Btooom only delivers half the package.\\n\r\n[ 8 | 10 ]\\n\\n\r\nOut of 10\\n\r\nStory:8\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nCharacter:9\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nOverall:8",

            "content": "Scoring Preconditions: While I rate all parts, the overall score takes in most consideration from story, character, and enjoyment. Art and sound are not factors in the overall, although they can slightly enhance or detract from enjoyment portion. I score from as unbiased a view as possible and I view it in a critical sense, not in a simple enjoyment sense. Thus I give at most a one point overall bonus for enjoyment. Story and characters matter most. I will state exceptions to this rule depending on the anime.\r\nSummary: Btoom! had a really great premise for its show and it had a lot of potential.I don't recall seeing another video game turned into reality anime but I'm sure I missed one along the way. Either way I thought the idea was quite original and seemed to be well worth the watch based on recommendations. But it wasn't really worth all the hype. Most of this goes down to the manga still being produced so the anime isn't complete either. At least I assume so. \\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10): SPOILER ALERT: the anime is open ended. There is no closure. The story is basically a parallel to The Hunger Games in almost every way. You have survival of the fittest, your choice of weapons (bombs), food packages, etc. You even have the poison gas (Note this only makes sense if you've seen the hunger games). And everyone has to duke it out for some crazy mofo's personal amusement. It pretty much follows the survival track with some flashbacks of how everyone's life is screwed up. You get yourself quite a little bit of ecchi and rape as welll. I can't really give a high score because nothing is special about the story besides its original premise. Essentially the story is a bunch of people trying to kill each other with bombs and whatever they try to fill in between isn't clever or moving. Neither is the romance in this well played. To avoid a spoiler I won't go into specifics, but its just a little too coincidental how this romance plays out between Ryato and Himiko.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): No complaints in this department. The art style is great and more realistic rather than artsy looking. Plus the bombs have unique features so thats a plus. Actions scenes were well animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): \"No Pain, No Game\" is on my playlist and the voice actors are good. Dubbed version wasn't a problem. Other noises were on par.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10): I want to start with Ryato. The mighty elite player of the video game is still an OP main character in the real world. Look I get that he's good at video games, but just because you're an elite Call of Duty player doesn't mean you automatically know how to use a gun. Yes all you have to do is throw a bomb, but that scene between Ryato and Kosuke was ridiculously unrealistic for both of them. People may disagree with me on this point but I feel it's a point to be made. Besides that, Ryato doesn't show any really development. He grows affections for Himiko and has a sympathetic nature. Cool but unspectacular. Overall he's just your average OP main character who saves his girl. The caveat is that he's only OP in videogames and in real life he mooches off his parents and is a video game addict. Lovely. Now lets turn to Himiko. Blonde, big tits, bad past. I won't say what past to avoid a spoiler. I feel she's a more realistic character in that she pretty much hates everyone and survives on instinct.  It matches her past and her character, but she also has development in her ability to trust others (Ryato). I like her more because she actually fights the demons inside her and trusts Ryato eventually. But she also has a hard edge and can actually fight, but not with that strategy bs that Ryato comes up with during fights. She throws those BIMs and that's that. A much more realistic character and she's hot. Other minor characters are other contestants with their own bad pasts, so I don't see the need to discuss them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): For all its lack of realism, the action is great to watch. I called the Ryato Kosuke fight scene unrealistic and it is, but it was still cool to watch. Besides, who doesn't love a battle royal with bombs only. The only reason it's not a perfect 10 is because the ending is open ended. I know the manga is ongoing, but its still my only and biggest caveat for enjoyment. Closure is necessary for a good story. Of course this will all change should a second season be announced. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10): While the story was a generic survival test, I felt Himiko and the action warrant a 7 rather than a 6. I get the feeling the anime has a little too much rape and it will probably turn off at least a couple viewers, but the anime certaintly had its critical appeal. I also ranked art a little more in the overall score because I loved the animation. Hopefully a second season is announced in which case this will get a revision.  But I'm always up for debate.",

In Betooom! Ry\u014dta Sakamoto (main character) is pretty good with the bombs but never get any better at using them. (Almost never he used the Bombs) Most of the time he is running away and avoiding the bombs. \r\nIn my opinion he should be less good at the beginning and get better over time.\r\nArt (8):\r\nI have not much to say about the art. I don't look at the details and stuff, I look moreat how the characters are drawn. I don't dislike the way the characters are drawn but I have seen better.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8) :\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about sound either. In Btooom! it didn't sound wrong so I gave it an 8. (no real references)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7):\\n\r\nLike I said by Story, He is good at the beginning and he never get any better. I would like to see him less good at the beginning and getting better over time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7):\\n\r\nAt the end of each episode Btooom! didn't give me the feeling I should watch the next episode immediately, but that it could wait for a few more days. But once I started the episode it become enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8):\\n\r\nThis isn't the worst season I've seen but it is also not the best. If you really like explosions and tactics Btooom! is something for you.",

            "content": "\u2018The new Hunger Games!\u2019 they said. \u2018The modern Battle Royale!\u2019 they said. \u2018If you liked Sword Art Online, you\u2019ll love this!\u2019 Etcetera, etcetera. Being a huge fan of the aforementioned media, you can imagine my excitement when I first came across Btooom!. Was my excitement justified?\r\nIt had a significant amount of hype, normal people being dropped onto a mysterious island with a bag of bombs and told to fight for survival? I was pumped! Ultimately, I was let down. Let me stress, Btooom! isn\u2019t a bad show, it\u2019s decent, in fact. However, with all the hype, I just expected a much better anime than theone we got. Let\u2019s break it down;\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Btooom! can be summed up pretty simply. Our protagonist, Ryo Sakamoto, wakes up on a mysterious island with a huge hole in his memory. After being attacked by a man armed with bombs, in a manner that is very similar to the online game Btooom!, he quickly realises he is in a real life version of the game that he is so proficient at. After that, we follow his life on the island, seeing if he can use his vast online skills when faced by the real situation. Like I said, the plot isn\u2019t all that complicated, but there is huge potential in it. Potential that, in my opinion, is wasted. This series only has 12 episodes and it\u2019s a classic case of an anime having to rush it\u2019s pacing in order to cover enough of the manga. 12 more episodes and this show would\u2019ve been a lot better. Pacing is the major issue, undoubtedly. Too slow at the beginning, Ryo took too long to accept his situation, and too fast towards the end. Another major theme of the plot was the idea that \u2018people are awful\u2019. It began to ask us questions about the true nature of humans, especially with the idea that each person on the island was sent there by a person that they\u2019d hurt. This was undoubtedly one of the best aspects of the show, I loved it! But too much of a good thing and it gets boring and guess what happened! (it got boring)\\n\\n\r\nThe character\u2019s really drive this anime, as opposed to the basic plot. They\u2019re varied and interesting, which makes it a shame that only Sakamoto and Himiko, the main female character, experience real development. The backstories are interesting in the main and the battles and subsequent clashes of values are the high points of Btooom!. Again, the show disappoints as the various antagonists and side characters are dispatched quickly and we are treated to more scenes of Himiko and Sakamoto awkwardly interacting. It\u2019s no Katniss and Peeta that\u2019s for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds and character designs are nicely done. The art is solid, with the island\u2019s features well animated and each character standing out. Truthfully, I liked the flashback scenes of Japan, nice animating there! The sound too, I have no major complaints. Opening is a bit generic but it fits and May\u2019n singing the ED! Plus points! Unfortunately, like the rest of the show both things didn\u2019t really stand out from the crowd and are good as opposed to groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nMindless action is the best way to describe the events of the show, which is a real shame considering the potential the plot has. As someone who likes to be challenged or at least surprised by my action anime, Btooom! is a disappointment. If you have some spare time and want to watch something light and straightforward, this is for you. If you want to watch something fresh, unique and gripping, there are plenty of better shows out there. Maybe my expectations were too high but this show can be best summed up in one word. Boring.",

From being an irresponsible bastard to a caring samaritan. also, the bond between the main characters was developed quite well.\\n\\n\r\nso, overall i enjoy this particular anime. the action is great and choreographed well enough and not so over-the-top.so if you want a great survival action anime, you should give this one a try. i believe that you will not be disappointed.   9/10   \\n\\n",

A game much similar to everyday shooters but with 1 major difference. Only grenades. He is jerked out of his everyday life only to find himself on an island hanging from a tree, with a bag slung over his back and a pack of grenades at his side. Oh and with no recollection of how he got there orwhat happened. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe character art was very good, but I found that that they put more focus on the direct characters than the surroundings. When they would zoom out to watch a 'nade fly it would blend the background, merging the trees, not very noticeable but I'm a picky guy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nAll of these points where just for the opening. \"No Pain No Game\" by Nano. This is an amazing song and the only reason that this got a 6. I can't remember a single OST from Btooom! and that in my eyes brought it down.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThis anime had amazing characters, each with their own back story and reason for being on the island. The main character Sakamoto is a stay at home 21 year old who is the top Btooom! player in Japan. After a visit to his local store he suddenly gets surrounded and blacks out, only to wake up on the island with no memory of what happened.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis anime had great cliff hangers but once or twice made me very mad at how the story developed. Other than that I would wait every night for Btooom! to come out on realitylapse to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9 \\n\r\nGood anime, It had it's strong points and it also had it weak points. This is an anime for somebody who wants an action/fantasy anime with a well rounded male lead who has his good points and flaws. I strongly recommend that you watch it and hope that you enjoy it. :)\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nStellerScale",

The pacing never gets too slow or too fast, and feels \"just right\" for a 1 cour show. \r\nHOWEVER, the questions left unanswered at the end of the show begs for a second season, which Madhouse should get working on ASAP.\r\nCharacters: 6\r\nJust like any other battle royale out there, the cast is pervaded with a very interesting set of characters, including psychos, rapists, and badasses. \r\nHowever, only the main characters Ryouta and Himiko are the onlyones that have extensive development, and even so, it is not much. Many questions are left up in the air with them and we, the viewers, can only wonder what the answers to these questions could be. \\n\r\nWhile the final credits roll, they show glimpses of even MORE characters. I hope they get more depth added to them in season 2...if there is even going to be a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nBtooom!, I feel, is best enjoyed in HD.\\n\r\nMadhouse is known for their amazing animation. The lighting effects are beautiful, the colors have a strong and vivid feel to them, and the background scenery is nothing short of amazing with its high attention to details. Their use of gradients in the animation also provides a more \"realistic\" depth to the art.\\n\r\nThere are a few hiccups here and there, but they do nothing to detract from the experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nFrom the ambient music to the sounds to the explosions, the sounds are awesome. The music plays at just the right times and makes each scene stand out from the last, and those explosions could really pump you up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI typically enjoy all of Madhouse's stuff, and this is no exception. All of the combined attributes listed above has led me to give this an enjoyment rating of 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nWhile not perfect and complete, Btooom! is definitely a great anime. It's amazing visuals, decent story, and interesting characters will  keep you entertained for all 12 of its episodes, but take heed, you will thirst for more.\\n\r\nI hope there will be a season 2, so all the questions left behind would be answered. But for now, all I can do is hope.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review!\\n\r\nGood day, and good night!",

            "content": "If you liked the concept of SAO but HATED the execution then look no further, this is the anime for you.\r\nAfter watching almost every single 8+ scored anime on MAL, I decided it was time to broaden my horizons and hit the 7's.  After watching this anime, it occured to me that I can't let reviews let me decide what I like, but rather have to decide on my own... even if it means one day watching the 6's.  \r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story doesn't start off too original, MC is a basement dweller who's really good at a certain video game (title).  Howeverwhere I feel this story shines is its combat system and survival aspect and how the players were forced into this game.   Players are ONLY given grenades rather than over-dramatic swords and guns.  While you may not agree with it, once you watch it, you'll realize how much more of an intense atmosphere it gives this anime.  It also gives it a layer of strategy that you would never see in a sword/gun game which makes the strategies THAT much more enjoyable.  The conflicts in this show are actually very believable and it outlines human nature so incredibly well.  And although a bit rushed, the romance in this anime was done very well; at least MUCH more so some other romance animes out there.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nI'm never really that picky on art but in this anime I found it pretty attractive.  The colors were very vibrant, the backgrounds looked great, the character designs were really nice as well.  They weren't too \"out there\" but were realistic enough where you'd be able to distinguish the main characters and other cast apart.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSome really neat OST's were played in this anime.  They were always played in perfect situations and often got me on the edge of my seat.  Voice acting was pretty good but Ryouta's voice sounded kind of strange, almost as if it was a native Japanese speaker when he said certain words like \"Btooom\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nAlthough one of the weakest points in the show, the flaws in each other characters are made up for in the other ones.  I really feel like Ryouta and Himiko were \"whole\" when they were together, alone they never worked that well.  Himiko is one of the less annoying female leads you'll see in an anime.  Although she can be dramatic, it's for good reason; she was nearly raped twice during the show and grew a bad androphobia.  Her fear is what drives her resolve, and although at times it's noble the other times it just seems unnecessary.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first anime I finished in a whole day without a break.  Don't be shy by the score, watch the anime and see for yourself if you like it, I learned not to do that after watching this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIt was a great anime.  Like I said; if you like the SAO concept but hated the anime itself, watch this.  It's a much more mature and intense version of it, and in my opinion is much better.",

Reisuke cared about having a mother figure. Yomotsu had a retarded sense of justice.\\n\\n\r\nThere was almost something comic about it. None of that exists in BTOOOM!. No one has an alternative moral system. No one\u2019s sadism is understandable. A fat guy attempts rape and we get to see it graphically, yet we don\u2019t know what\u2019s behind him. The creators try to shock us with Himiko\u2019s pain, but it\u2019s only unpleasant to watch. More shocking would be if they made understand the rapist and his point of view. This way the viewer might find he shares some thoughts with him, which is both horrifying and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nSome get a half-assed explanation, like abusive parents or a military past. These are just placeholders. The characters aren\u2019t very different besides one being more sadistic. Both Tsubaki and Reisuke have a sad past, but it\u2019s a different kind that transformed them differently.\\n\\n\r\nThe creators miss the best part of the Death Game scenarios. The Death Game throws a bunch of characters in a situation that forces them to confront each other. It needs different personalities. The clash between them is what creates tension. Some explosions will never be as exciting as a blind crazy, a yandere and a misanthrope meeting in the same place.\\n\\n\r\nThese personalities make us view these characters as human. We\u2019ll care about them, understand them and have empathy for them. The deaths will be sadder because we\u2019ll see a human who is like us fail, perhaps of his own undoing. That\u2019s how tragedy works. Tragedy isn\u2019t just making characters suffer but have them (and us) understand it. Characters just explode here.\\n\\n\r\nvlcsnap-2015-11-27-17h26m38s74\\n\\n\r\nRandom unimportant asshole\\n\\n\r\nIf BTOOOM! chose the way of Saw it would\u2019ve been better. It\u2019s not a show of aestheticized violence. Such violence is overblown and disconnected from reality. It can be fun to see limbs being torn and people explode, but there\u2019s no sense of fun here. The action scenes are tedious, consisting mainly of pointless inner monologues. The fact characters suffer is emphasized more than how fun it is to throw a bomb.\\n\\n\r\nAny momentum that a scene generates is immidiately smashed. There are a lot of inner monologues. It\u2019s a wonder the series didn\u2019t pull an Evangelion. They had enough for 3 episodes. Action scenes are about movement and set-pieces. Some dialogue can also help if the interaction is meaningful enough. Thoughts are static. No one has room for introspection during such scenes. You don\u2019t have them running in your head in a video game, so in real life?\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the stereotypical edgy anime that thinks violence, gore and suffering makes for something profound. It tries to something about how humans are cruel, but when everyone is cruel for no reason we it\u2019s hard to believe that message. How can be believe humans are as cruel as the players when the strings behind them are so obvious?\\n\\n\r\nThe symbol for caring and companionship is your typical harem protagonist, without the harem. Sakamoto has no personality whatsoever. He kind of cares about others, but why? He\u2019s the main character because it\u2019s easier to sympathize with him, rather than the rest of the meanies. More correctly, it\u2019s safer to make him the main character. Following one of the bad guys would mean they\u2019d have to to do more than be cruel for a while than die.\\n\\n\r\nHimiko isn\u2019t much better. She\u2019s an insutling portrait of the Clinging Woman. Everything Yuno satirized is in her. The parallels are so obvious, you have to wonder whether it\u2019s a response. Both girls rely on their men, but differently. Yuno relies for psychological stability. She acts less to please the guy than to fulfill her own desire for love. Himiko exists for Sakamoto and no other reason. Her love isn\u2019t related to personality. She\u2019s a reward Sakamoto wins twice, first for being a great player and second because he\u2019s saving her.vlcsnap-2015-11-27-17h28m47s108\\n\\n\r\nFor the glory of Satan\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s also an object of sexual gartification, both for characters and the viewer. She gets near-raped a few times, and these scenes are filled with nice shots that give you a clear picture of Himiko\u2019s body. These are not the expressive flashbacks of Tsubaki. You might be able to catch a nice shot there, but they\u2019re too expressive and short. The don\u2019t emphasize just the sexual part of it but the pain.\\n\\n\r\nIt made Tsubaki hateful of the world and everyone in it. It was her undoing, but she was portrayed as a tragic character. Himiko is turned into a silly tsundere who slowly learns to \u2018trust men\u2019, as if she should just get over it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is also insutling. It\u2019s the definition of \u2018inconclusive\u2019. This criticism has been brought up a lot, but many short shows have some arc that concludes. The grand story of Freezing isn\u2019t over, but there is an arc that concludes which defines the two seasons. BTOOOM! just ends. It makes it all feel like an advertisement for the source material.\\n\\n\r\nThere are tiny worldbuilding things that come off as moronic. There\u2019s no sensible explanation why the game exists. Hints point toward the good old cliche of human experiments or evil corporations. The bombs also somehow can tell whether their owner is dead or not. Then again, I keep praising a show about diaries that predict the future. If the world doesn\u2019t make too much sense but serves the purpose, it\u2019s okay. If your story is full of holes, it\u2019s a magnifying glass to how stupid your world is.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the art style is nice. Since this is supposed to be deep, we get a realistic art style with no crazy ideas. The designers still managed to give everyone a distinct look. At least in that department, BTOOOM! has something to teach others. Even characters that appear for a few minutes get their own unique look. It\u2019s too bad these designs weren\u2019t used in a different, better anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP ends with all the characters standing and looking towards the horizon. It reminded me of the first shot of Future Diary\u2018s ED. It summed up what made that one so good \u2013 a cast of crazies, which with flawed personalities that make them understandable even at their worst. BTOOOM! has no such empathy. It treats its characters like they\u2019re from a video game. They exist to kill and die. The protagonist has as much character as a silent protagnsit. It\u2019s amazing how bad it is.  has almost everything I want in an anime, and wrecks it.\\n\\n\r\n1.5 bombs out of 5",

            "content": "First: What happens when you take the best of Hunter X Hunter, The Hunger Games, Battle Royale, SAO, Mirai Nikki, and some Death Note-like tactics and put them in a blender? BTOOOM! Your blender explodes with awesomeness (ok, no more lame puns).\r\nSecond: Is it possible to cram 50 chapters' worth of plot in just 12 episodes and do it well? I can't believe it but this series proved it, it's like a miracle. Kudos to Madhouse for this gem.\r\nIf you like ANY of the works I mentioned above, you must definitely watch this show.\r\n*This review might feel vague in some parts to avoid spoilers.*\r\nSTORY 8/10\r\nThisis an interesting take on survival games. It may not seem original from this review, trust me, it is. You have your typical battle royale hunting game in a contemporary setting, with basically only one rule: collect chips from other people in a remote island similar to the tag-hunting game in the 4th phase of the Hunter's exam. This game is a bit more extreme in that killing is enforced, similar to other works. As expected, you will see a lot of strategic alliances and betrayals. What sets this show apart from similar works is that there are characters of any age and they are only given bombs to fight. The different types of bombs and their limited quantity ensures the strategy element is always present. This leads to a cool metagame because the characters have to figure out how the different bombs work by trial and error (in some ways like the hidden rules of the Death Note), as they are only given basic information on each one. The one with more knowledge obviously has the advantage. This leads to some parts that may feel like asspulls, but they are explained in more detail in the manga. This is one of the few weaknesses, but it is to be expected since they adapted 50 chapters in just 12 episodes. But rest assured, this is no Tokyo Ghoul where you need the manga like a manual to make sense of it. The BTOOOM! manga uses big panels constantly, so the chapters feel short in general. The anime took out most of the filler chapters, changed a few things, and re-arranged others for the better. As a result, the pacing is exhilarating but everything feels logical. Just like it would be expected, it feels like the characters rarely have any time to rest. On the downside, the anime does not cover the whole manga (there isn't enough material yet), but the studio stopped at the best possible point to end the season. You can pick up the manga right after watching the series, though. At the time of writing there are 77 chapters and the series is entering its final arc, so here's hoping for another anime season to conclude the story.\\n\r\nThere is a romantic subplot that is well done and not forced (at least in my opinion), although at first it relies on a coincidence a bit implausible... well, that's just my opinion. My only warning, though, is that contrary to the Hunger Games, which has a big focus on romance, this series is a seinen, so you won't have romance all the time; in fact, expect some crude scenes here and there. Just in case, I have to mention there is a rape scene and an attempted rape scene that take place fairly early in the story. They're not that graphic and serve to develop a character, but you are already warned. They're more graphic in the manga, though. Justified or cheap shock value? That's up to you. \\n\\n\r\nART (8/10)\\n\r\nThe art is really nicel, as expected of Madhouse. The art style is consistent with the manga and with the studio's most famous works. The animation is good enough and the camera angles often enhance the action. It clearly doesn't have the same budget as Death Note or Highschool of the Dead, but it is really fitting for the setting. And you will see a lot of good explosions, given the story.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7/10)\\n\r\nThe sound effects get the job done. The music gets the atmosphere right but the tunes aren't particularly memorable. I'd say this is a good thing since in a survival game it can be distracting if the music has too much presence. I think there aren't any insert songs at all. The seiyuus fit their roles very well, this is to be expected since there are some famous names involved.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (9/10)\\n\r\nIn a survival game, at least half of the enjoyment comes from the characters. And the big question is, how can you to relate to them if deaths are certain to come? Well, this show manages to make you care about them, they feel real. On the surface, the main character doesn't have any redeeming qualities, he\u2019s a dislikable character overall. But once he's forced into the survival game and you stop screaming \u201cYeah, serves you well, dumbass!\u201d he goes through a ton of development and you will root for him. One of the other main characters, Himiko, first comes across as an excuse for fan service, but her dark past reveals her to be much more complex and you want to hug her for more than just two big reasons.\\n\r\nWhile supporting characters are given a good amount of character development and they feel deep, the author tried too hard to give some of them redeeming qualities in the form of Naruto-like flashbacks (don't worry, these aren't long). One particular example is a kid that is deranged from the start (deranged like Yuno, just not yandere) and no matter how many flashbacks they throw at you, he still makes you shit your pants\u2026 and also want to kill him. Don't get me wrong, though, not all characters are like him. Finally, a few characters are underdeveloped because they become relevant much later in the manga, so they almost feel like cameos.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (8/10)\\n\r\nI marathoned this in two days, but only because I just wanted to check the first episode before going to sleep, and in the end I went to sleep after watching 8 episodes. That should say something about this show. The plot twists never stop coming and the characters have to stay on their toes all the time, given that they have to survive not only the fights with other players but also the natural dangers on the island, all while securing food for themselves and staying as mentally stable as possible. The bomb metagame keeps the survival deathmatch strong all the way through. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (8/10)\\n\r\nThis is a must watch for any fan of survival games, period. At the very least, you will have something new to compare to your favorite flavor of hunting. The only downside is the open ending, which kinda sucks unless you read the manga. I'm actually considering to give this series a 9, maybe a rewatch would help.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr Good balance of deep characters and action, some fan service and also gore. Good pacing. Very faithful to the original manga, which you can pick up immediately after. Go watch it.\\n",

            "content": "SOME spoilers\r\nBTOOOM! in a nut shell is about a weak protagonist knob who plays online RPG games such as, you guessed the obvious, BTOOOM!. \r\nNow for the story, BTOOOM! is an online game where.. wait.. what? Oh yea they never told us what that game was about. So he plays vidjuh gamez. Then one day his mom finally got tired of his lazy slob lifestyle and some grey area level nonsense happened. I think the kid got kidnapped and taken to an island where he fights to death to save himself for the enjoyment of some loan loon. I believe they also broadcast this livein Japan with the audience thinking it is some simulation survival reality show. The kid quickly & CONVENIENTLY meets up with this big chesty female character. She, like everyone else on this island, was kidnapped to fight on the island TO DEATH. For the most part she despises all male including the protagonist,(I''ll get to why later); and instead of helping she spends most of the show being a nuisance for her own self entitlement. Oh yea, instead of being a badass and killing all the other \"players\" the kid chickens out when it comes to the female lead because BOOBS. So for the majority of their time on the island they try to kill and collect these gems inserted into other players wrist. They are to collect a certain amount to advance and eventually get off the island. These gems also have abilities to track other players who are using them to do the same thing, kind of like a radar. Some silly thing about how they can cancel each other out, like a typical shounen plot devise \"our powers are equal!\" yada yada. Any shounen fan should know what I mean. The plot had a boring theme of survival of the fittest and abandoned on an island to survive for a reality show. It was suppose to teach the \"victims\" who were kidnapped to become better people. Because, well the show hinted at it, were selected by people who knew them. In other words, their \"close mates\" were tired of their crap and decided to teach them a lesson. But instead, much like this review, the plot got off topic and became more of a wow factor series instead of focusing on character development and overall themes. \\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe art was actually, for a MADHOUSE anime, very bland. Very simple. Nothing like their previous works in Metropolis, RedLine, Kaiba, Paprika or Akira. And many more. It is 1 of the very few simple stylistic titles MH has adapted. Even the explosions and the background scenery felt uninteresting to the point where I didn't even pay much attention to it. Just reading the subtitles, where in others like Kaiba, I would take my time to appreciate the atmosphere. It is sad to see MadHouse adapt such a terrible show and new fans will be deterred from their former, better titles. I really hope that's not the case and this review helps those reading learn of their previous works. OFF TOPIC. \\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh ho, here is arguably the worst part of the show. The characterization. I'll come out bold and say way too many conveniences. The characters are typical average nobodies with nothing going and down on their luck. \"Oh, fans will relate it is a dark time in the world yada yada.\" Nope. Didn't feel any sympathy for any of the characters. Except the fat man. He has a family back home. Family first people. The protagonist, like I said earlier is a low life loser NEET \"fans will relate\" SHUT UP. I'm a neet and this guy makes me feel like a God. Low life loser who does nothing but play online rpg games where he meets the female lead who plays the same game as him. They are apparently the king and queen of the game or some nonsense and have a wedding. Online RPG life is really quite sad when you think about it. Anyway, the male lead quit school and did nothing but sit around and threaten his mother. The female lead actually had a traumatic experience with the highschool rape crew, is what I'll call them. I won't spoil, but it is nasty and pretty sad. This is actually a growing issue not just in Japan, but all over the world. So real world references aside, the rest of the characters were in the same boat or just ex cons of some fashion. Though they may have relatable backstories for the audience, those didn't make up for the sloppy present tense whilst on the island. Their characterization derives souly on wow factor for the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I never once felt connected with the series. The themes were rehashed survival island and drove off of shock factor. Much like The Walking Dead there is no substance presented in present tense. Just hyped shock appeal for the masses to go \"oh my gurd I feel so bad for X and X. Oh no, look out!\" It is like an old horror flick that pops up and makes a ruckus and then dies down and nobody, but fans of the genre remember it. Nothing experimental nor original was presented here and nothing memorable to go by. Notice I didn't even name the characters. That's how much appeal this show has. None. \\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment 3/10",

            "content": "Alright, first off I'll start by saying that I am a nerd. I game all the time. I've spent 12 000 hours on a single MMORPG. And thousands of hours on other games. I'm also a girl, that has been through similar feelings the leading female character has. So I \"understand\" a lot of things about this anime differently and it may strongly affect my opinion and review.\r\nSo this hits home for me, hard. I had a lot of mixed up feelings while watching this, and I also almost cried. I'm also a fan of \"survival\" type animes and series, so my review is alsopartly based on my opinion that's somewhat formed before I started watching. Although, a lot of the events during the story surprised me.\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving the story a rating of 6, since the idea of a sort of battle royale isn't entirely original. However, I enjoyed the story as I like these type of concepts. There was emotion in the story, even if it sometimes felt like it wasn't there all the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe art gets an 8, because I liked it. The animation was fluid, to me, but I often don't judge an anime by art. It's rare for me to decide NOT to watch something because the art isn't nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound gets 9, I could often hear the feelings behind the words even if I was not looking at the screen the entire time. And the effects were nice, but my laptop's speakers are horrible, which has to be taken into account.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I loved both of the OPs. Catchy, fitting tracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. 8. This section is going to be severely influenced by my personal feelings, and I'm not looking to offend anybody. A lot of the people may say there is no character development, which straight up angers me. Mostly, because they say that Himiko is a completely bitchy/shallow character that always needs help. If you even for a moment considered why, perhaps you would understand better how she felt. Oh, except you won't because not everyone gets to experience what she did. And I'm happy that everyone doesn't have to. But in my opinion she had a right to be a scared, straight-up ass that doesn't trust anyone for the entire time. I also think the main protagonist, while he is kind and naive to start with, DOES grow, even if it is painfully slow. The characters were interesting enough for me, and I hoped for the whole duration of the anime the main two nerds get together! My heart sank every time Himiko turned Sakamoto away.\\n\r\nThe other characters could have been better introduced, but was there truly a need for that? I'm not entirely sure. Would have liked to know more, but there wasn't a need. If there is season two I hope all the survivors get more attention.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I could recommend this anime, but not for everyone. And I wish there were just one more episode or so, because I really wanted to know what happens. I agree with many that it's really left for guessing and hoping what happens next even if you can make strong guesses.",

            "content": "Story:\r\n    The story is about a video game made into a reality. Characters where transported to an unknown island without their consent. They were forced to play a real-life BTOOOM game in order to survive. \r\n     The series shows the viewers up to what extent man can do in order to survive. The desperation that they feel on trying to find and get supplies or food. The questions that they asking themselves as to why they are there and who are responsible for their miserable fate.\r\n     The game is actually pretty simple. They areequipped with bombs of different type and they are to use it when circumstances arise. The exciting part is if they win, they can have the opponents bombs but cannot use it unless the owner is dead. Another exciting part is the \"TRUST\" issues that the characters are imposed because a lot of the characters got betrayed. I like the thrilling scenes of each episodes especially the battle of intelligence and strategy. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n-There are variety of character design with almost good looking man and woman. There are some weighty, heavily muscled and even scrawny characters but these character designs make each character exceptional including the minor ones. \\n\\n\r\n-The series has a mature content. It showed sexual abuse(almost rape scene), brutal killings and dismemberment. However, it was not really that gross since it was toned down. I kinda like the scenery such as the forest and the beach. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening song \"No Pain, No Game\" complimented the series. I really like the way some of the characters synchronized with the song as if they are part of it. It also showed a summary of the characters of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nGreat character development for the main Protagonist Sakamoto from lazy and self-centered boy to sweet, selfless and helpful person. I cannot say the same to Himiko though but looking forward to it. \\n\\n\r\nOverAll:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime. It's a fast-paced story with full of action and twist. Looking forward to the next season.  Can't wait to get to know the other characters and to unravel the mystery of who is behind it all.\\n",

            "content": "And we're back to Madhouse. That anime company that I seem to have so many ups and downs with. Which makes it really difficult to predict what I'm going to think of their works without watching them. Although I suppose that's only natural given how prolific they are. This is Btooom! an anime based on a manga by Inoue Jun'ya. One thing worth noting is that the anime has a dozen episodes while the manga is ongoing. Which indicates that there may be another season, or that the anime stops at a certain point in the manga and isn't going to go further or possiblythat the anime tells a much shorter story. Let's examine Btooom! and find out which it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a young man named Sakamoto Ryouta, a neet who finds himself strapped to a parachute on an island with no memory of how he arrived. He finds a pouch filled with bombs in with his belongings and quickly learns that he's on an island where he's expected to fight a bunch of other people to the death using bombs. Luckily for him, the scenario is based off of the game, Btooom which he's an expert at. Wait, a group of people is taken to an island against their will and told to kill each other? That scenario seems to be popping up quite a bit in recent media. To be fair, Btooom does have fairly unique execution. Unlike most works with the same basic premise, the characters aren't forced by their captors to play the game. They're encouraged to with the promise of being sent home if they can kill enough people, but they generally rely on their prisoners own worst instincts to make the game work. It actually makes for a pretty interesting conflict. Another factor I like is the way that the \"players\" were chosen. Let's just say that none of them are there by chance and it leads to some interesting backstory elements. That being said, there are some issues with the story. One is that it over-uses flashbacks, many of which end up being pointless since the information conveyed in them is revealed more naturally in the main narrative. There are also some continuity issues, most prominently in the last episode in which one character receives a rather nasty injury resulting in an inability to walk well only to have that same character standing up without any support and with no difficulty in one of the last few scenes. Another thing that bothers me is the sheer level of coincidence involved in the plot. There are two people on the island closely connected to Ryouta solely for the sake of plot convenience and, while their back-stories do give them a reason to be there, it seems suspect that a neet would coincidentally have that many connections in that scenario. Now, the series does end on a cliffhanger which indicates that there could very well be another season. Some people might be annoyed by that but, frankly, I think that the pacing is really strong overall and that they pick a really good spot to end in which you get quite a bit of resolution which results in Btooom having a sense of completion even though there's clearly still more to go. I will warn you that there are some disturbing scenes involving both gruesome imagery and sexual assault and, while these scenes aren't poorly done or handled disrespectfully, they may be triggering to some people. \\n\\n\r\nNow we move on to the characters. Btooom is one of those anime that has a clear distinction between the primary characters and the secondary. Since the primary characters get quite a bit of development and backstory while the secondary characters are largely two dimensional. However, a lot of that is clearly the result of time constraints. After all, this is only a twelve episode series and they clearly setup the possibility for future development for a lot of them, so I'm not going to complain about it too much. One thing that does hurt the characters, however is the character of Kousuke Kira. He's one of those antagonistic characters who you're supposed to feel sorry for because he has a tragic backstory. Which I hate. It's a lazy way of trying to make the audience sympathise with a sociopath without giving them any qualities that are actually sympathetic. It's a cheap, over-used and emotionally manipulative tactic that really needs to go away. Fortunately, he's a relatively minor character and the main cast is really strong. Ryouta, Himiko and Taira are all well developed characters who develop very realistically over the course of the narrative. They all have faults, but are also basically good people. Which makes them both sympathetic and realistic. The romantic elements between Himiko and Ryouta are really well handled, leading to some genuinely heart warming moments and giving both of them some of their best character moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is excellent. The island is vibrant and teeming with life. The various buildings and backdrops have well done textures and look fairly realistic. I also like the fact that they don't make the explosions or gore over the top and ridiculous. My only complaint about the art is that there's some fan-service, although there's not a whole lot and it tends to be kept pretty tame. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good, although not great. The actors all do fairly well, with the possible exception of Nakamura Yuuichi who, likely as a result of the direction, doesn't bother emoting. Fukami Rica does a superb job, in spite of having a small role. Both Mimori Suzuko and Hongo Kanata also do really well. The music is okay. It's not bad, but it's not good either. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. The female characters barely even interact with each other in this. Except for one episode that's largely composed of flashbacks. \\n\\n\r\nBtooom certainly has more good qualities than bad. The story is solid with a lot of strong elements and the major characters are really well handled. Now, you probably won't like it if you're sick of the premise or if you're going to be triggered by the more disturbing content. However, if you think that the premise has merit when done well and you can handle some disturbing content, I think you'll find it an enjoyable experience. Personally, I'm going to give it an 8/10. While it has some flaws, there's nothing that drags it down too much. Next week I'll be doing something a bit different. An entire week of film reviews, starting with Kara no Kyoukai 2.",

            "content": "This an edited review since the DB wanted my very cheesy version of the Black Eyed Pea's of \"BOOM, BOOM, POW\"  in which was I modified for this anime removed......man I've spend 3 days making that. Bueno, what we have is an action packed anime in which it's theme was very similar to that form the movie \"Hunger Games\" which I've watched from a pirated DVD. Which is a game of survival which only those who wouldn't hesitate to play dirty would survived, though It's a bit cheesy to use hurling explosives called \"BIMs\" as a weapon, in fact to called such game aFPS would be an understatement, co'z them character's whether in a game or in a real life or death struggle don't shoot their opponent with there so called BIMs instead they throw it a an opponent and it goes KABOOM!!! This anime focus on man's desperation to survive in which he or she will do anything to do so, it also features players who were compose of everyday people that we love to hate e.g:\\n\\n\r\nRy\u014dta Sakamoto- an arrogant NEET which every parent wants to kick outta the house.\\n\\n\r\nHimiko- an unfortunate scapegoat.\\n\\n\r\nKiyoshi Taira- a boss every employee wants to kill.\\n\\n\r\nK\u014dsuke Kira- he represent every delinquent or rascal that every law abiding citizen who would wanna give a spanking.\\n\\n\r\nMasashi Miyamoto- info states that he's a war veteran, but he also represents a typical niegborhood thoughie whom we wish should be in jail.\\n\\n\r\nNobutaka Oda- a typical asshole.\\n\\n\r\nMasahito Date- a no good doctor who shouldn't even be a doctor at all.\\n\\n\r\nHidemi Kinoshita- a typical everyday bitch.\\n\\n\r\nYoshihisa Kira- a dad from hell who should probably stay in hell.\\n\\n\r\nS\u014dichi Natsume - a defense lawyer in which one would wish that nobody should be defending them criminals.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuo Akechi- basically he represent every typical sexual predator whose dick should have been cut-off.\\n\\n\r\nThe mentioned character's really does give once such impact that one would feel that hate for those character's. However, every show should have a protagonist and that's where Ry\u014dta Sakamoto fills the gap, here he's a top BTOOM player who dreams of getting a job at Tyrannos the very game developer which the protagonist was playing, this is where the fate comes in, remember when they say \"Be careful of what you wish for or you just might get it\" kind of thing? Well, he got what he wanted but not exactly what he expect it, where his life is now on the line, Himiko fills in as the love interest whom her character was interesting, co'z she's kinda like this wild animal in which needed to be tamed and it so happens that her distrust in men was been tamed by Ryota's sincerity. But it was a bit disappointing that Taira had become an opponent.... for a while since he has gone loco and committed Seppuku of sorts. But the real star of this anime is the blood and gore and the desperation's that we see in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMy rating for each of this anime's category:\\n\\n\r\nStory, character, enjoyment and overall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so the way the killing was done is off, but seeing how the character's have to survive from each other compensates for such short comings and the character's are well represented by the very scums that one loves to hate, so overall it's all good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing attractive here is Himiko, in which it would have been nice if there will be some nice fanservice of her.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I just hate both the opening and closing theme.",

            "content": "Let's all play a deadly game, with our life is on the line, where disillusion and insanity make its home, for everyone to bare our fangs to achieve the truly almighty darkness that has been lurking in everybody hearts. \r\nStory\r\nRyouta Sakamato is your typical NEET character who\u2019s trying to survive in a living hell island that solely created for high class people entertainment based upon online game called Btooom!. The online game is worldwide known for various participants from all around the world. Ryouta who is ranked 10th is clearly one of the top ranking players of the Btooom! in the world. However, the reallife Btooom! Game will show him how the game capable of doing which is opposite direction from what he ever imagined. Only one thing can save you from this ultimate humiliation and despair, it is the concept of survival of the fittest. Although how messed up it can be, this is the most rational option which only the strongest can survive. But I actually think brain is the main actor for us to survive. If you're diligent enough to figure out how everything works, anything is possible. \\n\\n\r\nReview\\n\r\nInoue Junya is a genius. This series had so much potential to unlock as well as capable to take this series to the next stage of admiration. Btooom! Is well planned-out for each plot and somehow make sense for both entire series and manga. The depth of this show's concerning one of the high issues in the world. Still, Btooom! manga is well thought-out and manage to tie everything together into a new stage. Although all the plot hole make the manga trying to show something uncertain and absurd, Inoue Junya still exposition logical concepts as much as he can. If I want to express it into words, brilliantly is the most suited. However, the series is not particularly success as the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does have its flaws. The series not paced up with the manga and add more with the ending of this series just make it worse with the ultimately cliffhanger.  I would not blame the fans for angering about this matter; bluntly I will join them because of the sudden direction twist which makes it nonsense. In short terms, the series maybe could pace up with the manga if they\u2019ve got a continuation to connect with what that has been left in the series. Not to mention, many questions has been left unanswered. However, the show still does a good job to presents itself as a psychological and thriller series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nBtooom! Characters mixed with variety kind of person. Every one of them is rather unique in a way and mysterious much as why they have been sent to this remote island. Clearly, almost all of them we can figured that not possibly what will you call a good person. But, this is just one of show's various provocative concepts. Naturally, we just will be drawn over by both the Main lead Ryouta and Himiko. As there were a mysterious red strings that pulled us indirectly. I would like to say this characters development is satisfying even in the end. With no intention to spoil you more, let\u2019s head to next aspects. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\r\nTalking about both the art and animation, Madhouse is pretty well known for series with depth of humanity in general. Such as Monster series. That's one clearly a masterpiece. In short, the best way to go as concerning the series with this genre is none other than Madhouse. Rather, I respect them in this aspect. How accurate and well designed the background, character is the proof of how good it is their works. You can see how beautiful it is the characters have been drawn in the series. While certainly not the perfect, it is still the most values than the other lead animation. Madhouse skill in this animation is well used to demonstrate the realism and realistic concepts. Their skill undeniably more than meets the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nThe voice acting with sound effects make the series lively than what we can imagined. In my honest opinion, Btooom! Sound effect is one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard. While maintaining the high quality of art and animation, they still do not leave the sound aspect behind. The Ops, \u201cNo Pain, No Game\u201d by Nano is always standing out as the series goes on. It\u2019s describes the anime perfectly fine which freak me out. While the other hand, the Ed by May\u2019n is much fabulous as the Op. Start with the slow pace but effectively romantic vibes. I can\u2019t praise no more. As this is also proven by how marvelous the series showed. We can try to deny but it's a beautiful one as well. Taking all aspects into the account, nothing is beautiful and flawless as this series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\r\nObviously we need another season. While certainly the romantic ending is quite a fine piece, there were too many questions has been left unanswered. Not to mention the almighty great cliffhanger where the series left. But I'm still recommend you to watch. Do yourself a favor and go watching this series if you haven\u2019t watch it yet. In all honesty, you have to see it for yourself. \\n",

            "content": "Story: BTOOM uses the same \u2018zero to hero\u2019 formula as Sword Art Online. Basically, you start with an unemployed, decent-looking nerd whose only significant talent is video games, and then thrust him into a situation where his gamer skills translate into badassery and sex appeal. As uninspired as this premise is, it\u2019s still forgivable because it\u2019s a necessary part of the death match genre set up. In this case, the protagonist is a highly-ranked player in the bomb-throwing FPS game, BTOOM, who suddenly wakes up on an island where he needs to play this game for real with a bunch of psychos, civilians and abuxom gamer girl. The strategy of the death match revolves around deception and utilizing whatever unique bomb-types you\u2019ve collected.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, BTOOM is one gigantic orgy of male fantasy. I say that out deep, self-reflection rather than judgment :). In this universe, a sedentary gamer can turn into a great athlete overnight, large-breasted women swoon over high online rankings, potential male competition is dichotomized into either ugly creeps or beta-males, and most importantly, the people behind online female avatars are not lecherous pedophiles but hot chicks. Now is there anything inherently wrong with a fantasy world like that? I say no. And BTOOM is a fine experience as long as one just enjoys the ride. Expect action, explosions, a few plot twists and plenty of undulating breasts. It\u2019s the Big Mac of survival anime, empty calories but still delicious.  \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n-The Main. I liked the main character because he neither perfect nor completely useless. As meager a request like that might be, male anime protagonists tend to fall into one of these two categories more often than they should--Kirito (I'm going to make several more references to that monstrosity SAO). I felt like he was a decent mix of pragmatism and idealism for this type of anime. \\n\\n\r\n-Flashbacks. The flashbacks were good and didn\u2019t feel like filler. Say what you will about their content but I felt they provided some much-needed context to grasp the psyches of the different contestants\u2014even if those psyches were very one-track. I could have actually used more background but I appreciate what I got. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n- Inconsistency. The hallmark of a lazy anime is inconsistency. Inconsistency can manifest as anything from abrupt changes in characters' personalities, to convenient lapses in game rules, to illogical fluctuations in individual strength. In BTOOM\u2019s case, it was the strength of those fucking bombs. Depending on the circumstance (and the protagonist\u2019s needs) the blast strengths ranged from firecracker to cruise missile. Let me ask you this, if a time bomb lands 3 feet away from the protagonist\u2019s feet, is he in danger? Would he have to think of a clever way to escape or could he just absorb the blast and shake it off? Answer: It depends which episode. In BTOOM there's no way to tell if and when a bomb is within lethal range of someone. This is inconsistency. \\n\\n\r\n-Blame. Anyone who has siblings knows what it\u2019s like to get wrongfully blamed for breaking something. The normal reaction is to either vigorously protest or take the punishment and later punch the sibling who didn\u2019t step up. What a normal person DOESN\u2019T do is rationalize/internalize the punishment and feel guilty for something he/she didn't do. No spoilers here but there is a lot of misplaced blame that makes it very hard for me to follow, let alone sympathize with, certain characters. These are glitches in storytelling. \\n\\n\r\n-Women. Women are not too complex in BTOOM. This comes as no surprise for an anime like this, and I\u2019ll direct you back up to my introduction. However, while I get what they were trying to build, I think this would have been a much more satisfying romance and believable story if the female characters had more depth. For example, they try to explore the subject of rape but it just comes off as comically clumsy. Then there\u2019s Hitomi. I swear, half the time I wanted to slap some spine into that girl. It got annoying. Admittedly though, it sort of evened out because I spent the other half of the time hypnotized by those bouncing... so where are we now, art?\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is good but not great. SAO blows BTOOM away in this area, it\u2019s not even close. However, BTOOM is still very watchable and is x10 more satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing memorable. I didn\u2019t care for the songs. I will say that after recently watching Mirai Nikki and Eureka Seven I was happy to get a male protagonist who had gone through puberty.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Some people really bash the characters in BTOOM for being brainless or too shallow. I actually disagree. While they certainly pander to the \u2018damsel in distress\u2019 theme a lot, I found the characters to be pretty interesting. They are all damaged and flawed in their own way. This concept is actually woven into the plot. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the male protagonist was at least moderately reflective and perceptive, certainly more than his doofus, goody-goody SAO counterpart, Kirito. Hitomi was harder for me to like but if you see her personality (you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about) as a pathology to be pitied rather than a plot device to be celebrated, she becomes bearable. So basically lower your standards with her lol. The other characters are fine. They are generally diverse and many are very ruthless and twisted. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I liked it a lot. Perfect cure for boredom on a rainy Monday afternoon. One more thing. This is an ongoing anime that focuses on the first 50 chapters of the manga. So *hint* *hint* this Anime does not cover the complete adventure.\\n\\n\r\nGore/Violence: Not gratuitous but it does earn its 17+ rating. This is a death match where people kill each other.\\n\r\nLove/Romance: Well it's either about two flawed characters exploring love or a lucky nerd with the hots for an emotionally vacuous trope. Take your pick. I prefer the former.\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: A lot of fan service but not to the point where it ruins the anime.",

And the characters had to choose whether they trust the other or not.\r\nI found it incomplete at the end though.

            "content": "A lot of peeps have been saying that Btooom! is not original, blah blah. Honestly, how many original stories are out there these days anyway? Although I do find similarities to many other works in bits and pieces over the course of watching it, I still enjoyed it very much ( even with the cliches and stupid women, yes...because the fight makes it worth while).\r\nThe protagonist is, sort of similar, but different from the generically wimpy main characters. I guess since it's easy to relate to his mind set as a semi-NEET myself, I really like how awesome he becomes as he acts out hisgame life. For characters in general, I really like how they come in a variety from middle aged salary man to high esteemed professionals to students to NEETs, etc. It's exciting to get different sneak peaks into their troubled lives and see how their perspectives change over time as they play the game. Comparing to most other shounen anime I've watched where each of type of character plays a specific role ( pilots are all old men, fighters are all bishounen, or everyone in the world is under 20, *it's exaggerated but you get what I mean ), this is one level above that. Annnnd, most importantly, the main characters are NOT THAT STUPID/USELESS. Finallyyyyy!\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is full of fantastical elements, such as the setting and the game itself, but it brings out the morals behind and the growth in characters quite well. Surprisingly I didn't find any turning point unrealistic. As for what I think, the overall production is not disappointing at all. Being very picky on graphics and visuals in general, Btooom! does, at times, present alarming ecchi-ness that I find hard to take (not in terms of content but ..pinkness. *Hue Saturation is too high). Ahem. \\n\\n\r\nThe only, real problem I have is the pacing. For some reason I find the thoughts of the characters too slow (especially Himiko). On top of that the suspense are killed too quickly with the immediate revelation of the action strategies. I would be happier if more emphasis is brought out. \\n\\n\r\nLastly...I really hope there's a second season since a lot questions have left answered. The hardest part of putting all the developments together has only just begun. *Kekeke, quoting from op already. Anyway.\\n\\n\r\nMy suggestion is that if you are into gaming and don't appreciate your boring life, like I do, then watch this. Keep in mind, if you're the type to zoom over anime, to pay attention because there's not a lot of narration-like roles to explain all the details for ya like in Akagi or Death Note. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading all my shinanigans! //*run off to read the manga.",

            "content": "**Review may contain small spoilers, not enough to ruin the show though. They will be indicated with two stars**\r\n**Feedback is appreciated**\r\nSummary :\r\nRyouta Sakamoto suddenly finds himself transported from playing the hit Btooom! video game to being stranded on a mysterious island with a huge gap in his memory. It doesn't take him long to figure out that someone is attempting to recreate the ultra-violent Btooom! game in real life. Fortunately, Ryouta's an ace Btooom! player. Can Ryouta repurpose his game based skills fast enough to survive?\r\nStory : 6\r\nArt : 7\r\nSound : 7\r\nCharacter : 7\r\nEnjoyment : 7\r\nOverall : 7\r\nStory : 6\r\nI like that this anime hada goal to work towards, and the characters more-or-less stick to that goal. However, the ending wasn't really an ending, and a sequel has yet to be announced. It's only been 3 years though, so there's a chance of a sequel.\\n\r\n**I liked the sub-story of Date and Murasaki**\\n\r\nI thought the story overall was fair.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 7\\n\r\nI don't have any complaints about the art, but at the same time I don't think there's anything particularly worth mentioning. \\n\r\nI personally didn't like the design of Himiko, I thought the anatomy was a little off, but it might just be me.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the art overall was good.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7\\n\r\nAgain, nothing to complain about. \\n\r\nI noticed right away who the voice actor for Masashi Miyamoto was, so that was a pleasant surprise. Kousuke Kira too.\\n\r\nBoth openings were by Nano, a band which I recognised, which also made it better. The ending theme was also good.\\n\r\nThe sound overall, I thought, was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 7\\n\r\nI liked the variety of characters. A lot of them appeared to be psychos **but I can understand that the immense pressure of the sudden survival game could make someone that way. However, Kousuke Kira was already pretty messed up, which made him a bit more interesting.**\\n\r\nWhile the ending wasn't very final in terms of the story, I liked the character development of Ryouta Sakamoto, **as he overcomes his complex**.\\n\r\nI also liked Himiko's development in the last episode.\\n\r\nOverall the characters were good, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 7\\n\r\nThere are 3 reasons this is a 7, rather than an 8/8.5.\\n\r\n1) **The multiple rape scenes in episode 2. I actually started watching this anime about 2 years ago, but stopped because this episode upset me a little. I skipped them this time, but either way, they definitely made this anime less enjoyable for me.**\\n\r\n2) The character development. **In the final episode, Ryouta mentions that he could have gotten on better with his family, and throughout the show we see flashbacks of him and his family, but I don't think the creators of this anime made it very clear what happened. It may just be me, though.\\n\r\nAlso, at the end the anime made it seem like Oda was really important to Ryouta, but before they happened to meet each other, Oda was never even mentioned.**\\n\r\n3) The way the anime was set out could have been better. I don't mean the order of events, I mean the way the events were animated. I feel like the last episode could have been sadder, like it was supposed to be, if it was carried out in a different way.\\n\\n\r\nDespite those three things, I enjoyed the battles and the hardships Ryouta went through. I also enjoyed the romantic sub-plot, even though it was predictable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 6.8 (7)\\n\\n\r\n*This is only my second review, so I'm sorry if it isn't very helpful.*",

In Btooom you basically battle other players for rankings only weapon you use in Btooom! are bombs. Not just regular bombs there are many different types Timers, Explode on Impact, Heat Bombs, and much more. Basically throughout this series there a lot of bloody killing and explosions which makes the anime pretty sweet in my opinion. Only thing I did not like is the few rape scenes they did have in the anime that could have really been done without.

            "content": "So, Btooom!! is pretty much a 'Battle Royale' style anime. A bunch of people are sent to some unknown island, and are given bombs called BIMs to kill each other with. The game is modeled after a hugely popular game called Btooom where players use bombs to kill their opponents. Our story picks up with the Main character, 21 year old Ryouta Sakamoto. We know one thing about him, he is the best Btooom player in Japan and one of the top 10 players of the world (and self-explanatory a NEET). The first episode follows him as he wakes up on the island, with noidea of where he is, what's happening, and how he got there. First couple mins, he gets attacked by an opponent (technically, everyone else is your enemy). That's as far as I'll go into detail (that's like the first 5 mins of episode 1). Anyways, the story is obviously about Ryouta, and his attempt to escape the island without killing anyone. He meets many different people, some friends, others enemies, some insane, some completely sane. And that's the core of Btooom. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the actual review. I thought the show did a decent job. It obviously doesn't win any points on originality, but the method of using bombs/ BIMs to kill your opponent and nothing else makes it different in comparison to Battle Royale or The Hunger Games. Ryouta himself can often get annoying and frustrating at times to watch. He's supposed to be the best player in Japan, and yet he never fully applies that knowledge to this game (he does so a few times, but that's it). The voice actor they chose for Ryouta, who can go from being confident to downright whiny (mostly the latter), felt as if he was forcing himself to act meek and whiny. He's one of those 'goody too shoes' characters that wants to get back to normal life without harming anyone (which is a near-impossible task). He seems to be more focused on idealism than reality. Me personally, I hate main characters who constantly preach to enemies to join them and become \"good\"...so Ryouta personally got on my nerves quite a few times. He barely has any confidence, and he only uses his game knowledge very rarely. I think my one pet-peeve about him is, He's WAY too gullible. He trusts everyone who he meets as if he's known them for a long time...and when you're playing a survival game, I find it unrealistic that someone could blindly trust every stranger they meet. So a major down-draw to this show would have to be the main character's personality.\\n\\n\r\nFlipping sides, the plot itself is actually quite interesting. While not revealing an ounce of Why they're playing a death game, they reveal small hints in many of the episodes. It was really interesting when I found out the reason why those people were chosen to play. It was something unexpected. But I'd have to give a thumbs up to the plot for taking an unoriginal trend and putting its own spin on it.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as this show is about battling enemies, it's just as much a psychological game (if not moreso). Most of the time it shows the characters thinking to themselves, and you find out their true colors. Some are deceitful while others are trustworthy...and you usually find that out by their inner-monologues. Most of the time is spent thinking: \"Do I trust him/he?r, can I trust him/her?, etc\". I can only recall a few battles that can actually be considered 'battles'. They were often short and lopsided, but sometimes turned out interesting results. I won't go into detail, but there are a couple characters whom pique my interest (and aren't explained this season), and the battles Ryouta had with them, were too short and should have been extended because they were good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very well-done. Madhouse did a really good job. It's not bright or shiny, but dark and dull as it should be. The dark tones set the scene for such a dark death game. It's nothing spectacular, but it certainly fits the show very well. \\n\\n\r\nI think the biggest drawback for the show is the lack of character development. None of these characters change much throughout. Whenever it seems that Ryouta or Himiko have developed stronger personalities, they falter and repress back to their old annoying selves. I understand that they're trying to be realistic, but you can only be so gullible (and nearly get killed for it) before you have to rethink your strategies. Anyways, that's the biggest negative for me.\\n\\n\r\nI also gotta admit at how cheesy this show is. It has some of the cheesiest moments that you'd never expect. Sometimes things are overdramatized, and other times they give in to hopeless cliches that make me chuckle. There was one moment during episode 11 where I literally could not stop laughing because of how cheesy and misplaced the scene was...damn lol. But yeah, sometimes it brings out the cheez-wiz can to spray all over.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Himiko (sigh), one of the most useless characters in any anime I've seen. She's the female main character of the show whereas Ryouta is the main male character. I'd say for half the season (6 episodes) she's a punching bag. She nearly gets raped, she gets pushed around, she's the complete opposite of Ryouta in which she trusts no one (which is actually quite frustrating). She's practically eye-candy throughout most of the show, and rarely battles. She had a lot of potential, but it seems they wasted it. She mainly just watches Ryouta battle and screams his name. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I gave it an 8 because it still has potential. It really depends on whether it gets another season (because the first season cut off when they were still in the game), or if they pull a Deadman Wonderland and lead me to read the manga...because this show is nowhere near finished, and I have reason to believe that Ryouta and Himiko would finally grow some spines/strong personalities and the real battle begins (that's just my assumption). I often found myself forgetting about it until I looked it up lol. I always said \"Let's see, I have this, this, and that to watch...and Oh, Btooom!\"...not saying it's bad, but just forgettable. It's worth a watch if you have nothing much better, and hopefully a season 2 comes out which will feel more complete and exciting.\\n",

I found out about this anime from a friend and we both agree that the anime is going to be amazing, something like how Sword Art Online is. \r\nStory:\r\nSo far I am on the 5th Episode of this amazing anime and so far I love how the story line is going. Pretty original how they get the main character to be stuck in a game and the only way is to win, and the only way to win is to killothers. I like this type of story line and hope that the rest of the anime would be as good as the first 3 episodes. When I think of this anime, I think of \"Bomber Man\" for the Nintendo 64, because the main purpose of this game is to kill others using different types of bombs. That is pretty much my summary of the story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI would say that they made the main character a lovable one, because he does nothing wrong and he kind of gets mixed up in a situation where he is forced to do something so unethical. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI like this anime and I hope that the anime gets good reviews and all. I just love the direction of how this anime is going. Stories amazing, Art is beautiful, main character is a boss, and this anime is really enjoyable so its a must watch!\\n\\n\r\nHope you find this review helpful in a way! \\n\\n\\n",

It's a little like SAO, but with bombs only, therefore it takes a lot more strategy and tactics in fights which makes it more exciting and makes battles more unpredictable.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nAlthough it has fast-paced action, the graphics have managed to still remain fluid despite the action. The character design was good for the main characters but the same cannot be said for the supporting ones.\r\nSound: 7/10\r\nSound is actually used in a casual way. Not too much, not too little. The opening song isgood, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters have done horrible things in the past and always blabber about karma when faced with deadly situations. They all have their good traits and dark sides but their stupidity in not picking up details that in real life should've been extremely obvious.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWe may not have the same tastes but I LOVE violence especially if it includes a lot of blood. There were very sly tactics and strategies that were used during fight scenes that you would like.And for perverts, there was an ecchi scene (attempted rape) but I don't like it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime would change the way we think about treating other people and about trust, with all the deception and betrayals. Definitely a good watch for video game-related anime and action fans alike.",

That i can understand and that's why i'm not being too rude on this. The same problem goes sometimes with Sakamoto,he will take his lovely time to grow some guts and actually fight,but he never desired to kill someone for real.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why i said this anime is a lot about people's morality. Better not to kill and get killed? Better go alone or together? Trust or not trust?.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the sound there isn't much to talk about i didn't notice any particular music that impressed me but sound effects are great such as explosions,footsteps and any kind of environment sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe animations are great and the island looks beautiful,explosions and special effects are great too.\\n\r\nThere is a lot of gore and violence and partial nudity in this show,let's say it's crude and cruel.\\n\\n\r\nSo what are really the flaws of this show?\\n\r\nWell in my point of view,it's sorta too short but the ending,if you can call it an ending,makes you clearly think it's not over,and assuming the manga is still going on i expect a second season,which i'll look forward to.\\n\r\nCharacters often make stupid decisions and there are some things that are so obvious that i asked my self on how the characters didn't notice it.\\n\r\nAside of that i can't think of any major problem.\\n\\n\r\nGeneral opinion;\\n\r\nIt's an intense show,short,but intense,it's like running without taking any break for a long time.\\n\r\nIt's a great anime but it's filled with some stupid scenes that i couldn't get the sense but maybe it's just me.\\n\r\nIf you like survival games and crude shows this is definitely your type but be warned that is quite emotional too,not because it's particulary sad,but because it's cruel.\\n\r\nAlso you'll find asking yourself very often:\\n\r\nHow did he survive that?\\n\r\nNo way he survived.\\n\r\nOh damn he is dead.\\n\\n\r\nPro and cons;\\n\r\n+Great animations\\n\r\n+Very good looking\\n\r\n+Intense \\n\r\n+Decent story\\n\r\n-Very short\\n\r\n-Cliffhanger ending\\n\r\n-You often see stupid decisions and statements \\n",

            "content": "Despite being based off a manga well-received enough to warrant an anime adaptation, BTOOOM! manages to fall spectacularly on its face, in the end only deserving an overall score of 4. Be warned, this review is more of a rant than anything else for having made the mistake of wasting 6 hours of my life on this anime; however I hope it can help you avoid making the same mistake. A breakdown of scoring is as follows (slight spoilers included):\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe setting is your standard all-out survival game in which players kill or be killed. While the premise initially offered immense potential for dramatic confrontationsand conflicts between each character's morality and personal beliefs, nothing like that---or anything even remotely interesting---happens throughout its entire run. No moral conflict happens whatsoever; the protagonist is spared from making any kind of moral decision at all, because it's conveniently written somewhere in the producer's footnotes that he should forever remain untainted on the moral high ground. Let's be honest; in a survival game, this makes for an incredibly boring protagonist and an incredibly contrived plot. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nBackgrounds can be pretty despite many shots being recycled. Character designs however leave much to be desired, and their facial expressions aren't all that expressive. The art tells the story well (if and when there's any at all to be told) however, so it's decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nSound gets a 5 here not because it's  necessarily any better than the other aspects, but because it's so boring and bland; it got a mediocre score for its mediocre performance which I barely noticed at all. While the soundtrack barely enhanced viewing experience, it didn't detract from it either; in other words, it was negligible and thus got a score neither praiseworthy nor critical. The OP/ED were better however and deserve more merit than this show itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nCharacterisation is, in my opinion, easily the weakest point of this anime; most of the characters are little more than cardboard cutouts filling up mandatory roles, and the reasoning behind their behaviour is so forced it's frankly a challenge to believe or empathise with them on any level. 1 point here goes to Daira for being the only character who demonstrates believable fears and doubts that I would expect out of the entire cast when being put in such a game; the other 1 point goes to the entire ensemble of supporting characters that flesh out the main cast's background, who drew more sympathy from me instead of the main characters themselves.\\n\r\nThe protagonist here, despite being a world-class gamer at the game he is supposed to conquer, turns out incredibly wimpy at the beginning---and actually manages to get worse as the story develops---or maybe the story doesn't develop, because it honestly doesn't go anywhere. He has plot armour stronger than the plot itself, surviving traps and explosions that previously managed to kill others; bombs LITERALLY ticked slower around him. At the same time, he manages to conveniently avoid any decisions that could possibly bring his own code of morality into question, never killing any other players until it becomes morally justified self-defense, out of either na\u00efvet\u00e9, stupidity or a combination of both I don't know. What the producers blatantly ignored was that a well-handled conflict in morality was one of the best things that could happen to a character; instead they seemed to think that putting the protagonist above all such confrontations would draw him sympathy for his compassion. Well, not from me.\\n\r\nMeanwhile the female lead is one of the most useless, if not THE most useless, heroine in anime that I have seen in recent years. A high-schooler with the boobs of a million-dollar surgery and the intellect of a toddler, she needs constant babysitting from the protagonist to survive, as if her only purpose in the plot was to get into trouble so that the protagonist has a chance to shine as her saviour. Just being a standard damsel-in-distress born out of awkward fan-service however would not have been that much of an issue if she hadn't been such an utterly useless character; if she hadn't the role of the heroine, she would've been one of the first characters to die. Since meeting the protagonist she seemed increasingly dependent on him to live; she needed her life, her purpose in life, her survival strategy, even her reason for living all handed to her in bite-sized pieces by the protagonist, and immediately lost her ability to function when she believed he was dead. She went from highly suspicious and mistrustful of the protagonist to utterly devoted and reliant in the span of a few episodes---I don't know if this was supposed to be taken as character development, because if anything it seems like regression to me; while she was at the very least independent in the beginning, towards the end she seemed incapable of thinking on her own.\\n\r\nAll the other players, particularly ones who lost to the protagonist and heroine, had one-dimensional motivations and contrived justifications for their behaviour; they seemed to behave antagonistically simply for the sake of being evil, perhaps to illustrate the protagonist's compassion in contrast. The sloppy and cliched manner in which this is executed however simply leaves me with a bad impression, and even lesser respect for the\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nIn the end, BTOOM! manages to disappoint so sorely that I would not recommend this show to anyone. It tries and fails so spectacularly in terms of plot, dramatic tension, fan service, character growth and development that the only thing it succeeds at is being a negative example for what NOT to do when producing an anime. \\n\r\nMadhouse, I thought you could've done better.\\n\r\nWatch it if you have nothing better to do; or don't watch it, you're really not missing out.",

In an effort to keep my self from spoiling anything, I'm going to try and stick to talking about the psychological aspect of the anime, and how the character's play such a vital role to it's success. First and foremost, for anyone who is squeamish about sexual abuse, violence, and sociopath's, this is probably not the anime to watch.   \r\nWhat I find most successful about the anime is how the plot revolves around the main characters lives. Each of the characters was put onto this island to playthis game for a reason, and were elected by people they knew from their own lives. That's practically all I'm going to say about the plot itself, because I think it's the characters that really make this anime worth watching.   \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters have extremely difficult to watch backstories, and personalities that match those backstories incredibly well. Not only that, but it shows human nature in a very real and disturbing way; it shows what happens when us as humans are cornered and forced to fight for our lives, and what happens to those of us who might be genuine at heart, but after being tested time and time again, break and turn into more of the \"primitive nature\" of kill or be killed. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy anime that show both the best and the worst of human kind, in an exciting and thrilling action packed environment, I would definitely consider giving Btooom! a try.",

            "content": "A person being forced into a game of death and having to cope with the moral dilemma of killing others sounds like it could make for a fairly compelling psychological story, but Btooom! managed to turn that concept into a shitshow instead. Btooom! tried to deal with ideas of trust, morality, and despair with this plot synopsis, but it ultimately squandered its potential.\r\nThe first episode showed promise, as Ryota's NEET life and unhealthy, otaku-like obsession with the game is immediately shown in a negative light as opposed to being glorified, and it gives us a taste of Ryota's moral dilemma to come when he killsone of the \"players\" of the death game in self-defense. However, a setup like this isn't difficult to achieve, and problems begin to arise quickly.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the plot often lacks suspense and tension. The game, despite trying to add variety with different kinds of bombs, is very simplistic, which is problematic when the show tries to focus on tactics. For example: the main characters are under assault by an enemy, who is using a homing bomb that detonates only when it reaches its target. A character who isn't being targeted intercepts the bomb and disables it, then decides to take the next bomb while protecting the original target. Given the situation, you'd think the assailant would now switch gears and switch targets. I came to this obvious conclusion almost instantaneously, but the show has the main character figure it out in an overly dramatic, Death Note-esque manner, absolutely shocking the other characters present. There were times in which the tactics were a bit more interesting, such as one case in which wind was used to the characters' advantage (and it was noted that this was a difference between the game \"Btooom!\" and the real version), but these moments are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of the boring tactics, the two main characters are protected by an unbelievable amount of plot armor that sucks the tension out of many moments. Expect scenes in which one of them dramatically reveal that they either \"threw the bomb away at the very last second\" or \"jumped into a hole in the ground in the nick of time.\" Sometimes the show won't even bother with that. A bomb might be thrown near a character and the character will simply fly back when it explodes, emerging unscathed in the aftermath. It's hard to take the show seriously as a result, especially when there are other ludicrous aspects lumped in that make things feel more silly than dire \u2013 Komodo dragons, anyone? How about Ryota's twisted smile when it looks like he's about to break and sacrifice someone, when two seconds later he manages to come up with a plan to save everyone (how edgy)?\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of edge, Btooom! falls into the trap of taking an attempt at depth and turning it into (what has become quite the buzzword among anime fans) \"edginess,\" a word that has come to be defined as something that occurs when a story tries too hard to be dark or deep and fails, potentially coming off as unintentionally funny, campy, or in-your-face. The show often portrays the majority of humans to be very corrupt, which serves as a plot device for characterization or a contrast to the main characters, but the problem is that this \"all people (or just men in Himiko's case; more on that later) are kinda scum\" trope is too overused. Granted, an island full of psychopaths may not be too out of place given the premise, but many of these people were thrown into the game for being dicks, not psychos. The show's presentation of the idea feels hamfisted rather than meaningful with all these \"edgy\" killers and rapists coupled together with funny shots of sadistic smiles and lifeless faces and other overdone instances of creepy, freaky nonsense, all of which contribute to the \"edginess.\" This kind of presentation makes it feel as though Btooom! is beating the viewer over his/her head with its themes and messages.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are arguably the show's biggest weakness. Ryota's character feels contradictory. On one hand, he is the chivalrous heroic type who is unbelievably kind and wants to save everyone, but on the other hand, he is portrayed (in flashbacks) to be a complete asshole who cares only for his game and has no issue with shouting at and even physically hurting his mother and stepfather \u2013 this, incidentally, is why Ryota got thrown into the game. A rocky relationship with one's parents compared to others can be understandable, but the contrast here in particular is too great to be believable. Ryota did act more amicable among classmates when he went to school, but this was before he became the obsessive NEET that we now know him to be; he is also shown to be acting very polite with representatives from the company that made \"Btooom!\", but it's only natural that he would suck up when he's trying to get a job doing something related to the only thing he cares about. As such, there's nothing in Ryota's flashbacks that could hint at his nature in the death game, or vice versa. It isn't as though one should expect Ryota to be a heartless killer in the game, but had he shown more of his bad personality in that setting, there could have been actual progression in his character from asshole to nice guy as he learns the value of having a friend he can trust and protect by meeting Taira (the person he partners up with in-game) and Himiko, thereby redeeming himself for what he did to get thrown into the game in the first place. Instead, Ryota is left inconsistent and bland. There's actually a scene at the end in which Ryota says that he shouldn't have looked down on people so much and should've learned about the value of caring for others besides himself, but this only fits with his flashback character \u2013 it goes contrary to the Ryota we see on the island who was nice and caring all along. It's like the author had the right idea at the start, but wanted to make Ryota more likable at the same time by making him nicer on the island, and so we're left with this confusing character.\\n\\n\r\nHimiko doesn't fare much better. In a strange backstory in which her friends wish the worst upon her (i.e. elect her to be thrown into the death game) because she ran away and \"betrayed\" them while they got raped (that selfish bitch ran to go get the cops...!), we learn that Himiko is very distrustful of men, and a similar experience on the island solidifies her belief that men are scum. She showed potential to be a strong female protagonist here, but the show wastes no time in turning her into a damsel in distress who soon becomes entirely dependent on Ryota, a trope that should've been avoided. Learning that not all men are so bad is one thing, but the presentation of Himiko's character is something else altogether. The portrayal of her character is even worse when examining all of these rapey scenes that Himiko is thrown into, which seem to be presented in a fanservicey way; they give off the impression that the animators are also trying to flaunt Himiko's body at the audience for sexual appeal, which is very out of place and awkward (there's a problem when you're not sure if a scene is supposed to be appalling or erotic).\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters mostly serve to present various psychological aspects of being thrown into death games. One character, Taira, puts his trust in Ryota on the island, but when the he's left alone several times after being injured, his mental stability begins to falter. There's this woman who trusts a man she loves (who, by the way, had already betrayed her once before), and was betrayed later when he took her chip. There's another guy who used to know Ryota from school, and he was used as a device for Ryota's characterization at the end. The concept isn't bad, but they all end up as one-note characters who are forgettable, although the dynamic between Ryota and Taira was sometimes decent, especially with the two of them expressing their fears in putting their trust in complete strangers in the environment of an \"every man for himself\" death game. The antagonist is shown to be a manipulative person who acts nice before he betrays those around him and reveals that he's a super evil prick (muhahaha...ha) \u2013 it appears that he's just super evil to act as a foil to Ryota's integrity. He comes off as a mere caricature, mostly, and is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter stupidity is a bit rampant. At the beginning of the death game, it took Ryota numerous tries before he realized that the bombs he was granted had timers attached, despite the fact that he'd already made the connection between the online and death games, that the bomb was identical to the timer bomb in the online game, and that the bomb had numbers counting down on it to signify a timer that Ryota had seen even before coming to his realization. Also, when Himiko voices her concerns regarding a certain bad guy's loyalty when the latter's tricking them, Ryota dismisses her suspicions, despite the fact that she had good reason to have them, and that he had learned before not to be so trustworthy; even when the totally-not-a-bad-guy acts very suspicious later on by asking Ryota if he trusted him out of nowhere when nothing prompted the question, Ryota doesn't feel as though anything is off. Moments like these are prime examples of how NOT to handle dramatic irony, and they're very frustrating to watch. It isn't as though Ryota was always foolish as fuck \u2013 as was mentioned prior, he's come up with a few decent strategies \u2013 but when he is, it really breaks the immersion.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to aesthetics, the art style is passable, albeit lackluster. The character designs look uninspired. Ryota is a thin guy with Light Yagami-styled hair, Himiko's a cute blonde with big tits, and so on. The designs serve their purpose, but little is done to make them stand out from other characters in other anime. The setting looks decent, but the most positive thing that can be said about it is that it works. The animation is nothing special for an action anime like this. The camerawork is poor, although the bombs' explosions look decent enough. The soundtrack is unmemorable and boring, but it usually isn't unfitting. The OP is exciting to listen to and serves well to pump you up for an action-packed gorefest, though the fact that it overshadows the anime could be seen as a bad thing as well.\\n\\n\r\nBtooom!, in trying to be mature, ends up beating its audience over the head with its attempt at dark themes. The characters are either cliche, inconsistent, or serve only to portray a trait or idea as opposed to a real character. The game is boring and the lacks the tension that a survival game needs to be exciting, resulting in underwhelming fights and ridiculous ways out of dire situations. The anime doesn't even have a proper conclusion, ending off with a shitty cliffhanger after the main characters finally hook up, with no second season in sight. Btooom! is a prime example of what not do to when trying to make something gritty, dark and deep.",

Although concept isn't very original, the characters and enjoyment is amazing. I couldn't find any complaints about this show except that is way too short. The battles are smart. There is so much tactical approach in the battles. Its more how to outsmart your opponent then using brute force which really enjoyed. I find very realistic how people are torn between humanity and survival instinct. Its a lot about trust.  Its not just like kill or be killed approach. Therewas a lot of smart and interesting  dialogue which is rarely seen in any kind of anime. There was surprisingly a very little of gore and ecchi scenes which is great. I hate when too much blood and boobs comes before show which I expected to see in this kind of anime. This show even has little of drama and romance that are superbly placed and aren't forced at all. I admit there are cliches scenes but they can be easily overlooked. For a long time I haven't seen a show that I enjoyed so much that I finished watching  all 12 episodes in 2 days. Just one question for the end: How on earth this show doesn't have a sequel?",

The Characters, i don't think there was even one well written character in there, let's start with sakamoto\r\nHis intelligenceis bad written, the thing showing this is the thing with the timer bombs. I mean he was 10# BTOOOM! player in the world (wich i hope require some intelligence) he was programmer etc. etc. but it takes two bombs to figure out its on a timer? Then the thing with the fight with implosion guy fight, It should have been more things with the mind state of seeing him from behind or i don't think it should have been added, and i also his personalty breakdowns works according to his overly good personality\\n\\n\r\nand himiko, first of i think this show has to much rapists and androphobia. And i think the whole incident that sent her there could have been better. Like the think her friends was really mad on her when there really there was nothing she could have done except for running and get the police, And then getting away from them was good to begin with. even without accounting gender 4 v 1 is a quite hopeless situation. and the other man hater is misjudging since it was a horrible human act that wasn't influenced by the male gender that traumatized her in the first place\\n\\n\r\nSince only horrible human beings that people wanted to disappear got to the island i think the characters are allowed to have some weird personalities but atleast their past could have been better written and be more realistic and be more in accordance with the influenced traits",

            "content": "A survival game in an uninhabited island based on an online game, now where have I heard of something similar to this?\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story was nicely done, even though it's a bit unoriginal. Though, Btooom! put its own twist in it by using rules from an online game called Btooom! (not a real game if you didn't know). The story had rape in it, and that's one thing I didn't like about the anime. If you're going to include rape in a survival game story, then you might as well make this whole series a hentai. Yes, I know it sounds realistic, but at leastactually keep it within the uninhabited island, and not in someone's high-school life. One more thing is that the rape was also just a bit overdone, because at the start, there was rape and maybe 4 minutes later, it shows a guy trying to 'punish' a girl. Though that probably adds some effect to the psychological side. There wasn't much sci-fi, other than the ability to find players that are close to you with a 'sonar ping' and BIMs that have unique abilities, such as timer bombs, cracker bombs or even implosions. It's very violent, but hey it's a survival game-type anime, you'd probably expect something like that. If you are the type who likes a slice-of-life, comedy-type anime, then you probably should stop reading this review.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI've heard a lot of things on how the character designs were from Death Note (I've actually never watched Death Note) and yes Light Yagami and Sakamoto Ryouta look similar. The animation and the art are actually quite nice, even though the character designs do look a bit 'old'. The colors can catch your eye easily.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST isn't too loud but sometimes can be used unnecessarily, because there was this one scene where it was serious, but a 'sports-event' soundtrack was playing. Didn't bother me that much, as the OST didn't stand out that much, though it did make some scenes blood-rushing. The 1st OP is probably one of my favorite OPs, because it somehow motivated me. The line \"the game has only just begun\" gave me goosebumps and it got stuck in my head. The OP feels like it was made just for the OP for Btooom!. The 2nd OP didn't give me the same feeling the 1st one did, but it was alright. The ED was more for an old romance anime, but it sounded relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto Ryouta, a full-time NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) and is the top Japanese player and is one of the best in the world. Sometimes, he can be stupid and act like a child, but other times, he's epic and smart. He is a kind person who thinks of others sometimes, but also has dirty intentions such as almost raping Himiko, but fortunately stopped himself before it escalated.\\n\\n\r\nHimiko, a highschool girl who had a normal life until one day, where it all got twisted. She is shunned by her fellow classmates, even her best-friend, who now hates her. She hates all men except Ryouta because she is married to him virtually, but not knowing until later on. She's a fragile woman and sometimes can be weak. She almost gets raped quite a bit in the anime. Though apparently more rape = more love for Ryouta. Anime logic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSurvival game-type anime always work out nicely most of the time and I can't see why people are giving this low reviews. I really enjoyed this anime, even though I would be skipping out some boring parts.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of survival game-type anime. If you liked Btooom, then I suggest you check out Mirai Nikki. Would I re-watch this anime? Maybe, because it needs A SECOND SEASON.",

            "content": "Btooom! is a pretty solid series. It's short with only 12 episodes and it does leave a gaping hole at the end due to the manga still being ongoing. Despite the gaping hole of an ending, it does a really great job on delivery. It's filled with great characters, and it's not the action series that it sounds to be from the synopsis. \r\nAs the synopsis says, it does pretty much go from him playing the online version to waking up in a jungle forced to play the real life version. It's not a weird \"snap your fingers and he's there\" transition like I wasafraid it would be. There is a mild setup and then we get the background story of who, what, when, where, why and how through flashbacks as the story progresses. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is dealt with much the same, meaning we get introduced to them and then see their lives and how they got there through flashbacks as well. It deals a little with the psychology of the experience, but a lot of the depth comes from why there are all there. It's a bit twisted at times both in the flashbacks and on the island (of course). All of this is complimented with some pretty well done voice acting that drives the emotional attachment developed to each of the characters in the story.\\n\\n\r\nI really felt the animation and artwork was done pretty well, and the music was integrated nicely into the flow of the series. It's nice that they didn't mess this up in post production. You can have all of cards lined up and then the guys behind the scenes can easily ruin it. Btooom has some decent production value.\\n\\n\r\nDon't let all of this praise fool you. It does have that gaping hole at the end, and it does slow down quite a bit towards the end. As I mentioned, this isn't much of an \"action\" anime series. The main character should be able to easily kill everyone on the island, but he's attempting to play a survival game without turning into a murderer. It's almost to a fault at times, especially with the intense beginning that sets you up for an action thriller that never matures.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully the story works, and I was a little relieved that it was not an action thriller all the way through. I really enjoyed the overall theme and feel of this series. I decided to watch the anime before reading the manga due to the 12 episode length, so I will at least get to enjoy the manga next.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this series, it is a solid 8, but due to it's faults it's easy to see that it could have been better. Definitely a must see in my book.",

            "content": "Btooom! 12 Episodes Long.\r\n\"Kill or Be Killed\", Or \"Lets work together and Survive!\"\r\nAt first i thought that this anime was going to be a complete joke. Your average \"Damsel in Distress\", and \"Prince Charming\". But wow, was i wrong. There is so much Emotion, the plot twists are amazing, The characters are breath taking! This anime has it all, and all of it is in the little 12 episodes! I Literally One-Sat it all, in the past 4 hours i've watched all 12 episodes. I've had no background information about this except for the few reviews that were recommened to me by different anime. Thatis how amazing this anime is.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nStarting off with your MC, you see him waking up in some sort of different \"land\" than he should be! And from then, you \"hear\" his reactions, which tell you that \"OH This voice acting is just Perfect! I won't get annoyed by their voices..Phew!\"\\n\r\nSo with that out of the picture, the story follows as one of your regular Survivor Anime's. Kill or be Killed. That's the motto that is flowing through the character's mind. \\n\r\nSlowly, Ryouta begins his journey and meets new people. However having lost his memories somehow, he recieves help; which is very rare. With the new people he's meeting, he goes on an adventure to try and find a way how to outsmart the game. Leaving behind a ton of plot twists, Empathetic moments, Amazing Fights, And strategic gameplay!\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis art is WAY better than most anime's out there! Every bit of detail everywhere! Where you have your average anime show a character in distress with very little details on their faces/aura, you have Btooom! With AMAZING details EVERYWHERE, Be it wrinkles (in the right places), Gorey Injuries, or even Traumatic Moments in characters Past. They certainly depicted everything with such emotion and thought.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm usually not a fan of Music, but the music added in for the action scenes/happy scenes/sad scenes certainly took my breath away. You'd think they'd play the same soundtrack throughout each episode? Hah! No way! They've made the music fit Perfectly with the scenes they deserved. Very well done for the music.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was OUTSTANDING! For just 12 episodes, i thought much less was going to be given to us, But man was i wrong. The development is so well-done. It shows you the characters background, and how it impacts them in the present time. It really made me just want to jump into my screen and hug them! It's so good, like words can NOT even describe it! For example, Kousuke Kira, ( don't worry no spoilers will be shown!) is just one of those characters that deserves the spotlight. Being thrown into a situation, with the disgusting horros of his past. . and then chucked into a new reality, and how the Actor voices him is just the definition of PERFECTION! And this goes for all of the characters! It's just perfect!!\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, This anime was very realistic. I could take in many situations and put them into my own real life. I Enjoyed every bit of that. When it comes to whether an anime fits your perspectives this anime has it in the Bag! The anime deserves so much more, It's too bad that the general summary of this anime is based off of Games. If it was something like adventure that didn't have to be limited to Gaming rules then maybe it would've got a lot of better reviews. However, do NOT let it hold you against watching this! It's just a short 12 episode Anime, which deserves to be watched by everyone! Atleast the first 4 episodes, that's just a small hour-ish. Give it a chance if you're not fond of gaming anime's, because i for sure am NOT a fan of gaming anime's, but this was an exception.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a masterpiece. However it did not recieve a 10 from me, only because of it's ending. Like most Masterpiece anime's, they start off with a bang then fall off towards the end. HOWEVER! This anime's ending isn't like what I usually see. The ending was very trustworthy and I do hope it gets a second season! It deserves so much. The manga is still continueing i think, and the wiki on the characters are still being updated so you will still love your characters even after the anime is finished!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you all will enjoy this anime. Even if gaming Anime's aren't your thing, I'm pretty sure this anime will be one that you'll remember.",

            "content": "As I just watched BTOOOM! about 3 years after the initial episode, its premise is actually a common theme of most series. Yes, about a NEET that is somehow trapped in a situation where their life at stake. It's so common that I even need to think twice or thrice to take such a show because there's a common follow-up of the series. It become a comedy that forget how the pinch in their life and in the last episodes, the situation become so dangerous that make the episodes before is a summer breeze. And how about BTOOOM!?\r\nBTOOOM! take a nice approach by using asurvival game as its core, a common thing of how Hollywood action movie/series. But, it didn't forget that it's an anime by using a game and NEET theme. It's quite a good start. As the story goes, BTOOOM! take us to know how the game works, how the mechanism itself, and how the rule-I think it's important to do this as a survival theme because we can't just let a guy die without a reason, right? Too bad, there are several detail that's somehow is quite bothering. One of them is how the 2 years-NEET protagonist is somehow can do all the run and action with a good stamina. Though, I was indifferent about it after several episodes. As the ending come, I think once again that this show is really using Hollywood recipe of action movie. Win against an enemy, got a friend, a betrayal, then closed by a kiss scene with the heroine. And I think they brought it well.\\n\\n\r\nI love how the character design made without using a moe-style too much. And that design is quite good to take this series seriously as survival theme. Though, there are several gap between design of a character to another. Next, I like their action scene even after they didn't use CG to do the bomb explosion. I actually expect some CG on the explosion, but a hand-drawn couldn't be said as a bad artwork. As a whole, the artwork is good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound work isn't really notable. I feel the explosion of every bomb is same regardless of the power. The BGM is not that bad, but it's isn't good either to feel a thrilling from the tense situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe character is quite bad for me. How the character interact, their questionable development, even how a weird conclusion of a certain episode is still bothering me. Despite that, the development of the protagonist is good. Though at first it's questionable how he's a jerk, but I love how he has his own ideal to do a thing, how he realize how jerk he is and know the reason of it, it's good to see how his development in later episode is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a good series. It's a good watch to see how a jerk become a hero and how the action scene goes with explosion despite a bad work on it. I would like to recommend this series to everyone who love an action with a good development on protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!",

            "content": "\u201cWhy is it always the game ones?\u201d -Me\r\nSurvival is the number one thing everything living is wired to do. We\u2019re driven to stay alive in any way possible, and so is everything else we live with here on planet Earth. That\u2019s why we do things, sometimes horrible, unthinkable things, in the spur of the moment when our life is in danger. \r\nThere really is a lot of death game anime that use this unwritten rule on a psychological basis, and my god is it rare to find a good one. Unfortunately, Btooom!, is not one of those hidden gems, and I\u2019m here to explain why.\r\n---PLOT---\r\nBtooom!\u2019sstory lays itself out with a death game set on a deserted island that\u2019s based off an in-universe console game of the same name. The characters are given bombs (called BIMs) that each have a different attribute, and imbedded in their left hands are chips that can track other players. The point of the game? Kill as many players as possible and collect up to eight of those chips so you can escape the island. Why?\\n\\n\r\nWell\u2026 It\u2019s alluded to, but the circumstances surrounding why is just BARELY grazed over because of Btooom\u2019s! improper ending.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime begins though, it actually starts out with some promise. There was good emotional depth, (at the time) and there\u2019s a clear connection to the obsession of hiding in your room all day, playing video games (or doing anything) excessively, and how the real life equivalent would be\u2026 psychologically difficult. Plus, with the \u201clast one standing\u201d plot; we get a demonstration of people reverting back to survival-mode, trying to get off the island and back to reality. For what its worth, all the players in the game have defining backstories that involve sexual assault, murder, and domestic abuse.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is where it quickly falls apart, because it tries SO HARD to be \u201cgritty,\u201d and for lack of a better adjective, \u201cedgy.\u201d These backstories are obviously there to gather audience sympathy, and explain the mental conditions of all the people playing, which would be a great dynamic if they weren\u2019t portrayed as shallowly and one dimensional as they are. It\u2019s direct in that we basically know that, \u201cthey were abused/assaulted etc, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re so messed up.\u201d But the backstory alone doesn\u2019t do enough to convince the audience that the psychological problems they have are realistic, because everyone acts flatly, creating a domino effect of predictability with no plausibility in sight. They stumble into trouble in a manner that\u2019s almost as if they want to get killed, prompting the question, \u201cWow, are you really that stupid?\u201d (They run directly into the path of incoming BIM\u2019s without any forethought) and they only ever act one way; kill or be killed. There\u2019s no dimension here, its like they\u2019re all machines.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the tactical aspects that come with a video game inspired death match goes, each character gets a different type of BIM, (one is a mine, another explodes upon impact, that sort of thing) and this would actually work if they knew how to aim when they\u2019re throwing the damn thing. Even if it explodes, the main characters are able to avoid its immediate radius anyway by jumping or dodging, crafting more than enough noticeable conveniences along the line of the story. The strategy is completely reliant on convenient circumstance, and to further screw up the narrative by tampering with the pacing, the story likes to flip flop between a completely useless subplot that takes place between the two main characters in the actual game of Btooom!, that can only be there to force them into being love interests. It doesn\u2019t flesh them out to any degree because they\u2019re interaction is limited to being only a short conversation at wedding and a party, so their \u201cchemistry\u201d doesn\u2019t even exist.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even at the end of it all, there\u2019s no solid explanation to the purpose of the death game, but this is a very common problem in anime. Either it didn\u2019t acquire the right following for it to continue and still make money off of merchandise, or it caught up to production of the manga. Regardless, it\u2019s a lackluster, unoriginal story that has no more to offer other than uninspired \u201cedginess\u201d and can\u2019t even hold suspense or tension because it\u2019s so predictable. The tactics are nothing but contrived and badly masked plot armor.\\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Terrible- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nThe main character Ryouta Sakamoto (who looks scarily similar to Light Yagami) is a 22 year old, Btooom! addicted NEET. Due to unknown circumstances, he\u2019s sent off to play the real version of Btooom! that he\u2019d spent so long getting good at.\\n\\n\r\nLike the rest of the anime, he\u2019s shown with promise. He had a trait of being genuinely emotionally affected with how he had to kill others, and it works out really well in the immediate beginning.\\n\\n\r\nBut this concept drops directly afterwards and he ends up being both bland and subconsciously indecisive of how he normally acts, without any development or exploration into what makes him tick. We know he became a shut-in because his family had never actually acted loving to him, but that backdrop doesn\u2019t work when he\u2019s constantly unsure about his personality. What I mean by this is that he\u2019s never the same guy, one minute he\u2019s a cunning mastermind at this game, (as he was explained to be one of the top players in real life) and the next he\u2019s an incapable ditz who somehow is able to escape the unrealistically small blast radius of a f****ing hand grenade. We know he\u2019s going to come out unscathed and pwn n00bs because of his brilliant \u201cstrategies\u201d that only he can think up, and is somehow thin as a twig and can outrun anyone, despite having spent years in his room all day. \\n\\n\r\nThe secondary main character, Abnormally Large-Breasted Himiko, is not any better. Her backstory involves a plunder of emotional trauma from attempted assault, and later when she\u2019s cast into the game she\u2019s molested, causing a fear and distrust of men. Admittedly, this is an interesting backstory for a character considering the traumatic influence of her past life, but it just feels so utterly misused and as a consequence, forced. She\u2019s regularly taken captive, forcing her into the \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d archetype, which wholly mistreats that capable backstory she has as she never ends up developing out of those trust issues, making it nothing but irresponsibly offensive and downright ironic, because the one thing she can actually trust is exactly what she\u2019s afraid of.\\n\\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, her backdrop is even further insulted because its used as a reason she can smack the protagonist like the baka he is! Because HE\u2019S DEFFINITELY THE PERVERT HERE IF YOU WALK OUT OF A SHOWER DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM. I don\u2019t know why having the two main, opposite gendered characters be love interests is so compulsory, but it has to be done right. And it isn\u2019t done right.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are completely bland and void of direction, as the only thing they\u2019re defined by is a dark motivation, one, specific trait, (doubt, insanity, etc) and a limited backstory, all of which pertaining to \u201cdis guy is nuts cause he had a messed up life.\u201d They only ever act violent, so it\u2019s never hard to predict what they will do next. \\n\\n\r\nBut there IS a tiny, ray of hope with the character Taira Kiyoshi. Out of all the characters, he\u2019s the most developed and explored, with a backstory that is far less forced and believable than the rest of the cast. He\u2019s a man who is both clearly affected negatively by the life he had outside the game, and sees now that he wants to correct those misgivings and get off the island. Taira is really the only character with an understandable motive.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, none of the other characters\u2026 have that. Their lives suck, and there\u2019s nary a time when its totally understandable that they\u2019d just jump right in to kill each other instead of at least trying to band together for survival. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s part of the show! We see how desperate and evil they act to get home again!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis would work if there were a slow decline from sanity to insanity from the cast, but they\u2019re all crooks and killers as soon as they\u2019re dropped in. They just decide to listen to whoever put them there, and kill others without hesitation. While there is a reason they\u2019re all this way, it\u2019s part of the unresolved nature as to why they\u2019re playing the game to begin with. \\n\r\n---Characters Score: -Poor- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---ANIMATION---\\n\r\nI believe in giving credit where credit is due, because this animation is goddamn gorgeous. It should be too; it was done by Madhouse after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe style is sharp and smoothly cut, with a lot of the colors being browns, tropical greens and grays due to the amount of foliage. The attention to detail in the backgrounds is amazing, where tree trunks are realistically barked, (with variance in bark size and color) leaves are all individually detailed, (most have visible veins) and the water, especially the ocean, looks like something directly out of a photograph. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some really standout character designs too, especially Abnormally Large Breasted Himiko, who\u2019s skirt pattern is a camouflage print that stays stationary as she moves, a stylistic choice that\u2019s common in American animation. But there are also a few duds in the cast design wise. Ryouta for example, who\u2019s a carbon copy of Light Yagami.\\n\\n\r\nBut otherwise, is some really high quality stuff. The explosions are always detailed in the finest of hotter colors, rust appears as if it\u2019s actually there, and the environment around the characters is as convincing as it gets for a two-dimensional animation. (Might I add, reptilian scales look FABULOUS) Even if theres under-whelming action (the characters are literally just throwing bombs at each other) The movement and style looks beautiful anyway.\\n\r\n---Animation Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SOUNDTRACK---\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is wonderful too. It has a cinematic feeling, an ensemble of both thematic, powerful music that assists the (nonexistent) suspense, and upbeat drum tracks that follow the action. I noticed several piano/violin pieces that belong in an award winning drama, and those were brilliantly put together. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone who\u2019s heard Nano\u2019s opening themes know they\u2019re done best when played over a panoramic shot of every character standing in the wind like a badass. Her opening, \u201cNo pain, No game\u201d is a punk piece that fits wonderfully for the atmosphere of Btooom!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ending, May\u2019n\u2019s \u201cAozora\u201d is a tranquil, mellow song that works wonderfully as well, paired with the beautiful visuals of the credits. \\n\r\n--- Soundtrack Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\r\nAFTER REPORT:\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tAmazing, beautiful music\\n\r\n-\tGORGEOUS animation\\n\r\n-\tFor what its worth, initially has a lot going for it emotionally\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n-\tOpen ending, room for new season and for the story to go up in quality\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tCompletely forced \u201cedginess\u201d that is terribly misused and offensive\\n\r\n-\t100% predictable, as the characters always act a certain way\\n\r\n-\tBullshit \u201ctactics,\u201d that have no convincing basis and are pulled out of the writer\u2019s ass to keep the main characters alive. \\n\r\n-\tThe main characters act like they don\u2019t know others are trying to kill them, but almost always end up unscathed anyway\\n\r\n-\tOverall bland, undefined cast that doesn\u2019t have any semblance of originality or personality and horribly forced \u201cromance\u201d sub-plot\\n\r\n-\tAllusion to what is happening and how, but not why because it never concludes, making the base story horribly unoriginal\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: -Terrible-\\n\r\nBtooom!, has no polished, complete story in sight. It lacks in nearly every single way, and cannot be enjoyed by anyone who is looking for a deep, complex and original plot that concludes, or well-developed, consistent and explored characters. It would be fine if it were mindless violence but it tries, so\u2026 so hard to be deep and realistic. So that entertainment aspect is out the window.\\n\\n\r\nThough I will say this; the story is open enough and has enough potential for it to go in many different directions. If this is indeed a cour one, then I will definitely watch cour two, because as it stands, it has enough to flip itself around.\\n\\n\r\nBut for now, it doesn\u2019t have that.\\n\\n\r\nI give Btooom! a pathetic 3/10\\n",

In case you were confused that is supposed to be the noise a bomb makes not a new pokemon. If you like mind games that are over convoluted and a plot so forgettable that I already forgot it, then boy do I have show for you! I watched this show a while ago to fill the future diary void and I don\u2019t think it worked cause I still re-watched future diary 3 bloody times. IDK the art seems good I guess I don\u2019t rememberthe soundtrack being anything great or anything for that matter\u2026 did this show have music or was it just all bomb sounds?\\n",

That's amazing.\r\nThus game itself always keep on evolving. Unless companies go into bankruptcy.\r\nIncidentally, I don't like Mobile game. I have never played it before. I always have and I always will.\r\nMoney is precious. Don't waste your time.\r\nThen, I talk Btooom! since now.\r\nProtagonist of this show is Ryouta Sakamoto. Ryouta is high level online player, and He is what you call NEET.\r\nI hate NEET, but considering his cruel past, really sympathize with him.\r\nOne day, when Ryouta woke up, he was in uninhabited island. He getinto trouble there. \\n\r\nHe makes full use of inherent skill, bomb (BIM), radar, he need to survive this game.\\n\r\nAnother participant, Himiko. She is heroine of this show. She also have tragic past and circumstance as same as Ryouta.\\n\r\nAt first two persons don't act together, but they made them start to trust each other in a certain event.\\n\\n\r\nStory is simple than you would think. Kill and Kill. That's all.\\n\r\nHowever, depiction of characters are wonderfully realistic (a bit of Sci-fi elements).\\n\r\nDid I ever tell you the definition of life? Get busy living, or get busy dying.\\n\r\nThey must eat and fight to live. At times someone fall into madness.\\n\r\nMy point is that you can know human's real nature through this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are some mature adults. Ryouta is smart and intelligent. Himiko have not special skill, but she is very delicate.\\n\r\nOne of participant, Kousuke Kira is freaking cool child character. Though his turn never many, he will make an intense impact you.\\n\r\nPromise also psychological battle with Ryouta and Kousuke. Not simply throw bombs each other.\\n\r\nNobutaka Oda and Hidemi Kinoshita are formidable pair. Spotlight of this show could say.\\n\r\nI can't write about other characters because it is danger, but they are quite twisted.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is plainly beautiful. Especially background, sunlight, forest, animals.\\n\r\nExplosion effect is flashy and fresh. It use different organized depending on the situation.\\n\r\nArt style is supremely likable. Each character has my type. Especially Himiko's design is awesome.\\n\r\nIncludes a little sexual content, but I think that opinions are divided.\\n\r\nThere is person that not be concerned about at all, or there is person that it is say dirty and unnecessary. I'm the former.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is not impressive. It doesn't match some scenes. But It is basically not break atmospheres.\\n\r\nVoice acting is solid. I tasted feeling like dub of Movie. I wrote it by Japanese style.\\n\r\nOP and ED songs are best of this show. OP song is rock, stylish, and want to listen it over and over again. I love this song so much!\\n\r\nActually, I listened to full version of OP song in Youtube's official music video before I watch this show. No harm in trying listen.\\n\r\nED song is quiet melody about Himiko's sentiment. You will want to listen to it in regularly.\\n\r\nLyrics also got to the point of story. Very polite. Great Job, Nano and May'n.\\n\\n\r\nI express weak points from now on. First of all, story's progress is very slow. Somewhat takes time for begin to get interesting.\\n\r\nSecondly, a certain character is ugly and mean bastard. I hate this character. Trademarks are skinhead and glasses.\\n\r\nFinally, the story is unfinished. It depends on my interpretation is ended beautifully, but as I thought indigestion.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, this show is drastically good. Individualistic and so many flaws, but still entertaining.\\n\r\nFirst I avoided this show because I dislike protagonist's setting, but when I start watching, I was immersed before I knew it.\\n\r\nThis show also not for everyone. But if you love products like Bomberman, Far Cry 3, Lost, The Hunger Games, then you will enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this show by Rakuten TV (Japanese video distribution site). And I bought Blu-ray Complete Collection after a few days.\\n\r\nThe reason is that I love this show and I want 2nd season.\\n\r\nThere is no help for it now, but I did my best as much as possible.\\n\r\nAlthough it seems some people have already given up, I'm still hoping.\\n\\n\r\nNO PAIN, NO GAME.

            "content": "Enter the world of Btooom! through the eyes of Ryouta, a world-class player of the video game Btooom, a battle arena FPS game where guns are absent and bombs called BIMs are the only weapons available.  Through unfortunate circumstances, he gets kidnapped and ends up on an island with real-life BIMs by his side.  He soon realizes that he is trapped in a real-life game of Btooom! on the island and his only way to leave is to win.\r\nIt\u2019s a land of kill or be killed.\r\nIt\u2019s pretty clear from the get-go that there\u2019s way more to the forced game of survival than whatmeets the eye.  Btooom!\u2019s pacing is fast enough to maintain constant interest. The show begins as a straight up survival thriller where Ryouta goes through hell\u2019s worth of bombs and violence, desperately applying his skills in the video game as survival and battle tactics so he can live for another day.  Of course, there is an external force working behind the scenes that prevents the outside from interfering with the \u201cgame.\u201d  A change in focus from the battle of survival to figuring out the method behind the madness takes place.  The plot\u2019s flow is fairly straightforward, but it overall feels very fluid and not thrown together. Btooom! reveals itself to be not just an anime about throwing bombs to keep living, but a strong presentation of reading between the lines and defeating the system that restricts the freedom of the island\u2019s inhabitants.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the story being told mainly through the eyes of Ryouta, there\u2019s a healthy amount of screen time and development for the supporting cast.  Each character has a respectable personality and some even have compelling pasts that all add up to reveal the big secret behind Btooom! Island.  No one particularly stands out since they\u2019re all unique in their own way, but no one\u2019s left behind either.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 interactions with each other vary in many different ways.  One would expect that every encounter on the island always leads to explosions and extreme adrenaline levels, but it\u2019s easy to notice that not everyone is dead-set on staining their hands for their own sake.  Not even a Btooom! master like Ryouta can have the same killing intent as he does in the virtual world.  His skills in the game are refined to defend himself and destroy his foes, but he still has a rational sense of reality and wants to find a way to escape the bloodshed that was forced upon everyone on the island.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation does not try to impress anyone with movie quality animation and pretty colors.   Fancy special effects take a back seat as the art shows its focus on the fact that Btooom! is still set in the real world despite having video game rules set upon it.  The island environment is not portrayed as the dream beach area, but drawn as close to a real island as 2D drawing can make it.  It is a nice touch to see how the island slowly transitions from a peaceful resort to a bloody battleground of explosions as the episodes fly by.\\n\\n\r\nEven though explosions aren\u2019t the most exciting visual effects for anime and Btooom! is all about bombs, the action is kept very real.  There\u2019s nothing top-notch to marvel at here, but the animation delivers and looks very fluid when intensity unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nOpenings and ending aren\u2019t all to what defines the sound of an anime, but nano really drives it home with powerful music that pumps the viewers up and portray the image of Btooom! quite accurately.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of that, here\u2019s nothing new about all the other sounds.  Explosions sound like explosions, and there is no reason to be surprised by much of anything in the SFX and voice acting department.  They all get the job done.  The background music is subtle and it\u2019s really most noticeable during action and times of suspense. The mood is well-promoted by the BGM, and combined with nano\u2019s impressive performance, a promising soundtrack can be something to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no \u201cboring\u201d part in this anime, especially considering the likable cast of characters, the moderately fast pacing, and the intense moments that lead to engaging bomb fights.  It\u2019s very easy to stay glued to the screen when all these factors are playing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not only is Btooom! a true blast to watch, but all the major themes that apply to standard survival anime are shown with a noticeable presence. The themes are not up for self-interpretation.  Btooom! is here to tell a message about being forced out of normal society and balancing personal morals with what is really needed to continue living in whatever conditions that are forced upon the outcasts.\\n\\n\r\nFinal ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStorytelling (40%):  8 -> 3.2\\n\r\nCharacters (30%):  8 -> 2.4\\n\r\nVisuals (10%):  8 -> .8\\n\r\nSounds (10%):  8 -> .8\\n\r\nEnjoyment Value (10%):  9 -> .9\\n\\n\r\n3.2 + 2.4 + .8 + .8 + .9 = 8.1\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 8.1\\n\\n",

            "content": "So wow I was...hehe...\"Blown away\" by this show...that pun may need some explanation if you have no idea what this show is about.\r\nThere are lots of shows nowadays that follow the style of 'Oh no, we're trapped in our favorite video game. What ever will we do?', examples being obviously Sword Art Online and Log Horizon. Log Horizon fixates more on the RPG aspect and the characters actually enjoy their new setting. SAO on the other hand is more of a WoW-esque game where players literally fight for their lives to escape. Btooom! on the other hand, is the best of both worlds, where playersare familiar with their setting (AKA The game Btooom!), but have a strong urge to survive.\\n\\n\r\nWe all have people in our lives that we would like to be rid of and never see again. But how far are you willing to stress that emotion? Btooom! follows the story of Ryouta, the best player of the game 'Btooom!' in Japan, rated number 10 in the world. However, because of this, he is ridiculously anti-social and literally drops out of school to play this game. Now at age 22, that becomes an issue, for he has no job and his nonstop gaming is tearing his family apart essentially. In fact, this leads to the main plot. Recently, letters have been popping up in Japan stating that if you write someone's name, someone you want to disappear, and send that name to an address, you'll get a ton of money and that person will vanish. People think it's just a chain letter gimmick, however, it is quite real. Certain people whose names are written on these letters are taken and dropped on an island in the middle of the Pacific with no way out except for one method: Collect 7 chips. What are chips? They are surgically implanted stones placed on the hands of the contestants and the only way to remove the chip is to have the person die. Obviously, conflict ensues. The catch here is that the conflict on the island follows the game Btooom! where the only weapon one can use are different variations of bombs (see, now that pun makes sense).\\n\\n\r\nI've been talking about the plot for a long time so I suppose I should move on to other aspects. The characters are all great and have very well done attributes and quirks, ranging from murderous 14 year old kid to a lawyer etc. Basically, there are all kinds on this island fighting to survive.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation work is really well done, especially where it needs to shine most, that being during scenes of action and explosions. The soundtrack is also, personally, one of the best I've heard recently. It's subtle, but adds a lot to the show.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on for a lot longer saying why I loved this show, but I'll let the positives and negatives handle most of that for me.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+The two opening themes, 'No Pain No Game' and 'Exist' are both really good and fit the show perfectly\\n\r\n+Animation and sound is solid, espacially during moments of action\\n\r\n+Characters are diverse and all have their own little quirks or memorable attributes\\n\r\n+The romance in this show is one of the best I've seen. Characters don't fall in love just because the plot wants it, but the love really feels real and deserved\\n\r\n+This show really hits hard the whole morals thing. However, even though there are times when the main character says he won't play the game and kill people, he doesn't just live by that and take whatever comes at him, but instead, if someone tries to blow him up, he'll actually fight back and will kill them.\\n\r\n+The touching moments of trust and emotion really stand out in this explosive world\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-Only a 12 episode show (gimme more)\\n\r\n-Some scenes of torture and rape (just a warning in case you aren't into that)\\n\r\n-Characters, especially the main one, are SO naive it hurts sometimes\\n\\n\r\nIf you're really into theses shows where characters are put in the worlds of their favorite game, I highly recommend this show. In fact, I recommend it even you don't like those shows because it stands out from those other contenders. It ignores fanatsy in favor of real, deep meaning to the game and the morals one faces and how far into a game one can go before they lose themselves. If you want a touching, yet action-packed, violence-filled, explosive adventure, Btooom! is the perfect show\\n\r\nAnd that's why Btooom! gets a 9/10",

            "content": "I was looking for an anime with a post-adolescent protagonist and a serious storyline, and that brought me to Btooom! But the stats for this anime on ANN and MAL weren't outstanding, so I went into it with mixed feelings but came out impressed.\r\n[NO SPOILERS]\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\r\nThis anime is a good eye-candy that has a respectable story with interesting characters. If you\u2019re into the action, sci-fi and survival game subgenres mixed with some romance, then you will enjoy this anime. This is one of those few examples where a decent-to-good manga is adapted into a better finished product.\r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nThe story, in a nutshell, explores how people\u201csurvive\u201d when forced into a harsh survival game in a tropical island in the middle of nowhere, and then it mixes this setup with some heavy action and light romance.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime quickly reminds of Sword Art Online (SAO), as they both share similar premises of a survival game; although SAO features a visual reality, whereas this anime is a real reality. The inciting incident of this anime also has a very similar feel to that of SAO. But pretty much everything else about this anime differs from SAO. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode should thrill you enough to get you very interested. The last episode warrants a second season to tie up loose ends. And everything in between is predictable but also enjoyable because the action-packed, raw adventure of the main characters will firmly hold your interest throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist Ryouta Sakamoto had the privilege to undergo full development \u2013 he is very much human with his carnal tendencies balancing his natural virtue \u2013 but not without major faults. Ryouta for some reason always figured out stuff 100 years late. It would've made for a good plot point if the anime creators had set him up as a downright idiot,  but he wasn't established as one. In fact, on the contrary he was introduced as a gaming genius. By halfway into the series, it became clear that the anime creators spontaneously nerf his reasoning ability in certain scenes just to make the plot thicker and hike up suspense. Terrible idea.\\n\\n\r\nThe female protagonist Himiko was also well developed as a damsel in distress, and was at least not another archetypal useless female protagonist. She might not have been the super strong, super smart type, but she at least decisively pushed the story forward, considering that the premise of her strange interpersonal attitude was properly justified with a believable back-story.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters represent a full spectrum of personalities and disorders: the psychopathic young teen, the treacherous doctor, the darwinistic thug who believes that only the fittest should survive, the pragmatic opportunist, etc. They probably won\u2019t bore you.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & ART: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was neat, colourful and shiny; and since most of the scenes were outdoor, you have sunshine, and the anime creators effectuated its effect very well with the shadings and glitters. You can expect no less from the studio Madhouse.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow the animation failed to fully convey the emotions that characters were expressing due to the subpar portrayal of subtle facial and bodily movements. This was a persistent flaw. The flow of motion during action scenes were decent enough to suffice. In all, the neatness and lustre of the art makes up for any shortcomings in animation, which were not even close to bad.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT & PACING:\\n\\n\r\nThe plotline is non-linear in the first few episodes, with long flashbacks that, if consolidated, can span up to half of an episode. These flashbacks get in the way because many times they have absolutely nothing to do with the scene they interrupt. Nothing kills the mood more than having a flashback of \"the girls\u2019 day out\" that interrupts the scene where someone\u2019s throat has just been slit and sh*t is about to go down, especially when this flashback adds no value to the intense scene it just interrupted. However those flashbacks later on proved to be very useful to the story and eventually became very much appreciated. Nevertheless, they could have been spliced in more seamlessly; but really, they didn't have any overall adverse effect in the long-term.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s pacing was perfect. It didn't feel slow or rushed. Something intense always happened and moved the story forward in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT ARMOUR:\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist Ryouta Sakamoto is equipped with a strong plot armour, literally. His skin had to be made of steel for him to survive some things other characters cannot (and did not) survive. But it wasn't rampant enough to detract from the fun.\\n\\n\r\nFANSERVICE & ECCHI:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime abounds with bouncing clothed boobs, panty-shots and cleavages but no nudity; although there are scenes where the sexual tension is palpable and non-consensual sex implied. In all, there is a hefty dose of fan service in this anime, but it is more sanitized than in the manga.\\n\r\n_____________________\\n\\n\r\nFeedbacks via PM, comment, etc., will be much appreciated.\\n",

            "content": "[May contain slight spoilers]\r\nBTOOOM!, a psychological-action-thriller series which was not only one of my first anime I had watched, but after 3 full watches, still remains one of my favourites and defiantly one of the better series I have watched. Although not having a horrible score on this site, I still do believe it to be severely underrated and I feel people focus on the negatives (of which it does have a couple) a lot more and ignoring the positives of which it does so well. \r\nStory\r\nThe story takes the basic concept of such manga as Battle Royale and adapts upon it, although having quitea few similarities I feel it does enough to become its own entity rather than a clone. Giving the 'players' different types of bomb (or BIM) and a radar to tactically take down their enemies and use strategies some of the players have learnt from playing the fictional video game 'BTOOOM!'. Also having the players being 'chosen' indivually through sign ups rather than completly random people adds another layer of characterization and originality. Being only 12 episodes, it has a lot of plot to fit into that length (50 chapters or so) so it does feel slightly rushed, I think it would have been alot better suited to a 24 episode series to flesh out the characters a bit more but for a 12 ep series, I deem it one of, if not the best.\\n\r\n[Overall 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nFor a 12 ep series, this has a lot of character development and back stories for most, if not all of the recurring characters, fed slowly in-between the current story, which does not feel forced and develops the backstory in segments, revealing more and more of the characters. This anime's strongest point and what it does the best or certainly on par with is the character's morales, and how in a desperate situation without law, your inner instincts come out and take over, be it murder, torture, rape etc. I feel that Himiko's character was extremely well developed and definitely the best character in the show imo, being a character that underwent a serious traumatic event and losing all trust in men became interesting when she met Sakamoto and her slowly regrowing that trust was fascinating to see. Some of the supporting characters seemed a little cliche therefore not getting a perfect rating.\\n\r\n[Overall 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nExecution\\n\r\nSomething that most people probably wouldn't rate an anime for but I deem to be one of the most important parts, how well executed was the anime, could it have been better? I believe this anime to be excellently executed, a fantastic mix of plot, character development and action, one of it's best features is how well it creates atmosphere and threat, at any moments the characters could be killed or attacked, and the great sfx and music add to this also.\\n\r\n[Overall 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nMusic - This anime has a very varied and decent soundtrack, not one I would rate as one of the best, but some tracks are sure to be memorable and stand out, most add to the atmosphere of the moment whereas a couple feel out of place. \\n\r\n4/5\\n\r\nVoice Acting [Dub]\\n\r\nI'll start by saying Brittney Karbowski as Himiko did an exceptional job, one of the best female performances in anime imo, completely bought that character to life and cemented her as one of my favourite characters and voice actors overall. The rest of the cast stand in her shadow but only a couple felt a bit poor compared, most of them were at least good, but not too many other excellent performances.\\n\r\n4/5\\n\r\n[Overall 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nNot much I can say about the art, it is neither poor neither outstanding, I thought it did blood very well but overall good art, won't blow you away but will not be disappointing.\\n\r\n[Overall 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAs you might be able to tell I very much enjoyed this anime, partly because it was one of the first I had watched so I might be slightly biased, but after re-watching it twice and looking at it more critically rather than nostalgically I still very much enjoy this series and will remain one of my favourites, all 3 times I watched in 1 sitting because of it's excellent job of cliffhangers at the end of each episode, make it very hard to stop watching, only can say the same for ERASED, Steins;Gate and Death Note that also did that.\\n\r\n[Overall 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nOverall Positives and Negatives\\n\r\n++Himiko\\n\r\n++Portrayal of character morales and trust\\n\r\n+Interesting take on the 'Battle Royale' genre\\n\r\n+Character development and backstories\\n\r\n+Overall sound\\n\r\n+Threat/atmosphere\\n\r\n+Told through multiple perspectives\\n\r\n+Learning the rules of the game felt believable, not genius nor stupid\\n\r\n+Cliffhangers\\n\\n\r\n--Everyone is almost indestructible, many characters have BIM's explode right next to them and they just brush it off, I understand you can't really have an action series like this and have it 100% realistic, but they could have toned it down a bit.\\n\r\n-Unbelievable coincidences, there are too many characters that meet that knew in the real world, out of ~30 players out of millions in Japan this felt a little too coincidental, I could believe one but there are multiple characters who know others already, especially a certain in-game couple.\\n\r\n-Length, not exactly the anime's fault but a slightly longer series would have benefited it massively\\n\r\n-A certain ecchi BIM scene involving a Ms. Himiko, just felt stupid and out of place, completely unneeded and frustrating, also a couple other ecchi scenes seemed a little ott although some were used very well to the story's advantage.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nEnjoyment of the series as a whole: 9.7\\n\r\nRaw Quality of the series: 9.1\\n\r\nOverall Rating 9.4/10 : Exceptional series, just falling short of masterpiece status with a few too many negatives and short length.",

            "content": "Take 1/2 LOST, add 1/4 Gantz and spice it with Mirai Nikki. Dish out with beautiful tropical landscapes and you will get Btooom!\r\nShort story long, Btooom! is another anime that features a mysterious survival game in which much like in Mirai Nikki the players are meant to eliminate competition in order to survive. Or they could work together to achieve better results and together figure out what brought them all on a beautiful deserted island. What's more, what they have to do in reality is very close to the gameplay of a popular video/computer game called Btooom!\r\nPlot. In all honesty the plot is quite intriguingand yes it did remind me of LOST somewhat. In the beginning there's a lot of mystery as to what brings the protagonists here, how many players there are out here, who's behind this massive kidnapping and much more. The \"gameplay\" concept of this anime is also very cool; simple and effective. As the story goes, a lot of questions will get their answers though don't expect absolutely shocking plot twists. Most of the episodes will leave you thrilled because action scenes are rather satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nArt. The art is very good. Beautiful tropical island reminds me the fresh screens from Far Cry 3. The landscapes are lovingly detailed and there are great light/shadow effects. Characters are decently designed and overall are pleasant to the eye. Animation quality is very good, movements are smooth and life-like.\\n\\n\r\nSound. The OP is wonderful with upbeat rhythm and sweet animations. It fits just right to an action-filled anime. The ED is traditionally much more soothing and gentle, more instrumental too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. This is probably the weakest point as of yet, though definitely it doesn't ruin the anime considering that there should be second season down the road.  Ryouta, the main protagonist, will probably get on your nerves quite a bit. His backstory unveils that he used to be a complete gaming junkie with no ambitions and goals and no regards to his family. Of course he will get to regret it all and repent his ways, but that's not my issue with him. My issue with him is his surprisingly \"shounen\" ideology of getting through such a grueling experience with his hands unstained, which is too naive and doesn't quite fit well into seinen aura this anime has. Sadly he doesn't change in that regard even by the end of the season and displays quite a number of such childish fits.\\n\r\nAnother source of disappointment would be Himiko, a necessary set of nipples in this anime. Her backstory reveals several rape attempts and her struggle for survival. It's honestly quite expected that she'd act hostile towards male characters, still she comes around way too slow before even acting civil. The biggest letdown is that before she meets the main guy, she's perfectly able to stand up for herself, yet after the meeting she is reduced to a typically helpless big-boobed female which worships her hero (= read damsel in distress). Oh yeah speaking of boobs, they actually did a scene when a bomb ricochets off Himiko's. Glorious, isn't it.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the relationships between the characters are taken slowly and steadily which is a big fat plus because it adds more realism and prepares good base for further episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a very decent anime that combines nicely both action and suspense and does a good job portraying relationships and mind states of people in extreme situations. It's definitely better than similar survival titles like Mirai Nikki or Deadman Wonderland. This season completed, I'm actually looking forward to see the continuation.\\n",

I got told this anime was supposed to be for adults, yet it tries to force rape, murderand video games down my throat every single episode like a fifteen year old boy writing fan fiction for a Quentin Tarintino film.",

            "content": "SUMMARY REVIEW: This shit is ass. Don't watch it.\r\nFULL REVIEW:\r\n-Story 3 : The story could've been SOOO much better, this show had a good concept, it could've been a masterpiece if they gave a fuck about the series but it seems they cared more about catering to that average \"pervy 12 year old\" audience. But in 2018 this anime is 5 years old so I have to cut it some slack.\r\n-Art 4: The artwork was average, nothing crazy, nothing ugly, its just ok. Killing people with only Explosions was the main reason I wanted to watch it but they all look the same. \r\n-Sound6:Everything audio-wise sounded good except the explosions and the music, which disappointed me. Oh and the dub is horrible so just go with the sub if you plan on watching it.\\n\\n\r\n-Character 2: Oh shit this was baaaad. Lets get the worse character out the way: Himiko, Her as a character, she was useless unless her tits where on screen she was just a fantasy dream girl that would please the audience this show was going for. Her nearly being rape every other episode was just fucking disturbing for no reason. It was just there to, again, please the stupid audience. I didn't care for ANY of the characters. Why? Because their development was rushed. They really don't give us any background knowledge of the characters other than the reason why they were cast to the island. (I'm not saying that every character has to have a tragic past to have a watcher care for a character but it was the only thing this show had to build character) Sakamoto is the same character as Kirito from SAO: He's a clueless pervy nerd who is good at the game because he was good at the digital game. If you think about it Sakamoto should be dead, (if was dead it would've made this show 10x better because, it would show that nobody's safe and that anybody can die) as a NEET that plays games 24/7  he doesn't have any real physical or mental advantage. The ONLY advantage he has is that he knows all the BIMS and what they can do. Other than that he's not smart or clever or charming or anything. He was just good at the digital game. The first enemy Sakamoto faced should've killed him 5 times already, he was fit, knew how his BIMS worked and he was prepared to kill. But since Sakamoto was good a clicking a mouse he beat him....I don't want to talk about the others characters but here's a small summary: boring.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 1: I think you know what I was gonna say.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall 2: If they really cared about this series they'd gave the show more thought and more time to develop but they just wanted to make a quick buck instead of a masterpiece. I really wish this show was better but it's not so suck a dick",

            "content": "Btooom! \r\nThis was a good anime with a pretty decent premise. I enjoyed watching it, and I could probably watch it again if I wanted to. However, this really isn\u2019t the best of the all of the survival game animes out there. And this anime probably could have been better if it weren\u2019t for a few things.\r\nStory: 6.5/10\r\nWith survival games being so damn popular and so overdone, you really need to do something new with it if you want to make it into something special. Sure, having a bunch of people who have earned the hate of people they know be nominatedfor a deadly survival game is a great idea, but what\u2019s the point of such a large cast if you\u2019re not going to do anything with all of them. I hardly know anything about most of the characters and I REALLY, REALLY wanted to learn more about them! Like there was this one kid who liked to kill for fun. He didn\u2019t care about life and would snap at any adult who tried to talk sense into him. He was very interesting and I wanted to see more of him. I wanted more insight into what he was thinking and I would\u2019ve wanted to see a little more of his past. I also wanted to know more about Ryouta\u2019s family so I could understand better where things went wrong. Also it may just be me, but it seemed like halfway through the show, they changed the rules on when you can use the bombs so I got kind of confused at some point. It also amazed me how quickly the two leads forgot about their comrade just for the sake of fanservice. They also ended it in a terrible way. The people who made the game claim that there is wrong with the island that the nominees are playing on, and then they just end it there. I wanted to know what was wrong with the island. I wanted more insight on the characters. You see, this is the problem with twelve episode series. FEW stories can be fully told in just 12 episodes! I wish they would\u2019ve provided an explanation of some sort or actually went through with making a second season. So much build up, and yet so much letdown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were all very interesting and unique. I liked all of them. However, sometimes the background seemed really blurry. I\u2019m not sure if this was done on purpose or not. Anyway, all of the fights scenes were done well and were pretty exciting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here except that all the characters sounded great. I will say however, that this was my first time hearing the voice of Kanata Hongo (Ryouta\u2019s seiyuu) and he sound really cool! They should really give him more roles in more anime. I think that the kid who liked to kill for fun sounded a little older than he probably should have, but it didn\u2019t bother me that much. Besides that, the opening and ending themes were good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhenever a new character wasn\u2019t being introduced or returning for another appearance, Ryouta was pretty much responsible for holding the show up. He was a very likeable guy who spoke out when he disagreed with something and made good plans and stuck with them. He also had some really great character development. I liked him a lot, he was very relatable and I was rooting for him the whole time. Unfortunately, Himiko was pretty bland most of the time. She never really did anything helpful and just needed to be rescued most of the time. And when she was rescued, she was usually very ungrateful. Of course, all of this was blamed on her androphobia. Now, she has a perfectly good reason for her androphobia but for whatever reason, they liked to pass it off as humor. There would be scenes were Ryouta would ACCIDENTLY see her naked and she would go all Louise from Zero no Tsukaima and Taiga from Toradora! on him! And I would just stare at the screen and go REALLY?!?!? REALLY?!?!?! CAN\u2019T YOU GUYS TAKE THIS A LITTLE SERIOUSLY?!?!?!? NUDITY IS NOT ALWAYS FUNNY AND BESIDES, HIMIKO KNEW IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!!! SO KNOCK IT OFF!! Anyway, besides the kill-loving kid, I also liked the lawyer, the defense force officer, and the doctor. There were other interesting characters too but I won\u2019t talk about them here. But, I will say that they all deserved more screen time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis really was a good show, but it is in desperate need of a second season.",

            "content": "Ever since Battle Royale perfected the psychological narrative of humans being forced to kill other humans, it seems inevtiable that stories similar to it will appear, and while it certainly has its differences, Btooom! suffers from a lack of a second season (as per my knowledge), as the ending comes abruptly leaving viewers wanting a little bit more. \r\nAs a concept, the story is actually very interesting. Rather than just have people being sent to an island at random to kill each other, the entire concept is that the contestants are playing, and actively balancing a game against their will. Confrontations are just about lifeand death, they are more along the lines of strategically figuring out how to defeat different opponents. As long as you turn off your inner critic, you can ignore the subtle plot holes that would ruin the action packed story. What really drives Btooom! is the reason why these particular people were sent to the island. Random people were given a letter in the mail asking if they wanted anyone to disappear. Naturally, there are both those who deserve the punishment, and those who do not. That alone made me curious about every character that was encountered. And of course, you have the typical tension of whether or not the players are going to betray each other or not. Unlike Battle Royale, in Btooom! there is the possibility of teaming up and actually winning. \\n\\n\r\nI did not really notice anything peculiar about the art or the sound, which makes me believe it was good, otherwise I'd complain about it. The character models and the scenery fit, and nothing seems out of place or obscure. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest variable in whether or not you'll enjoy Btooom! stems from its characters. Ryouta Sakamoto, our main protagonist, may have been a douche to his mother, but what we discover is that he really is a nice guy. Not only that, but as the series progresses, he really finds out about himself, and what he did wrong in life. He truly benefits from the whole ordeal. Some of the antagonists are curious subjects as well, but may come off as a bit cliche: \"The hardened criminal who does whatever it takes to win\", \"the traitor who acts nice but is really waiting for the chance to strike\", and of course, \"the demented, insane character who wants to see people die for no reason\". \\n\\n\r\nYet, the biggest offense comes in the form of the female lead, Himiko. While her back story is interesting, her insecurities paint her as a stereotypical girl who cannot fend for herself or think for herself, and often breaks down into tears. From a narrative standpoint, the gig gets old pretty fast. At one point I shouted, \"come on! Just do something, anything!\" to no avail. No doubt this is Ryouta's show, and nobody is going to steal it from him. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I thought it was enjoyable only for the premise. I had read bits and pieces of the manga, and after seeing the end of the anime, I'm curious to see how far along it is. If it ever gets a second season, my opinion of it may improve. Still, if you are looking for something action packed, with a great plot, Btooom! might be a good fit... just don't expect much out of the female lead.",

            "content": "The only thing in BTOOOM! that makes it unique are the bombs. Seriously, it seemed really cool starting it. However, that's not enough to make a story shine on its own, and as the end reached nearer, I had hoped something would turn things around and make it not so predictable and disappointing. I wanted it to surprise me just once!! Unfortunately, that didn't happen.\r\nFirst off, story: 4/10\r\nPretty simple. You read the summary on here, and it's basically just that. They fight to survive in a game that needs them to kill other people. The fanservice was incredibly annoying. I couldn't help but eye rollevery time. There were a lot of flashbacks. They didn't hold back.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is fine, but the ending is pretty unsatisfying. They left you with something you probably already expected to happen. In fact, everything was so predictable here. I feel like the protagonist was a little bit of a gary-stu. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good, but not what I would call spectacular. I mean, Madhouse always does really nice close-ups of characters, and overall I think it was pretty consist. I was neutral towards the character designs. As for backgrounds: there wasn't anything too notable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the opening. I found myself humming it while I tended to my cats. As for background music, I don't think it was too great. I can barely recall any. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was tolerable. This goes for the subs, of course.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nDear lord. It's hard to begin on this. The protagonist is kinda a mess. He starts off as a self-entitled lazy guy  but then when he gets on the island he's extremely selfless. He keeps saying he's not the same person and that he's changed after an experience, but 5 minutes later, he's back to how he was when he first landed on the island. Also, he's way too in shape for some lazy bum that plays video games all day. Seriously, I keep wanting to refer to this guy as a gary-stu. He's just so good for no reason. I could rant all day about this.\\n\\n\r\nThe girl, Himiko, was fine. The one thing that annoyed me was how she kept being seen as a sexual object. There was a lot of mention(and even showing) of rape happening. It was gross and I'll say it a hundred times and then some more. It didn't feel like they were trying to send a message out. It was like an excuse for more fanservice, and that's what makes it so gross. It wouldn't bother me so much if they didn't keep throwing it in your face. I'm sorry if you think that mentioning the rape scene is a spoiler, but I feel like people should be told beforehand because it made me cringe. I don't want anyone to be triggered or anything. This is my biggest issue with this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters were okay. In my opinion, it wasn't that they were totally forgettable, it's that I wanted to forget some of them. I didn't like any of them. Plus, you only saw some once or twice. There was Taira, but they weren't being subtle with throwing him aside. They showed you backstory of characters who you didn't even know or see that many times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI found myself eye-rolling a lot through this, but I did enjoy some things about it. I don't have anything to elaborate on here because that's all I have to say on the enjoyment section.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't give it anything else but a 4. I look at this anime and I think: \"Wow, this was probably created by a bunch of straight guys who have absolutely no lives whatsoever, and then put their desires within this anime.\" Even if that's not the case, it's the feeling I get.\\n\\n\r\nIt just tried too hard to be too many things in so little time, and by the time it reached halfway, I knew deep down it wouldn't get better. I don't like how this anime had so much sexism in it.  \\n\\n\r\n It finished without answering a lot of questions, but those questions probably have answers that are as predictable as everything else. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but if you like bombs, don't care much for story, or anything else, go watch this.",

It's simply the giant cliffhanger ending that stops the anime dead in it's tracks expecting to get a second season which it most likely never will. That being said if the ending wasn't so bad it'd be a 7 maybe as a storyline. \r\nArt: 8\r\nBtooom's art is one of the little really goodthings in the anime. Nothing much to say here beside the fact that boobs bounce in real life not like in the anime where when a certain blonde haired character jumps and bounces and such but her boobs stay like two balloons in a bra. Overall it's good animation quallity.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\\n\r\nSounds from the anime and stuff aren't really memorable beside for the opening which is really energetic just in sync to get you into the vibe of the show before it starts. It's an 8 just because I liked the opening really, lol.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\n(a bit spoilerish here)\\n\r\nCharacters aren't that bad, I mean we have the typical kid that stays playing games all day and meets a hot girl that also plays games all day over a game and they marry in game and such blah blah then they meet on the island blah blah he saves her blah blah hot hot sexy stuff blah blah she has giant tits blah.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nTHE ENDING KILLED ME AND THE FACT THERE WILL NEVER BE A SECOND SEASON EVEN MORE.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMeh, if you can live through the ending without cutting your throat with a rusty knife and you can live though the meh story and the meh characters and enjoy the animatin, art and soud design you'll probably enjoy this anime for a decent ammount more than me. Just be warned, cliffhanger ending.",

The story starts when Btooom! turns into a game played by people kidnapped and forced to play in the real world. The objective is simple, kill or be killed. Each players starts with different sets of bombs and must destroy the other opponents to survive. 22 year old protagonist, Ry\u014dta Sakamoto is one of the top players in the world at Btooom!. However, this isn't just a game anymore, this is real life and these are real people. \r\nThis survival themed anime is easy to appreciate since there are so veryfew survival animes out there. Btooom! is filled with many exciting moments and nonstop action. There aren't a lot of unpredictable twists and everything is pretty straightforward. This isn't an anime where everything ties together at the end. Not a very intelligent anime, but still very enjoyable and should keep you entertained.\\n\\n\r\n7/10",

I love how it was based on a video game and not in an actual video game. It made the story line more riviting with just that one new fact. I also liked that they fought with bombs it was an innovative method of fighting I have never seen in a show unlike Swords and guns which are too overplayed. \r\nI understand the show only had 12 episodes (needs more!) But I thought everything happened too fast and the characters bonds didn'tshow enough growth during a longer period of time. They kinda just suddenly changed an evolved dramatically. I felt like they could have done so much more with the characters, but then again twelve episodes isn't too much time.",

Bit of explicit scenes in their so not preferable to children.

            "content": "I hope they make a season two.\r\nBtooom! Successfully combines a cast of characters and situations that while not necessarily unique or new are exciting when placed together.\r\n30-40 people are \"kidnapped\" and dropped on a deserted island with nothing but the clothes on their back and a fanny pack of bombs. In addition they've had a chip implanted into their hand that allows them to \"sense\" other players and is only removable if they're dead. They are told that the only way off the island is to collect seven additional chips (or basically to kill seven people).\r\nEach person then deals with this in their ownway, forming alliances, going alone, betrayal, traps, hiding, actively hunting, running, etc. They are \"aided\" by airdrops of food, water, and other supplies but these are limited and often lead to major fights. Additionally, they must contend with komodo dragons, starvation, thirst, injury, lack of sleep, and stress.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses we learn that each person was sent here by someone close to them that wanted them gone and that each character has a troubled past of some sort or another. Enough backstory is given to genuinely care about each charter but not bog the greater story line down.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style isn't anything new but is generally nice to look at and works well. Character designs are predictable to some extent, that is personalities match what would generally be expected from different appearances and it's not to difficult to predict what order people will die in. The opening theme songs are kind of angsty but worth multiple listens. I would consider the genre to be mostly action with a little bit of drama/romance. There's a couple of sad moments but they're normally followed by more action so there's no time to dwell on them.\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy enough to follow that it can be a light watch but also has enough moral/ethical/situational dilemmas for greater thought and discussion. I look forward to a second season but could be decently satisfied with this season's ending being the end.\\n",

            "content": "Let's talk about Btooom!\r\nI know, maybe it's not a very good name but fairly well defined since the anime is based on bombs and explosions.\r\nIt is an anime released in 2012, which consists of 1 single season of 12 episodes. It is based on a manga released in 2009 but continues to publish at a rate slow enough (once a month).\r\nWithin the genres we can emphasize action, science fiction and a certain romance to be clarified with the progress of anime.\r\nHISTORY:\r\nBtooom! It is a popular online game based on pumps. Its main objective is to devise strategies with teams and with different types of pumpsto win the game.\\n\r\nSakamoto, our main protagonist, is one of the best players in the world of this game. In turn, it is a boy of 22 who neither study nor work and spends all day in his room playing until one day he wakes up hanging from a parachute on a seemingly deserted island without knowing why.\\n\r\nHere begins the real adventure, because a \"organizaci\u00f3n'' has kidnapped several people and has led to this island, including the main character, and gave them a bag of bombs and a\" radar'' (chip embedded in hand ) each, just as in the game Btooom! ...\\n\r\nThis organization has kidnapped people who have been \"nominadas'' by others who apparently hated them for some reason, so that all people of the island have been bad people with someone or something.\\n\r\nSo if you want to escape from this island they have a total of 8 chips, so you have to kill at least 7 people.\\n\r\nSakamoto will find a wide variety of people, including a girl I used to play online but most of all a lot of people who want to kill to survive.\\n\\n\r\nMAIN CHARACTERS\\n\r\n-Ry\u014dta Sakamoto: Ry\u014dta of 22 years is the main male protagonist of the series. He is an elite player in Btooom! 4 stars (the scale is with a maximum of five stars) who was nominated by his mother, to participate in the game Btooom! In real life.\\n\r\nHe was often seen as being abusive to his mother and stepfather while trying to motivate him to present several works that were getting to him, none of whom he wanted and considered his unnecessary interference. This is because he had set his sights on a job in Tyrannos Japan, a group of game developers who created Btooom!.\\n\r\n-Himiko: The female protagonist of the series. She is in love with Ryota and married him in the game Btooom!. She was nominated by his group of ex-girlfriends because together attended a group meeting with a group of celebrities who ended up raping them, this only Himiko, who was delayed and after arriving and finding out what was happening was saved fled to bring police however her friends not only believed guilty of this misfortune, also they preferred to think it was an accomplice of rapists.\\n\r\nAt the beginning she hated men for the incident with her friends, because after reaching the island the first group that had belonged problems.\\n\r\nWhen she meets Ryota this shows that will protect her while alive. Either way, still maintain some distance between them due to insecurity.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nIn many characters we see a pretty bad design.\\n\r\nIn the case of Himiko, whose facial design is quite simple and a little weird.\\n\r\nIn other characters we find a better design but the fact that the two players have a simple design gives a negative point to the anime.\\n\r\nAnd now comes the most awaited moment ...... THE OPPAIS. Well, Btooom! only gonna get big breasts of the protagonist, which are practically the only ones throughout the anime but not fall short.\\n\r\nBtooom! It has a good animation. We can highlight the great animation of the explosion, which is the basis of virtually anime.\\n\r\nAlso the sound and animation when using the radar is pretty well animated, and all chases through the jungle and old buildings is more than good.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\nIn music I can say that is quite well suited to every moment of the anime, which is usually quite normal in animes of this style.\\n\r\nCharacterized mainly by the action music in times of struggle and ambient music in times of stress.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nAt first I resent the slow development of the anime and naivete of the protagonist, but as was advancing the anime, the plot became more interesting and Sakamoto finally showed his great talent.\\n\r\nFor me, it was a pretty good picture that includes an original idea that is being based on bombs, but has lacked something that would make were glued to the screen. Something more epic moments of tension or would have been quite favorable.",

However, it had enough action in it to hold my attention the whole time, which is a feat by itself (lately I've had the attention span of a goldfish). \r\nThe story was fine, though with the shortness of the series and the many plot points that they had to cover, they ended up not getting to even explore all the possible plot lines they could. It was also very predictable. \r\nThe art was pretty good, but nothing remarkable. It seemed that everyone except the 'gorgeous' heroine was drawn well,ironically. I had many problems with her design, but I can't put my finger on it. \\n\\n\r\nThe explosion sounds and the voiceacting was decent for most of the characters, except for Himiko, again. The songs were amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were almost good. I know that sounds rude, but the thing is that every character had so much potential, but it was somewhat wasted. Each had a backstory and a life, that much was for sure, but the backgrounds weren't very well explored. Even the main character's background was only explored briefly in the last episode. Some of the characters could have been very fleshed out and entertaining, but it never happened. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed most of it overall. \\n\\n\r\nWould I watch it again? \\n\r\nProbably not. It was good enough the first time around, but when you already know what's going to happen and there's that many plot holes and no ending, there isn't any motivation to rewatch it. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it?\\n\r\nIf you like explosions and hot girls pairing up with gamer guys and some light explosion gore, sure. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU DO NOT LIKE UNFINISHED STORIES, GAMING, BLOOD, BOMBS, ETC. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to say that this looks like it was inspired by Sword Art Online though. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, have a nice day everyone! \\n",

            "content": "(Don't worry, this review is spoiler free)\r\nStory 6/10: The story is a good run of the mill survival game. Although now a days, that's not a very creative plot they added their own little spark that other survival anime series don't have. \r\nArt 5/10: Art wise is very interesting. After watching series like Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni and Sword Art Online, the art style is quite different and most certainly stands out. However other than Btooom! is animated in a different way, it doesn't have anything special that stands out about the art.\r\nSound 6/10: I personally think that one of the best things aboutthis series is the soundtrack AND ESPECIALLY DAT OPENING!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10: I think the characters are very boring and over used. The main character is a sterotypical heroine that has no interesting personality. The love interest is annoying claiming that because of her past that every man in the world is awful and lewd. As a matter of fact, I think the characters with the MOST character would be background characters that we rarely see. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10: Personally, I enjoyed watching this series! Until the end. I personally think that the creators we're just too lazy to write a proper ending. Because there is too much potential adventure to happen for it to end. Granted, this would be a perfect ending for the end of season two, then later have a season three. However it's been 4 years. They lost the interest of it's viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10: This series wasn't really my cup of tea. I didn't enjoy it as much as people said I would. But I think anyone who is reading this (Who hasn't seen the series already) should watch Btooom! to learn what a mediocre at best series looks like.\\n\\n",

This review is not too detailed just an idea of the anime.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThe story was quite enjoyable, i will not say it's aything special but was entertaining. It revolves around our main protagonist who has accomplished nothing achieving in life except in the online game world, and our heroine who had a bit of a traumatic experience that left her to resort to online games. This was the life of our main characters until some physcos decided to f**k with people's life with games. Basically, people who were hated or were not wanted byanyone were kidnapped, left on a desserted island to kill out each other with special bombs, and in order to win they have have to collect 7 special items from 7 different persons after killing them...yeah..  i will not go into much details in order to prevent spoiling anything but that's the basic idea.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nArt was well done and captivating, nothing much here to tell, but combined this art and story it produces an excellent anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nHmmm...the sound was good, nothing too fancy, just about average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were very good. There were various characters each with distinguishing personalities and i found them very interesting, the heronine's character had great development and the protagonist was hmmm..the normal helpful, selfless type,more or less. The side characters also brought out this show, they actually have development and contribute to the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nIn my opinion this show was excellent. I had a great tme watching this show, and to be honest I did not believe it was so enjoyable. At first I thought this was going to be a pointless and storyless show but it proved me wrong and the main characters were executed well to bring about this show's enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n",

It was very well executed and it has its own originality to some extent.\nEverything from the story to the soundtrack was very well executed. It very well deserves a Season 2 and the wait will be definitely worth it!\n-Story: If you liked the movie 'Predators' this is a lot similar in the sense that a bunch of people got kidnapped and sent in a tropical scenery and are involved in a survival game. Except they're killing each other and not hunted. It was well thought and made sure to not missdetails. It was also very well executed in the sense that the plot twists weren't something too impossible.\\n\\n\n-Art: A1 Pictures have never failed to amaze me with their art-style. The character designs are very good including the in-game Btooom! avatars.\\n\\n\n-Sound: The soundtrack is very good and very fitting to the atmosphere. It's not too distracting while still keeping the intensity.\\n\\n\n-Character: Anime including MCs being really good at games tend to make the MC really pathetic and annoying. Though this isn't the case with Sakamoto. He has very good intuition, a skilled strategist and knows what he's doing. I'm also a fan of MCs going insane from time to time so this is definitely a plus.\\n\\n\nOverall from the first to the last episode I really enjoyed this series. I'll be looking forward to a Season 2 and I'm sure it will be as good as this.",

            "content": "Btooom!.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIt's underrated, exemplary and stylish. The storyline of this anime is fast-paced, and the lead character is immediately thrown into the death game. It's a combination of SOA and battle royale, although with less action and more grenades. It's really easy to understand and appreciate the story, and you will get hooked after the first few episodes.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe art is by all means not the greatest, but there is some brilliant art work at times. The various environments are well done.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nThe sound is well-done, with a catchy theme song and general interesting soundtrack. It's not the best, but definitely enough to not putyou off.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDuring the anime there is a limited number of characters, mainly because of the fact the majority of it takes place on an isolated island. This leads to you being attracted to some of the main characters, although they're really not that interesting. Character development is generally weak at times and you barely get to know any more about the characters except some rushed explanations when it's necessary to advance the plot. Nevertheless, there is a diverse cast of characters; goodies and baddies who you will loathe and love. There's also a relationship between two characters which slowly blossoms as the story advances.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's fast-paced nature and uncomplicated story means it's so accessible for anyone who likes any anime. There is some pretty interesting scenes with flashing lights, bombs and a range of unorthodox jungle creatures. If you're here for the romance then it's not for you; it's an anime about action, decisions and the bangs of bombs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile it's not the best anime out there, Btooom! deserves a shot. Whether you like psychological, romance or harem anime, this one is worth trying. It's addictive and will keep you interested. And though the ending may be disappointing, the mid-way action more than makes up for it.",

            "content": "Btooom! was a series that had a lot of potential, but in my opinion, did not deliver it as strongly as it could of.\r\nThis review will be to the point as much as possible\r\nStory: The story was very similar to Mirai Nikki's that there is a group of people that have to fight to the death. in Btooom!, each person involved in the \"game\" gets an initial 8 bombs or \"BIMs\" and tries to kill 7 other people in order to leave the game and go back to their normal lives. The story was overall very good, it just didn't explain enough to the \"whydid this happen?\" factor\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was not fantastic for a newer anime because some of the explosions looked pretty bad. Also, on quite a few scenes, the characters' faces looked very awkward and poorly drawn. \\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The first Opening is very good and goes well with the show. The second Opening does not hit me as \"Wow this is really good!\" because most of the scenes in the opening are just from previous episodes. Also, the BGM's were placed in at the wrong times. At least that's what I felt. The music just didn't really match the situation the characters were in. The Ending was also slightly above average.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: For sure the weakest part of the show. I didn't feel sympathetic for ANY of the characters shown nor did I feel they were in the series long enough. My favorite character, Kira had maybe 15 minutes of screen time. A lot of the characters only appeared for 3 minutes and we never see them again.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite being fairly mediocre, I really enjoyed this series. I found it easy to marathon and you never were really bored with any scenes. The action was very good and I was always at the edge of my seat to see what type of BIM was thrown next. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts: Btooom! is overall a good anime with some minor errors in each section, but nonetheless very entertaining. I would recommend this if you like Action shows, explosions, or you want to marathon a quick 12 episode anime. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nFinally, thank you for reading my review on Btooom! and have a great day! ^-^",

            "content": "Have you ever just sat down, watched an anime in one straight-shot and in the end came out feeling like you just watched something amazing? For me, Btooom! was one of those such animes.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story itself was pretty good, mixing in suspense, suspicion, and an array of twists, and good character development, especially between Ryouta and Himiko. As far as I can tell, there haven't been many survival type animes that have come out of the industry, it's definitely something that's rather defining, or more importantly, it is something different than what normally gets put out each season. \r\nArt: 8/10 \r\nThe art style wasrather decent for the show, however I did feel that for a 2012 anime, it was lacking at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the opening and ending, and the various music that plays during the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before, the characters develop quite well. Due to the harsh conditions they all have to go through, nearly every character, both main and supporting go through some sort of development and they end up pretty different from when they are first introduced. What I feel is pretty defining for this anime, is how the characters begin to compare trust to survival and the two themes get put to test a lot during this show, friends become enemies and enemies become friends. Ryouka and Himiko both experience the above, especially when dealing with each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat I disliked the most about this anime, was how much it was overshadowed by Sword Art Online, but pretty much all animes that aired last fall were overshadowed by it. I will say right now, this is no SAO, in fact, this anime is more or less what SAO should have been. It was definitely a good watch and don't be turned off by it simply because it's most closely like SAO.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI bought Far Cry 3 a few days before I started this anime, and I must say, between the combination of the two, it was a very good week. The themes of survival and deception appealed to me a lot at the time, and is probably the most influential aspect that one will take out of watching this particular show.",

This sums up the basic story of BTOOOM!\r\nOur main character Ryouta Sakamoto is one of the best players in the world in the online game \"BTOOOM!\" where you are only allowed to fight with bombs. In real life Ryouta is a NEET who has a damage relationship with his family and has fled into thevirtual world of \"BTOOOM!\" where he is a celebrity and even has a girl friend.\\n\\n\r\nBut his world is turned upside down when he wakes up stuck in a parachute in a tree on a deserted island having lost his memories. This soon turns into a deadly game where you can trust nobody and your best friend is yourself. During the series he meets other people who also has been dropped onto the island along with him in his quest to get of this god forsaken island and figure who is behind this sinister game.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this series is really quite good and it reminded my a bit about the art style from Death Note. The series was produced by studio madhouse which makes sense in that case.\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is really standard from anime in general and the soundtrack isn't really much to write home about. I'd say that the sound is the shows weakest part.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that stood out about this show was the characters who were all really well developed and everyone had at least some change done to their personalities over this 12 episode series. I'd say that the most enjoyable thing about watching \"BTOOOM!\" is seeing the characters changing over time and interacting with each other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this show and I would recommend it to you if you like psychological action series or movies like Battle Royal.",

            "content": "In a industry filled with archetypes and plot formulas, few series of anime have the ability to really stand apart from the rest. Anything amazing seems to have already been done before and the characters start to become simple skin swaps of each other. Btooom! isn't a series that will break too many boundaries of the 'death game' sub genre, but it does a good job of not falling behind.\r\nBtooom! is a story about a highschool gamer who wakes up on an island with a bag of bombs, a day's worth of supplies and a chip ingrained on his hand. This much can be foundfrom the synopsis. The story has a decent beginning, a great middle and a weak end. The action of the series is good, but interactions between characters, as well as back story flashbacks, tend to overshadow the action in terms of quality. The fighting is good, especially in the middle of the series, but near the end, it falls into a pattern: \"impossible escape, fight back, another impossible escape, fight back\". This pattern robbed the action of its suspense.  The ending seemed abrupt and since there not another episode after it to cushion the blow, it only makes it worse. The manga is still going on, so a sequel could help the series recover from this pitfall. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is great. The character designs fit the characters personalities and the animation is good too. Enviroments, while a bit redundant, help bring life to the battle scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is the best I've heard in a while. The voice acting is spot on and the opening is fantastic. The sounds of explosions and other SEs are good too. The one fault I have is the ending. The music does not seem to fit with the series and its slow pace decompresses the adrenaline that the series thrives on. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this series each had the potential to be great, but many of them had their spotlight taken off too soon. Due to the short length of the series, many foes the protagonists face only have about an episode or two of scene time before they disappear until the ending. It was especially sad because the villains are truly frightening. As far as the main cast goes, the protagonist has his on and off moments. One moment he is a level-head young man, the next he's a naive person who seems to have learned nothing from his time in the game. The female protagonist is much more consistent and she isn't only just eye candy. She has a believable personality and easily bucks the stereotypical 'dumb hot blonde'. The side characters are decent enough, with exception of a man named Taira. At first he seems like a well built character, but as the series progress, his presence seemed to only fill up time in the series, especially near the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of the series depends on the viewer. Those who play online shooters and love leveling up in games like CoD will probably find more in this series than just the passive gamers, but the point is that this is an anime for gamers. If you hate FPSs, you probably will have hard time understanding some of the concepts of this anime and that may hinder your enjoyment. The memorable villains and heroine keep this series from falling into the decent bin, but due to the predictable ending, I won't recommend watching it again. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has a decent, albeit rushed story, nice art, great sound and solid characters. Would I watch it again? Probably not, but it wasn't a waste of time. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review so I hope you guys find this helpful\r\nThe story(8):\r\nLets make one thing clear at the start. This isn't an anime like Mirai Nikki were you are put in a virtual world and the main character is crying all over the place. This anime is in the real world and with a main character that is more mature in a view ways. He's name is Ryouta Sakamoto and he is ranked #10 in the world top player of the game Btooom!. That is a game were you need to kill other opponents with as you may have quest bomb's. He isdropped on an island for at that time reasons unknown and finds out that he needs to play Btooom! to survive. Every opponent has a bag with bombs and there are a view different types with each their own advantages. He finds himself in sticky situations and you can see him struggle in those situations. He finds a guy and they start running along together. They stick to getter and one of the strong points in the story is that they all feel like real people. They all don't trust other people but they won't kill each other to except of course some people that are just maniacs and start killing every one.  He later finds a girl with men issues. Her name is Himiko. Everything in the story is progressing very slowly and that is good for the character development in Btooom!. The only problem with Btooom! is the ending. I won't spoiler anything of course but it isn't done and season 2 won't be released because the sales in Japan weren't as great as expected. Nevertheless it is an awesome story were everything falls to place and if you want to know how it continues after the anime you should start reading the manga. Now Let's move on to the next topic.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation (8):\\n\r\nThe first thing you will notice is how   well the characters are drawn. It is not like the anime you know today and that is better. The lighting is done perfectly and when the action comes you won't see anything that will make you lose interest. Of course there are a view parts that could have drawn better like when he was playing Btooom! on he's xbox 720 or something and you could see some points that should have been better but those won't ruin anything. It could be that the game was just to badly developed that the xbox 720 couldn't handle it but yeah who cares. Well let's continue with:\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound (8):\\n\r\nThe opening and ending song of btooom! were great, with the opening standing out more. They let you think you were on that island as well with the sounds and the music in the background went great with the scenes they were in.  There isn't much more I can say about the sound except it is well done so let's continue with:\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (9) :\\n\r\nThe character feel more alive than ever because they seem like real people. Ryouta Sakamoto is an 22 year old dude that likes to play Btooom! all day. He feels like an average student only he has some anger issues with he's family. He is selfish and thinks only how things effect him. He felled like he was the men in Btooom and that's why he played all day. As for Himiko she is an average popular beauty that just isn't having any luck. She has men issues for a reason and you feel sorry for her to the whole story. She was almost raped and it felled like she reacted to that as real as can be. She didn't turn into some kind of whore like in some echi anime's instead she fought to maintain her purity and that is something I like to see in an Anime. For some other character is in the anime there is enough background in Btooom to make you understand them. They pulled that of very well if you consider that this is an 12 episode anime.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nBtooom is an anime I recommend to all of you. The story is great with the ending as a letdown but if you don't mind to read the manga later on you won't regret watching it. The character feel real and the sound and animation both make it better.  I give this anime a 8,5 out of 10.\\n",

I hope it will be of good help because I was in state of mixed emotions upon finishing the series.\r\nAn acquaintance recommended this series to me because I am looking for some action/adventure genre at the moment, yes I was satisfied with it. At the same time, I saw it on the list of \"20 most passionate anime kisses\" here, so I fed my curiosity by downloading the series.\r\nAnyway, at first, I thought it will be of the same genre like Mirai Nikki [Future Diary] Sword Art Online and No Game No Life because ofthe connection of reality/virtual world, I wasn't wrong. In addition to that, I can't stop thinking about The Hunger Games, it was like the anime adaptation of the movie.\\n\\n\r\nWhy just 7? The Story is mediocre, I got excited but I already anticipated what will happen next. The sound is good, nothing special, the art is atleast very good because of it's graphics and such; I somehow enjoyed it because most of the time, I'm totally pissed with the characters. Yes, pissed, very pissed! Probably because I got used to like Female leads with strong will and character. I just don't get how naive and stupid the MC, like where's the logic? Yeah, \"Anime Logic.\" I'm used to 'cut' endings and I like them better actually. Not that much to tell about the romantic connection of the characters because it's very plain.\\n\\n\r\nSooo, to end this, if you want to get excited, pissed, and angry watch this series.",

This is not a traditional anime and does not appeal to anime fandom in any way. That is why I loved the detailed story. What many people fail to realize in \"real life\" including war, there are many people who do not act intelligent and carry out the violence their told too. Someone who is despised and not wanted especially act this way and itis not unbelievable that they would kill each other. Many say there is another way to escape rather than killing each other is a lie and refuse to face reality. That is why we have wars today! If you follow the story (with zero fillers :) I might add) with no expectations then you will be impressed I guarantee it! \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nArt is well done. Womens' face is more round and again does not follow traditional anime drawing. Overall very well done and distinguished.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nExcellent could not spot errors after watching it twice!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is a boy who is a shut in who plays video games (Not much different from otakus) all day. Has no job. Pretty believable to me. If you think there are no people like him you are very wrong. Of course there people who really don't like him including his parents!  That's what leads him too the island! As I stated, good; detailed background with believable characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI re-watched this series so yes it is good. Just not great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nGreat overall and better than most anime. Very detailed anime.

            "content": "I think a number of people who look this anime up, do not expect it much from it. I heard the name mentioned in a few forums and in my recs, so I wanted to check it out. After looking at the synopsis and genre tags, I thought at best this anime would come out as cookie cutter recreation of the past like fifteen shows I saw. Once I actually began to watch it, though, I totally threw out any preconceptions.\r\nThe plot itself seems simple at first, but still original. People trapped on an island and must survive by killing each other. But, they canonly use bombs. Kinda cool, okay. Typical action, right? Well, while I anticipated a relatively one-dimensional story, an intensive, almost Lord of the Flies-esque, scenario takes place. What happens to humans when their only obvious means for escape comes from the deaths of those around them: Survival of the fittest? Jungle Law? Or will they maybe, possibly, perhaps band together and overcome like an encouraging, believe-in-humanity story?\\n\\n\r\nBtooom!delivers its plot realistically, which I think makes up one of the best points of this anime. This  series is not good versus evil or right versus wrong, it's humanity versus itself. No one gets heroized. Ain't no superman fighting fires for justice in this show. It's an intense ride and, although only a few integral themes present themselves and therefore seemed to get rehashed often, just for the story itself, I'd totally recommend this show. And that's kinda rare these days, no?\\n\\n\r\nThe art came out pretty well, nothing special really to say about it. The character styles seemed somewhat original. The background art was great, though, if you care about that. By the way, not as much ecchi as you might think. Actually, in terms of legitimate fan-service, it's pretty much non-existent.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fit the show well. I skipped the opening and ending most of the time, though haha. The in-show tracks, though, sounded good, but not like amazing or masterful. It was good enough to be good enough.\\n\\n\r\nBtooom! made some very good characters with individualized personalities. The writers developed the characters fairly well and they drive the story. If you watch Btooom!, you're watching for the characters and the interactions between them.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, unexpectedly awesome anime. Watch it, it's definitely worth it.",

It is really a mix of both and shares the same type of action/thriller feeling. Not much is said about how the Btooom! game works, however, which is one of the lacking points, in my opinion. One character can say that that's 'how it worked' in the game, but never will the user really see what was indeed the way to play, except for the first 2 minutes of the show. \r\nArt : 8/10\r\nBtooom! really has anamazing scenery, but since it's on a deserted island, you get to see pretty much the same things over and over again. The characters are well drawn and the gore part of the anime is really well done (saying 'decomposed' should ring a bell here). \\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much to say here. The explosions sounds are real, genuine and clearly well thought. The voices of the character all share their own personalities. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much is impressive on this point on Btooom! The characters are plain, going from the classic-huge-cleavage-almost-got-raped-blond-girl to the guy-that-has-a-plan, we don't see much that is very well thought. Needless to say, the character development is pretty much absent. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWith only 12 episodes, it is hard not to enjoy Btooom!. The story goes fast and keeps you on a track for all twelve episodes. It is indeed pretty horrible to end on such an horrible note, however, with many questions left unanswered, which explains my grade on this category. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nBtooom! has it's good points, nobody can deny it. The plot is twisted and some of the images are pretty horrible to watch, so you should be warned. It's easy to go through all twelve episodes in a day or two, so you don't have to plan ahead. Just start it when you feel like spending a nice time with a pretty nice story and some nice thrill, but don't expect much conclusion, because you won't get any!",

Later he gets abducted and sent to an island to fight other people, a pretty decent story line enough to grab your attention.\r\nArt: Looked pretty clean so it's good enough to watch to keep yourself entertained for a bit.\r\nSound: It sounded like what you'd expect/hear from playing an FPS with grenades and that type of stuff so it's good enough to pass.\r\nCharacter: Similar to what you'd find in an average anime, white knight protagonist gets beat down stands back up. Gets a few allies along theway, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This part may seem very biased and is entirely my opinion but the anime was good all the way up to until the end , I couldn't believe it that one episode could ruin the entire anime. Mr. Protagonist is trying to be a good guy and he gets beat down (best example I could think of without spoiling the entire anime.) This made it very hard for me to enjoy the rest of the anime thinking how cliche it was , and it not only happens once but twice  and totally ruined it for me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I recommend watching it ONLY if you're prepared for cliche scenes that are almost cringe worthy and if you're okay with the risk of getting cancer near the end.",

            "content": "This review will have no spoilers in it, however, I will be blunt in saying that the way this show ended, is very much like how Deadman Wonderland ended, which was that it ended with some resolution, but with TONS of questions left unanswered or things that were not ended that should have been ended.   Outside of that issue, the rest of this will be fairly postive.\r\nStory:   Basically think of this as Survivor (the TV show) meets anime.   No seriously, that's what the plot revolves around which is people stranded on an island and they have to survive exceptthis time its a deadly form of survival where people can, and will, die.   The story description in the MAL page here describes it best.   IMO, the story was simple enough to follow yet interesting enough to continue.   Various conflicts would happen and it was enjoyable.   There are some scenes of sexual violence so if rape and implied rape makes you feel unease, then be warned that there are a few scenes early on, but you don't see the full act of it happening per se.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOutside of that, the story is basic and simple but that's not bad when compared to animes with stories so complex that you have to read wikia, the manga, online posts, or just rewatch it many times, just to understand it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:    I swear I had this vibe that the art style for some scenes and some people were like SnK.   The style was fine.  Nothing in particular to say about it.  The people were interesting in looks, some had distinctive features like a large forehead (well it appears that way), braids, tats, mega breasts, etc.    And speaking boobs, the fanservice was surprisingly mild.  Sure the main female has nice DD or E cup breasts, but there was only a few fairly mild ecchi scenes, so the mood was kept fairly serious.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:     Not much to say here.  The music OP and ED were great, BGM was fitting mostly.  Of course the use of Half Life Crowbar-hitting-metal sound was there a few times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:    Weakest part of the show.  There were plenty of characters that COULD  have had more interesting things to them, but it was usually explained through flashbacks and would last for just one episode.    The main two characters were lacking in detail but at least they established how they were loosely connected before you find out later how they truly met.    \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:   I really wanted to like this, I really did.  I found myself enjoying it from the near start, all the way to the end, but then when I saw the last few minutes of it, i realized that they were going to do a Deadman Wonderland move on me and end the show (and series) on a ton of cliffhangers and with many things left unanswered.    With that said, I don't know if I would recommend this to anyone because I would hate for them to watch it and then say \"Wow, all that just for an ending that isn't an ending?\".",

            "content": "Into anime you can (possibly) relate to due to it involving some guy/gal that spends their time playing games 24/7? Maybe even interested in moderate-large amounts of gore? Looks like you're looking at the right anime when it comes to Btooom! as they involve both of these things and many other things you could potentially be interested in.\r\nI originally heard about Btooom! from a friend of mine whilst I was feeling somewhat bored one night, looking for a nice, gore-filled, psychological anime I could really get into and have fun with; Btooom! was the recommendation, as I've stated. I must say, it surpassed my expectationsto some point, but it wasn't exactly perfect yet I can't really say why because... well, spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, let's get down to the brass and review this anime!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nA survival story is something I really enjoy, especially when there are bombs and a load of other people involved. One amazing thing about the story with this anime is that it isn't a simple case of \"let's throw you into this place and see what happens\"... although it actually is... let me rephrase that! The story focuses a lot on Ryouta, the 22-year-old who got thrown into this place and yet it focuses a lot on bonds made with other people and it does surprisingly have a lot of character progression, which is a must in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to write much else about the story, but one little thing about the story which put me off is that I felt it was incredibly similar to the movie, \"Condemned\", turned into anime with a change of characters and with the use of bombs instead of pure survival. However, that's just me being picky, haha!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt may be a very, very weird comparison, but I feel that I enjoyed that art in this as much as I did with Highschool of the Dead in the sense that colours really stood out, meaning colours weren't pale and they didn't look bad. I don't know, it's hard to explain! Anyways, the way the art was done really made things such as the jungle look absolutely beautiful, and the animation was also incredibly well done. I unfortunately can't think about many negatives to the art, considering I'm not much of an artist myself and don't know what's great and what's awful.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI have a certain policy when it comes to watching a new anime, and that is that I must always, always listen to the opening and the ending at least once, even when it changes. It's thanks to this policy that I ended up enjoying the opening and ending to Btooom! and I was able to bask in the glory of such sound.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with this, the voice actors / actresses used in Btooom! were pretty damn cool, as all of them seemed to fit their counterparts pretty well and helped me to feel a little more involved in their world, such examples being Kira Kousuke, a psychotic brat who was actually cool who ended up having a voice actress that sounded pretty psychotic when needed; nice going on really getting the good people to fill out the spots!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is going to have the lowest score for me and I don't like to give low scores, as you can probably tell. The characters were incredibly predictable which ruined all of the fun with absolutely everything. Ryouta was made to be smart from episode 1, and he was way too smart for my liking whereas Himiko was your typical little girl that had to have somebody to depend upon all of the time. Honestly, the characters could have been done much better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the let down that are the typical character personalities, the show was very enjoyable for  me as I certainly found what I wanted in the psychological department along with the gore department. I was really indulged in this anime from start to end and wouldn't mind watching it again if I could be bothered. Shame there's no second season though...\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my own personal opinion, Btooom! was a good piece of work which was very enticing, leaving me wanting more and more with no hope as it's not going to happen. I certainly recommend it if you enjoy gore and a smartass character, especially when he's got some hopeless girl to handle, haha! It's good for the story though as well, so check it out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nForgive me if this is way too long for you, as this is my first review and I wasn't entirely sure how much I should do or about how I truly, truly, TRULY felt about each little section. However, this is most likely what I'd stick with no matter what, unless I decided to go through and write my review whilst I'm watching each episode, changing it after each episode until I had the final piece... which is definitely not happening.\\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoyed, and if you do watch Btooom!, ENJOY IT!",

            "content": "Btooom has been on my watch list for some time and finally got round to watching it. Its a story of a guy  Ryouta who\u2019s a bit of a looser in real life but excellent at the game Btooom. One day he wakes up and finds that he\u2019s been left on an island and is actually stuck in a real life game. Unlike other anime\u2019s where people are stuck in a virtual world, the island is very real as are those who want to kill you. It\u2019s easy to see what\u2019s influenced Btooom with elements of Lost, the Hunger games & lord of theflies all present here.\\n\\n\r\nRyouta must soon learn to use his skills in Btoom to survive. Each player has a chip embedded in their hand which acts as a sonar. In order to get off the island you must collect eight chips. This is the main motivation of characters in the series.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Btoom are its weakest aspect. Ryouta soon meets Himiko a female player who for all purposes is not a very good player and is one of the weakest female characters I\u2019ve seen in some time. She is constantly in danger from being raped, blown up or tortured. The rape theme in particular is quite unwelcome and sets the serious tone for the series and a touch of humour is sadly lacking. The side characters are mostly very unpleasant. They also turn on each other very quickly which didn\u2019t seem very believable given the supposed mixture of people on the island. \\n\\n\r\nOne area where Btooom excels is the action scenes. Because the game uses different types of bombs the battles become a game of tactics and experience. Ryouta is one of the best Btooom players in the world and uses his skill to outwit opponents. Ryouta also appear to be fairly indestructible despite some close calls. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is by Madhouse so as you would expect it\u2019s excellent. The battle scenes are fluid and the character designs are detailed and well drawn. \\n\\n\r\nSound on Btooom is ok but the opening song is average at best but it doesn\u2019t detract from the series or the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nBtooom is an enjoyable action anime with weak characters and a fairly unoriginal plot. Perhaps the biggest issue with the series is that when it ends it feels it\u2019s only half way through the story. A second season does not look likely which leaves you feeling short changed as your only getting half a story. It\u2019s a shame we don\u2019t get more Btooom as it\u2019s a solid action anime and is defiantly worth a watch.\\n",

            "content": "-Overall\r\nBTOOOM! is a dark thriller where people have been sent to an island. The only way off the island is to use the bombs they are provided and a radar to kill 7 other people. Each person was randomly assigned a bomb type, so people don't know what to expect when fighting one another. The story of BTOOOM! is solid, and interesting. The art looks good, and can easily compare to modern day anime (BTOOOM! being from 2012. 2 years can make a big difference in visual quality.) The sound is average. The main characters are awfully bland, but the rest of the cast isinteresting enough. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and it got my heart beating fast. The action is enticing, the romance is decent enough, and I can't wait for a season 2. \\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 8.4\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.15\\n\r\nOverall: 8.11. It's very good. \\n\r\nMore details down below.\\n\\n\r\n-Story\\n\r\nThe Story of BTOOOM! Is well crafted. The premise solid, interesting, and well explained. The plot is very good and not too predictable, which is refreshing for the Action genre. I can't say much without spoiling things, but I enjoyed the story very much.\\n\\n\r\n-Art\\n\r\nThe art is alright, pretty standard. It does look good for a 2012 anime, but it's nothing amazing. The artstyle for the eyes is different than usual, and may annoy some people. I didn't really care, but the eyes might be an issue for some.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nThe voices are pretty good, and the soundtracks fit well, although that's pretty standard.\\n\\n\r\n-Character\\n\r\nThe main character, although he does have an interesting backstory, behaves and acts like a stereotypical male lead: brave, selfless, sympathetic, strong. And the main female lead acts like a stereotypical female lead. She has an interesting backstory, but acts essentially like the \"Damsel in Distress\" which is far too common and uninteresting. However, the supporting characters don't act nearly so archetypal, and I guess the 2 mains are more interesting than other main characters in the action genre *cough* Kirigaya Kazuto *cough*\\n\r\nAnother problem I had with the main character, Sakamoto, is that he seems to have fluctuating intelligence. At times he's clever, crafty, and a master of deceit. At other times, he's dim-witted, unreasonably reckless, and all too trusting. For example, in the first episode, he can't seem to figure out that the bombs he has are timed bombs, despite seeing earlier a timer on the bomb counting down, and the bomb exploding when it reached zero. Other times he's a genius, out-manuevering and predicting his opponents like a boss.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\nThis anime was one of the most thrilling shows I've seen in a while. The action is well-choreographed and the idea of using only bombs as weapons is interesting. My heart was beating hard and fast while I was watching this, and I can't wait for a season 2!",

            "content": "------------------------\r\n| Btoom! : Review |\r\n------------------------\r\nBtoom! is an 12 action anime based on a manga by Junya Inoue and animated by one of my favorite Studios Madhouse. To be honest I really didn't expect much from this when I started watching this and I got what I expected. Would I recommend this to anyone ? Unlikely. Let's find out why \r\n-----------\r\nStory - 3\r\n-----------\r\nStory of Btoom.., is nothing to write home about. The basic premise of the show is a bunch of people are put in a island , given bombs and instructed to kill each other to get off the island. And this itself is flawedbecause..., There's nothing really keeping them there, Just craft a boat and get the fuck out of there maybe ?\\n\r\nAnd as the series goes on , story doesn't really go anywhere and doesn't really have much of an ending. The supposed \"twists\" in the series are plain cheating , they clearly show us that happened and then later they show something completely different happened there ? How's that a twist ? That's plain cheating.\\n\r\nWe can clearly see that this series tries to tackle a lot of mature subjects as it takes on matters such as rape and trauma but it has no idea what to do with those and saying it falls flat trying to tackle those would be an understatement , it absolutely humiliates itself. \\n\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\r\nCharacters- 3\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\\n\r\nNope , nothing to see here.\\n\r\nThe series doesn't manage to create interesting or \"believe\" characters. I highlight believable mainly because none of the characters feel human , even though that's what they are pushing for. Every character is extremely one dimensional having one trait that defines them and that's it.\\n\r\nThe main character of series is neither interesting , likable or compelling. Only positive thing I can say about the main character is that he does receive some positive development towards end of the series. \\n\r\nHow story handles the characters brings down the plausibility even more , as every character is extremely dumb that even the most common thing to do is considered strategy. And have I mentioned how none of them ever gets injured (except one character) ? all the bombs , being blown away , jumping around and even falling from fetal heights.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\r\nSound and Animation- 6\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to keep this section extremely short because there really isn't much to talk about here. Both sound and animations are competent , nothing special and nothing bad. Character designs are admittedly pretty good. Animation is done by Studio Madhouse so no worries there as they always deliver. Soundtrack is nothing notable and the Opening Theme is actually pretty good.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Experience - 4\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThis is an extremely passable but watchable anime. Would I recommend it ? No , there are much better alternatives (Not SAO) , If you want a spectacle of explosions go watch a Micheal Bay movie or Black Lagoon (Black Lagoon preferably).\\n\r\nSo do yourself a favor and just pass on this one. \\n\\n\\n",

The only problem is that the entire show is about rape. The female protagonist is a busty blonde whose backstory is she got a bunch of her friends raped. This is actually all they do to tell us about who she is. Now she's on this island with bombs and radar and needs to kill people to survive. So of course the logical next step is that every man she encounters is doing everything he possibly can to force himself sexually upon her. You know,because she only has tons of bombs and radar to defend herself, so it only makes sense. \\n\\n\r\nSound is standard. Art and animation is slightly above average. Would have been a great show if they only ever stuck to the male protagonist. The writer is so mind numbingly obsessed with trying to rape this girl you'd almost think he was trying to tell you something. Even the high moral male protagonist has his moment.",

The development of the plot itself works, the characters are realistic, sensible ideas, reasonable plans. Even the situations are quite different from each other, despite having bombs in common. The only thing that does not convince me is why these guys are brought to the island. But the real problem with this series is that everything that happens is already seen. We are facing the umpteenth clone of \"Battle Royale\", if not theleast original of its copies, the most similar to it. Another thing that upsets the nose and not a little is that the story is incomplete: in fact in the last five years there has been no follow-up and it can be deduced that the project has been canceled.\\n\r\nReading the plot I was intrigued and given to the mad joy because when there is an anime that stands out the survival I do expect it, putting myself comfortable on the sofa and watching it until the end.\\n\r\n\u00a0Summing up the plot, Ryouta Sakamoto is a twenty-two year old unemployed who spends his days playing a video game, BTOOM, where he is one of the best, does not have a good relationship with his mother and almost always ends up being indecent. One day he wakes up in a tropical island where his skill with bombs is immediately put to the test, just like in the video game. The protagonist will find himself in a hell where he will have to try to survive and unite his playing talent with the real one.\\n\r\nIn conclusion Btoom is an anime that surely has some staff, there are no others like this. Definitely like the lovers of the genre.",

No one is comically evil, no one is fairy tale good. Every character makes their decisions based on their past, their perceptions of the present and an expectation of future outcomes. Like real people do! No one does something just because it is important for the plot to move forward. Furthermore the characters speak in sentences of length befitting the situation, unlike how in some anime people are cripplingly verbose in the middle of a fight and the fight just suddenly lulls to allow this character to speak a whole paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nOn the bad though, due to the shortness of the anime's run, the characters seem, to me at least, a little undeveloped. I think that had they not rushed out to make this and instead waited for the manga to finish then they could have had a longer schedule, thus extending the character building scenes and also (obviously) not had the story suddenly stop in the middle.",

Starting with Btooom!'s intro. It fits the anime perfectly and it hypes you up from the start and every time you hear this opening you'll get excited for each episode. Character wise the show has many interesting characters even though when some feel generic anime cliche characters. The MC isn't one of those OP characters that everyone who is afraid of but he does have a respectful part in the plot ofthe show but at the same time he isn't some pussy who just gets whooped and relies on his girl to do everything. I mean I am all fine for a strong female or females to lead the show I've watched plenty of anime that have those but when the male characters can't do anything for themselves and are like a lost puppy it pisses me off. Btooom!'s MC in our case is the perfect balance where you kinda get worried if he's going to eat it or not. The love interest in this show is done pretty well. She has a huge character progression from the beginning to the end and it's done very well. Plot wise it's okay. It's one of those anime that a game becomes a reality but has a nice twist too it because the main weapon of choice is grenades with different effects to them. The only problem is that they don't really go into the plot of the show. By the end of the last episode I was kinda disappointed not because how it ended but because the realization hit me that I didn't know the reason they were doing any of this. All in all Btoom! was a good anime but wasn't as good as it could've been.",

Just like the online game Btoom he used to play. \r\nIt's a situation were either kill or be killed and the fittest shall survive. It's not every day when you come across a survival anime with this execution. \r\nI have to say I was really drawn to Btoom!'s story thatI watched the whole thing in 6 continuous hours. The idea of choosing people you would wish to disappear and for them to actually disappear only to be taken into this \"game\" was really good! \\n\r\nWe get to learn about the characters backgrounds, some you'll sympathize with and some you'd wish they'd just go and die, your emotions will be completely moved by each development. \\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are great, I was initially worried about the idea of ONLY using bombs, but that thought was soon forgotten seeing how cool is it to use each kind of BIMs for different purposes. \\n\r\nThose fights would be so intense that sometimes you'll be at the edge of your seat watching everything closely waiting to see what shall happen next.\\n\r\nIf there's one thing for sure, gaming experience can save your ass in here lol. \\n\\n\r\nIt is rare when you see a show that only gets better, each episode is better than the last, it brought the game out to be played in real life to be played by real people who got nothing but their survival instinct, luck and a whole lot of Bombs to make it out of the island safe. \\n\r\nThe art wasn't consistent at times but that's about the only little issue in the show, the sound was amazing the two openings are awesome and the voice acting as well.\\n\\n\r\nWell, as you can already tell, I really liked this anime, made me want to go straight and review it, cause it's not everyday you come across an anime that is trying to be something and something different than the other shows you've seen. It just pains my heart to know that this was the worst selling anime for 2012 :/ \\n\r\nIt was not perfect, no, but it gave me a thrilling experience and I was definitely entertained and in the end that's what it matters...\\n\\n\r\nBUT I NEED A SECOND SEASON T_T :'( :'(",

Things get interesting when she signs a document which shereceives about persons who you would want to get rid of she wrote down his name and then he was kidnapped and sent away to island away from civilization other persons who were also unwanted were sent to this island too to participate in a survival game which is much similar to Btooom but the difference is that shit just got real.. \\n\r\nSound~~\\n\r\ni really enjoyed the opening theme it makes me really sight to watch the anime and the ending theme song is also awesome the battle and action scene sounds are also great.\\n\r\ncharacters~~\\n\r\nwill at first i though the protagonist was a douche but then i realize that ryouta is pretty cool he's not scared to rush into action and he always puts his friends first before survival. He made some great friends along the way Taira was his first friend and then Himiko who didn't trust him or any men at first but  after he saved her there was  great character development between them... \\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\noverall i completely enjoyed this anime and i know all of you would if you give it a chance i personal love survival and game animes such as ( Mirai nikki and Sword Art Online) and this anime is a fusion of those two great animes..\\n\\n\r\nLike i said before take a gamble and watch this anime don't be scared its not boring you will definitely enjoy it...\\n\\n",

Although the anime is great if you watch it it does not cover the entire story, however there is a manga version that  is ongoing but slow. So if you do like the anime go look up the manga as soon as you end (the anime leaves of at about chapter 50ish). So like I've said it does not cover the entire story, but you should still watch it. Compared to other anime that have been cancelled halfwaythrough it stands, in my opinion, on top. it does not leave of at the best moment, like any other cancelled anime. But i can say that if you just want to watch the anime and hate reading then it is fulfilling enough. And still a brilliant deep, mature, and thought provoking anime. SO WATCH IT",

            "content": "Btooom is a survival/ suspense style anime focused on male lead Ryota struggling to survive on an island where he and others are forced into a survival game based off an online video game that he is one of the top global players on. The series mixes focus between exploring how Ryota and several others wind up on the island and the players finding themselves trying to survive against one another using their wits and the various bombs they have in their possession to kill off one another. In its focus on the main leads and some of the other players, Btooom does very wellin focusing on the issues faced by them as the series explores the circumstances and personal flaws that led each character on the island and how the survival game affects their psyche, with Ryota, Himiko and Taira's stories getting the best development among the bunch. The dynamics of the survival game are also engaging to see as each of the bombs fulfill specific functions that are reliable depending on the player's present scenario and each player exploits the battle environment, manipulation, their personal experiences and some luck with the real life/ online game to take advantage of any opportunity they can get to cripple or kill off their foe(s), making for genuinely suspenseful moments when Himiko and Ryota deal with rival players. The series also delves into the moral ramifications of the game as Ryota and some other characters deal with the circumstances of their life-and-death game in differing ways with mentalities varying between every person for themselves, breaking down from the lack of contact with trustworthy folk and trying to hold onto whatever morality possible.\\n\\n\r\nPraises aside though, Btooom does have its fair share of issues that keep me from wanting to rate it higher. Some characters on the island don't get much in the way of depth and background, existing either to serve as obstacles in Ryota and Himiko's struggle for survival or to relish in some form of depravity, with one over-the-top case being a 14-year old murderer/ necrophiliac. Also, the means in which the survival game gets pulled off does stretch believability quite a bit with the means the video game company behind the Btooom video game pull off and get away with their acts. The series is also left open-ended as Ryota and Himiko are still on the island and several elements to the series that are hinted to are left unresolved.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Btooom's presentation is a bit on the plain side. Scenery shots of the island and city landscapes coming from flashbacks are nicely drawn with vivid, restrained color and plenty of detail. There is a good amount of diversity in the designs employed for characters to give the series a realistic feel, though they lack the heavy level of detail given to scenery. The animation to the series is okay, though mostly highlighted with any explosions and collateral damage that result from bombs going off and lacking the fluid and smooth frame rate that TV anime like Psycho-Pass and Fate/Zero 2 had from 2012.\\n\\n\r\nWhile having its fair share of issues, Btooom is still a solid entry in the suspense anime genre in its focus on Ryota and Himiko's survival in a real-life version of the online game that they were a regular part of with its original premise and focus on the mental toll that the game pushes on some of the major characters.",

            "content": "Love big explosions and bombs? Yes! Love hot schoolgirls? Hell yeah! Love blood and gore in anime?  Not really, but its alright. Now combine them altogether. The end result you get BTOOOM!! Of course, what people is looking for, is a good story, 'fraid to say that BTOOOM!!'s story doesn't sound that bad at first sight; 22-year old Ryouta Sakamoto finds himself playing his favourite online game...in real life fashion. Anyway, I'll try my best not to include spoilers in this review. This anime is all about survival and action.\r\nHonestly, the whole concept sounds a little Battle Royale-ish, but after watching the entire seriesof 12 episodes, It wasn't that great. It's not that bad either. Let's just say that, the story is somewhat rushed in a way, and also I still can't quite get  Let's start by first talking about the characters. The characters consists of commoners of varying age forced to play a online game recreated in a real life situation. However, 90% of the characters were pretty ugly, to be honest. Not saying that all anime should consists of hot and perfect-looking characters, but still most of the characters in this anime had annoying attitudes and few were made to look so ugly just to be killed.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem? Most of the explosions aren't \"realistic\". You see, in one episode, a man died a horrible death due to a bomb that detonated right below him. And then, in another episode, another person survived the exact same bomb type that detonated close behind him. How the hell did he survive a huge explosion that close? Not only that, he survived with having few minor burns. Totally unrealistic. Probably just a way to keep the \"important\" characters alive throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnother minor problem I have; its about the protagonist. Well, he's pretty alright though, but then, how he can \"predict\" and tell whats going to happen next is so...amazing. Almost like he has some kind of psychic power. It's like most of his plan always goes according to it. It's like he can tell what the enemy is going to do next; its like he can read their minds or something. \\n\\n\r\nThe types of bombs used in the series have unique designs, especially the implosion-type bomb. But few of the bombs were so underused, for example, as far as I can recall, there was only one character that had a certain type of bomb that no other players had. I won't spoil what type of bomb and which character had that type. If they made some really unique bomb designs, why not make use of them? Also, the main concept of the anime is bombs, so there's no other weapons besides them. So, if you like Guns or Swords, you'll probably won't find BTOOOM! that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and graphics? are actually quite stunning. The 3D-effects for some of the bombs looks superb at the very least, and the environment looks nicely polished. Nothing much to complain about the art and graphics. Character art and designs also look great. For example, Himiko's clothing design. The army-camo colored skirt and tie does look awesome. But it still makes me wonder how'd she got hold onto it and why she wearing it before she got sent to the island.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound? The Opening theme, No Pain, no game is over-the-top and I always loved listening to it. The ending theme in my opinion, isn't really my type though. Since music genre is from one's personal view, so I only listened to the ending theme once and never again. Hint - There's a 2nd opening theme saved for the last and in my opinion, it's way better than the first opening.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict? Overall, BTOOOM!! does have its good parts in most of the series, but it's still a little half-baked.In the end, I was rather disappointed after watching the whole anime since BTOOOM!! have A LOT of potential of becoming a great anime, the reason why 'cause I really like Battle Royale-ish shows/anime/movie. But in my opinion, if you do like action-genre or survival of the fittest-type anime, why not just give BTOOOM!! a try? Who knows, you might actually like it more than I do.",

The story is literally booming with ideas. From the unique BIM, to the psychotic people trying to blow you apart at any opportunity.\r\nArt: 7\r\n-For the art Btooom! has everything going for it. The scenery has superb details and the lighting was great (Felt like i was starring at the sun). My only problem is the blood could have had a more life like feeling.\r\nSound: 9.5\r\n-The voice acting is what you'd expect fromthe majority of anime. I love the opening  even though i don't have a clue what there saying except \"Its only just begun\". :]]\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\n-The story has your typically  protagonist that we all hate to relate to (Being a gamer in denial). But being a psychological drama, the show is full of gritty characters with rather interesting and unpredictable personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n-It's rare to come across an anime with so much to entertain the audience with. I read this somewhere but i can't seem to remember where: If you watch an anime and time flies by, then you know its great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\n-It's a nice anime too watch, so give it a try fans of Deadman Wonderland, Gantz and Mirai Nikki you will be at the edge of your seat from start to finish!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is also my first review on this account. So if you wan't to know my original account then give me a comment ^-^.\\n",

Since the game is played using primarily bombs and tactics, lots of explosion audio and art was used. It was all done very well. My problem with it was the characters werent really that lovable. I didnt feel compassionate about them as much as other anime ive seen. Overall the show is very good and an interesting apporach to a first personshooter game perspective.

            "content": "Dominate on Counter Strike or Battlefield? Perfect, now we'll force you to join it for real! Btooom is a twist on the Battle Royale premise where ordinary people, who have been selected as \"unwanted\" by others, are dumped on an abandoned island and forced to play the video game Btooom in real life. What is Btooom? It's a game where people utilize bombs and \"sonar\" pulses to find and destroy each other. Luckily, our protagonist is one of the top Btooom players in the world. Will his \"virtual\" experience help him survive the real version of the game?\r\nFirst and foremost, viewers beware, this series' endingis as compete as that in HSOTD. Imagine watching the original Battle Royale halfway and just stopping; that's pretty much the current conclusion for this series. Second, if you're tired of how mainstream video gaming has become in anime, avoid this as well. Third, if you don't like the protagonist \"magically\" surviving what can only be described as certain death repeatedly I'd pass on this as well. For all of you who this has not yet dissuaded, continue reading.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation quality of the series is mixed. Overall lighting is above average and there is a good range of beautiful island scenery and darker, more tense moments. The drawing clarity and detail could be better at times but it doesn't necessarily stand out as a negative. One thing I did notice was how miraculous it was that the main characters still had clean clothes after days of fighting and blowing each other up. As for character styling, the main heroine has somewhat wide eyes that remind me of Key's old works. It was also convenient how her Btooom game avatar was close to how she looks in real life whereas Ryouta looks like a generic dude.\\n\\n\r\nThere's substantial sexual abuse, violence, and some gore in this show that make it inappropriate for those under 13. The camera does turn away at critical moments, and at one point utilizes an ugly black filter that covers half the screen- talk about laziness... Expect plenty of explosions, blood, and effects.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBtooom utilizes a heavy rock jpop OP, which then strangely changes to a new OP by the same band in the last episode as if to signal a new arc. The ED is a cool down, mellow piece that has a distinctively unpleasant tune for me. The BGM fares better with an interesting mix of brass and some vocal work similar to the fight songs in Persona 4.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is fairly average overall. I think it would have been a bit more realistic if every other person on the island didn't sound like they were already insane.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWhile it's true that there are now pro racing car drivers that were picked for their virtual driving skills, I don't think that carries over so well here. The idea is that the company that created Btooom is abducting \"unwanted\" people to do research for an unspecified purpose, perhaps some form of the battles between players in Zetman. Looking past the not-so-realistic premise, the show plays as a relatively entertaining thriller that's told from the perspective of multiple participants- each one trying to guess the intentions of everyone else.\\n\r\nThe story often uses flashbacks and monologues to give background or explanation, some of which is overused.\\n\\n\r\nPlot-wise, expect a fair variety of plot twists and cliffhangers. After awhile, I stopped being thrilled by the survival aspect of the show and migrated more into a guessing pattern as to how the protagonist would miraculously escape the next impossible situation. There is a huge plot shield on important characters, and it really takes away from the overall experience. As mentioned before, the story does build in tension until the last episode where it just sort of stops. No one rides a roller coaster to the top of the hill and decides \"OK that was a great ride let's move on\". I'm assuming that there will be a follow up but, regardless, this was poor execution.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nOur protagonist, while a god in the virtual world, is just an average NEET in the real world; he's afraid of dying but doesn't want to kill anyone. Sound like anyone? Indeed, also like Kira Yamato, Ryouta is able to summon what amounts to SEED mode when he's pushed to a corner, somehow magically gaining foresight and instant athletic reflexes. There is supposed to be development with the characters as they grow to trust and interact with each other. However, Ryouta is just your typical anti-social dude who (strangely enough) trusts everyone without second thoughts. The story does play a bit with romance as Ryouta and Himiko had previously met in the online world but it was downplayed and ultimately had very little impact on where the story goes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for supporting cast, most of them are all antagonists and vilified to the point that it makes Mirai Nikki look good, which is quite saddening. Due to the huge plot shield and minimal character exposure/weird character behavior I found it quite difficult to connect with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nWhile a fairly entertaining thriller early on, Btooom implodes when it comes to plot progression and character interactions. It fails to sell its premise and serves only to mock gamers. I may modify this if ever a second series appears but in the meantime, it wasn't worth the six hours.",

So in the middle of the story we discoverthat whoever is there is only those who were allowed them to leave the company, thus they will discover themselves, and taking this \"game of death\" as a punishment for what they had done where they lived. .\\n\r\nBecause I liked this anime? Well .. first his story is a lot of good, nothing is repetitive, with a light romance in the middle with enough blood, make it better xD struggles strategy, if you have never seen before, it's really hard to know who will win the fights. . the 'art' it is simply perfect for the anime, put some exaggerated shadows perfectly! Characters were well thought out, as much as their physical as mental of each!\\n\r\nBasically what I have to say about this anime, I hope it helped!",

Considering this, today's anime review would be \"Btooom!\"\r\nPlot and Storyline\r\nAs mentioned in the intro, this anime really reminded me of The Hunger Games. And now you'll hear why. The story is set in a world where currently a very popular game called Batoom! is infecting the life of millions all around the world. One of the world's best players is Ryouta Sakamoto. He is a need without a job that only lives for that game.One day he suddenly wakes up hanging with a parachute from a tree in a jungle. He didn't know where he was or what happened to him, but soon he will find out. While walking on that lonely island a man attacked him with bombs, trying to kill him of curse. That's when he realized. He was trapped on that island by the makers of Btooom! along with others being forced to play the game for real. The rules are the same as in the game. Use only bombs, and each player gets another type of bombs.You have to kill at least seven people and take their crystals if you want to escape the island alive. The thing I found most interesting about this anime is the way the players were selected. I don't want to spoil you that, but I promise that kinda represents the sickness of our society. \\n\r\nThis anime, how I think, is first of all a psychological one. The anime deals with the mind of people like non other. The whole time it was about the thought of killing others just to save your own life. What is more important, a life of someone or your own? A question that forced a lot of people to loose their mind on the island. But we also have the ones that didn't need a second thought and mercilessly killed to survive. The ones responsible for this kinda made of it a TV show but not everybody can watch it. What ever, the real-life-game looks like a psychology experiment done by a crazy scientist where he wants to understand the nature of soul it self. \\n\r\nA cute, little romance is also also a part of this whole story. The fact that surprised me is that they kinda confessed to each other in the end, whats mostly unlikely in an anime to happen.  The\\n\r\nThe show also doesn't lack in action and funny moments. It is an exciting story with no plot holes that only makes you want more and more. The only question that is left open in the end is \"Where is season two?\". Honestly now, this is not the greatest anime I've watched but it definitely deserves another season. Besides, the story is unfinished soo...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nIt is a psychological anime so it implies that you get the chance to \"meet\" each character and learn about their personality. You have a colorful bunch of characteristics from needs, to 14-year-old psychos and rapers. Here for you I have the two mains:\\n\r\nRYOUTA  SAKAMOTO is a typical NEED character without a job in his twenties. As he later realizes he always cared just about his self, making it look like he does things for others. But despite that he knew that it is not human to kill others just to survive. Ryouta experiences a huge character development and becomes a responsible young man that knows what he has to change in his life. \\n\r\nAs one of the few female characters HIMIKO's life on the island becomes real hell. In the beginning of the story Himiko becomes a victim of raping and turns into a man hating girl right after that. In a situation of death or being raped she rather chooses death. That's a thing I admire about her. She later on gains trust in men after meeting Ryouta, but her fear never disappears. A strong female character that maked the story even more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\r\nThe animation of this anime is really good. I liked it. The action scenes and bombs are well done just like all the characters in this anime. The landscapes are also beautiful and mostly bright but also dark where it should be. There is nothing much to talk about animation. I'd give it a 8/10. Nice work! \\n\\n\r\nConclusion                                           \\n\r\n This anime is definitely a show I would recommend you to watch. It is catchy, interesting, and enjoyable to watch. It is rich in action and all that psychological stuff makes you very curious.  What I have to say about this anime is that it honestly looks like a mix of Hunger Games and Sword Art Online, but it is not bad. \\n\r\nIt is rich in background stories but doesn't leave plot holes at all. I loved it, I think you will too, so give it a try.\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "This anime...this anime.\r\nI avoided watching this before because i thought it was just gonna be about throwing grenades at each other.  Boy was I wrong.  It''s closer to Battle Royale than a simple game of who can kill the most people with one grenade (COD4).  I eventually gave in and watched it.  Before I watched it i was not expecting much.  Maybe because it surprised me is why i have given it a high rating but anyway...\r\nBtooom is the name of a game were the only weapons are grenades.  The best player in the 10th best team in theworld is the main protagonist.  Ry\u014dta Sakamoto is a 22 year-old (YEAH!  An anime not about high school kids) who lives with his mom.  After receiving a e-mail(or something like that) from the worlds number 2 player he was taken to an island where he would have to survive with a number of other people but, they also have to kill each other and collect  7 green crystals embedded in their left hands.\\n\\n\r\nThe main story of this anime is fairly good and i would like to say more but that would spoil the entire series.  The anime was produced by Studio Madhouse and it is certainly up to standards set by Sword Art Online for animation.  The characters are not two dimensional and show character progression throughout the anime.  I really, really enjoyed this and at no point was i bored.  Currently there is only one season but there is a manga series with 10 volumes.  There is no dub at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall from me it gets a 9/10",

I couldn't really stand the big black guy with the long black hair, the white guy with glasses, and the women (except Himiko). The fights almost scared me to death and the rest of the characters were crap. BTOOOM is a very, very creative action anime. This anime would make me cringe sometimes because if the characters. I didn't care if this anime was terrible. I would give this a 8/10. \r\nPlease watch the anime...",

I feel like it combines all genres very well. It has action, drama and romance exactly where its needed and at the right timing. \r\nHow people on this irland act is understandable. everyone acts the way they do, because of their backstory and their character. In Btooom! the perspective of many main characters is shown which makes it way more intresting and it explains why the MCs act the way they do.\r\nBut I'm actually thrilled because it's agreat anime that combines action and romace without it seeming fake. And it's so rare to have action anime in which a big part is romance (although action is more prominent). Also the dramatic moments where great. The only negative point would be the missing of tah 2nd season.. :(((\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed it and the reason why my overall score is 8 and not 9 is because i felt like something more was missing for a 9. But all in all it's definetely worth watching! ;)",

            "content": "Btooom! begins with the fairly predictable premise of a death game similar to the ranks of Hunger Games, but with a psychological twist. It attempts to reveal the primitive nature of people when all is at stake, putting their morality and conscience to the test, all the while using the BIMs to add action to the plot. There are many who point out inconsistencies between the characters where flashbacks are concerned, which has a simple explanation: People are different over time and when around others. It examines what are called reverse prejudices, where generally oppressed figures are seen discriminating against the majority. Sakomoto and Himikostruggle with horrible experiences and finally find solace with each other, if that's worth anything. The short span of episodes do make it difficult to grasp the purpose of this game and the motives of the characters, making the ending rather unfulfilling and rushed. Still, all in all, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys genres of psychology and action. Go ahead, have a blast.",

            "content": "The \"fight-to-the-death\" genre isn't a new one, with shows like Mirai Nikki and Deadman Wonderland having\u00a0saturated the anime market in past years. While there's nothing inherently wrong with this genre, it can quickly go downhill if not handled carefully, and in\u00a0BTOOOM!'s case, I'd say that's what happened.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nI wanted to like this; I really did. But it fell flat in my opinion, and here's why.\r\nPLOT\r\nRyota Sakamoto is a NEET, and an avid video game player at that. So much so, that he manages to seize his spot as\u00a0one of the world's top players for the online action battle game, BTOOOM. One day, Ryota\u2019s reclusive\u00a0lifestyle is suddenlyturned upside down when he inexplicably wakes up on an island with others who are trying to kill him. Vowing not to play this real-life version of the game he\u2019s spent so long perfecting, he is determined to stick together with the other players and survive.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe very reason for why Ryota and the other characters were sent to the island in the first place is briefly mentioned a few times, and we do get glimpses of who exactly is pulling the strings for this death match, but it's still not explained very well. They're portrayed as these evil people who joyously clap their hands together like a circus seal while watching the contestants in their twisted game kill each other off. There's not much explanation for why any of this is happening (I only remember them mentioning their motive only once or twice).\u00a0In fact, the whole plot is so rushed that making sense of any of it is difficult. We don't even get any sort of resolution; the end is incredibly abrupt, and considering the buildup until that point, you'd think there'd be\u00a0some\u00a0sort of payoff, but unfortunately we're not that lucky. A cliffhanger like that would have worked\u00a0if they were planning on making a sequel, but since the second season never came to fruition, it's just frustrating and confusing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nYou don\u2019t really see a lot of the other characters until halfway through the anime, despite the flashback scene to the airplane clearly showing around 20 or so of them. When they do show up, they\u2019re killed off before you have a chance to comprehend what\u2019s going on, they just simply disappear, or not much is explained about them so you\u2019re left with these cardboard cutouts of people. In fact, I found myself skipping a few minutes at a time here and there because things were just\u2026 really not going anywhere, honestly. Considering this is a death match, I was expecting a bit more tension and action.\\n\\n\r\nRyota has a bit of a plot armor problem, enough to make Yuno Gasai proud\u00a0. Almost every explosion that happens, he manages to dodge without so much as a scratch. Meanwhile, Taira and Himiko are getting the shit kicked out of them by everything that comes their way, but Ryota\u2019s perfectly fine. Literally, I barely blinked an eye when an explosion occurred\u00a0because I pretty much knew Ryota would survive it anyway. The only time he ever gets severely injured\u00a0is because it's convenient to the plot, and even then he wasn't as hurt as he should have been.\\n\\n\r\nHimiko, too, has issues of her own. She constantly switches between the damsel in distress and the badass female lead depending on what's going on. It's hard to really tack down a main personality trait for her since her character has such drastic mood swings. And honestly, her tragic backstory\u2122 was unnecessary. The studio seemed more preoccupied with finding ways to add shock value to\u00a0BTOOOM! rather than handling such serious issues in an\u00a0intelligent manner. This is evidenced by how afraid she is at first of everyone, including Ryota and Taira, and then magically manages to overcome her trauma within a short period of time because... drum roll...\u00a0she starts to fall in love with Ryota. C'mon, really? While I've never been a victim of sexual assault, I do know that it oftentimes takes\u00a0years,\u00a0to overcome something so terrible. But I guess it doesn't matter with this anime, since it's proved that as long as long as it's convenient to the plot, anything goes.\\n\\n\r\nART + SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe art is better than what I expected, and while it is pretty decent, it\u2019s a bit lackluster. The studio's budget seems to have gone into the backgrounds more so than the actual characters, but oh well. As for sound, I was told the OP was pretty good, and I have to agree! I didn't like it too much at first, so I skipped it; then when I took the time to listen to the whole thing I couldn't stop. It's catchy as hell, that's for sure.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nDisappointed in this one :/",

            "content": "What a Shit Show \r\nHonestly this was something that is pretty interesting the first 3 or 4 episodes but after that you realize that the show has some major faults. \r\nFirs the things i like.\r\n: The Blonde hair chick  ( Himiko) is the only likable character. I honestly love her entire back story and wish the show was about her. I have a couple things i wish they would've done better with her.\r\n: The music for this is pretty good.\r\n: ........ I got nothing. Only that the Blonde hair chick is a nice character and that it has some good music.\r\nThings i don't like( Things that i really don't like i'll go into deeper detail)\\n\\n\r\n: How edgy this show tries to be. Like i swear i almost cut myself from how Edgy this is. \\n\\n\r\n: How stupid these fucking characters are. Like fuck sake. I have not seen characters these dumb in years. \\n\\n\r\nWith the only interesting and likable character being Himiko ( Blonde chick) Her also being the only one with common sense. It gets hard to watch without her on screen.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even know where to pick to explain the idiocy of some characters. Just know that i am kind of convinced a AI was without any shred of humanity and is only told how humans act was given the job to write the script .\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the dumbest things is that a fucking game company is behind all this. The reason as to why is also retarded. Doesn't help that the main bad guy is just a bad character and not in the \" He's a bad guy\" Everything from his design to how he acts is just bad and what you expect out of teenage fanfiction.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC is just so generic. At first you might think there's more too him with his past. But no everything about him is generic. \\n\\n\r\n~~SPOILERS~~ \\n\r\nThe bane of all anime's it seems is the ending. From chapter 9 tell the end is just so stupid. But it really shines at the very end.\\n\\n\r\nBrief description is that they finally have enough chips to leave but decide it's best for both of them to stay. I think it would have been a pretty good ending if the MC sacrificed his chips and sent the chick home. But instead they agree that they should stay on the island tell they kill another 7 people even though the entire show they say they don't want to kill. \\n\r\n~~SPOILERS~~ \\n\\n\r\nTwo finale things\\n\\n\r\n: One we see in one scene that when they were on a plane being dropped off that there was a small little girl in the back round. I wanted her to be part of the show. I imagine that if she was then the story might be more interesting with the two MC's taking care of a little girl instead of some old man. Them trying to shield her from the violence and gore while also keeping the three of them alive. Making a makeshift family. This would have been so much more interesting then what we got.\\n\\n\r\n: I wish we got too just see Himiko as the main character and her trying to live. No companion besides the little girl like i just mentioned.  I would love to see more of her home life and how people are reacting to her disappearing and the group of children who signed her for the survival island thing. \\n\\n\r\nI think that her entire story is wasted on this. I would love to see something similar without it being about a overly dumb survival island and just have her disappear cause of her former group of friends. Throw in the kid i keep mentioning and have it just be her and the kid trying to escape X. Then have a couple episodes about the people reacting too it and whether or not she forgives her former group of friends. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall a story with tons of wasted potential that it ruins it.",

            "content": "Short Review (satire elements)\r\none phrase to describe this anime: \"unexpectedly pleasant\"\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nBtooom! follows the story of ryouta sakamoto who is a world class gamer in the game Btooom! which is a fps game that uses bombs in a TDM (team deathmatch) setup. Sakamoto is your regular NEET doesnt do much besides play this game but everything changes when he gets forced to play the game for real. To be honest the storyline was nothing new we seen it before gamer vs game it was stupid to me tbh they got the most high tech bombs ever but not one single fucking gun? really? objective toleaving the game with your life is to take other people lives and gems that each player starts of with collect 7 and you can leave\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nVery well drawn and a lot of attention to detail within the whole anime, i personally like the opening theme visuals they looked sick. art is great and should be recognized\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound is like watching a movie with the most expensive quality headphones you hear everything from the waves in the ocean to the explosions of bombs to the growling and movement of the komodo dragons. the sound was a highlight in the anime\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6.5/10\\n\r\nThe characters werent really that well told even the main character sakamoto we dont really see a lot of background of him just that he was a NEET, an amazing Btooom! player and had conflict with his family and he was the most told. I feel like a lot of the character background was thrown for the sake of having something there, because if they were just random people on the island no one would give a fuck if they died or not. dont get me wrong i understand its not well paced because its only 12 eps. But one thing this anime does have is character development from the moment they get on the island you see almost everyone start to change over time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nit was unexpectedly pleasant i didnt think i was going to like it but i do\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6.9/10\\n\r\noverall not bad you will probably enjoy it you can watch it all in one  sitting for fucks sake and judge it for yourself. only reason its a 6.9 and not a 7 because the ending is fucking stupid",

            "content": "BTOOOM!, a name you may have heard before, and might have remembered because of how strange of a name it really is. BTOOOM! is an exciting show, to say the least. However, like every other show of it's kind, there will be flaws. These flaws may be based on preference, however most are logical flaws that I will soon point out. Let it also be known that there will be praise involved as well. And so It begins. \r\nStory - 7\r\nBTOOOM! caters to the audience that you would expect most anime watchers to be- nerd like kids to adults who spend most of their dayon the internet, and mainly playing games. You could also say that it attempts to side with viewers whom are NEET, or those who are young and Not in Education, Employment, or Training. I give this show props for not having players sucked into the BTOOOM! game, like the well known Sword Art Online, but rather sent to a real life replica of it, and expected to kill other 'players' in order to go home. The situation of them being sent is a bit realistic, since the US Army has scouted top ranked shooting game players before. However, there is a giant thing I have wrong with this. If you throw 30 gamers onto an island with a bunch of bombs, do you think they would actually run around and kill each other? If they truly are such gamers to a large extent, they will most likely have no physical endurance or strength what-so-ever, nor the will to kill another human being. That is for most, anyway. There are many things I can argue with the story line, but it's at least a little good.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nI was actually very surprised at how nice the art for this series was. It was mainly very fluid and pleasant to look at, especially the semi-realism take. I have to say, their eyes were gorgeous. Actually, all of the character art and animations were lovely. The show handled nature and explosions relatively well, which is definitely good because those are two things we see very often. The bad parts of the art would be when we see people from a distance, as with most anime. However, you can't say that every anime has blob faced people at a distance, because there are some out there that actually put in the time. Despite this, I'm quite happy with the art. The opening and closing arts were nice, even if the ending song's art was just some pretty pictures panning across the screen.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nThis is the one section that is purely based on preference. I just have to say that I love Nano, and she is the one who did the opening for BTOOOM!. The opening does get you hyped for the episode to start, which is what themes are mainly for. The ending song didn't really stand out much to me, so I don't have any comments on it. I watched the sub, and it was good in my opinion. I've never exactly heard a 'bad' japanese dub before, except for Elfen Lied. I'm sure there are more out there, but I probably haven't seen them. None of the background tracks really stood out much, which is why this section has a 7 from me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series were okay at best. Let's look at the two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nRyota Sakamoto - Male protagonist\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto is, how do you put it, kind of weak? You always want your main character to be strong and cool, but this guy took 10 minutes of an episode trying to figure out how a BIM (bomb) works, when he had the most basic type. Not to mention, he's supposedly on the top 10 leaderboard for the game BTOOOM!? I get that the whole situation was a shock, but you would think he would know. His character design reminded me a lot of Light Yagami from Death Note, which puts it out there that his design wasn't exactly very unique. He wasn't completely spineless, and wasn't dumb the whole way through either. He just could have been smarter.\\n\\n\r\nHimiko - Female protagonist \\n\\n\r\nNot the only girl in the show, but every guy seems to think she is, since they all try something nasty with her at some point or another. She didn't get in the way enough for me to hate her, and even though she had serious trust issues with men, she had a right to. Her character design is basic. The only thing that makes her unique is that her eyes are way too far apart. The fact that her and Sakamoto were married in game was a bit.. cringe worthy. It just reminded me of those 10 year olds that get married in Minecraft. I have an issue with how everything about her is very sexual. Like how she has super big boobs and has gotten sexually assaulted way too many times. Her personality isn't bad, just how the story treats her.\\n\\n\r\nThere are characters I love (the psycho kid) and characters I hate (the fat guy), as with every show. These feelings are at extremes, though. Short rant: why do all of the men have to be disgusting pigs in this show? It is just way too obvious that whoever wrote the story for this strongly disliked men in everything they do.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment - 6\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was fun to watch, but there were times where I was questioning everything about it. It made me mad, happy, all of the above. When I finished, I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. The ending was bad, which probably didn't help. Watching any survival show is fun, though, no matter how bullshit it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n\r\nIt was good, but definitely no masterpiece. It had many flaws. This reaction could also be partly because of the fact that it didn't wrap up in a neat little bow like we all would like. I would say to watch it and form your own opinion of it. You may love it, but you may hate it. Maybe the manga is better. I haven't read enough to differentiate the two. If you find yourself okay in dealing with what I've criticized, go ahead and enjoy yourself! \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "As a huge fan of the twisted survival game theme for anime/manga, I thought Btooom! would be the perfect anime for me. In some ways it was, but in other ways it started to let me down. However, there is no doubt that Btooom! was a highly entertaining watch that, even with it's flaws, was ultimately worth the watch.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nLike I said, I'm biased towards this anime's story; I love the plots where humans are pitted against each other in a twisted game that tests their desire to survive as well as their sanity. I feel like this setup, while becoming less and less original,is a great storyline for a horror/psychological anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThere's no doubt that Btooom! is extremely well animated. Each of the character's designs fits their personalities, from the cute child psycho to the relatively ordinary NEET protagonist with a big heart. The only problem I had was sometimes the body-to-face proportions looked a little strange to me, mostly with Himiko. Her head was kind of a weird shape, but that could just be me. Either way, it's nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThere isn't too much to say here. I really loved the OP (up until the last episode, where it was changed), and never really listened to the ED. The voice actors did a good job, and you could start to see in their voices when their mental state began to deteriorate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is where I think Btooom! really excels. I think all of the characters were likable or detestable, as needed, in their own way. My personal favorite would be Kira, who I think had a great background and was extremely disappointed when he didn't get more appearances later on in the anime. Even though he's a deranged sociopath, he still has that intrigue about him that makes you want to know more about him. I think when an anime makes a few of the \"villains\" likeable, they've done an excellent job of crafting their characters.\\n\r\nHimiko was a bit annoying at first; she seemed to exist simply for Ryouta to save. However, her back story (while not original in the least) was believeable and she started to redeem herself towards the very end. Speaking of Ryouta, I think he was a fantastic protagonist -- he wasn't wimpy, but he also wasn't a brutal killing machine. He had a sense of morals, but he wasn't like \"NO I CAN NEVER KILL AT ALL!\" which can be annoying in these kind of stories. Of course, the way he always managed to dodge BIMs simply because he was the main character was aggravating, but that doesn't really have anything to do with his character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nBtooom! is definitely worth watching simply for the enjoyment factor. No, it may not have an incredibly complex plot or huge mindfucks, but if you were to watch this anime after it had finished airing, it would be the kind of anime that you marathon. It's action-packed plot and interesting characters make each episode go by quickly, so even if you don't enjoy it, it should be a quick watch and is at least worth a chance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nBased on my ratings for other factors, I should be giving this anime an 8 or 9. However, I have to give it a 7 simply for the ending. Throughout the second half of Btooom!, the focus shifted slightly to a romantic one. There was still action, but more of the time was spent with Ryouta and Himiko's relationship than badass bomb fighting. The ending was extremely disappointing in the fact that it had more focus on romance and wasn't really any unexpected twists at all; although based on the ending, I think there is high hope for a second season.\\n\r\nOverall, Btooom! is a great watch if you're looking for a survival anime with a world that sucks you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat, even if it is a little predictable at times.\\n",

Ok, now on with the review...\r\nStory: 7/8 of 10\r\nA newish story with some very good execution, but it shows very well how people give up and break so easily given the situation, some coincidences are way to far from normal, meeting a highschool ex-friend whom you nearly killed, and a girlyou only knew online who almost kills you, but it was all-in-all quite refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was different from your typical anime, but it was not a bad thing, the art was very good and clean, with attention to detail in the ruins and jungles, the sound was good, and it was very suitable for the scenes. The opening (no pain, no game) is probably my favorite OP, but the ending does not really suit the theme, being a nice and soft piano song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis had development going for it, because people do snap and go mad easily, or change to trust people quicker. You can't really relate to any of the MC's, as they all did some stupid **** or just messed up so monumentally that I have never seen anything like it. It is nice to see how they start to get closer even during the hell of the game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I recommend this anime for people who have quite a strong heart, as this sometimes will disturb the feint-hearted , but it is full of action and adventure, overall I give this anime a 8/10 for the awesome themes and cool setting.",

            "content": "\"Btoom!\" is one series of the increasingly popular \"survival game\" genre. It comes with a few downsides,  such as extensive fan-service, and sexual content that is only appropriate for 17 and up, in my opinion. There's nothing particularly special about the art or the sound; however, the storytelling was well done. The various battles and predicaments in the survival game are just original enough to get you excited and curious. The main characters, if not terribly deep, are developed enough so that you can sincerely cheer them on as they try their best to survive. My favorite aspect of the series is the processby which candidates of the survival game are chosen. I can't give spoilers, so, if you like battle royale, you'll have to see for yourself and give \"Btoom!\" a try.",

Needs more bombs.'  \r\nAnd so was born Btooom!\r\nStory - Take a bunch of seemingly average people, give them some bombs and let them loose on each other and see what happens. The anecdotes into the human psyche asides, the story of Btooom falls into the pitfall of this sort of show. It can't have much of a story because the story itself cannot be flexible otherwise the premise of survival game doesn't really work. I mean howcan a survival game be played if the players aren't 100% focused on survival? Thankfully I like this sort of story so it wasn't unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nArt - I don't take a huge amount of notice of artwork but Btooom! seems especially poor, considering it's a relatively recent anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Again, not an area I take a massive amount of interest in. I liked the opening song but beyond that the soundtrack didn't stick out at all. Neither good nor bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The shows saving grace, if you like. The characters are not at all who they seem to be at first. It becomes almost difficult to sympathise with some of them. Whilst each character has their own shady past in one way or another there's really obvious character growth issues here and that which hold this section back. These flaws are perhaps less obvious that some others.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Watchable. In the end I finished it out of obligation more than anything. I wouldn't go back and rewatch though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I came close to dropping it. But I didn't. By finishing it I can call it good enough. However I have to give Btooom! the distinction of being one of the worse anime I've finished watching",

It was just missing something and I can't put my finger on it. The psychological aspect of the anime was amazing. It's deep and thought provoking. It shows you how twisted humans can be. This is pretty much the only thing I actually liked about Btooom! \r\nArt/Sound: \r\n8/10\r\nI think the art is very good. The dub and sub voices are actually pretty great if I do say so myself. The opening and ending songs were decent.\r\nCharacters:\r\n2/10\r\nThe characters arewhat made the anime bad. I felt that the main character should've been I don't know, better. The main female character reminded me why I hate female characters in anime's and manga's so much. She was beyond annoying. Not just a little annoying, but beyond. Now. When you have one annoying main character, you're usually supposed to have one that's the OPPOSITE to kind of balance the characters out. You know what? I didn't get that. The main guy character was annoying too. He had his little \"bad-ass\" moments maybe once or twice. The only cool character was the dude with the glasses and he was on screen for like three minutes altogether. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nMy only MAJOR complaint is the characters. If they were better, I would give this anime a higher rating. The characters are what make or break an anime. If the characters aren't good, the anime is most likely not going to be that good.",

You know the survival game set up, you go alone, find a team, dominate the game, face trust issues among your team, disband, re-group, betrayal, ending. That's all I basically have to say.\r\nArt (8): Very clean, and very good character design there are some times where I think peoples faces look weird and look like fish. But other than that it was pretty good. The thing I like the most about the anime was the color pallet very bright colors and I love bright colors.\r\nSound (7): Tobe honest I wasn't paying much attention to the sound I don't even remember what OP or ED sound like, but the jungle sounded like the jungle and the bombs sounds like bombs so  I can't complain.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8): The characters were pretty good, things weren't the way they seemed until you really got the see the backgrounds of all the other characters every character had their own background story and they weren't those background stories where is like cry for me. They were real.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8): I watched this anime with my friend and we are very very into anime so we basically finished it in the same day we watched it I didn't enjoy it in the beginning because to me all survival games are the same, then I started to learn about the characters which is normally my favorite part and the background stories were amazing it connected me to the characters so I found myself caring for them and laughing with them.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall may contain a spoiler)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7): It would have been higher but my friend made this anime sound like the greatest thing. The final episode is what made me really dislike this anime I know that romance is a strong emotional thing that is in most shows and anime but in a survival game, I like to keep it \"Can we just be friends\" I don't like when people seek love in this dangerous situation. In real life would you really be looking for a girlfriend while everyone around you is trying to kill you? But I did my best to judge it fairly and gave it a 7.",

Ryouta looked much better in the anime compared to the manga. the environment was drawn pretty good and there was quite some detail in the buildings. The water was great and the physics were also good. some characters were drawn better than others but not all the characters could be masterpieces. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nsound:\\n\r\ni never really pay attention to sound in anime but judging from my overall experience, i didnt find much fault. the opening song was amazing (its my ringtone lol) and it really suit the anime. explosions were fine but it was no christian bale movie. voice acting was good. i didnt see any major problems with it. 8/10\\n\\n\r\ncharacter:\\n\r\ni think this is what really made this anime what it is. the characters were all unique with different backgrounds. i dont want to spoil anything but trust issues and betrayal added the extra drama in this anime. ryouta's expertise at the online game really brought out his strength though he was apprehensive about killing. his knowledge on the gameplay and various tactics he used made the action scenes seem as if he was in control even if he was losing. sanity was also tested in the characters and some handled it better than others.i really hated the bad guy and i just wanted to punch him in his face (in other words, they did a good job in establishing an antagonist) The characters had interesting backgrounds that really makes you wonder how the creators put such an ensemble on an island but nevertheless, all the characters, relevant or not all played a role in the overall enjoyment of the anime....some more annoying than others.8/10\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment:\\n\r\noverall i really enjoyed this anime. it had me counting down each week for a new ep to come out and after every ep, i wanted more! if ur looking for a quick action anime without a heavy storyline that makes ur head explode, then btooom is a good choice. i really liked all the strategies and the thought process in the battles and the story was great. 9/10\\n\\n\r\noverall:\\n\r\n8/10- neeeeeds a second season!!!! :)",

The show was very short and the plot doesn't really go anywhere thanks to its \"read the manga ending\" but luckily it was very easy to transition to the manga after completing the series. I wouldn'treally recommend it unless you really like the idea of trapped in a game series but if you do plan to watch it don't expect much of any plot, character development or a special ost, just decent animation and fun violence. Also rape. Lots and lots of rape.",

I think -_- and its called btooom\r\n  I've actually watched this anime to point where I wanted to punch both main characters in the face (Ryouta Sakamoto and himiko). but ima let you guys discover why when you watch the anime but its still a well done anime.\r\n  Btoooms storyline is very dramatic and heart filling for Ryouta later discovers he was signed to kill other people in a game to win forcefully without knowing. Same goes for his unknown lover Himiko who undergo a series of events killer people to survive andfinally meeting (find out the rest of the story by watching it). Btoooms story really gives out that crazy vibe that's like school days in a sense if you ever watched that anime but someparts are also tear jerking as I said in my last review and I only write reviews if the anime is good enough to waste my time doing this but it excutes the fact of reality that you just cant live anymore you old bastard ^_^ if you don't know who im talking about. again watch the anime. hahaha this probarably not helping you understand the concept but bottom line the story was set up pretty well and dramatic and im warning kids under 15..... there is a \"close but not quite\" rapes scene ^_^\\n\\n\r\n  The characters of btooom is really well shown for himiko really gives off the pain of losing friends and almost getting raped by a band famous singers and she really shows her pain in a sense that you just want to help her of course and she show it through playing the game of btooom and spending time with Ryouta through the virtual world. that's just an example of a character and if you think that's interesting then there are lot more characters that express their traits pretty straightforward lunatic, rapist, murderer, no life guys, emo people, players, honest men, all the down to the romance that this anime focuses on between Ryouta and Himiko.\\n\\n\r\n  The art is definitely in in this day in modern age where the anime is smooth and clean and very contrast and I love animes that are like that but to speak and score the art I would give it a 10 because the way these characters eyes are colorful enough to give off emotion (like in many animes that are well done) is very good. \\n\\n\r\nI do recommend this anime if you love blood and gore and right smack down messed up crazy shit that happens between the two lovers. \\n\\n\r\notegato gozaimas ^_^",

It looks like a copy of Battle Royale or Greedy Games with elements of videogame but the simple plot is implemented with very strong characters and an excellent development of the script, for sure this is an anime that surprised me and that is worth to watch.\r\nBtooom! Is a 2012 anime based on the action manga of the same name written by Junya Inoue. Produced in the studio Madhouse (Death Note, No Game No Life) and directed by Kotono Watanabe, having 12 episodes of 24 minutes. The anime shows the story of Sakamato Ryouta, one of the best players in thepopular online game Btooom, a First-Person Shooter where only bombs, known as BIMs, are allowed to defeat their enemies. However, on a certain day, he and several other people are transported to a deserted tropical island, equipped with BIMs and the radar of the game, and with this, the participants are informed that they have to kill seven other people, and get the Chips that the person owns, to be able to leave the island. And so begins the survival game.\\n\\n\r\nI quite like works that deal with survival in this style, a survival game where either you kill or die, so my interest in Btooom was natural. And as simple as it is, it's interesting. First that the protagonist is not a teenager, which is very rare, but rather is a NEET of 22 years addicted to games, and on the island have to use his knowledge for this. So, this thing of transporting real-life game knowledge is not usually true, but in this case it is valid, after all, the game is exactly the same as the online game, so his addiction to the game proves useful.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story of the anime itself, it's nothing too complicated or you have to cite too much, it's a survival game, what else do you need to know? Well, in this game he makes partnerships to survive more, but each person needs 7 more chips beyond his own to leave the island. Anyway, we see the protagonist trying to survive this bloodthirsty game. But unfortunately, the anime does not complete anything well, because the end is very open, since it covered only where the manga had gone until then, then ends at the end of an arc, but not at the end of the game itself, which A little disappointed. And no, there's almost no chance of a continuation in anime, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nBut the most important thing here is the fun watching this anime, which is pretty big, at least for those who, like me, really like survival animes. The anime leads well the battles and the deaths are several, besides that the whole climate of survival pleases enough, then, however much the end does not please, the anime generates an entertaining tension during him all, which is very good.\\n\\n\r\nI spoke well of the protagonist before, but now I'm going to talk about him too, because he's practically the only one who is afraid to kill others, with that idea that it's wrong and everything, good, wrong is, but it's killing or Die, and he prefers to run away and almost die to it. This is a light spoiler, but it's good for me to talk about him, since he has this problem for me. But in general he is an intelligent protagonist, and he survives more for intelligence than even protagonism.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the rest of the cast, a girl is the other protagonist, and she is an interesting character, especially for what she has suffered in the past, but again suffers from too much altruism. Beyond it, several survivors are presented, but I do not believe all, and some are interesting, but almost none have a great development to be quoted.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of technical aspects, the animation is high level, we're talking about Madhouse, their animation hardly disappoints. As for the direction, it is a good direction, it does not impress, but it does not leave anything to be desired, and considering that it is the only work to date that this director has worked, that is good. Soundtrack is good but not very striking.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Btooom! Is an excellent survival anime, with a consistent story, with an ending that leaves you wanting to be too open but with great fun.",

            "content": "Forgive me, but this is my first review I've actually written out about an anime; but this one just pissed me off so much that I just felt the need to express my opinion on it. The show tries to damn hard to be edgy, and dark but it fails so much. First I will start off in saying that this show has basically the some of same story elements from SAO, No Game No Life, Konosuba, and Is it Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon. Most(if not all) came after Btooom! but at least they did it right(ok maybe not SAO, butI think it was OK).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:3\\n\r\nHimiko- The Feminist Poster-Child: The girl who thinks all men are out to rape her. I suppose that would make her a pretty good character, if they had actually decided to make her the strong independent woman she started out to be; but that is needless to say, not what we have here. Not spoiling the story(too much) for people who haven't seen the show, but something happened that made all of her friends hate her despite it not being her fault at all. Let's just say it involved rape. After this event they chose to send her into this game. After which, she is almost raped herself, and decides that all men are her enemy in this game. In the end she relies solely upon Sakamoto, completely disregarding what little character she had to begin with. It's like if this shows developers wanted to make an even bitchier version of Asuna from SAO- and she probably can't even cook.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto- Neet Gamer Cliche. He is this shows equivalent of Sora from No Game No Life, or Kirito from SAO(I should stop comparing...). He's that dude who was a shut-in gamer from one world, who is taken to another world where he is suddenly gifted and actually can contribute something to the world. The only thing about this show is how much of a fucking dumbass this guy is. The dude has to be the absolute densest motherfucker I have ever seen in anime. He is also like a hypocritical spiderman/batman. He says he isn't gonna kill, but then he will, then he tries, then he doesn't... it's just really dumb. There really isn't much to say about him, he's just a cliche of the Guy-who-gets-transported-to-another-world genre which I have seen at least 7 different times. \\n\\n\r\nFor the rest of the supporting cast I will just list off my nicknames for them, and once you watch the show you will figure out exactly who they are mearly from the name. We have; Daddy Issues, Everyone's Weird Uncle, The Fonz Wannabe, Basic Bitch, Token Black Guy #1, Token Black Guy #2, Papa Bear, Obvious Bad Guy, and Female Jack Skellington.\\n\\n\r\nStory:4\\n\r\nLike I said, it starts off pretty much like Konosuba(SAO, No Game No Life, ReZero.... is there an actual name for this kind of story?) Where the dude gets taken to another world that turns his life upside down. I would like to say that at least 20% of the story is due to some of the characters own stupidity, but I will let you decide that for yourself. The story really is nothing special, except for one thing- It doesn't have an ending. I watched 12 episodes for some kind of closure, and all I got was cock-blocked and disappointed that I had wasted 3 hours of my day. It was at this point that I decided to write this review. The ending(or lack-thereof) alone is why you have this garbage review to read.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:5\\n\r\nI would say it was somewhere between meh, and OK. It's really nothing special in my opinion. I have certainly seen better, but I have also seen a lot worse.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Same as the Animation, nothing really special about it. I'm not a sound geek, so I'm not really picky.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment: 1\\n\r\nI kept on waiting for something that I hadn't seen before, and I didn't get anything. The story is as cliche as the characters. That being said, the best way i can describe is if Michael Bay had an autistic baby with Reki Kawahara.\\n\r\nThere was absolutely nothing about the show I can say I enjoyed.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Not much to say the series just simply about killing each other with bomb. There is a game called BTOOOM!, its successfully sold in a large amounts and so famous among societies. There is no thing such as age to be an issue here. Whether it's a kid, adolescents, and adults are loving it.\r\n    But wait!, it's not just a simple game about bombing each other in the first place. The dirty business behind all of this revealed when the main character, Ryouta Sakamoto dragged into a deserted island. He realized a pouch of 8 bombs timer type added to his belongingsand a gem planted on his left hand out of the blue. The rules is simple, collect 8 gem and the helicopter will come to pick you up which means you need to stop other hearts from its beating permanently for the sake of collecting the gems, in short, kill people you meet in the island. The truth begins to burst; their real life now depends on their desire and skill to survive.\\n\\n\r\n    The plot is not a freshly-baked in anime industry. Well you must be named few other similar series with the same theme fluently. The main idea itself is not something I'm surprised about, but the progress of its story is well-done. (Still it's unique for its boom). I like how the story slowly turns into a magnificent dark sense, and (somewhat) gore scenes to satisfy my interest. Mostly other series will edit it to reduce the terror of blood such as make it blur with black tint or other methods (I really hate this one), or even cut the scenes so it can progress to the next scene. We can find even slightly, the gore feelings here and that's what the anime maintain I guess.\\n\\n\r\n    That aspect I stated above also related to my enjoyment as a whole in visual aspect. Aside from the gore scenes presented, the effect is good too. Well; for me the character designs feel a bit blowzy (maybe because it's quite seinen so the details are not the matter:) I don't know why but I have a feeling the core of enjoyment are the bombs and everyone's strategy. The bombs are vary (I like it lol) and the tactics aren't just a childish game which is easy to guess.\\n\\n\r\n    The OP song here is absolutely the BTOOOM! series charm, sung by nano \"No Pain, No Game\" is rock n' roll! It seems the last ep, ep 12, is quite special because the OP song is changed still sung by Nano \"Exist\". And The ED song is sadly not supporting enough \"Aozora (\u30a2\u30aa\u30be\u30e9)\" by May'n.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor the enjoyment throughout the show plus the songs, and other aspects related,\\n\r\nI decide to give the series rate 8.\\n\r\nPros;\\n\r\nOP songs & Insert Songs\\n\r\nThe enjoyment\\n\r\nStrategy & those thrilling bombs\\n\\n\r\nCons;\\n\r\nAverage design characters\\n\r\nEach characters aren't too developed",

            "content": "Ok so here comes my review for BTOOOM!\nStory 6/10\nOriginality is obviously lacking lol. It doesn't mean the subject of a Battle Royale-ish story isn't interesting anymore, but sometimes I kinda feel like they are copying some parts of Battle Royale, especially the part with the cheerful guy instructing the rules to the players on the screen. I know you guys will have to agree with me about this.\nSo at some parts the story is really promising. But it is just predictable. In many fighting scenes I was like \"Oh I think he is going to do this and then she is going to do that\"and yeah, like a magic *maybe not* that is exactly how the scene proceeded. Even when it is not predictable, it is not GENIUS, not something you would go \"WOW I CAN\"T BELIEVE THEY CAN THINK UP THAT!\" Many strategies in this anime are totally random, like the writer was suffering writer's block or smt so he decided to invent some ridiculous way for his characters to get out of the situation.\\n\\n\nAnd the FAN SERVICE oh the FAN SERVICE I get that many of the viewers are males but I freaking hate those fan services focusing on Himiko's boobs, soo annoying, take away all the excitement of the shows.\\n\\n\nArt 7/10\\n\nWhat to say when I love how Sakamoto is drawn. It totally fits his character! The drawing of the psycho kid is totally perfect! And we are treated to a few delicious batte scenes with bombs exploding everywhere! But I guess it still lacks a little bit of action to fully say the Art is breathtaking or anything.\\n\\n\nSound 7/10\\n\nI love the OP and actually I decided to watch BTOOOM! based on the OP only, the song is so good, especially when it goes \"The game has only just begun\"! The rest of the soundtrack isn't anything outstanding but they fit the anime.\\n\\n\nCharacter 3/10\\n\nHahahaha.\\n\nThe characters.\\n\\n\nFirst we have the main character Sakamoto, who I really like. BUT it is only because he is sooo bad ass, but only sometimes, and also because I like his design so much. Sometimes he is just plain stupid and overly good, although he is first depicted as an ass-hole who treated his parents so freaking horribly that they completely went insane because of him to the point of trying to commit suicide. He just confuses me too much.\\n\\n\nHimoko. That girl. She almost never does anything useful instead of looking good. She is kinda annoying. And her background story? Haha so ridiculous she is sent to this island because her friends hate her. *SPOILER ALERT SPOILER SPOILERRRRRRR* Because they asked her to set up an appointment to meet this guy who they idolize so much so she did it and came to the appointment a little bit late and found out all her friends got raped and she was about to suffer from the same thing when she took all her bravery to escape and call the police to rescue everyone. YEAH THAT IS TOTALLY A SIN AND HER FRIENDS HATE HER. FOR RESCUING THEM. I can't even.. *SPOILERS ENDDDDDDDDDDDDD*\\n\\n\nThe rest of the cast: They have ABSOLUTELY NO DEPTH. And yeah \\n\\n\n*SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\n I hate it when they depicted Taira-san as an asshole at the end of the anime when he has so much potential to be an ass-kicking sidekick of Sakamoto ._. The fact that he turns into a bad guy is so predictable \\n\nSPOILER ENDSSSSSSSSSSSS*\\n\\n\nThe other people are not given any back-ground story and they lack dimensions in their personalities and they are stupid, really stupid.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\nIt is given a generous score of 6 due to the fact that I highly enjoyed the first 4 or 5 episodes before the anime turns into something really cliche.\\n\\n\nSo overall 6/10. Go watch it if you are a very big fan of this kind of survival game, but in my opinion it is just ok, nothing really special.",

            "content": "BTOOOM! (12 Episodes)\r\nRating: 5/10 (Average)\r\nRecommendation Level: Skip It\r\nWith a promising first episode, BTOOOM seemed to have a lot to offer. Until you realize it's faults.\r\nStory:\r\nRyota, 22 years of age, lives at home with his parents. Doesn't have a job and plays a video game called BTOOOM all day, everyday. He's in the top ten of the best players and a king at the game. Then one day, Ryota awakes on an island, armed with only bombs. As he progresses forward, Ryota soon comes to realize that he's playing BTOOOM, for real.\r\nOh...the plot. BTOOOM has so much promise but it just doesn't execute very well. Alot of the story is bogged down with meandering dialogue and over the top conflicts. The anime tries to take itself to serious and that's where it starts to fall apart. Instead of being a dumb fun anime, it wants to be a drama. Sometimes it works, but more times than not, it fails do to its weak structure of characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nRyota: Douche.\\n\\n\r\nHimiko: Almost useless.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else: The show doesn't care, so I don't care.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Ryota makes the most progress. Without him, BTOOOM would be a lost cause. Ryota makes changes on his life decisions and comes to realize how important his actions are and what life really is about. Himiko, why couldn't she be better?\\n\\n\r\nHimiko is a damsel in distress. Granted, she does do things on her own but Ryota almost has to save her at every turn. Now this just may be me, but when you have an action based anime, I always feel your lead lady characters should be strong in some way. Either cunning, good with weapons, good at fighting, et cetera. When you have a damsel, it becomes really distracting and it bogs down the anime every turn. Ryota always has to carry the majority of the load when it comes to their lives being at stake. At least Ryota and Himiko have some chemistry together. So, that's good.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation can be pretty decent at times. The action scenes are well done and the softer moments aren't awful to look at. Which is disappointing because the action scenes can be very far and in-between and those are the best parts of BTOOOM.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, besides the first opening, is okay. The first opening is the strong point. It really kicks the anime into gear and gives a lot of hope going into the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub, is actually pretty good. Besides Himiko's voice, which when I heard who it was, I knew what I was getting from it, everyone else is pretty solid. It seems they took time to find a good cast to suck more viewers in. I can respect that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf BTOOOM spent more time trying to be stupid, it'd be a lot better. As of now, none of the drama elements really work because of the ending. And not trying to give away too much but the ending is one of those \"There should be a season 2 coming. There isn't? Okay. Go read the manga.\" The final episode really kills the overall appeal of the show when you realize that BTOOOM spent more time trying to create a drama like atmosphere, when there was no confirmation of a second season, and not just go all out ridiculous with its plot. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, some of you may really like the anime's direction. It may lead you to read the manga and see how it ends. For me, I'm not anticipating on reading the manga. The show comes off with good ideas, it just wasn't executed very well.",

If you are still reading you are probably wondering why is it amazing and you should so i will tell you.\r\n(story) The anime is about a guy named Sakamoto Ryouta. He is an unemployed loser that plays a specific video game all day long. That game is called Btooom. He is the best player in japan and he is very well known in the Btooom world. He is famous and he even has a girlfriend in the gamethat he never met in real life. But one day he wakes up in an strange island with a bag of bombs and some food. He can't remember anything and he is worried about what to do and where to go. So he decides to search the island for any survivors. After walking for quite some time he meets another person. Happy to meet someone he rushes towards him and the guy that he met attempts to kill him. After he survived this attack he finds out that some people are trying to recreate the Btooom game in the real world and the only way to leave the island is to kill 7 other people. Will he survive this twisted version of the game? \\n\\n\r\n(Visuals) Visually it is beautiful. The charachters look amazing and the explosions look really nice. The characters are well detailed and the colors are lively and bright.\\n\\n\r\n(Sound) It also sounds great and the opening songs are catchy and nice. The voice actors did a great job in making you feel like they are in danger. But there some voices actors that couldn't represent the character they should really well but it wasn't too noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime and i believe a lot of people would. Since i LOVE survival anime i enjoyed it a lot and i had a wonderful time watching it.  If you have some free time i think you should watch it because you will enjoy it.",

            "content": "You are now in life or death situation how do you cope? Well for me I would crawl up in a ball and cry but that's not what people in this anime do oh now lets fully examine this anime known as Btooom!\r\nStory=7 \r\nGranted I have seen many versions of this plot but that doesn't stop it from having a unique take on it. I love seeing how there are different situations and how the main characters deal with it even though the solution involves blowing shit up. This is a battle royal style anime with Video games being involved (PC Master race all theway). So we have Sakamoto a NEET who likes to play a video game known as 'Btooom' and boy is he good at it, I mean really good. Heck he ranks number 10 in the world. One day he wakes up on an island to discover that his favourite game is to be played in real life. Although everybody thinking that just because he is amazingballs at the game that he can make this through alright. That is particularly correct he doesn't die or anything I mean what do you expect he is the main character after all. But this is also psychological on the player as in real life killing someone is a hard decision to make in real life than it is in a video game. So seeing that being represented in this anime is a plus instead of them just going for the Shounen route and blowing up each others asses (instead it is there body parts and internal organs :) ). Every character has a backstory to make us feel either sympathy or a fill in into why they would be in this terrible situation so don't expect each character to have backstory because with the amount of characters that we see we wouldn't have one for them but that's not a massive issues as I really didn't like most of them anyways. You will get the occasion fan service (as well as rape on the side but nothing too graphical) which to me doesn't take away from the story I would go far as to say that it helps it out nothing high school of the dead style but still we get boobs with a bra holding on to them (not like we haven't seen enough of those already). Which kinda helps sell the idea of how bad Himiko had it. Overall fast paced for 12 episodes but no too quick that you don't miss out on anything. \\n\r\nThe one thing I had bad about it is that is ended on a massive cliff hanger and wanted me too see how our characters continued to progress on wards. \\n\\n\r\nArt=7\\n\r\nBoy did this remind me a lot like the art style in Deathnote oh wait maybe because that guy who did Deathnote also did the art style for Btooom. The contrast in blue and green will not surprise you in why they look similar. The art on the island was up to how anime standards go but I feel like the animation budget went in that than where the characters lived in the city but like we care about the city they live in we want to see the insects and animals and bloody hell a lot of explosions. Aw yes the explosions if you are a muscular man just like myself you will love the explosions but if you want dialect so that the characters do not to kill each other,GET OUT NOW! Back to subject the animation on the explosions look like what explosions would look in the anime world. The design one the characters were generic to the big boobed to a Light Yagami looking mothertrucker (hint look back at beginning to see why)and long angle shots made the trees and plants look more like my sketch book from when I was 7(Hint I wasn't good at drawing) The shading at times was off putting at times but hey I'm crazy so don't bother making sense of it. Animation on the opening was freaking amazing like a child on LSD and went well in partying what we the audience was about to see. Then there is the ending animation which put everything into a calm manner and relaxed us from the epicenes that we had preciously had seen.                          \\n\r\nBRIGHT FUNNY COLOURS FOR THE KIDS!\\n\\n\r\nSound=8 \\n\r\nOpening song 'No Pain No Game' by Nano defiantly suited it ( I love Nano's work) and made me hyped to see the next episode. This is one the openings that I would not skip but instead watch as the song and the opening animation suited each other in a passionately way, like chocolate and Pepsi (weird combination I know) the rest of the soundtrack created a hyped or dramatic atmosphere and there was never a comedy moment to break the tension (if there was I didn't find it funny) and all music was serous apart from the ending song. As preciously mentioned about the ending animation it applies to the ending song as well making calm and peaceful. They then changed the opening song on the last episode and as many people complain about op songs changing I found this to be to my liking and thought it went really well with it as it was produced by the same band (go check out Nano's works they are good). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters=6 \\n\r\nOk before I start writing this I would like to point out that some of the characters DIE or DONT HAVE AN EXCEPTABLE BACKSTORY for me to consider them to be of an importance so if I don't mention them then they haven't really been that important apart from being killed. \\n\r\nRy\u014dta Sakamoto who is a Neet and depends on his parents money to live and lives with them as well. He is as stated previously an amazingballs player of the game Btooom. During intense battles he can change from his normal self to his I'm going to kill you mode but that doesn't get shown a lot of the time. He started out as a dick but as we progress through out the story we see a much more different side to him (not his I'm going to kill you mode but his caring mode). Sakamoto does not ever leave his friends when they are in danger (but he will if they are injured...weird) and cares for trying to leave the island without killing. It is nice to see such a strong willed character to do so. \\n\\n\r\nHimiko who is a highschool student with a tragic backstory about how her friends hated her (hint has nothing to do with getting them raped) and spends most if not all of her time playing Btooom. She then meets Sakamoto online and the get internet married but when they meet in real life its not the why they planned on meeting each other also as a side note she really hates men and I mean REALLY HATES MEN with a passion but if you saw what she had to go through than you could sympathise with her for doing so. But Sakamoto is the only male she trusts on the island and would protect him to the very end they share a strong love for each other (inset twilight joke here you unoriginal person) but don't know that they are meant to be until the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nK\u014dsuke Kira \\n\r\n(No Deathnote reference here) Kira is a 14 year old boy convicted of doing terrible terrible things to not only people but his family as well (although what happened with his dad was acceptable as I thought of his father to be an asshole) he plays this game without thinking about human life making him a dangerous person to be up against. \\n\\n\r\nA few mentionable characters are Kiyoshi Taira who is another member in Sakamoto's group who doesn't really serve much of a purpose in the series but plays a big part in the final episode. Then there is Sakamoto's childhood friend Nobutaka Oda who him and Sakamoto had a disagreement on which led to them both being expelled from school and plays no massive part apart from the battle scene with him and Sakamoto but even then it could have been a totally random character and it would still have the same affect although I suppose the writers were looking for some emotional backstory to give Sakamoto and that's why Nobutaka was introduced. Also not going to lie he is one badass mothertrucker. \\n\\n\r\nthere's not much I can write now the only negative that I can see in this series is of the characters and the cliff hanger at the end although I here the manga is still continuing so if you want to see how the story progresses go read that. I could only stream this as it is not available on DVD in Britain. \\n\\n\r\nNow remember kids don't stay indoors playing video games all day you might end up just being in one yourself. That has been my review and a recommendation for you to watch it because it is good. \\n",

            "content": "Before I go into the specifics I would like to say one thing. All of these are my own beliefs and I do not expect anyone to completely agree with them or agree with them at all. But as a person who have watched almost all genre of anime, and countless number of shows (I do not really feel like adding all to my profile), I believe my opinion may help someone who has trouble deciding \"Btoom!\" is worth their time or not. \r\n*This review is spoiler free.\r\nStory:\r\nFirst lets talk about the story on the surface. It is quite simple. Kill, survive, go home.Sadly, the over arcing story is far to simple to be interesting. However, character's back stories have been done very nicely. The underlying message is much heavier. It talks mainly about evil acts humans are capable of.  When placed in a desperate situation, people are willing to go as far as murdering another human being. There are multiple situations where characters have the choice to kill or flee. Most choose to kill. Of course the show is set in an extreme situation, but the message saying that everyone is capable of evil is prominent and realistic. With a nice mix of these, the story line is enticing due to its complex yet simple nature. \\n\\n\r\n*Show ends off making you want to kill yourself though. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe first episode would make anyone want to punch the main character in the face for being so stupid. But other than that, the character developments were done quite phenomenally. Interesting back stories and significant changes in their personalities throughout the show makes every single character likable in some way. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt just like Steins;gate. It starts off incredibly slow. But once it hits the climax, you will not be able to stop watching the show. It was one of the most addicting shows I have watched in 2013.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it?\\n\r\nI highly recommend it! Even though the ending will make you want to",

            "content": "It's kind of interesting how hard it is to make good survival game anime, there really aren't that many out there that are good. I've made my opinions clear on \"Future Diary\" and \"Juuni Taisen\", and they both show why survival game anime are extremely difficult to make properly. \"Btooom!\" is another such example. \r\nGoing into it, the idea of the anime seems pretty promising. I mean yeah, it's a survival game, nothing too interesting about that, but the whole premise seemed pretty unique. Whereas \"Future Diary\" and \"Juuni Taisen\" have willing and knowledgeable participants, every competitor in \"Btooom!\" has participants that were unwillingly kidnappedand brought onto an island. However, the creativity stops there. Let me just go through a few of the things that made me dislike this anime as whole. \\n\\n\r\nOn a positive note though:\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty damn stunning. Coming from Madhouse, this isn't really a surprise. Watching it, you really feel yourself immersed into this jungle-like island. The animation on the leaves is vivid and gorgeous, the rivers look bright and refreshing, each character has a really clean design, etc. Hell, the animators even took every liberty to make the scales on a lizard realistic. Like the animators took a ton of dedication into making it look good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is damn awesome too. The music during the actions scenes either gives you a feeling of dread, suspense, adrenaline or an odd combination of the three. Not to mention that the opening is fantastic. Not my favorite, but it definitely set the tone the show tried to establish. Key word: Tried.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters:\\n\r\nUsing that I'll segue into my next section, arguably the weakest part of the show was the story and the characters as a whole. Don't let this anime fool you, its beauty is skin deep. \\n\\n\r\nThe story begins by introducing the audience to the protagonist, Ryouta Sakamoto who is a NEET and top Btooom! player, being the best in Japan and #10 in the world. One day, he wakes up to discover that he's on an island, and rapidly figures out something is wrong.\\n\\n\r\nWon't go into any more detail since I think the rest is pretty self explanatory. The story tries to take itself too seriously. It has so much potential to be an interesting and thought-provoking series, but falls flat on the multitudinous problems that you see throughout the run of the show. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, this is a world in which the laws of physics don't apply. If a bomb is thrown at a remotely important character, their plot armor kicks in and they magically make it out alive. When the same bomb is thrown in the exact same way at a character no one cares about, nope, sorry, you're dead. Like honestly, this got to be such a contrived part of the series. The majority of primary protagonists and antagonists find some convoluted and complicated way out of avoiding BIMs, even if realistically there's no possible way that anyone could possibly survive, much less dodge a bomb like that. What makes zero sense is that even if you are lucky enough to avoid a bomb, you will either die or be severely impaired or incapacitated from the g-force of the bomb alone. In wars, the majority of grenade related deaths are either due to shrapnel, or the g-force of the explosion shattering skulls. So many of the characters feel immortal with the way they're able to avoid death without a scratch. \"Thank God there was this rock that appeared out of nowhere to shield me from the blast!\" This series has so much Deus ex Machina, it feels like something out of \"Future Diary\" (sorry not sorry). I'd be willing to forgive all of that if the series concluded properly, but no. The ending is a total cliffhanger, and based on the idea that there likely won't be a second season, this is all we have.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are even worse. I have hated virtually every single character in this anime aside from maybe one or two. Ryouta is such a confusing character, at least in personality. He's a total dick to his parents, but suddenly changes to this virtuous protector on the island. And even his tactfulness varies greatly on the island too. Either he's unbelievably brilliant and cunning, or has no damn clue what he's doing. He's supposedly this amazing player, so how it took him multiple tries to understand how the timer BIMs worked was beyond me. His design, while clean, lacks any sort of creativity. He kinda looks like Light Yagami crossed with a harem protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nHimiko isn't any better. While the concept of having someone go through trauma and attempted rape in the past, and then having to adapt to a survival game environment is really interesting, the writers did almost nothing with it. She's also apparently a pretty good player in Btooom! too. She could have been this amazing contender, but was reduced to another typical damsel in distress. Another thing that bothered me about her character was her distrust of men. No doubt what she went through was horrible, but to make a scathing generalization about ALL men was just ridiculous. I mean she's put in a ton of compromising situations where someone might have their way with her, so I don't blame her on that. What I DO blame her for is that she distrusts Ryouta, but sticks around with him and Taira anyway. Like she doesn't bother to trek out on her own and attempt to live off the land, which would have been a really cool deviation from the norm. She doesn't even try to find another woman either. I also disliked how the writers and designers put in fanservice at really inappropriate moments. A good chunk of the time, whenever we see her body is when she's being assaulted, which was both distasteful and appalling. The other time fanservice was shown was when Ryouta walked in on her bathing in the river; she screams pervert of course, because why not? Even when it isn't Ryouta's fault, like when she walks out of a shower and runs into him, he's still somehow the pervert. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the other characters are pretty bad too. Pretty much because they either fall into the \"this person is a dick\" or \"this person is insane\" tropes, which is to be expected. Like, almost none of them are sane when they get on the island. Kousuke Kira is one such vile character. I don't care how you try to defend him. Saying he's crazy because \"his dad abused him\" is such a lazy excuse for both writing and defense of the character. His dad is a horrible, horrible person don't get me wrong, but when you kill and rape women (in that order btw) THREE times by the time you're fourteen, there's some underlying psychotic mental disorder that abusive parenting can't be solely responsible for. \\n\\n\r\nThe lawyer and doctor characters are also awful people. The lawyer is a sleazy excuse for a human being who represents the Kiras. The doctor manipulates the good(?) nature of Ryouta by healing Taira, only to turn around and unsurprisingly betray him and Himiko by attempting to kill them with remote control BIMs. Not to mention this isn't his first rodeo either, he was on the island before, and betrayed his lover not once, but TWICE in the span of their background. Almost everyone else is a bit character that no one could bother to care about, or as I mentioned previously: insane, a dick, or an insane dick. \\n\\n\r\nThe people back home aren't any better either. Ryouta is sent into the game by his mother of all people. He was terrible son, but going as far to make him disappear? Are you serious? And what about Himiko's friends? In one of Himiko's backstories, we discover that she just barely managed to escape a \"party\" in which three of her friends were raped. What do her friends do to thank her for contacting the police when there was literally nothing else she could do? They all unanimously agree to send her in, despite having literally no reason to. \"Yeah, she didn't want to get raped, and there was nothing she could have done to help us, so she escaped with her life and went to the police.\" What a bitch amirite? This was another point of contention I had for Himiko's character. It's made perfectly clear she doesn't like men, but she had absolutely no trust problems with girls despite the fact that THREE WOMEN were responsible for sending her into the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe only two characters I ended up liking where Taira and Shiki (No, she wasn't actually a shiki, but how cool would that have been?). Taira is pretty much the only character to have a fleshed out background, and is a pretty good-natured, down to earth man. He even totally understands why he was in the game. He's not your typical cocky bastard who has no damn clue why he was sent there. Shiki is also a cool character too, having survived the first game, only to come face-to-face with the man who stabbed her in the back twice. Unfortunately, she doesn't get much time and there isn't much more to her character, which is a shame because she's really interesting and mysterious, and I want to get to know more about her.\\n\\n\r\nThese two, the sound and the attention to detail in the animation are the only reasons this score is a five and not a four. \"Btooom!\" had so much wasted potential, and instead chose to go with a trope-filled plot with detestable characters.",

That should be everything you need to know about this. \r\nBut it says I need to write a needlessly longer review. \r\nThe story was OK. The MC was both a genius, and an idiot. I found it hard to get over the glaring contradiction of that. At times he would have unmatched insight, at other times he was more dense than your average teenager. And no, I'm not talking about romance.\r\nIf the series went on it could have lead to some exciting battles, but the author decided not to show any yet, save one or two.I suppose his idea was to do that much later on and keep the MC a pacifist as long as possible. \\n\\n\r\nIt does touch on some more mature themes and do so alright in terms of realism. \\n\\n\r\nBut again, none of this matters as it has no plans on ever finishing. There is no ending nor resolution.",

            "content": "Story & Writing:\r\nBtoom's writing is nothing short of an offensive joke. It's so shallow, pretentious, and utterly devoid of personality that I do not hesitate to compare it to Sword Art Online , if that gives you an idea. \r\nFirst off, the characters are extremely one-dimensional and horribly developed. Most of them are hackneyed \"villains\" who embody what this show would like to unironically call \"human nature,\" betraying everyone they meet and thinking only about themselves. What's worse is that Btooms takes itself seriously and seems to expect the audience to agree with its laughable message, one akin to what a 12 year old wouldcome up with after listening to one too many Linkin Park songs.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single character who is not the protagonist will always be reduced to either a Saturday cartoon villain or a sex object. This would be somewhat tolerable if only protagonist wasn't such a braindead cookie-cutter self-insert jackass who, due to his \"game experience,\" is the smartest and most formidable player on the island. He never loses a duel and can never die. He is protected by so many layers of plot armor that no conflict that involves him ever feels substantial or interesting, because nothing is ever at stake. Did this extensive description remind you a certain other overpowered protagonist from another anime? Well, that's exactly my point. \\n\\n\r\nBut it does not end there.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot started as a somewhat interesting action thriller but slowly devolved into a parody of itself. First of all, the \"battle of wits\" are made to look very dramatic and intense but in the end they all boil down to wacky deus ex machinas and very basic strategies that are not as clever as Btooom thinks. Secondly, the bare-bones romance subplot between the protagonist and the heroine is purely unneeded and nothing short of cringy. This is when the self-insert undertones really creep to the surface, reducing Btooom's writing to nothing but masturbation fodder for male audiences.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd worst of all, Btoom has a very uninformed and oftentimes sleazy obsession with misogyny and rape culture. It's like the writer learned everything he knew about misandry, androphobia, and rape culture from the first two paragraphs of a fucking wikipedia page. Btoom treats rape as if it's just a fact of life, as if it just happens and victims of rape should just move on, should just forget about any physical, mental, or emotional trauma inflicted on them in the process. Btoom's message is neither sympathetic nor complex. It just uses rape as an easy cop-out plot device to pull edgy backstories out of its own asshole. But then again, I would at least tolerate this offense if Btooom didn't approach the issue so shadily and lecherously.\\n\\n\r\nTo give you an example, a character was nearly raped twice.\\n\r\nYou'd think the show would exhibit some degree of sympathy towards her, right? Show her compassion and maybe put her in more comfortable situations? \\n\r\nNope. Btoom proceeds to sexualize the fuck out of her, frequently showing shots of her in her underwear and actively puts her in very sexually provocative poses. It also does this very scummy thing where it treats her like she's stupid and crazy for being distrustful of men after her traumatic experience. By the end of the show, she is reduced to just a powerless sex object whose only purpose is to get into trouble and be rescued by the oh-so-heroic protagonist. Once again, deja vu? Shit Fart Online vibes? I don't believe in coincidences.\\n\\n\r\ntldr:\\n\r\nBasically, what I've described is the scope of what this dogshit show can do with its writing. Truly a travesty. A completely predictable, shallow, edgy tryhard story with piss poor execution and obscene character writing.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nMadhouse does good work, but sadly that effort is wasted on this pile of dung disguised as a \"story\"\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nMediocre. Nothing memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\n3/10\\n\r\nFuck you Btooom. You're neither deep, thrilling, nor clever. You're just glorified self-insert wank bank material.",
