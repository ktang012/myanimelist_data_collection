            "content": "Generic: such a simple word, yet one that can also encapsulate a great deal of information with its utterance. Simply attach it to the title of a show and it works as a description without any need for further elaboration. Just say \"it's generic\" and a picture is immediately imprinted onto the minds of the audience as to what is to be expected. It's even better saying it out loud, follow after me and let's say it together:\r\n\"Owari no Seraph is generic!\"\r\nNow doesn't that just roll off the tongue with so much ease? Fits like a glove doesn't it? It's like the word itself wastailor-made for this show. And perhaps that word is all that's needed to sum up this series. \\n\\n\r\nThere's really no change when it comes to this ill-conceived hogwash of clich\u00e9s and overused tropes. It's still a poor man's version of better shounen stories, it's still subpar in quality, and it's still an intoxicating pile of throw-away excerpts from better-established premises and ideas. Owari no Seraph is the \"How to make a Basic Shounen for Dummies\" in visual format. If 1st season didn't hammer that point in, then this season surely made sure to get the job done. But I guess there is one noticeable change worth noting, and that's that the show somehow manages to get worse. Through the magic of fujoshi bait, God awful writing and the power of friendship, this anime becomes a firework display of stupidity rarely achieved by many. It pushes forward into the throw-away abyss at breakneck speeds. And in its own way, it succeeds. It has proven that when you really try hard enough, when you really push long enough, and when you really care enough, you can enter even denser shounen bullshit territory. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you \"Generic: the anime.\"\\n\\n\r\nPicking up from where we left off, we follow our protagonist MustProtectMyFamily-kun and the squadron of vampire slayers, as they gear up for an impending all-out battle with the vampires, in what is to be an attempt to regain control of Earth for the sake of humanity's survival. And while all this is going on, in the background, there's an even more sinister plan being conjured up by ImTheObviousBadGuy-sama and his cohorts. \\n\\n\r\nNow the setup for this season isn't all that bad, in fact, it's a traditional one that, if done right, can be quite rewarding to watch unfold. It's the classic clash of ideals, where opposition reaches a breaking point of unreachable compromise. The end all be all fight where the stakes are set on the highest pedestal. A Zero-sum dice roll, where only one side can walk away rewarded. These are the kind of stories that litter literature, cinema and TV on constant rotation, but despite that, can still offer up the same thrills and chair-gripping engagement expected from the best of them. But even when considering the long shelf-life that these kinds of stories offer, if it's poorly written, no amount of the garnishing and repacking can be done to salvage it. And to no one's surprise, Owari no Seraph isn't going to be a show that defies that unspoken rule. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, the problem with Seraph isn't the premise or idea, but rather the piss poor execution of it. The show just doesn't seem to have the proper comprehension of what is needed for it to make this kind of story work. Its ineptitude runs deep into the core foundation of the show, from the garish narrative decisions to the downright terrible plot conveniences tossed in to bail itself out of a tight squeeze. Every turn and corner lead into another questionable writing decision that really exposes the lack of foresight on the part of the creator, and improper planning on the part of the scriptwriters. Throughout the show's run-time, this leads to numerous situations where our characters come face to face with death, only to have a last-minute dues ex machina tossed in to fish them out of troubled water. And this doesn't just happen a few times, it happens in an endless cycle, most notably with our main protagonist MustProtectMyFamily-kun, who inexplicably survives more shit than even what's possible with the aid of basic plot armor. It's like he himself becomes the embodiment plot armor, to the point where his existence is met with guaranteed immunity, regardless of consequence. This creates some of the most uninspired character struggle imaginable. There is zero tension to a story that goes out of its way to perform back flips around its lead. \\n\\n\r\nBut this isn't only limited to him, almost everyone that's given a name and a back-story is automatically in the safe-zone, even if they're stabbed through vital organs. I can't properly explain this without taking a special mention of the show's ending. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, just pay attention to the numerous times where our main characters not only live through death marker injuries but also walk it off like it wasn't that big of a deal, it's quite laughable. The only ones 'biting the bullet' are characters that are clearly introduced for the sake of dying a few episodes later. The moment they're introduced, a death flag is planted smack dab on their forehead. It's an old trick that wasn't good in other stories and isn't good here either. \\n\\n\r\nBut Owari no Seraph S2 isn't all bad, if anything, there was a noticeable improvement in its art and animation. The fights carry more weight behind it (non-figuratively speaking), the character models remained far more consistent from frame to frame, and the issue regarding the flat backgrounds are better worked around. It's a more palatable experience overall, and that, at the very least, deserves some credit. Also, the color choices seemed better implemented. For example, the reds (burgundy to be more specific) and greens were far more eye-catching than the often acid washed look of the 1st season. It wasn't that big of a change but it was enough to be noticed on a panel to panel comparison. \\n\r\nAs far as the soundtrack goes, most of the content from season one finds itself worked back into this season. If you liked S1's music score then S2 should suffice. However, the opening wasn't as instantaneous as the first. It feels more commonplace in comparison to the harmonious balance found between the vocals and instruments of the 1st season's musical number. Not a bad opening per se, just not as catchy as bellowing out \"I'LL BE THERE, HOLD ON, THEY'LL CHANGE US SOMEHOW, SO WHERE ARE YOU NOWWW?\", but it still gets the job done in its own way. Not singing in the shower level, but hey, music is subjective, so that depends entirely on the listener.\\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph's 2nd season does improve a few aspects that 1st season was lacking but it also implemented things that were far worse as well. It took one step forward only to take two steps back. It's not the most aggravating title to watch but at the same time, it doesn't have a reason to exist (outside of Wit Studio milking a fanbase it helped establish). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the more noticeable issues this season had in comparison to the 1st, I still can't bring myself to hate this franchise. It's really just a soulless product that comes and goes without registering any sort of response from me. The fights were better put-together but the narrative was more stupid. The animation was more eye-catching but the content being animated was dumb. In a way, it just balanced itself out. A series that's forever just \"ok\" in my head.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph is a show that's either passable or outright rejected betting on one factor, and that's personal experience. Like I've stated in my season one review, this anime serves as a gateway title to help you get a little insight into the medium's norm and season two only furthers that trend. But where the line is drawn is that factor, that personal experience. If you've been an active follower of anime for an extended period of time, you've undoubtedly seen numerous of titles that play out in the exact same order to what Owari offers. And from that vast selection, you've probably seen it play out far better as well. So with that in mind, this anime isn't made for long time anime viewers, it's made for the bright-eyed newcomers who haven't consumed enough of these fast food titles to grow sick of them yet. Owari no Seraph can serve as a title to get others into the medium, but as far as those already steadfast in it, I cannot in good conscience recommend this John Smith: serial number 28927.",

Do not watch this if you only plan to watch a few at a time.\r\nThis anime requires a binge session to finish it as it can get tedious, but it is (kinda) worth it.\r\nStory: 5\r\nArt: 7\r\nSound: 7\r\nCharacters: 2 \r\nEnjoyment: 5\r\nI have now finished this anime and as such my review has changed, slightly.\r\nI will leave my old review up as I still agree with it as i wrote it, 9 episodes in. Go to the bottom for full season review.\r\nUp toepisode 9:\\n\\n\r\n[Such a waste of an intriguing plot idea and character (Mika)\\n\\n\r\nThe first season was not the best, I will admit. Yet I felt that the story had promise and Mika was way underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season is everything that is wrong with the first on steroids, all beefed up and loud. One dimensional characters that are just the tropes of typical animes. No character development or really plot progression.\\n\\n\r\nAll that happens could be summed up in a fraction of the time if there were not purely random and unexplained scenes mixed with boring drawn out flashbacks. The only thing that kept me watching was the story, and I found out that it is really not all that complex after reading a summery. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are stuck in a time paradox. One where any actual character development is stuck and all that they can do is spout the same exact lines over and over. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are good. Yet, as hard as you try to dress up a pile of trash to make it look fabulous, it's still garbage. \\n\\n\r\nOnly watch if you need anything to watch and have no better options to binge. \\n\\n\r\nIf the story is grabbing you then look it up online]\\n\\n\\n\r\nFull season:\\n\\n\r\nOn a whim I decided to finish this anime late one night, and I am glad I did. Kinda. It is still not the best anime by any shot but I can kinda see it going somewhere next season, so I hold out hope there. \\n\\n\r\nThe main issue with it is that it is trying to be the next big hit anime *cough (Attack On Titan) cough*, but FAILS hard. It has a great story, I knew this from the start; this was why I even continued to watch it and why I finished it. Too bad the characters and writers let the story down. \\n\\n\r\nThere are simply too many mysteries in the story and more keep coming the longer you watch. With no answers to solve the past questions you just end up lost in what is going on always. Characters motivations are there, but we have not got any idea what they are. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the shows biggest failing, the writers are writing in too many character traits without fleshing out the others added before. This leaves you with a confusing mess of a \"family\" of characters whose motivations are one dimensional and come off as just lame. \\n\\n\r\nRead the manga if you have the itch for answers that I have after finishing. Maybe it is the better read, or at least it is more complete at this point.",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph is back. Initially, I was disappointed with the first season. With heavy amounts of exposition and lack of charisma for quite a bit of episodes, my expectations going into the sequel wasn\u2019t high. However, season 2 turned out to be pleasantly different. No, I wasn\u2019t expecting this to be a significant improvement but it does set its foot a bit further than mediocrity.\r\nBranded as a sequel, it\u2019s absolutely imperative to be familiar with the first season to get the full experience. As the title implies, the majority of the second season takes place in Nagoya, a city on the surface that isalso home to noble vampires. Originally, it was actually home to humans until the Apocalypse. What is the Apocalypse? For a brief recap, it\u2019s pretty much when a lethal epidemic wiped out a major part of humanity years before the start of the show. From this event, vampires became the rulers and treats human like livestock while also keeping some human children alive for their own purpose. One of these children named Yuichiro Hyakuya managed to escape and was taken in by the Japanese Imperial Demon Army, a group of resistance who plans to liberate themselves from the vampires\u2019 rule. Flash forward to present day and we got a resistance group fighting not for pride or liberty. But for survival.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the manga, the second season is actually quite faithful or at least captures the magic of the story especially in the first 10 episodes. The first season had a ridiculous amount of info dump and exposition, so much with the buildup and to the point that it became distracting. Luckily, this sequel is more about the action and the execution. A few concepts in this season deals with how humans desperately fight for survival in the face of unimaginable circumstances, the higher-ups of the Japanese Imperial Army taking a keen interest in Yu, and Yu\u2019s own personal goal to make Mika into a normal human again after realizing that he has turned into a vampire; the very thing he loathes. A lot of the episodes also deals with interpersonal problems and how certain characters such as Shinoa bears responsibility for herself and others. In the face of danger, characters make decisions that gambles on life and death. Some even defy orders for their own personal reasons. \\n\\n\r\nAs such, expect the sequel to bulk emotional drama as well. The latter half of the show will easily get the viewers to recognize how dangerous the vampire Nobles can be. Death is reality and the humans realizes that whole earthly. While there is a lot of battle on the frontlines, the show also seems to enforce human drama. The most prominent would be the relationship between Yu and Mika. The latter is no longer human while Yu tries to restore him back to normal. Their conversation unites them with both delightful and painful memories of the past. Just do note that there\u2019s a bit of feeling of subtle BL that fans likes to play their minds with in one of these episodes. While the show isn\u2019t actually a BL, it\u2019s easy to fantasize after seeing the deep chemistry between Yu and Mika. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters in the series also makes an impact of various degrees. Shinoa\u2019s character is much more serious as she has a lot of burden on her shoulders. Meanwhile, Guren shows what his comrades means to him when faced against unprecedented odds on the frontlines. What\u2019s much more interesting though is the presence of the Hiragi family. Kureto, the heir of the family\u2019s current heir, is a character that is a bit different from his comrades. With a cold personality and strong emphasis to accomplish any task at whatever the cost, he also often demands respects from others. To me, he is like the anti-thesis of the main characters. Although he is fighting for the good of mankind, his ways of doing so often puts odds against his own comrades. One could even speculate that he is a manipulative individual as he assigns Guren\u2019s group into near impossible missions. Speaking of family, it still remains a main theme throughout the second season. Besides Yu and Mika, the Moon Demon Company still has a prominent presence. Yu treats it like his own family and often seeks to protect them. Even if this takes toll on his own body and spirit, Yu is selfless in nature. Obviously, this also translates into his desire to turn Mika back to what he was before \u2013 a human. The way the sequel is directed improves as each episode adds more and more to the main themes and concepts. Even the storytelling gets more interesting with the developments despite some pacing issues and omitting some parts of the manga. On the negative side, the antagonists of the show still remains dense and stereotypical. Characters like Crowley hardly gets any characterization while most of the fights against the strongest vampires lacks excitement. (most of them are more like one sided fights). Furthermore, Kuel continuously hides secrets from others and we don\u2019t get the chance to know her true purpose. I suppose Mika is more like an anti-hero in this season although his actions are questionable with his vampire nature. But in retrospect, the antagonists aren\u2019t appealing either in character or role.\\n\\n\r\nWit Studio adapts the sequel although the artwork hardly improved. The character designs still looks essentially the same as they did for the previous season although I like the way the Hiiragi family members are designed. Kureto in particular expresses a ruthless nature that is decorated quite well. In addition, most of the demons has a credible design to induce fear. We also get the introduction of some new noble family members, antagonists that looks even more menacing than before. The battles they participates in are some of the main highlights of the sequel as camera angles and action scenes features them quite well. Match that with the stereo soundtrack and we got quite a season. The OP and ED theme songs also conveys what the show is capable of that gives off more of its atmospheric setting \u2013 a battlefield with nothing but potential for destruction and chaos. \\n\\n\r\nAfter taking a breath in and out, I think this second season is an improvement of the previous. It capitalized the main story\u2019s purpose while delivering memorable fights and expressing a variety of emotions. While the technical features still generally remained the same, the show is easily watchable for those looking into some stylistic action. I can\u2019t say for sure that the sequel will be a pleasurable experience for everyone though. It still omits manga material at some parts and can seem a bit too serious for its own good. One particular episode with Yu and Mika in the second half of the show can be uncomfortable to watch for some people. And also, I feel like they stuffed a lot into the finale, perhaps too much and leaves too open. But for all its downsides, the battle in Nagoya will be one to remember.\\n",

            "content": "* Hi there! This is my first review, so bear with me if it's badly written or judged. Constructive feedback is welcomed. *\r\nDid you enjoy Seraph of the End (Owari no Seraph) Season 1? Then you'll probably enjoy this sequel. Personally, I don't like Seraph of the End as a whole, but the show has a few merits that keep it from being unbearable to watch.\r\nNOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS FROM THE FIRST SEASON.\r\nFrom what we've seen so far, the animation is generally a lot more realistic and fluid than the first season's. In the first season, the animation was quite rigid and unrealistic,barely showing any kind of fluidity at all (e.g when Guren goes flying through the air in ep.10) and episodes would often use cheap \"action lines\" as a means to show multiple people fighting.  \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the soundtrack isn't anything special, it works very well when it needs to but otherwise the sound is above average. The opening music is nice.\\n\\n\r\nI think the art style of this show is beautifully done. Some might not like the hazy, painted and generally greyish background style (which really shows during scenes set outside) but I think it really captures the story's wasteland/apocalypse setting. These backgrounds always compliment what is being animated. The same can be said for the character and weapon designs, which also suit the story very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues where we left off, and is based on the battle at Nagoya. The actual plot, so far, as boring, stale, and as shounen as the first season, so don't expect much development there. There are, however, more action scenes, which is what this show does a lot better than the first season. The second season, more so than the first, loves to shove themes of 'family' down your throat every single episode. I'd appreciate these themes if they were implemented with even a bit of subtlety, and would let the viewer make a personal connection rather than having it constantly spoon-fed to them, but instead these 'familial themes' get in the way of enjoyment. To its merit, the second season's premise is quite promising and interesting so far, and has a lot of potential to turn into something engaging.\\n\\n\r\nWhat saved the show from being unwatchable for me were the moments based entirely on character interactions, episodes where the whole gang would just talk to each other and have a fun time. Yes, all of the characters are modelled off of common shounen stereotypes   but that doesn't mean they aren't entertaining. The second season shows us how the characters have developed from the annoying and arrogant kids they were in the first season and are becoming slightly more mentally mature. If you don't like shounen main characters and common character types (e.g tsundere) which all receive below-standard development then you probably won't enjoy Seraph of the End's characters.\\n\\n\r\nSeraph of the End's second season is quite enjoyable for fans of the series but to the people like me who didn't really find the show to be to their liking, skip this continuation. The only reason I'm not dropping the series is because of its (shounen, but) enjoyable characters, great art style, and okay animation.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

Well: \r\nStory (up)\r\nI gave it a fair, because it was still connected with the 1st season in an apocalyptic wasteland ( I just exaggerated it) where vampires wanna rule and humans have to survive, but in its general context, the story simply rely on the \"Betrayal\" theme , where one would think knows who bad and the good were, but as it turns out it wasn't that black and white. In this sequel,it wasn't surprising  that in any show with an apocalyptic theme, it would always have an open ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt (up)\\n\\n\r\nWell what can I say, it's the usual quintessential for any anime or manga to overdress the characters, it's like making them go to a formal gathering in a bikini, then again, this anime didn't rely on the fanservice to sell, that would prompt them preves to play with their joystick.\\n\\n\r\nSound (up)\\n\\n\r\nI don't have any comment as to the seiyus who did the character's voices, and I don't have any liking for both the opening and closing themes. I think that's \"Fair\" enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (up)\\n\\n\r\nI've said before, in this anime the distinction between black and white isn't that obvious, in fact this anime has kept us audience guessing as to how them characters would turn up, thought the main protagonist  Yuuichirou  Hyakuya is the quintessential character who should be the most powerful one the anime wasn't solely focus on him, rather it was equally divided amogst the characters, but the most profound where Guren, Mika, Ferid, Cowley and Kureto, they basically defined treachery in their own order and Shinoa, Kimizuki, Mitsuba, Yoichi and Mikoto defines survival in their own way  as soon as they themselves got caught in a situation where they can no longer trust even their own side, which provides for a \"Very Good\" climax and ending for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (up)\\n\\n\r\nI suppose, I could have given this anime's overall an 8, but since it ended with an open ending with no assurance of a season 3 (or will it), I just ranked it a 7, which IMAO would be \"Good\" enough............\\n\\n\\n\r\nPEACE and Happy New Year\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nA few weeks ago, I shared a meal with my grandparents, brother, and other cousins. During the dinner, we talked about all manner of topics. Our grandfather\u2019s brother named Georgie. The notion that bigger teeth brings beauty later in life. How awesome that grand meatball tasted.\r\nAt one point, the topic turned to familial connections, the bonds we share with each other. I stated that I would die for them. They are my family, so this statement sounds obvious. At least, I hope it is obvious for most.\r\nI sincerely believe it. Strangers pass by. Friends comeand go. But family. Family is forever. Yu of Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen believes the same. Unfortunately for Yu, he does not get to have dinner-made conversations. Instead, he gets an almost abysmal anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThis second season (really the second half to the split-cour) of Owari no Seraph (called Nagoya from here on out) begins shortly after the first season (really the first half).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a glaring issue that persists across most of this season: nothing actually happens. Hyperbole, yes. Events occur and characters move, sure. But the conclusions or outcomes are no doubt insignificant when the bigger picture is looked at.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has essentially five main conflicts that occur one after another. The first conflict is Yu\u2019s team contrasted with Makoto\u2019s team. The second is the multi-front battle. The third is the rescue attempt of Guren. The fourth is Yu aiding Mika. And the fifth and final conflict is the angel and demon clash at the end. Each conflict introduces drama, and each conflict does almost nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first conflict is designed to accentuate the inexperience of Yu and the other members. They get beat by Guren and reluctantly accepted by Makoto and his team. A nice approach \u2013 except for that fact that Makoto\u2019s team gets decimated over the course of a few episodes. Two members are killed off by some vampires, two others are killed off by the angel-demon contraption, and Makoto is left alone. Meaning the initial comparison has nothing come of it since the (supposedly) less experienced squad moves on without a single loss.\\n\\n\r\nThe second conflict brings about a lot of action. People die, swords swing, and tension ensues. The purpose of the attack is to wipe out the vampires once and for all. But, as the anime shows, that is all a lie. The attack is nothing more than a sacrifice. In other words, the battling is just the myriad of characters and soldiers stalling for time \u2013 they are fighting for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThis conflict is hurt further by the audience knowing nothing of the situation. The audience learns next to nothing about the vampire society. The audience learns next to nothing about the behind-the-scenes deception of the vampires and the humans. The audience learns next to nothing about the more otherworldly aspects \u2013 namely the angels and demons.\\n\\n\r\nThe third conflict revolves around getting Guren back after he gets captured. Yu being Yu, he decides to bring the fight to the vampires to save Guren, a man he considers part of his family. The resulting failure of the rescue \u2013 the attempt meant, in the end, nothing \u2013 is certainly an asinine development. But it is the later betrayal of Guren (regardless of whether he is in control or not) that turn his speeches on camaraderie and family into nothing. Plus, Guren ending up back with the humans means the rescue triply meant nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth conflict is arguably the only one that means anything more than nothing. Established in the first half of the split-cour, Mika works to save Yu from the \u201cevil\u201d humans, forcing him to go to impossible lengths to save Yu. Furthermore, the conflict is the only one that exists throughout most of the season leading up to its finale in the grocery store. Mika becoming a vampire, despite fighting off the temptations for years and years, could arguably be more nothing-based drama. But this conflict, compared to the others, actually has a meaningful impact on both the characters involved.\\n\\n\r\nThe fifth and final conflict is easily the sloppiest. The angel-demon contraption has nothing in terms of context. The vampires and the humans all do nothing as the demon comes forth. Krul Tepes is (supposedly) killed off when she does almost nothing to retaliate. Kazuki does nothing to save his sister despite how much his character is built on his strong relationship with her. Yu essentially resets everything back to how it was before the contraption appeared (minus a few characters), meaning nothing important happened plot-wise.\\n\\n\r\nCollectively, the narrative does next to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nNagoya continues, for the most part, the artistic direction and actual animation that it had with its first half.\\n\\n\r\nThe background art itself still has a painting-like quality to it. While the locations tend to blend together as grays, browns, and blacks, this dreariness contributes nicely to the dreary mood of the anime. Lighting is not as much of a focus, unfortunately, causing the anime to lose an opportunity to further cast darkness over the show.\\n\\n\r\nNagoya\u2019s animated sequences are a mixed bag. Downtime does have some fluidity in eye or head movements, and there are even subtle shifts, such as Shinoa moving her hair out of the way to better hear Yu\u2019s heart or Yu scooching backward while Mika rests in his arms and bites on his neck.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the anime also includes many a battle, yet, despite the swords, axes, and pikes, the anime rarely depicts choreographed fights. As such, the battles become less flashy and more simplistic with lots of cuts or smoke. Considering that the anime touts itself as having action, having these animated sequences be so lackluster adversely affects the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are certain sequences that prove Nagoya does not always rest on its laurels. In particular, the sequence where Mika battles through a road of enemies to get to Yu involves a lot of movement, perspective, and coolness. Other sequences, like the final fight between Yu and the demon or Yu and the gang versus the top-hat vampire, while not as involved, make the anime less static than it tends to be otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the character designs remain the same as before. Shinoa, Yu, and the other humans are rather plain in design. Some have accessories like bows or glasses. Some have oddly colored hair. But generally their designs are not that intricate. The vampires are more eccentric than the humans, making the vampires\u2019 designs more unique and therefore slightly stronger.\\n\\n\r\nFor both groups, their actual outfits are decorated with buttons, medals, and other additions. Most interesting of all is the choice of color. The humans wear black attire whereas the vampires wear white. Color symbolism often dictates that black equates to evilness and white equates to goodness. Meaning, having the colors swapped between who one would usually believe the good and bad guys to be induces a subconscious muddying of morality. An idea that, while not explicit, has a presence in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Nagoya are difficult to discuss mostly because the anime refuses to properly do much with them \u2013 nothingness seeped into the characters, too.\\n\\n\r\nOut of the entire cast, only two characters receive adequate attention: Mika and Guren.\\n\\n\r\nMika continues mostly where he left off. The vampires dislike or toy with him, he hates humans, and all he thinks about is Yu \u2013 and blood. His refusal to fully turn himself into a vampire by consuming human blood (he has satiated his thirst through Krul Tepes\u2019s blood all this time) begins to consume him, and it is this consumption that Nagoya focuses on with his character for about three-fourths of the season. His inability to control himself, his anger at himself for his urges, and his conflicting feelings towards humans.\\n\\n\r\nAll the while, he never stops thinking about Yu. His actions always revolve around finding or helping Yu and not disappointing him (by becoming the very creature that Yu hates). Consequently, in what is perhaps the anime\u2019s smartest bit of writing, he and Yu finally reunite when Mika is at his most desperate. I.e., Mika\u2019s thirst for blood and Yu reach an apex.\\n\\n\r\nYu, valuing family above all else (more on this shortly), gives Mika exactly what he wants: himself. Yu shares a private moment with Mika, he gives Mika his blood, and he reassures Mika that Mika will always be family to him \u2013 vampire or otherwise. The moment is nice, signifying development of Mika\u2019s character. Afterwards, Mika still has trouble trusting humans, but he at least comes around for Shinoa and the others, turning him into the best character that Nagoya has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nGuren is the other prominent character. Outwardly, he is a jerk, a rude and arrogant dude. Inwardly, he cares deeply for his squad mates \u2013 perhaps more so than anyone else.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the season, he leads, he falls, and he \u201cbetrays.\u201d Quotes because it technically is not his fault. His weapon had been implied to be difficult to control due to the strength of the spirit possessing it and Guren\u2019s love for said spirit. (Shinoa\u2019s older sister in both cases.) So him succumbing to temptation is not completely out of the question.\\n\\n\r\nThe real problem with the betrayal is that it (like the story) does next to nothing. Yes, Guren\u2019s tears while in his possessed form indicate that his true self hates the kin-killing monster he becomes. But it serves little purpose. His actions do not drastically affect the outcome of the season. He does not confront major players besides Yu who, in response, just spouts even more dialogue on family. And, most importantly, Guren\u2019s betrayal does nothing for himself. The betrayal (and, indeed, the whole season) does not provide growth for his character whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Guren is humanized through a flashback involving him and Yu. He compares himself to Yu, encouraging him, advising him to live and push on until the day he can fight for the one who needs his help. Shinya, seemingly his best friend, also humanizes Guren indirectly: Guren wholly trusts Shinya, counting on Shinya to save everyone in his stead and proving how good a friend Guren can be. These instances make up for some of the improper handling of his character but not all of it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, due to the focus on Mika and Guren (and the focus on a story that does nothing), the rest of the cast is forgotten about. Deeply forgotten about. And that is putting it lightly.\\n\\n\r\nYu starts to leave his him-against-the-world mentality, relying more on his comrades and acting more friendly towards them. However, he still spouts the same dialogue about family over and over. He is certainly consistent in his ideals which deserves a small amount of praise, but he repeats the same thoughts on family ad nauseam, turning him into an annoyance rather than a worthwhile character. He does seem to gain some control of his powers near the end of the season, but, because the angel and demon concepts had gone unexplained up to that point, his control does not make much sense.\\n\\n\r\nShinoa, arguably the most popular character of the anime, loses her edge. In an attempt to mold her into a more serious, reliable leader, the anime cuts down on her smug, snarky attitude \u2013 her defining trait. The tradeoff, not surprisingly, failing to work. As a leader, she gets her group into horrible situations and even causes issues (and deaths) for others based on her decisions. And because her smugness heavily disappears, so does her intrigue. And despite her older sister gaining (a minimal amount of) relativity, Shinoa\u2019s overall importance to the anime diminishes.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main group \u2013 Mitsuba, Kimizuki, and Yoichi \u2013 are painfully forgotten about. Mitsuba has an older sister that seems to be working for the evil humans, but, similar to Shinoa, that relationship is not expounded on. Kimizuki gets a small moment near the end of the season where his beloved sister, the girl who his entire character revolves around, is subjected to horrific treatment. But when he is thwarted with a single sword stab and when he chooses to abandon his sister without putting up much of a fight, Kimizuki becomes more of a joke than a person. As for Yoichi, he may as well not even exist for how much the anime ignored him.\\n\\n\r\nEverybody else cannot be discussed because they are even less prevalent than these three. And as far as themes are concerned, the obvious one is family. Different aspects of family are shown as the season goes on. Yu proves how far people are willing to go for their family when he throws himself into the fray. The commander of the humans proves what happens when one does not care about family. And the notion that family means more than shared blood rings throughout the season. The anime does not explore family on the vampire side, so the theme itself is not as strong as it could have been, but the theme is explored to some overall extent nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nA less obvious theme is that of temptation. Vampires are tempted by blood, and humans are tempted by freedom. But the theme is more nuanced than that. Mika is tempted (indirectly) by Yu. Guren is tempted by his weapon. Yu is tempted by family. For many of the characters, the prospect of attaining their desires drives them forward. To be fair, the theme itself has no outright exploration, but, since the angel-and-demon backdrop exists, the theme of sin \u2013 temptation and greed go hand-in-hand \u2013 cannot be ignored.\\n\\n\r\nDoes Mika, Guren, and some themes make up for the incredible amount of other problems the cast have?\\n\\n\r\nBarely. Just barely.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track of Nagoya has to be talked about first because of how poor it is. The tone, especially in the beginning, is overly optimistic. As such, it contrasts too much with the dreary mood that the rest of the anime steeps itself in. The song also does not do the vocalist justice. She is either forced to sing in a standard, almost conversational tone or forced to strain for specific notes. The only interesting part of the piece is the otherworldly sound-effect that seems as though it is produced by dropping a piece of metal in an icy cavern. But (obviously) that is not enough to make the OP even remotely worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track, however, is a lot stronger. The beginning and middle adopt a captivating tone that is simultaneously chilling and beautiful. Varying the pace of the piece also furthers the song\u2019s complexity which in turn furthers its strength. This time, the vocalist can flex her prowess, matching the song\u2019s highs and lows, quicks and slows. The ending lyric is a bit silly \u2013 a \u201cTrick Star\u201d does not make much sense in the context of the anime let alone in real life \u2013 but, overall, the ED stands as a nice addition to Nagoya.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack (expectedly) uses the same kind of music that the first half used. Most of the tracks are filled with drums, triumph, and ominous sound-effects, setting the atmosphere in a manner that befits the oft soldierly show. None of the tracks are particularly noteworthy, however, so they remain as simple additions rather than praiseworthy ones.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting sees a similar fate. Saori Hayami\u2019s feminine voice for Shinoa is still attractive to hear. Miyu Irino as Yu can be a bit grating when he starts pouting or yelling. And Kenichi Suzumura as Crowley coats his words with a childish lilt. The only above average performance comes from Kensho Ono as Mika for the struggle and pain one can hear in his voice.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis type of show, where the characters are in danger of being killed off or maimed or otherwise needing help, usually gets me. I have to know if the characters are going to be all right because I just do not like being kept in the dark about their safety. And so, I found myself being pulled along by this one.\\n\\n\r\nBut that was the only trait keeping me interested. I was not a fan of any of the characters. Yu was too annoying; Mika was even more so. Mitsuba, Kimizuki, and Yoichi were barely relevant. Guren was too much of a jerk, and the other vampires were either too arrogant to root for or too lame to take seriously. And since Shinoa lost a lot of her smug, she too was not as fun to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe action as well was uninteresting. None of the fights were cool or memorable. In fact, a lot of them blended together, especially when Yu and the humans almost never seemed to win or even succeed in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s comedic moments were sparse. The anime\u2019s drama was not gripping. The anime\u2019s romance could have been more pronounced. I was simply not entertained by the vast majority of what the anime set out to do.\\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen has a slew of issues. The story does nothing, the characters are forgotten about, the animation is par for the course, the music likewise so, and, as a whole, it fails to entertain. Family may be forever, but, thankfully, this anime is not.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, so much nothing in the narrative it hurts\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, nice background art, okay character designs, and about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, themes on family and temptation surround Mika, Guren, and a spectacularly awful rest of the cast\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, the safety of the characters was the only enticing part\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen this is a rare example of a perfectly mediocre anime. Flawlessly bland, exquisitely insipid, wholly vapid. Watching  Owari No Seraph is like eating air, there is simply no taste, good or bad. \r\nOwari No Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen is the uninspired continuation of an anime that should never have been made. \r\nStory: \r\nLets recap. A mysterious virus wipes out most of humanity and vampires come out of the woodwork to wage war on the surviving humans. Yu, our cliche shounen, hotheaded/immature/cocky/must-protect-everyone protagonist, has joined humanity's army to fight the vampires. He really really hates vampires for killing his childhood friends. He reallyreally wants to protect his friends too. The second half starts after he unleashes his mysterious superpowers on the vampires about to kill his comrades.  \\n\\n\r\nAs with so many mediocre anime, the premise itself is neither novel nor self-evidently atrocious.\\n\r\nThe product is simply a sand-flavored cake.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSlow pace/shitty action:\\n\r\nThere are a few identifiable things that contribute to ONS' mediocrity. The pacing is mind-numbingly slow. Most of the fight scenes in the show are related to training/testing of some sort. Learning to unlock your sword's potential, fighting your own weapon's demonic spirit, getting tested by the higher ups, learning to fight as a team, etc. The actual action scenes, what few there are, are usually pointless or indecisive.\\n\\n\r\nConvoluted storyline:\\n\r\nThe agendas of the humans and vampires are not well developed. The leadership and structure of the two factions are left nebulous and simple questions like why the two factions are fighting? why the vampires are so sadistic? What is a demon in relation to a vampire? etc are not explained. At times ONS try to draw clumsy moral parallels between the humans and vampires but it's just too messy and blurry to have any impact.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre\\n\r\nSound: Mediocre\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are poorly fleshed out and easily forgettable. They will make predictable decisions then inexplicably decide to trust their mortal enemy for no reason. \\n\r\nIn the background of the almost completely absent character development is the homoerotic attraction between Mika and Yu. I'm still trying to wrap my head around how that fits in (no pun intended). I think the core problem is that both characters are just too underdeveloped for me to know where their bond is coming from. They are \"family\" but then Mika looks like he wants to bone Yu. Yu seems to act differently when he's around Mika. The male vampires are all pretty androgynous and the act of drinking blood is unsubtly sexualized. Then there's that strong pederasty vibe between Ferid and Mika... I dunno...whatever. \\n\\n\r\nTo say that the characters are flat would be an understatement. They aren't even cardboard-flat. They are 100%, eco-friendly, RECYCLED cardboard-flat. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYu: Brash, hot headed, annoying as fuck. Where have we seen that before? Oh right, everywhere. He's a cookie-cutter shounen protagonist. He will charge into battle screaming at the drop of a hat without thinking. He has two objectives--kill vampires; protect friends. There's no growth throughout the series and he is exactly the same from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nMika: Now a vampire. Struggling with his various 'urges'' you might say. I don't think it's a stretch to call his bloodlust an allegory for homosexuality but again, whatever. As a character his thought process is largely absent. Why is he siding with the vampires when they murdered his friends? If he is siding with the vampires why is he so hesitant about drinking blood/killing humans. If he is hesitant about killing humans why does he enable his friends to murder children and distrust humans so much? If being changed into a vampire has altered his thinking why does he still have such a boner for Yu? Why is he so wishy washy about everything? \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else:\\n\r\nToo many half baked characters to keep track of. For such an vacuous anime you would think there would be plenty of room to develop the side characters but not really. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Meh\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall disappointing. The last few seasons of anime have been pretty weak so I finished this out of boredom. Watch only if you are really, really bored.",

            "content": "I just finished watching Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya which is the second season of the show. I said I would review it and here it is. So are my problems with the characters fixed? Does the second season improve all of the first season\u2019s flaws? Let\u2019s find out!\r\n(If you have not seen the show yet I suggest you do so or at least watch the first season since I will be talking about the ending of the first season)\r\nStory:\r\nThe second season picks up right at the end of the first season with Yuuichirou fully healed and everyone going back to business asusual. That is until they find out that there is corruption in the army and are sent to Nagoya to take down a huge vampire army. The majority of episodes in this season are about the battle in Nagoya (hence the name) and that is pretty much the main plot of the second season. I would go into more since there are a lot of twists and turns in this season but I am trying not to spoil the story since I highly suggest you watch this show for yourself, although as I said I will try not to spoil anything extremely major to the plot if you are here just to know if the second season is any good. And the answer is yes. The second season is a lot better than the first in terms of overall story progression since a lot of important stuff happens in this season opposed to the first and thanks to the setting and the main plot of this season there are a lot more epic fight scenes which was lacking in the first season. So overall in terms of story this season was a big improvement over the first, although like the first it does end on a cliff-hanger which I hope gets resolved since this is a show that deserves another season or a continuation of some sort. This story needs to be continued and while you could read the manga I still think it deserves another season since if you read the manga you wouldn\u2019t get Hiroyuki Sawano\u2019s epic soundtrack or the awesome voice acting backing it up. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThankfully this season gets rid of the main problems I had with the characters Yuuichirou and Mikaela. Yuuichirou is still a stubborn and generic shounen anime protagonist but still likable, and his goals aren\u2019t mainly set on revenge but to also protect his new family and fight to defeat the vampires. Mikaela\u2019s problems are fixed as well as he takes the role of a lone wolf, undercover protagonist rather than an anti-hero as he is still set on \u2018saving\u2019 Yuuichirou but is also not on the side of the vampires as, even though he is one, he still holds hatred for them which wasn\u2019t really shown from him in the first season. Other than that all of my opinions on the other characters stay the same and not many new characters are introduced in this season which gives time for all of the old ones to be further fleshed out rather than focusing on some random new characters. Any of the new ones aren\u2019t really worth talking about although they are still likable even if they don\u2019t serve much to the plot. The only new character I will talk about is the show\u2019s newest antagonist: Kureto Hiiragi. Kureto is one of the main heads of the Imperial Demon Army and also the main source for the corruption in the army. Throughout this series you will learn to hate Kureto as some of the stuff he does is pure evil, especially in the last two episodes. Although the show still never explains what the Four Horsemen of John are or where they came from. There is something that kind of explains it but it is a spoiler and it only happens in the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFirst off, I forget to mention this in my review of season 1 but the first season has a good opening and ending and they were never songs I skipped. The same can\u2019t be said for the second season however as the opening is boring, generic and not enjoyable to listen to and the ending is plain but better than the opening. The soundtrack remains the same and it is still as epic as ever, if even more as most of the songs I like from the soundtrack only play in the second season. And every time I hear the main theme play I just can\u2019t help but smile at the epicness since it can make even a conversation about escaping between Yuuichirou and Mikaela sound like the most epic thing in the world. Definitely one of Hiroyuki Sawano\u2019s best soundtracks and one that I will be listening to a lot down the line. My main problems still remain the same however as some of the sound effects sound muffled at times and the music to midway animation sequence transition is still pretty awkward. All of the voice actors return and the actors for the new characters are on par with the others. I would expect nothing less from a Funimation dub. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nMy opinions on the animation are exactly the same as the first season since it is exactly the same. The colors really pop, the characters look really nice and Wit Studio shows that they can handle action scenes really well. My only complaint is that CGI is sometimes used, although it is never bad CGI it is still really noticeable and can break your focus during a scene when it appears. Although I don\u2019t mind CGI in anime as long as it\u2019s done well. The animation still remains to be one of the shows high points. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nOverall I thought that Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya was a definite improvement over the first season, mainly in terms of story and characters. It\u2019s a show that deserves another season or a continuation of some sorts since it feels like it\u2019s a story that you need to witness in anime form. I haven\u2019t read the manga so I wouldn\u2019t know how it compares but the awesomeness of this show, accompanied by Hiroyuki Sawano\u2019s epic soundtrack is something that made me love this show so much and I couldn\u2019t dream of witnessing this story without my favorite voice actors doing the voices or listening to the epic score in the background. That\u2019s why I am happy to give Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya the rating that it deserves.\\n\\n\r\nRating: Great \\n\r\n(My rating system is explained if you check my profiles main page. I hope you liked the review and look forward to more in the future)\\n\\n\r\nPeace out, Anime fans! \\n",

            "content": "I wish this was not a second season and a continuation of the first season making it a total of 24 episodes that I could have rated better altogether, unfortunately that was not the case. The reason for this, is that I would have had a better Overall rating than I gave for each season on it's own. After watching the first season it was understandable that the setting needed to be revealed and back stories needed to be told, etc... so I saw it to be a little slow until it got some action after 2/3 of the anime had passed. So then Irated it a 7. I'm almost done watching this second season I know I I'll be giving it a 9. There were parts where I was anxious, surprised, concerned, sad, and I even cried a little. This season gave me what I wanted and I enjoyed it very much.\\n\\n\r\nIt made me feel bad I gave the first season a 7, but that just what I felt it deserved seeing as it just ended with the god stuff happening almost to the end. So that is why I really wished it would have all been a 24 episode 1st season instead. This time, my enjoyment surely maxed out, and I was certainly not disappointed. If I had to go back and re-rate the first season knowing what would come afterward, I would have given it an 8; however, I will not because that's just how I felt it was, and having it spit up that way was not my choice. At least the first season was good enough to make me want to see this second season and I'm glad I did. \\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, here are my ratings for the following:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nWith season 1 out of the way, the progression of the story and this particular arc (battle of Nagoya) was very interesting to me, and we get to see a lot of action. It's what I was looking for in the first place, but it wouldn't have been as enjoyable without the story-telling in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThis rating has to do specifically with the animation and execution of the battle/fighting scenes since ,well, the overall art is the same as the first season. When I saw a noble vampire strike Guren, you could have felt the power and intensity from just watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThis Mika and Yuuichiro thing is my weakness. Say yes to friendships <3\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI definitely got more into this second season than I did with the first. Looking forward to see more in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8.6/10 which translates to a 9 (if you round it off hehe)\\n",

            "content": "Do you ever have that one anime where you feel as though there was many things going on but still feeling like there was no impact to any of it? Anime that are of the action genre often come into this dilemma. Ones that have an overarching story that tries to make it grand and epic, only to squander it by not giving much to go on. It doesn\u2019t help with a short 12-13 episode season. Considering that Owari no Seraph had a 2nd season in the same year in order to facilitate its story longer and still come off short is basically rubbing saltin the wound.\\n\\n\r\nTo go back on the first season for a bit, since I never reviewed it, my initial impression of the story was incredibly underwhelming. I thought the way it told a revenge plot involving a boy who wants to kill vampires who killed all of his friends was too simple and drab for me to take seriously. There are ways in which this could work but with Owari no Seraph\u2019s case it comes across as predictable and hamfisted with the melodrama. Not only is the story itself nothing special, but the way it is presented is all over the place. Most notably the pacing is what drags it down so low. There are many places where the plot just rushes along in order to get to the next battle scene without any semblance of exposition to tell the audience what exactly is going on. This is very apparent in the last episode of this season where the last ten minutes felt like there should\u2019ve been two more episodes to fill in to make it feel more like a seamless transition from scene to scene.\\n\\n\r\nWriting is the key point to any story as well, and Owari no Seraph has probably the most boring dialogue of any shounen anime this year. It\u2019s like the running joke in America where we think of Hollywood of just reusing cliched catchphrases we see in countless action blockbusters by putting there hand in a jar and pick whatever line is on a piece of paper. That\u2019s what it feels like for some of the lines that lean on the \u201cedgy\u201d or \u201cmelodramatic\u201d nature of Owari no Seraph. Many of the lines, even if you\u2019re watching with the worst fansubs or know a little Japanese like I do, just reek of stale dialogue writing that even a high school student with a novice level of writing composition could do better. They can range from predictable to groan inducing on many occasions.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of the characters here are of the same level as the story is in terms of quality. They all fall under the category of forgettable and flat, with the exception of one character that is the one ray of sunshine of this entire anime. The character I am referring to is the lovely sarcastic lady,  Shinoa Hiiragi. Although her character development is on par to the rest of the bland cast, her snarky demeanor and voiced wonderfully by Saori Hayami, who does her lines a cut above the rest. Without her, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve sat through all 24 episodes of season 1 and 2; in fact I would say the only reason I bothered to continue this was just to see more of Shinoa. Her presence in season 2 is just as good, albeit a little more serious than in the previous one which kind of disappointed me but I\u2019ll take whatever Shinoa I can get at this point.\\n\\n\r\nYuu proves himself to be the stereotypical edgy protagonist who shouts most of his lines and blurts out predictable vengeful lines and promises to stick with his friends lines. Admittedly, I do think Mika, Yuu\u2019s other friend who gets turned towards the vampire side, was probably the least bad out of the suck bunch in the cast. Only because he at least had a role that was kind of captivating to see where he has to battle out his friend\u2019s other friends in order to reunite with him. In fact, all three of these characters are the only ones I even remember. As much as I rag on Yuu\u2019s character, at least I can remember his name and the dumb lines he spout out. You could quiz me on the rest of the characters and I will guarantee you that I would not make more than a 20% grade percentage. This being the problem of how so little development any of them have despite being in the same armed forces as Yuu and Shinoa or the vampire clan they are fighting against. The only thing we have to go on is that they are fighting an enemy that threatens their way of life, that\u2019s about it. Whoopee.\\n\\n\r\nIt is weird to analyze the technical prowess of Owari no Seraph because I do love the artwork of the characters and even some of the backgrounds look nice to look at. However the animation is very hit or miss. No where is this more evident than in the fighting scenes where there are some episodes where the animation just takes a nose dive and seems so obvious that the animators were cutting corners, possibly due to budgeting issues or whatnot. When it isn\u2019t at such low quality, it is serviceable to the eyes and compliments the artwork. Other than the animation being a mixed bag, I genuinely love how colorful the characters look. As a matter of fact, if the characters didn\u2019t have very distinct colorful features to their hair or skin, I think my opinion of them being forgettable would be even lower than it is.\\n\\n\r\nVampires and humans battling out each other can be something fun on paper but rarely has there been any that succeed in reality. Had the writers took their time to develop the characters and story slowly for me to get a sense of the world, I think this could\u2019ve been pretty good. What I got out of Owari no Seraph after finishing its 2nd season was just the biggest meh that has ever meh this year of 2015. All I got out of it was more Shinoa fanart to gaze upon with my own eyes. At least great things can come from average places.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C-\\n",

It has some good and some bad. \r\nI really love the ost in this season. They really nailed the music in this one. \r\nBecause I am me, I always fall in love with the side characters who aren't even the main side characters. So Ionly started to really like the main characters at the end of this (second) season. I think they're great characters but the anime couldn't do them all justice with such short episodes/seasons when so much is happening. (My favorite is Shinya, so. You know.)\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall it's a good anime. It did take me like almost two seasons to get properly interested in everything (I did enjoy this and the first season, but the main reason why I continued to watch this was Shinya), but that's just because I am me and I'm weird. Might change my opinion on the overall score later, but this anime belongs to the 6-10 range.",

I will mostly comparing how things are in this season than the first season.\r\n\"More fujobait but gets way better than the first season.\"\r\nStory : 9/10\r\nIt gets way better than the first season. We got a lot more backgrounds on what's happening. The start are kinda slow and filled with daily lives of them in the main basecamp and some events to tie up the \"Yuu's awakening\" incident. The main story kicks in a few episodes later where they are sent to Nagoya for war, hence the season title. The finale was also as great as the firstseason.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\r\nThe art are as good as the first season with oily hand-drawn paintings as backgrounds, and it meshes well with the animation that used thick lines as borders. The animation also got better, no more awkward scenes like where Mika's feet gliding trough the stairs like in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\r\nSawano Hiroyuki. Also we now got fripSide for OP and Yanagi Nagi for ED, I particularly loved the ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8/10\\n\r\nNow Yuu aren't as annoying as he was in S1, he's gotten more mature somehow and doesn't yell \"I'm going to kill every vampires\" every 5 minutes anymore. Another notable improvements are Shinoa and Guren, now Shinoa got more personalities than just the smugness people praise her for. We also got a better look at Guren's personalities. Overall the Shinoa squad members' interaction are better with each other. And we also got more Mika on screen now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjyoment : 8/10\\n\r\nShonen being a shonen, the battle hype is really good, it was fun to see people hacking up other people with swords and various arms imbued with a demon. There are also a few comedy scenes which is good to break the ice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\r\ntl;dr It's better than the first season, if you didn't like the first one, you might like this one.",

            "content": "Seraph of the End is pretty dark for a shounen series. People can straight up die when you least expect it, make gruesome sacrifices, fight desperately to their last breath, and make positively evil schemes. But all of this is what makes Seraph of the End so interesting.\r\nThe story of Seraph of the End gets more interesting in this second season as we learn a lot about Yu, meet new characters and experience shocking plot twists and meet new antagonists. I was very shocked at the character who reappeared at the last episode, and are very interested about the past of a certain Lieutenant Colonel.As always, Seraph of the End's story this second season was very good and kept me interested to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Seraph of the End continues to be superb, as always the animators over at Wit Studio are doing their best. Some scenes are amazing to watch, especially the battles. I hope Wit keeps this level of quality consistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds of Seraph of the End do their job service-ably. Whenever a certain scene would begin with a certain mood, the music would match it perfectly. I understood exactly what was being conveyed by the music, which did it's job.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this Anime continue to be interesting as we learn more about several of them, and their are one or two shocking revelations here and there. We also meet new characters, as well as witness the \"End\" of many of them. The people behind Seraph of the End's story continue to write great characters and interesting twists.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm going to give Seraph of the End a 9/10 on enjoyment and my overall score. Seraph of the End season 2 is perfectly fine for those who liked the first season, and I recommend this series for people who aren't snobs that have a stick up their ass about shounen. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

But all in all the story was amazing the main characters designs were incredible.

            "content": "Despite the art being like the storyline, pretty boring and generic, this season was after all better than the first one.\r\nThis season, I found myself disliking the protagonists of the show and did not care much at the end if they'd survive or not. I see nearly 0 character development and all the characters in the show seem very flat and uninteresting with the exception of Shinoa and Mitsuba, having somewhat of a background worth thinking about. They all kept speaking and acting in this very obvious (sometimes obnoxious) and specific way which kept the story very uninteresting and predictable. \r\nSecondly, the plot does notmake any sense from time to time. Some characters act very unrealistically. Like, there are multiple characters who frequently keeps disobeying the commands but are yet still allowed to participate in the battle (You can guess who). You are given no sense of time elapses and the plot overall was just confusing and a big mess with major plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, I did not notice any great musical performance. The music, very much like everything else, was very generic and basic. Not bad but nothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nThe art though is very consistent but was in my opinion, very boring to look at. Very few shots with extraordinary art (If any?) and it all looked a bit childish at times so I found it hard to take some scenes seriously but that could've been that it was just me being not very fond of the art style. But as I said, no weird frames and everything looked like it was supposed to, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSo was this season worth it? Yes, if you managed to get through the first one this one is way better but still not very top notch. After reading all this I do realise it sounds like I didn't enjoy the show at all but I really did. Overall, it was good and I'd watch another season if there would come one but this isn't an anime you'd discuss for months with others.",

But there are so many plot and character holes that made me feel that i wasted my time. Also we dont have to forget that this anime series is full of cliche in both story and characters, which havent been made well. However the main problem is thatyou cant understand the true goal of the mangaka, he probably wants to explain some issues but he cant and he creates many others. In the duration of this season you expect that you are going to solve some mysteries but finally you get nothing. The holes become far deeper. Last but not least because the majority of the fans watches something for the enjoyment , personally i believe that there is no enjoyment in such a thing.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Generic: such a simple word, yet one that can also encapsulate a great deal of information with its utterance. Simply attach it to the title of a show and it works as a description without any need for further elaboration. Just say \"it's generic\" and a picture is immediately imprinted onto the minds of the audience as to what is to be expected. It's even better saying it out loud, follow after me and let's say it together:\r\n\"Owari no Seraph is generic!\"\r\nNow doesn't that just roll off the tongue with so much ease? Fits like a glove doesn't it? It's like the word itself wastailor-made for this show. And perhaps that word is all that's needed to sum up this series. \\n\\n\r\nThere's really no change when it comes to this ill-conceived hogwash of clich\u00e9s and overused tropes. It's still a poor man's version of better shounen stories, it's still subpar in quality, and it's still an intoxicating pile of throw-away excerpts from better-established premises and ideas. Owari no Seraph is the \"How to make a Basic Shounen for Dummies\" in visual format. If 1st season didn't hammer that point in, then this season surely made sure to get the job done. But I guess there is one noticeable change worth noting, and that's that the show somehow manages to get worse. Through the magic of fujoshi bait, God awful writing and the power of friendship, this anime becomes a firework display of stupidity rarely achieved by many. It pushes forward into the throw-away abyss at breakneck speeds. And in its own way, it succeeds. It has proven that when you really try hard enough, when you really push long enough, and when you really care enough, you can enter even denser shounen bullshit territory. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you \"Generic: the anime.\"\\n\\n\r\nPicking up from where we left off, we follow our protagonist MustProtectMyFamily-kun and the squadron of vampire slayers, as they gear up for an impending all-out battle with the vampires, in what is to be an attempt to regain control of Earth for the sake of humanity's survival. And while all this is going on, in the background, there's an even more sinister plan being conjured up by ImTheObviousBadGuy-sama and his cohorts. \\n\\n\r\nNow the setup for this season isn't all that bad, in fact, it's a traditional one that, if done right, can be quite rewarding to watch unfold. It's the classic clash of ideals, where opposition reaches a breaking point of unreachable compromise. The end all be all fight where the stakes are set on the highest pedestal. A Zero-sum dice roll, where only one side can walk away rewarded. These are the kind of stories that litter literature, cinema and TV on constant rotation, but despite that, can still offer up the same thrills and chair-gripping engagement expected from the best of them. But even when considering the long shelf-life that these kinds of stories offer, if it's poorly written, no amount of the garnishing and repacking can be done to salvage it. And to no one's surprise, Owari no Seraph isn't going to be a show that defies that unspoken rule. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, the problem with Seraph isn't the premise or idea, but rather the piss poor execution of it. The show just doesn't seem to have the proper comprehension of what is needed for it to make this kind of story work. Its ineptitude runs deep into the core foundation of the show, from the garish narrative decisions to the downright terrible plot conveniences tossed in to bail itself out of a tight squeeze. Every turn and corner lead into another questionable writing decision that really exposes the lack of foresight on the part of the creator, and improper planning on the part of the scriptwriters. Throughout the show's run-time, this leads to numerous situations where our characters come face to face with death, only to have a last-minute dues ex machina tossed in to fish them out of troubled water. And this doesn't just happen a few times, it happens in an endless cycle, most notably with our main protagonist MustProtectMyFamily-kun, who inexplicably survives more shit than even what's possible with the aid of basic plot armor. It's like he himself becomes the embodiment plot armor, to the point where his existence is met with guaranteed immunity, regardless of consequence. This creates some of the most uninspired character struggle imaginable. There is zero tension to a story that goes out of its way to perform back flips around its lead. \\n\\n\r\nBut this isn't only limited to him, almost everyone that's given a name and a back-story is automatically in the safe-zone, even if they're stabbed through vital organs. I can't properly explain this without taking a special mention of the show's ending. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, just pay attention to the numerous times where our main characters not only live through death marker injuries but also walk it off like it wasn't that big of a deal, it's quite laughable. The only ones 'biting the bullet' are characters that are clearly introduced for the sake of dying a few episodes later. The moment they're introduced, a death flag is planted smack dab on their forehead. It's an old trick that wasn't good in other stories and isn't good here either. \\n\\n\r\nBut Owari no Seraph S2 isn't all bad, if anything, there was a noticeable improvement in its art and animation. The fights carry more weight behind it (non-figuratively speaking), the character models remained far more consistent from frame to frame, and the issue regarding the flat backgrounds are better worked around. It's a more palatable experience overall, and that, at the very least, deserves some credit. Also, the color choices seemed better implemented. For example, the reds (burgundy to be more specific) and greens were far more eye-catching than the often acid washed look of the 1st season. It wasn't that big of a change but it was enough to be noticed on a panel to panel comparison. \\n\r\nAs far as the soundtrack goes, most of the content from season one finds itself worked back into this season. If you liked S1's music score then S2 should suffice. However, the opening wasn't as instantaneous as the first. It feels more commonplace in comparison to the harmonious balance found between the vocals and instruments of the 1st season's musical number. Not a bad opening per se, just not as catchy as bellowing out \"I'LL BE THERE, HOLD ON, THEY'LL CHANGE US SOMEHOW, SO WHERE ARE YOU NOWWW?\", but it still gets the job done in its own way. Not singing in the shower level, but hey, music is subjective, so that depends entirely on the listener.\\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph's 2nd season does improve a few aspects that 1st season was lacking but it also implemented things that were far worse as well. It took one step forward only to take two steps back. It's not the most aggravating title to watch but at the same time, it doesn't have a reason to exist (outside of Wit Studio milking a fanbase it helped establish). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the more noticeable issues this season had in comparison to the 1st, I still can't bring myself to hate this franchise. It's really just a soulless product that comes and goes without registering any sort of response from me. The fights were better put-together but the narrative was more stupid. The animation was more eye-catching but the content being animated was dumb. In a way, it just balanced itself out. A series that's forever just \"ok\" in my head.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph is a show that's either passable or outright rejected betting on one factor, and that's personal experience. Like I've stated in my season one review, this anime serves as a gateway title to help you get a little insight into the medium's norm and season two only furthers that trend. But where the line is drawn is that factor, that personal experience. If you've been an active follower of anime for an extended period of time, you've undoubtedly seen numerous of titles that play out in the exact same order to what Owari offers. And from that vast selection, you've probably seen it play out far better as well. So with that in mind, this anime isn't made for long time anime viewers, it's made for the bright-eyed newcomers who haven't consumed enough of these fast food titles to grow sick of them yet. Owari no Seraph can serve as a title to get others into the medium, but as far as those already steadfast in it, I cannot in good conscience recommend this John Smith: serial number 28927.",

Go to the bottom for full season review.\r\nUp toepisode 9:\\n\\n\r\n[Such a waste of an intriguing plot idea and character (Mika)\\n\\n\r\nThe first season was not the best, I will admit. Yet I felt that the story had promise and Mika was way underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season is everything that is wrong with the first on steroids, all beefed up and loud. One dimensional characters that are just the tropes of typical animes. No character development or really plot progression.\\n\\n\r\nAll that happens could be summed up in a fraction of the time if there were not purely random and unexplained scenes mixed with boring drawn out flashbacks. The only thing that kept me watching was the story, and I found out that it is really not all that complex after reading a summery. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are stuck in a time paradox. One where any actual character development is stuck and all that they can do is spout the same exact lines over and over. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are good. Yet, as hard as you try to dress up a pile of trash to make it look fabulous, it's still garbage. \\n\\n\r\nOnly watch if you need anything to watch and have no better options to binge. \\n\\n\r\nIf the story is grabbing you then look it up online]\\n\\n\\n\r\nFull season:\\n\\n\r\nOn a whim I decided to finish this anime late one night, and I am glad I did. Kinda. It is still not the best anime by any shot but I can kinda see it going somewhere next season, so I hold out hope there. \\n\\n\r\nThe main issue with it is that it is trying to be the next big hit anime *cough (Attack On Titan) cough*, but FAILS hard. It has a great story, I knew this from the start; this was why I even continued to watch it and why I finished it. Too bad the characters and writers let the story down. \\n\\n\r\nThere are simply too many mysteries in the story and more keep coming the longer you watch. With no answers to solve the past questions you just end up lost in what is going on always. Characters motivations are there, but we have not got any idea what they are. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the shows biggest failing, the writers are writing in too many character traits without fleshing out the others added before. This leaves you with a confusing mess of a \"family\" of characters whose motivations are one dimensional and come off as just lame. \\n\\n\r\nRead the manga if you have the itch for answers that I have after finishing. Maybe it is the better read, or at least it is more complete at this point.",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph is back. Initially, I was disappointed with the first season. With heavy amounts of exposition and lack of charisma for quite a bit of episodes, my expectations going into the sequel wasn\u2019t high. However, season 2 turned out to be pleasantly different. No, I wasn\u2019t expecting this to be a significant improvement but it does set its foot a bit further than mediocrity.\r\nBranded as a sequel, it\u2019s absolutely imperative to be familiar with the first season to get the full experience. As the title implies, the majority of the second season takes place in Nagoya, a city on the surface that isalso home to noble vampires. Originally, it was actually home to humans until the Apocalypse. What is the Apocalypse? For a brief recap, it\u2019s pretty much when a lethal epidemic wiped out a major part of humanity years before the start of the show. From this event, vampires became the rulers and treats human like livestock while also keeping some human children alive for their own purpose. One of these children named Yuichiro Hyakuya managed to escape and was taken in by the Japanese Imperial Demon Army, a group of resistance who plans to liberate themselves from the vampires\u2019 rule. Flash forward to present day and we got a resistance group fighting not for pride or liberty. But for survival.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the manga, the second season is actually quite faithful or at least captures the magic of the story especially in the first 10 episodes. The first season had a ridiculous amount of info dump and exposition, so much with the buildup and to the point that it became distracting. Luckily, this sequel is more about the action and the execution. A few concepts in this season deals with how humans desperately fight for survival in the face of unimaginable circumstances, the higher-ups of the Japanese Imperial Army taking a keen interest in Yu, and Yu\u2019s own personal goal to make Mika into a normal human again after realizing that he has turned into a vampire; the very thing he loathes. A lot of the episodes also deals with interpersonal problems and how certain characters such as Shinoa bears responsibility for herself and others. In the face of danger, characters make decisions that gambles on life and death. Some even defy orders for their own personal reasons. \\n\\n\r\nAs such, expect the sequel to bulk emotional drama as well. The latter half of the show will easily get the viewers to recognize how dangerous the vampire Nobles can be. Death is reality and the humans realizes that whole earthly. While there is a lot of battle on the frontlines, the show also seems to enforce human drama. The most prominent would be the relationship between Yu and Mika. The latter is no longer human while Yu tries to restore him back to normal. Their conversation unites them with both delightful and painful memories of the past. Just do note that there\u2019s a bit of feeling of subtle BL that fans likes to play their minds with in one of these episodes. While the show isn\u2019t actually a BL, it\u2019s easy to fantasize after seeing the deep chemistry between Yu and Mika. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters in the series also makes an impact of various degrees. Shinoa\u2019s character is much more serious as she has a lot of burden on her shoulders. Meanwhile, Guren shows what his comrades means to him when faced against unprecedented odds on the frontlines. What\u2019s much more interesting though is the presence of the Hiragi family. Kureto, the heir of the family\u2019s current heir, is a character that is a bit different from his comrades. With a cold personality and strong emphasis to accomplish any task at whatever the cost, he also often demands respects from others. To me, he is like the anti-thesis of the main characters. Although he is fighting for the good of mankind, his ways of doing so often puts odds against his own comrades. One could even speculate that he is a manipulative individual as he assigns Guren\u2019s group into near impossible missions. Speaking of family, it still remains a main theme throughout the second season. Besides Yu and Mika, the Moon Demon Company still has a prominent presence. Yu treats it like his own family and often seeks to protect them. Even if this takes toll on his own body and spirit, Yu is selfless in nature. Obviously, this also translates into his desire to turn Mika back to what he was before \u2013 a human. The way the sequel is directed improves as each episode adds more and more to the main themes and concepts. Even the storytelling gets more interesting with the developments despite some pacing issues and omitting some parts of the manga. On the negative side, the antagonists of the show still remains dense and stereotypical. Characters like Crowley hardly gets any characterization while most of the fights against the strongest vampires lacks excitement. (most of them are more like one sided fights). Furthermore, Kuel continuously hides secrets from others and we don\u2019t get the chance to know her true purpose. I suppose Mika is more like an anti-hero in this season although his actions are questionable with his vampire nature. But in retrospect, the antagonists aren\u2019t appealing either in character or role.\\n\\n\r\nWit Studio adapts the sequel although the artwork hardly improved. The character designs still looks essentially the same as they did for the previous season although I like the way the Hiiragi family members are designed. Kureto in particular expresses a ruthless nature that is decorated quite well. In addition, most of the demons has a credible design to induce fear. We also get the introduction of some new noble family members, antagonists that looks even more menacing than before. The battles they participates in are some of the main highlights of the sequel as camera angles and action scenes features them quite well. Match that with the stereo soundtrack and we got quite a season. The OP and ED theme songs also conveys what the show is capable of that gives off more of its atmospheric setting \u2013 a battlefield with nothing but potential for destruction and chaos. \\n\\n\r\nAfter taking a breath in and out, I think this second season is an improvement of the previous. It capitalized the main story\u2019s purpose while delivering memorable fights and expressing a variety of emotions. While the technical features still generally remained the same, the show is easily watchable for those looking into some stylistic action. I can\u2019t say for sure that the sequel will be a pleasurable experience for everyone though. It still omits manga material at some parts and can seem a bit too serious for its own good. One particular episode with Yu and Mika in the second half of the show can be uncomfortable to watch for some people. And also, I feel like they stuffed a lot into the finale, perhaps too much and leaves too open. But for all its downsides, the battle in Nagoya will be one to remember.\\n",

            "content": "* Hi there! This is my first review, so bear with me if it's badly written or judged. Constructive feedback is welcomed. *\r\nDid you enjoy Seraph of the End (Owari no Seraph) Season 1? Then you'll probably enjoy this sequel. Personally, I don't like Seraph of the End as a whole, but the show has a few merits that keep it from being unbearable to watch.\r\nNOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS FROM THE FIRST SEASON.\r\nFrom what we've seen so far, the animation is generally a lot more realistic and fluid than the first season's. In the first season, the animation was quite rigid and unrealistic,barely showing any kind of fluidity at all (e.g when Guren goes flying through the air in ep.10) and episodes would often use cheap \"action lines\" as a means to show multiple people fighting.  \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the soundtrack isn't anything special, it works very well when it needs to but otherwise the sound is above average. The opening music is nice.\\n\\n\r\nI think the art style of this show is beautifully done. Some might not like the hazy, painted and generally greyish background style (which really shows during scenes set outside) but I think it really captures the story's wasteland/apocalypse setting. These backgrounds always compliment what is being animated. The same can be said for the character and weapon designs, which also suit the story very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues where we left off, and is based on the battle at Nagoya. The actual plot, so far, as boring, stale, and as shounen as the first season, so don't expect much development there. There are, however, more action scenes, which is what this show does a lot better than the first season. The second season, more so than the first, loves to shove themes of 'family' down your throat every single episode. I'd appreciate these themes if they were implemented with even a bit of subtlety, and would let the viewer make a personal connection rather than having it constantly spoon-fed to them, but instead these 'familial themes' get in the way of enjoyment. To its merit, the second season's premise is quite promising and interesting so far, and has a lot of potential to turn into something engaging.\\n\\n\r\nWhat saved the show from being unwatchable for me were the moments based entirely on character interactions, episodes where the whole gang would just talk to each other and have a fun time. Yes, all of the characters are modelled off of common shounen stereotypes   but that doesn't mean they aren't entertaining. The second season shows us how the characters have developed from the annoying and arrogant kids they were in the first season and are becoming slightly more mentally mature. If you don't like shounen main characters and common character types (e.g tsundere) which all receive below-standard development then you probably won't enjoy Seraph of the End's characters.\\n\\n\r\nSeraph of the End's second season is quite enjoyable for fans of the series but to the people like me who didn't really find the show to be to their liking, skip this continuation. The only reason I'm not dropping the series is because of its (shounen, but) enjoyable characters, great art style, and okay animation.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

Well: \r\nStory (up)\r\nI gave it a fair, because it was still connected with the 1st season in an apocalyptic wasteland ( I just exaggerated it) where vampires wanna rule and humans have to survive, but in its general context, the story simply rely on the \"Betrayal\" theme , where one would think knows who bad and the good were, but as it turns out it wasn't that black and white. In this sequel,it wasn't surprising  that in any show with an apocalyptic theme, it would always have an open ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt (up)\\n\\n\r\nWell what can I say, it's the usual quintessential for any anime or manga to overdress the characters, it's like making them go to a formal gathering in a bikini, then again, this anime didn't rely on the fanservice to sell, that would prompt them preves to play with their joystick.\\n\\n\r\nSound (up)\\n\\n\r\nI don't have any comment as to the seiyus who did the character's voices, and I don't have any liking for both the opening and closing themes. I think that's \"Fair\" enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (up)\\n\\n\r\nI've said before, in this anime the distinction between black and white isn't that obvious, in fact this anime has kept us audience guessing as to how them characters would turn up, thought the main protagonist  Yuuichirou  Hyakuya is the quintessential character who should be the most powerful one the anime wasn't solely focus on him, rather it was equally divided amogst the characters, but the most profound where Guren, Mika, Ferid, Cowley and Kureto, they basically defined treachery in their own order and Shinoa, Kimizuki, Mitsuba, Yoichi and Mikoto defines survival in their own way  as soon as they themselves got caught in a situation where they can no longer trust even their own side, which provides for a \"Very Good\" climax and ending for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (up)\\n\\n\r\nI suppose, I could have given this anime's overall an 8, but since it ended with an open ending with no assurance of a season 3 (or will it), I just ranked it a 7, which IMAO would be \"Good\" enough............\\n\\n\\n\r\nPEACE and Happy New Year\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nA few weeks ago, I shared a meal with my grandparents, brother, and other cousins. During the dinner, we talked about all manner of topics. Our grandfather\u2019s brother named Georgie. The notion that bigger teeth brings beauty later in life. How awesome that grand meatball tasted.\r\nAt one point, the topic turned to familial connections, the bonds we share with each other. I stated that I would die for them. They are my family, so this statement sounds obvious. At least, I hope it is obvious for most.\r\nI sincerely believe it. Strangers pass by. Friends comeand go. But family. Family is forever. Yu of Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen believes the same. Unfortunately for Yu, he does not get to have dinner-made conversations. Instead, he gets an almost abysmal anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThis second season (really the second half to the split-cour) of Owari no Seraph (called Nagoya from here on out) begins shortly after the first season (really the first half).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a glaring issue that persists across most of this season: nothing actually happens. Hyperbole, yes. Events occur and characters move, sure. But the conclusions or outcomes are no doubt insignificant when the bigger picture is looked at.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has essentially five main conflicts that occur one after another. The first conflict is Yu\u2019s team contrasted with Makoto\u2019s team. The second is the multi-front battle. The third is the rescue attempt of Guren. The fourth is Yu aiding Mika. And the fifth and final conflict is the angel and demon clash at the end. Each conflict introduces drama, and each conflict does almost nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first conflict is designed to accentuate the inexperience of Yu and the other members. They get beat by Guren and reluctantly accepted by Makoto and his team. A nice approach \u2013 except for that fact that Makoto\u2019s team gets decimated over the course of a few episodes. Two members are killed off by some vampires, two others are killed off by the angel-demon contraption, and Makoto is left alone. Meaning the initial comparison has nothing come of it since the (supposedly) less experienced squad moves on without a single loss.\\n\\n\r\nThe second conflict brings about a lot of action. People die, swords swing, and tension ensues. The purpose of the attack is to wipe out the vampires once and for all. But, as the anime shows, that is all a lie. The attack is nothing more than a sacrifice. In other words, the battling is just the myriad of characters and soldiers stalling for time \u2013 they are fighting for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThis conflict is hurt further by the audience knowing nothing of the situation. The audience learns next to nothing about the vampire society. The audience learns next to nothing about the behind-the-scenes deception of the vampires and the humans. The audience learns next to nothing about the more otherworldly aspects \u2013 namely the angels and demons.\\n\\n\r\nThe third conflict revolves around getting Guren back after he gets captured. Yu being Yu, he decides to bring the fight to the vampires to save Guren, a man he considers part of his family. The resulting failure of the rescue \u2013 the attempt meant, in the end, nothing \u2013 is certainly an asinine development. But it is the later betrayal of Guren (regardless of whether he is in control or not) that turn his speeches on camaraderie and family into nothing. Plus, Guren ending up back with the humans means the rescue triply meant nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth conflict is arguably the only one that means anything more than nothing. Established in the first half of the split-cour, Mika works to save Yu from the \u201cevil\u201d humans, forcing him to go to impossible lengths to save Yu. Furthermore, the conflict is the only one that exists throughout most of the season leading up to its finale in the grocery store. Mika becoming a vampire, despite fighting off the temptations for years and years, could arguably be more nothing-based drama. But this conflict, compared to the others, actually has a meaningful impact on both the characters involved.\\n\\n\r\nThe fifth and final conflict is easily the sloppiest. The angel-demon contraption has nothing in terms of context. The vampires and the humans all do nothing as the demon comes forth. Krul Tepes is (supposedly) killed off when she does almost nothing to retaliate. Kazuki does nothing to save his sister despite how much his character is built on his strong relationship with her. Yu essentially resets everything back to how it was before the contraption appeared (minus a few characters), meaning nothing important happened plot-wise.\\n\\n\r\nCollectively, the narrative does next to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nNagoya continues, for the most part, the artistic direction and actual animation that it had with its first half.\\n\\n\r\nThe background art itself still has a painting-like quality to it. While the locations tend to blend together as grays, browns, and blacks, this dreariness contributes nicely to the dreary mood of the anime. Lighting is not as much of a focus, unfortunately, causing the anime to lose an opportunity to further cast darkness over the show.\\n\\n\r\nNagoya\u2019s animated sequences are a mixed bag. Downtime does have some fluidity in eye or head movements, and there are even subtle shifts, such as Shinoa moving her hair out of the way to better hear Yu\u2019s heart or Yu scooching backward while Mika rests in his arms and bites on his neck.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the anime also includes many a battle, yet, despite the swords, axes, and pikes, the anime rarely depicts choreographed fights. As such, the battles become less flashy and more simplistic with lots of cuts or smoke. Considering that the anime touts itself as having action, having these animated sequences be so lackluster adversely affects the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are certain sequences that prove Nagoya does not always rest on its laurels. In particular, the sequence where Mika battles through a road of enemies to get to Yu involves a lot of movement, perspective, and coolness. Other sequences, like the final fight between Yu and the demon or Yu and the gang versus the top-hat vampire, while not as involved, make the anime less static than it tends to be otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the character designs remain the same as before. Shinoa, Yu, and the other humans are rather plain in design. Some have accessories like bows or glasses. Some have oddly colored hair. But generally their designs are not that intricate. The vampires are more eccentric than the humans, making the vampires\u2019 designs more unique and therefore slightly stronger.\\n\\n\r\nFor both groups, their actual outfits are decorated with buttons, medals, and other additions. Most interesting of all is the choice of color. The humans wear black attire whereas the vampires wear white. Color symbolism often dictates that black equates to evilness and white equates to goodness. Meaning, having the colors swapped between who one would usually believe the good and bad guys to be induces a subconscious muddying of morality. An idea that, while not explicit, has a presence in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Nagoya are difficult to discuss mostly because the anime refuses to properly do much with them \u2013 nothingness seeped into the characters, too.\\n\\n\r\nOut of the entire cast, only two characters receive adequate attention: Mika and Guren.\\n\\n\r\nMika continues mostly where he left off. The vampires dislike or toy with him, he hates humans, and all he thinks about is Yu \u2013 and blood. His refusal to fully turn himself into a vampire by consuming human blood (he has satiated his thirst through Krul Tepes\u2019s blood all this time) begins to consume him, and it is this consumption that Nagoya focuses on with his character for about three-fourths of the season. His inability to control himself, his anger at himself for his urges, and his conflicting feelings towards humans.\\n\\n\r\nAll the while, he never stops thinking about Yu. His actions always revolve around finding or helping Yu and not disappointing him (by becoming the very creature that Yu hates). Consequently, in what is perhaps the anime\u2019s smartest bit of writing, he and Yu finally reunite when Mika is at his most desperate. I.e., Mika\u2019s thirst for blood and Yu reach an apex.\\n\\n\r\nYu, valuing family above all else (more on this shortly), gives Mika exactly what he wants: himself. Yu shares a private moment with Mika, he gives Mika his blood, and he reassures Mika that Mika will always be family to him \u2013 vampire or otherwise. The moment is nice, signifying development of Mika\u2019s character. Afterwards, Mika still has trouble trusting humans, but he at least comes around for Shinoa and the others, turning him into the best character that Nagoya has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nGuren is the other prominent character. Outwardly, he is a jerk, a rude and arrogant dude. Inwardly, he cares deeply for his squad mates \u2013 perhaps more so than anyone else.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the season, he leads, he falls, and he \u201cbetrays.\u201d Quotes because it technically is not his fault. His weapon had been implied to be difficult to control due to the strength of the spirit possessing it and Guren\u2019s love for said spirit. (Shinoa\u2019s older sister in both cases.) So him succumbing to temptation is not completely out of the question.\\n\\n\r\nThe real problem with the betrayal is that it (like the story) does next to nothing. Yes, Guren\u2019s tears while in his possessed form indicate that his true self hates the kin-killing monster he becomes. But it serves little purpose. His actions do not drastically affect the outcome of the season. He does not confront major players besides Yu who, in response, just spouts even more dialogue on family. And, most importantly, Guren\u2019s betrayal does nothing for himself. The betrayal (and, indeed, the whole season) does not provide growth for his character whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Guren is humanized through a flashback involving him and Yu. He compares himself to Yu, encouraging him, advising him to live and push on until the day he can fight for the one who needs his help. Shinya, seemingly his best friend, also humanizes Guren indirectly: Guren wholly trusts Shinya, counting on Shinya to save everyone in his stead and proving how good a friend Guren can be. These instances make up for some of the improper handling of his character but not all of it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, due to the focus on Mika and Guren (and the focus on a story that does nothing), the rest of the cast is forgotten about. Deeply forgotten about. And that is putting it lightly.\\n\\n\r\nYu starts to leave his him-against-the-world mentality, relying more on his comrades and acting more friendly towards them. However, he still spouts the same dialogue about family over and over. He is certainly consistent in his ideals which deserves a small amount of praise, but he repeats the same thoughts on family ad nauseam, turning him into an annoyance rather than a worthwhile character. He does seem to gain some control of his powers near the end of the season, but, because the angel and demon concepts had gone unexplained up to that point, his control does not make much sense.\\n\\n\r\nShinoa, arguably the most popular character of the anime, loses her edge. In an attempt to mold her into a more serious, reliable leader, the anime cuts down on her smug, snarky attitude \u2013 her defining trait. The tradeoff, not surprisingly, failing to work. As a leader, she gets her group into horrible situations and even causes issues (and deaths) for others based on her decisions. And because her smugness heavily disappears, so does her intrigue. And despite her older sister gaining (a minimal amount of) relativity, Shinoa\u2019s overall importance to the anime diminishes.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main group \u2013 Mitsuba, Kimizuki, and Yoichi \u2013 are painfully forgotten about. Mitsuba has an older sister that seems to be working for the evil humans, but, similar to Shinoa, that relationship is not expounded on. Kimizuki gets a small moment near the end of the season where his beloved sister, the girl who his entire character revolves around, is subjected to horrific treatment. But when he is thwarted with a single sword stab and when he chooses to abandon his sister without putting up much of a fight, Kimizuki becomes more of a joke than a person. As for Yoichi, he may as well not even exist for how much the anime ignored him.\\n\\n\r\nEverybody else cannot be discussed because they are even less prevalent than these three. And as far as themes are concerned, the obvious one is family. Different aspects of family are shown as the season goes on. Yu proves how far people are willing to go for their family when he throws himself into the fray. The commander of the humans proves what happens when one does not care about family. And the notion that family means more than shared blood rings throughout the season. The anime does not explore family on the vampire side, so the theme itself is not as strong as it could have been, but the theme is explored to some overall extent nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nA less obvious theme is that of temptation. Vampires are tempted by blood, and humans are tempted by freedom. But the theme is more nuanced than that. Mika is tempted (indirectly) by Yu. Guren is tempted by his weapon. Yu is tempted by family. For many of the characters, the prospect of attaining their desires drives them forward. To be fair, the theme itself has no outright exploration, but, since the angel-and-demon backdrop exists, the theme of sin \u2013 temptation and greed go hand-in-hand \u2013 cannot be ignored.\\n\\n\r\nDoes Mika, Guren, and some themes make up for the incredible amount of other problems the cast have?\\n\\n\r\nBarely. Just barely.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track of Nagoya has to be talked about first because of how poor it is. The tone, especially in the beginning, is overly optimistic. As such, it contrasts too much with the dreary mood that the rest of the anime steeps itself in. The song also does not do the vocalist justice. She is either forced to sing in a standard, almost conversational tone or forced to strain for specific notes. The only interesting part of the piece is the otherworldly sound-effect that seems as though it is produced by dropping a piece of metal in an icy cavern. But (obviously) that is not enough to make the OP even remotely worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track, however, is a lot stronger. The beginning and middle adopt a captivating tone that is simultaneously chilling and beautiful. Varying the pace of the piece also furthers the song\u2019s complexity which in turn furthers its strength. This time, the vocalist can flex her prowess, matching the song\u2019s highs and lows, quicks and slows. The ending lyric is a bit silly \u2013 a \u201cTrick Star\u201d does not make much sense in the context of the anime let alone in real life \u2013 but, overall, the ED stands as a nice addition to Nagoya.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack (expectedly) uses the same kind of music that the first half used. Most of the tracks are filled with drums, triumph, and ominous sound-effects, setting the atmosphere in a manner that befits the oft soldierly show. None of the tracks are particularly noteworthy, however, so they remain as simple additions rather than praiseworthy ones.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting sees a similar fate. Saori Hayami\u2019s feminine voice for Shinoa is still attractive to hear. Miyu Irino as Yu can be a bit grating when he starts pouting or yelling. And Kenichi Suzumura as Crowley coats his words with a childish lilt. The only above average performance comes from Kensho Ono as Mika for the struggle and pain one can hear in his voice.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis type of show, where the characters are in danger of being killed off or maimed or otherwise needing help, usually gets me. I have to know if the characters are going to be all right because I just do not like being kept in the dark about their safety. And so, I found myself being pulled along by this one.\\n\\n\r\nBut that was the only trait keeping me interested. I was not a fan of any of the characters. Yu was too annoying; Mika was even more so. Mitsuba, Kimizuki, and Yoichi were barely relevant. Guren was too much of a jerk, and the other vampires were either too arrogant to root for or too lame to take seriously. And since Shinoa lost a lot of her smug, she too was not as fun to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe action as well was uninteresting. None of the fights were cool or memorable. In fact, a lot of them blended together, especially when Yu and the humans almost never seemed to win or even succeed in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s comedic moments were sparse. The anime\u2019s drama was not gripping. The anime\u2019s romance could have been more pronounced. I was simply not entertained by the vast majority of what the anime set out to do.\\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen has a slew of issues. The story does nothing, the characters are forgotten about, the animation is par for the course, the music likewise so, and, as a whole, it fails to entertain. Family may be forever, but, thankfully, this anime is not.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, so much nothing in the narrative it hurts\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, nice background art, okay character designs, and about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, themes on family and temptation surround Mika, Guren, and a spectacularly awful rest of the cast\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, the safety of the characters was the only enticing part\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen this is a rare example of a perfectly mediocre anime. Flawlessly bland, exquisitely insipid, wholly vapid. Watching  Owari No Seraph is like eating air, there is simply no taste, good or bad. \r\nOwari No Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen is the uninspired continuation of an anime that should never have been made. \r\nStory: \r\nLets recap. A mysterious virus wipes out most of humanity and vampires come out of the woodwork to wage war on the surviving humans. Yu, our cliche shounen, hotheaded/immature/cocky/must-protect-everyone protagonist, has joined humanity's army to fight the vampires. He really really hates vampires for killing his childhood friends. He reallyreally wants to protect his friends too. The second half starts after he unleashes his mysterious superpowers on the vampires about to kill his comrades.  \\n\\n\r\nAs with so many mediocre anime, the premise itself is neither novel nor self-evidently atrocious.\\n\r\nThe product is simply a sand-flavored cake.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSlow pace/shitty action:\\n\r\nThere are a few identifiable things that contribute to ONS' mediocrity. The pacing is mind-numbingly slow. Most of the fight scenes in the show are related to training/testing of some sort. Learning to unlock your sword's potential, fighting your own weapon's demonic spirit, getting tested by the higher ups, learning to fight as a team, etc. The actual action scenes, what few there are, are usually pointless or indecisive.\\n\\n\r\nConvoluted storyline:\\n\r\nThe agendas of the humans and vampires are not well developed. The leadership and structure of the two factions are left nebulous and simple questions like why the two factions are fighting? why the vampires are so sadistic? What is a demon in relation to a vampire? etc are not explained. At times ONS try to draw clumsy moral parallels between the humans and vampires but it's just too messy and blurry to have any impact.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre\\n\r\nSound: Mediocre\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are poorly fleshed out and easily forgettable. They will make predictable decisions then inexplicably decide to trust their mortal enemy for no reason. \\n\r\nIn the background of the almost completely absent character development is the homoerotic attraction between Mika and Yu. I'm still trying to wrap my head around how that fits in (no pun intended). I think the core problem is that both characters are just too underdeveloped for me to know where their bond is coming from. They are \"family\" but then Mika looks like he wants to bone Yu. Yu seems to act differently when he's around Mika. The male vampires are all pretty androgynous and the act of drinking blood is unsubtly sexualized. Then there's that strong pederasty vibe between Ferid and Mika... I dunno...whatever. \\n\\n\r\nTo say that the characters are flat would be an understatement. They aren't even cardboard-flat. They are 100%, eco-friendly, RECYCLED cardboard-flat. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYu: Brash, hot headed, annoying as fuck. Where have we seen that before? Oh right, everywhere. He's a cookie-cutter shounen protagonist. He will charge into battle screaming at the drop of a hat without thinking. He has two objectives--kill vampires; protect friends. There's no growth throughout the series and he is exactly the same from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nMika: Now a vampire. Struggling with his various 'urges'' you might say. I don't think it's a stretch to call his bloodlust an allegory for homosexuality but again, whatever. As a character his thought process is largely absent. Why is he siding with the vampires when they murdered his friends? If he is siding with the vampires why is he so hesitant about drinking blood/killing humans. If he is hesitant about killing humans why does he enable his friends to murder children and distrust humans so much? If being changed into a vampire has altered his thinking why does he still have such a boner for Yu? Why is he so wishy washy about everything? \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else:\\n\r\nToo many half baked characters to keep track of. For such an vacuous anime you would think there would be plenty of room to develop the side characters but not really. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Meh\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall disappointing. The last few seasons of anime have been pretty weak so I finished this out of boredom. Watch only if you are really, really bored.",

            "content": "I just finished watching Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya which is the second season of the show. I said I would review it and here it is. So are my problems with the characters fixed? Does the second season improve all of the first season\u2019s flaws? Let\u2019s find out!\r\n(If you have not seen the show yet I suggest you do so or at least watch the first season since I will be talking about the ending of the first season)\r\nStory:\r\nThe second season picks up right at the end of the first season with Yuuichirou fully healed and everyone going back to business asusual. That is until they find out that there is corruption in the army and are sent to Nagoya to take down a huge vampire army. The majority of episodes in this season are about the battle in Nagoya (hence the name) and that is pretty much the main plot of the second season. I would go into more since there are a lot of twists and turns in this season but I am trying not to spoil the story since I highly suggest you watch this show for yourself, although as I said I will try not to spoil anything extremely major to the plot if you are here just to know if the second season is any good. And the answer is yes. The second season is a lot better than the first in terms of overall story progression since a lot of important stuff happens in this season opposed to the first and thanks to the setting and the main plot of this season there are a lot more epic fight scenes which was lacking in the first season. So overall in terms of story this season was a big improvement over the first, although like the first it does end on a cliff-hanger which I hope gets resolved since this is a show that deserves another season or a continuation of some sort. This story needs to be continued and while you could read the manga I still think it deserves another season since if you read the manga you wouldn\u2019t get Hiroyuki Sawano\u2019s epic soundtrack or the awesome voice acting backing it up. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThankfully this season gets rid of the main problems I had with the characters Yuuichirou and Mikaela. Yuuichirou is still a stubborn and generic shounen anime protagonist but still likable, and his goals aren\u2019t mainly set on revenge but to also protect his new family and fight to defeat the vampires. Mikaela\u2019s problems are fixed as well as he takes the role of a lone wolf, undercover protagonist rather than an anti-hero as he is still set on \u2018saving\u2019 Yuuichirou but is also not on the side of the vampires as, even though he is one, he still holds hatred for them which wasn\u2019t really shown from him in the first season. Other than that all of my opinions on the other characters stay the same and not many new characters are introduced in this season which gives time for all of the old ones to be further fleshed out rather than focusing on some random new characters. Any of the new ones aren\u2019t really worth talking about although they are still likable even if they don\u2019t serve much to the plot. The only new character I will talk about is the show\u2019s newest antagonist: Kureto Hiiragi. Kureto is one of the main heads of the Imperial Demon Army and also the main source for the corruption in the army. Throughout this series you will learn to hate Kureto as some of the stuff he does is pure evil, especially in the last two episodes. Although the show still never explains what the Four Horsemen of John are or where they came from. There is something that kind of explains it but it is a spoiler and it only happens in the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFirst off, I forget to mention this in my review of season 1 but the first season has a good opening and ending and they were never songs I skipped. The same can\u2019t be said for the second season however as the opening is boring, generic and not enjoyable to listen to and the ending is plain but better than the opening. The soundtrack remains the same and it is still as epic as ever, if even more as most of the songs I like from the soundtrack only play in the second season. And every time I hear the main theme play I just can\u2019t help but smile at the epicness since it can make even a conversation about escaping between Yuuichirou and Mikaela sound like the most epic thing in the world. Definitely one of Hiroyuki Sawano\u2019s best soundtracks and one that I will be listening to a lot down the line. My main problems still remain the same however as some of the sound effects sound muffled at times and the music to midway animation sequence transition is still pretty awkward. All of the voice actors return and the actors for the new characters are on par with the others. I would expect nothing less from a Funimation dub. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nMy opinions on the animation are exactly the same as the first season since it is exactly the same. The colors really pop, the characters look really nice and Wit Studio shows that they can handle action scenes really well. My only complaint is that CGI is sometimes used, although it is never bad CGI it is still really noticeable and can break your focus during a scene when it appears. Although I don\u2019t mind CGI in anime as long as it\u2019s done well. The animation still remains to be one of the shows high points. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nOverall I thought that Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya was a definite improvement over the first season, mainly in terms of story and characters. It\u2019s a show that deserves another season or a continuation of some sorts since it feels like it\u2019s a story that you need to witness in anime form. I haven\u2019t read the manga so I wouldn\u2019t know how it compares but the awesomeness of this show, accompanied by Hiroyuki Sawano\u2019s epic soundtrack is something that made me love this show so much and I couldn\u2019t dream of witnessing this story without my favorite voice actors doing the voices or listening to the epic score in the background. That\u2019s why I am happy to give Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya the rating that it deserves.\\n\\n\r\nRating: Great \\n\r\n(My rating system is explained if you check my profiles main page. I hope you liked the review and look forward to more in the future)\\n\\n\r\nPeace out, Anime fans! \\n",

            "content": "I wish this was not a second season and a continuation of the first season making it a total of 24 episodes that I could have rated better altogether, unfortunately that was not the case. The reason for this, is that I would have had a better Overall rating than I gave for each season on it's own. After watching the first season it was understandable that the setting needed to be revealed and back stories needed to be told, etc... so I saw it to be a little slow until it got some action after 2/3 of the anime had passed. So then Irated it a 7. I'm almost done watching this second season I know I I'll be giving it a 9. There were parts where I was anxious, surprised, concerned, sad, and I even cried a little. This season gave me what I wanted and I enjoyed it very much.\\n\\n\r\nIt made me feel bad I gave the first season a 7, but that just what I felt it deserved seeing as it just ended with the god stuff happening almost to the end. So that is why I really wished it would have all been a 24 episode 1st season instead. This time, my enjoyment surely maxed out, and I was certainly not disappointed. If I had to go back and re-rate the first season knowing what would come afterward, I would have given it an 8; however, I will not because that's just how I felt it was, and having it spit up that way was not my choice. At least the first season was good enough to make me want to see this second season and I'm glad I did. \\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, here are my ratings for the following:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nWith season 1 out of the way, the progression of the story and this particular arc (battle of Nagoya) was very interesting to me, and we get to see a lot of action. It's what I was looking for in the first place, but it wouldn't have been as enjoyable without the story-telling in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThis rating has to do specifically with the animation and execution of the battle/fighting scenes since ,well, the overall art is the same as the first season. When I saw a noble vampire strike Guren, you could have felt the power and intensity from just watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThis Mika and Yuuichiro thing is my weakness. Say yes to friendships <3\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI definitely got more into this second season than I did with the first.

            "content": "Do you ever have that one anime where you feel as though there was many things going on but still feeling like there was no impact to any of it? Anime that are of the action genre often come into this dilemma. Ones that have an overarching story that tries to make it grand and epic, only to squander it by not giving much to go on. It doesn\u2019t help with a short 12-13 episode season. Considering that Owari no Seraph had a 2nd season in the same year in order to facilitate its story longer and still come off short is basically rubbing saltin the wound.\\n\\n\r\nTo go back on the first season for a bit, since I never reviewed it, my initial impression of the story was incredibly underwhelming. I thought the way it told a revenge plot involving a boy who wants to kill vampires who killed all of his friends was too simple and drab for me to take seriously. There are ways in which this could work but with Owari no Seraph\u2019s case it comes across as predictable and hamfisted with the melodrama. Not only is the story itself nothing special, but the way it is presented is all over the place. Most notably the pacing is what drags it down so low. There are many places where the plot just rushes along in order to get to the next battle scene without any semblance of exposition to tell the audience what exactly is going on. This is very apparent in the last episode of this season where the last ten minutes felt like there should\u2019ve been two more episodes to fill in to make it feel more like a seamless transition from scene to scene.\\n\\n\r\nWriting is the key point to any story as well, and Owari no Seraph has probably the most boring dialogue of any shounen anime this year. It\u2019s like the running joke in America where we think of Hollywood of just reusing cliched catchphrases we see in countless action blockbusters by putting there hand in a jar and pick whatever line is on a piece of paper. That\u2019s what it feels like for some of the lines that lean on the \u201cedgy\u201d or \u201cmelodramatic\u201d nature of Owari no Seraph. Many of the lines, even if you\u2019re watching with the worst fansubs or know a little Japanese like I do, just reek of stale dialogue writing that even a high school student with a novice level of writing composition could do better. They can range from predictable to groan inducing on many occasions.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of the characters here are of the same level as the story is in terms of quality. They all fall under the category of forgettable and flat, with the exception of one character that is the one ray of sunshine of this entire anime. The character I am referring to is the lovely sarcastic lady,  Shinoa Hiiragi. Although her character development is on par to the rest of the bland cast, her snarky demeanor and voiced wonderfully by Saori Hayami, who does her lines a cut above the rest. Without her, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve sat through all 24 episodes of season 1 and 2; in fact I would say the only reason I bothered to continue this was just to see more of Shinoa. Her presence in season 2 is just as good, albeit a little more serious than in the previous one which kind of disappointed me but I\u2019ll take whatever Shinoa I can get at this point.\\n\\n\r\nYuu proves himself to be the stereotypical edgy protagonist who shouts most of his lines and blurts out predictable vengeful lines and promises to stick with his friends lines. Admittedly, I do think Mika, Yuu\u2019s other friend who gets turned towards the vampire side, was probably the least bad out of the suck bunch in the cast. Only because he at least had a role that was kind of captivating to see where he has to battle out his friend\u2019s other friends in order to reunite with him. In fact, all three of these characters are the only ones I even remember. As much as I rag on Yuu\u2019s character, at least I can remember his name and the dumb lines he spout out. You could quiz me on the rest of the characters and I will guarantee you that I would not make more than a 20% grade percentage. This being the problem of how so little development any of them have despite being in the same armed forces as Yuu and Shinoa or the vampire clan they are fighting against. The only thing we have to go on is that they are fighting an enemy that threatens their way of life, that\u2019s about it. Whoopee.\\n\\n\r\nIt is weird to analyze the technical prowess of Owari no Seraph because I do love the artwork of the characters and even some of the backgrounds look nice to look at. However the animation is very hit or miss. No where is this more evident than in the fighting scenes where there are some episodes where the animation just takes a nose dive and seems so obvious that the animators were cutting corners, possibly due to budgeting issues or whatnot. When it isn\u2019t at such low quality, it is serviceable to the eyes and compliments the artwork. Other than the animation being a mixed bag, I genuinely love how colorful the characters look. As a matter of fact, if the characters didn\u2019t have very distinct colorful features to their hair or skin, I think my opinion of them being forgettable would be even lower than it is.\\n\\n\r\nVampires and humans battling out each other can be something fun on paper but rarely has there been any that succeed in reality. Had the writers took their time to develop the characters and story slowly for me to get a sense of the world, I think this could\u2019ve been pretty good. What I got out of Owari no Seraph after finishing its 2nd season was just the biggest meh that has ever meh this year of 2015. All I got out of it was more Shinoa fanart to gaze upon with my own eyes. At least great things can come from average places.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C-\\n",

It's very interesting and deep, but in the anime it takes quite a while to get interesting, or to get people interested in the story itself. \r\nArt style is I guess \"basic anime style\". It has some good and some bad. \r\nI really love the ost in this season. They really nailed the music in this one. \r\nBecause I am me, I always fall in love with the side characters who aren't even the main side characters. So Ionly started to really like the main characters at the end of this (second) season. I think they're great characters but the anime couldn't do them all justice with such short episodes/seasons when so much is happening. (My favorite is Shinya, so. You know.)\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall it's a good anime. It did take me like almost two seasons to get properly interested in everything (I did enjoy this and the first season, but the main reason why I continued to watch this was Shinya), but that's just because I am me and I'm weird. Might change my opinion on the overall score later, but this anime belongs to the 6-10 range.",

I will mostly comparing how things are in this season than the first season.\r\n\"More fujobait but gets way better than the first season.\"\r\nStory : 9/10\r\nIt gets way better than the first season. We got a lot more backgrounds on what's happening. The start are kinda slow and filled with daily lives of them in the main basecamp and some events to tie up the \"Yuu's awakening\" incident. The main story kicks in a few episodes later where they are sent to Nagoya for war, hence the season title. The finale was also as great as the firstseason.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\r\nThe art are as good as the first season with oily hand-drawn paintings as backgrounds, and it meshes well with the animation that used thick lines as borders. The animation also got better, no more awkward scenes like where Mika's feet gliding trough the stairs like in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\r\nSawano Hiroyuki. Also we now got fripSide for OP and Yanagi Nagi for ED, I particularly loved the ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8/10\\n\r\nNow Yuu aren't as annoying as he was in S1, he's gotten more mature somehow and doesn't yell \"I'm going to kill every vampires\" every 5 minutes anymore. Another notable improvements are Shinoa and Guren, now Shinoa got more personalities than just the smugness people praise her for. We also got a better look at Guren's personalities. Overall the Shinoa squad members' interaction are better with each other. And we also got more Mika on screen now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjyoment : 8/10\\n\r\nShonen being a shonen, the battle hype is really good, it was fun to see people hacking up other people with swords and various arms imbued with a demon. There are also a few comedy scenes which is good to break the ice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\r\ntl;dr It's better than the first season, if you didn't like the first one, you might like this one.",

If people say it's bad they are over exaggerating cause it's better than a lot of the slice of life plague or poorly put together anime adaptations of ecchi mangas. And it's certainly not an epic that everyone should watch. However, that's not to say you shouldn't watch it. \r\nIf you're a fan of action anime, this is probably your cup of tea. If you're more of a story kind of guywell then you might have to force yourself to drink the tea, but leave with the word of \"meh\" filling your mind and will probably re-evaluate your choices in tea. \\n\\n\r\nThis show got kind of hot and heavy in this second season, which is was fine and dandy. Problem is it got rushed making anyone who watches it break out into a sweat from running through the plot so fast all in one episode. The final episode just bust out all the stops and sped through probably about 3-4 episodes of material all leading up to another season which will take a while to come out.\\n\\n\r\nSo, go watch Attack on Titan because this show is basically that but with the power of friendship or family or something.",

People can straight up die when you least expect it, make gruesome sacrifices, fight desperately to their last breath, and make positively evil schemes. But all of this is what makes Seraph of the End so interesting.\r\nThe story of Seraph of the End gets more interesting in this second season as we learn a lot about Yu, meet new characters and experience shocking plot twists and meet new antagonists. I was very shocked at the character who reappeared at the last episode, and are very interested about the past of a certain Lieutenant Colonel.As always, Seraph of the End's story this second season was very good and kept me interested to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Seraph of the End continues to be superb, as always the animators over at Wit Studio are doing their best. Some scenes are amazing to watch, especially the battles. I hope Wit keeps this level of quality consistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds of Seraph of the End do their job service-ably. Whenever a certain scene would begin with a certain mood, the music would match it perfectly. I understood exactly what was being conveyed by the music, which did it's job.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this Anime continue to be interesting as we learn more about several of them, and their are one or two shocking revelations here and there. We also meet new characters, as well as witness the \"End\" of many of them. The people behind Seraph of the End's story continue to write great characters and interesting twists.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm going to give Seraph of the End a 9/10 on enjoyment and my overall score. Seraph of the End season 2 is perfectly fine for those who liked the first season, and I recommend this series for people who aren't snobs that have a stick up their ass about shounen. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

I see nearly 0 character development and all the characters in the show seem very flat and uninteresting with the exception of Shinoa and Mitsuba, having somewhat of a background worth thinking about. They all kept speaking and acting in this very obvious (sometimes obnoxious) and specific way which kept the story very uninteresting and predictable. \r\nSecondly, the plot does notmake any sense from time to time. Some characters act very unrealistically. Like, there are multiple characters who frequently keeps disobeying the commands but are yet still allowed to participate in the battle (You can guess who). You are given no sense of time elapses and the plot overall was just confusing and a big mess with major plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, I did not notice any great musical performance. The music, very much like everything else, was very generic and basic. Not bad but nothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nThe art though is very consistent but was in my opinion, very boring to look at. Very few shots with extraordinary art (If any?) and it all looked a bit childish at times so I found it hard to take some scenes seriously but that could've been that it was just me being not very fond of the art style. But as I said, no weird frames and everything looked like it was supposed to, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSo was this season worth it? Yes, if you managed to get through the first one this one is way better but still not very top notch. After reading all this I do realise it sounds like I didn't enjoy the show at all but I really did. Overall, it was good and I'd watch another season if there would come one but this isn't an anime you'd discuss for months with others.",

But there are so many plot and character holes that made me feel that i wasted my time. Also we dont have to forget that this anime series is full of cliche in both story and characters, which havent been made well. However the main problem is thatyou cant understand the true goal of the mangaka, he probably wants to explain some issues but he cant and he creates many others. In the duration of this season you expect that you are going to solve some mysteries but finally you get nothing. The holes become far deeper. Last but not least because the majority of the fans watches something for the enjoyment , personally i believe that there is no enjoyment in such a thing.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph was a good anime. It's story was good and hooked me in with the first episode. By the end of season 1 I was completely confused as to whose side to be on. Both the Vampires and he Humans sucked. I finally watched season two and finished it to see if it cleared up my confusion and it did to some extent, but still I don't like either side. \r\n(Spoiler??) Another thing that just annoyed me the whole time watching it was that Yuu and Mika didn't even get together until the 10th episode of the second season! Like wtf?! (Not countingthe very short reunion in season 1) The whole time I'm waiting for them to find each other and team up and it be all awesome but it didn't even happen. They barely fought together and it only lasted two episodes because the show ended shortly after the teamed up. \\n\\n\r\nShow ends unfinished tho which sucks but if you want to continue there is the manga so it's not so bad but I wouldn't mind a season 3 and if one came out I would definely watch it.",

            "content": "Sound 3\r\nI cannot recall anything of the music from either seasons. That's a bad sign.\r\nArt 6\r\nWhile some scenes were very nicely animated, I just don't like the character designs at all and nothing really stands out for me. \r\nThey did this thing a lot where they'd have this painted background but then the actual characters would be brightly and clearly animated in front of it. The contrast was just really jarring.\r\nAs for character designs....Ugh. The main character could not have a more generic main character design. Black spiky hair. Angry-looking most of the time. Some nice green eyes. He was just so generic, and Ihaven't even gotten to his personality yet. \\n\\n\r\nThe blonde pig-tailed girl also had a terrible character design. Every time she'd come on screen I'd shield my eyes or try to avoid looking at her. Her hair was just so disgusting....And that brings me onto the other bad parts of the character designs.\\n\\n\r\nTheir hair. All of their hair was really ugly and distracting, like the girl's hair mentioned above. Also, the brown-haired, wimpy side-kick's hair bugged me throughout the entire show. He needs a hair cut or just a shave. Please. (I also really hated how the noses were drawn with a passion.)\\n\\n\r\nThe uniforms also really bothered me. They were quite detailed for a post-apocalyptic setting, like they put most of their research budget into developing those uniforms. Also, why did all of the girls except ONE wear skirts? Why? Just why? They are doing some serious combat and yet they have skirts. It just seems absolutely illogical, especially for an anime that seemed to be trying to take itself seriously (maybe?).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1\\n\\n\r\nThat's right, characters get a nice 1. They were atrocious. The only character I liked in the ENTIRE series was Mika. And he barely showed up at all in both seasons. And on top of that he was always full of angst and rarely made sense. \\n\\n\r\nAs for all of the other characters, their personalities were so cut and paste and bland that I don't even need to touch on them, except for one.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character. While he was basically a combination of Eren Jeager, with his constant call for revenge, and Natsu Dragontail(sp?), with his obsession with family, he really bugged me as a character. He is one of the most OP main character's I've ever come across. If something is not going well for him, he usually passes out and wakes up completely rejuvenated, and also with the added bonus of forgetting most of the bad stuff that happened. He also cannot be defeated. On top of having the special black demon weapon thing or whatever it's called, he has another extra bonus that I won't spoil. But basically whenever he needed a power-up that him being special couldn't already solve, he could go to his bonus. Using his bonus should have had really bad repercussions, but in fact it was the exact opposite. He can basically do anything and never be defeated. He's not even a character...More like a nice handy tool.\\n\\n\r\nStory 1\\n\\n\r\nI am kind reviewing both seasons, but as I don't remember many of the details from season 1, I'm just going to kind of describe the situation.\\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph is what you'd get if you took the fantasies of a teenager full of angst and puberty and made it into an anime. There is no cohesion within the \"story\" and there are tons of unrealistic events. The humans are more like super-humans with their ability to survive serious injuries like large, gaping, holes in the gut and falling through four stories of building. There is absolutely no realism.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even want to dwell on how bad this story is anymore. Le'ts just say that my favorite episode of both seasons is also the one that everyone happens to make the most crack videos out of.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3\\n\\n\r\nDON'T WATCH THIS ANIME! ...unless you like crappy unrealistic fights and drama that makes little to no sense. Just shut your brain off and you'll likely enjoy it. I have a friend who is absolutely in love with this show, but then again she likes all of the anime I consider crap. It all depends on your tastes so don't take my word for it, we probably have different opinions (though probably not...don't watch this...you probably deserve better...).",

            "content": "RE POST AFTER GETTING TAKEN DOWN\r\nI watch this show like its heroin\r\nOut of all the fall/winter shows of 2015-2016, this is one of my favorites (one punch man is the other one, but lets save that for another time shall we!).\r\nI cum a bit in my pants every time i hear the theme song (I could impregnate the world with the amount of times)\r\n________________________________________________________\r\nNow lets move on to the more educated side of my argument...\r\nStory: i want to say like 9 or 10, but its kinda an 8 (8.5 tops)\r\nThe theme of the show is, \"family comes first\", for all those who didn't have thoseannoying 11th grade theme analysis essays basically the show is a battle field of pain but it is the strong bonds that the characters have to one another that allow them to have a will to go on. The good thing about this show is that it is a bit like game of thrones or the walking dead in a way that the writers don't give a shit about you and will kill off or destroy a character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMain Characters: 8 \\n\r\nBacicly ya got ya main character Yu, who the story revolves around, all connections and sub plots have to do with him. He is strong but isn't an overpowered man beast like kirito in sword art online. But the thing that make him a likable character is his will to go on, but again the writers can break this rule and give a sense of hopelessness.\\n\\n\r\nOther Characters: 10\\n\r\nThe reason I praise the writers with a glorious ten is because they stuck with the focus that this story was going to be about Yu. The rest of the characters have a just enough detail about them, that provides backstory to support their motives (however they don't hopelessly strangle out all their choices because of \"back then\"), they also now appear as people, instead of random characters that we are like \"who's is that guy\". \\n\\n\r\nOk I'm getting tired of writing about characters, Lets move on!\\n\\n\r\nAction : Fuck the system I give an eleven (that's \"11\" for those who can't read)\\n\\n\r\nThe action is a BIG part of the show. It has no weird way of fighting, but each person has a special that is well.... EPIC (ha u thought I was going to say special). And these epic moves are not just a bigger explosion caused by how much you scream certain words, Instead for example on of the main/ side characters has some kind of Bill Cosby special, as in when he opens his coffin the target is paralyzed/ fallen asleep (ok, in words that dosn't sound that cool but trust me, it be coolio).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10, it makes me orgasm (it is a soundgasm)\\n\\n\r\njust listen to it your self: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orK6WZbSaPg&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLiv4XcYJxUOpG9MBb8JzaQ-2fqwMR-S8v \\n\\n\r\nDid it make you a bit wet? (don't lie, I know that you just changed your pants)\\n\\n\\n\r\nART - 9.99999999 - it has beautiful backgrounds that look like they should be hung up in an art gallery, however the character look fantastic too but have a tiny bit of contrast with the background that makes them seem a bit like the animation from south park.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT IS OVER 9000\\n\\n\r\nI love this show and will continue binge watching it to make up for my shit life. \\n\\n\r\n:) \\n",

            "content": "******************Spoilers(kinda, not really)***********************\r\n**************************************************************\r\n  Now that you have been properly warned, we can continue. Ill start off by saying that I don't usually write reviews for anime, or really any other type of media that I find enjoyment in unless I really have something to say about it. Well, this is one of those anime that I want to say something about. Now, what I want to say is not necessarily bad, I enjoyed watching this, and I would recommend it to any one who wants something quick to watch in the dry seasons.\r\n***************************ART(8)********************************\r\n  The art was pretty good, I liked it a lot,it wasn't fresh and new like a big budget triple A anime, it was gritty, and it really fit the idea of the story well. The characters looked good, and the fighting and the weapons were pretty cool as well.\\n\r\n**************************SOUND(7+)***************************\\n\r\n  To be completely honest I didn't pay much attention to the music like I usually do, but when I did sit back to listen to the intros, or the music in the Anime I enjoyed it. The sound design on the other hand I did pay some attention to and I liked it, I liked how you could here the trailing and echoing of the characters voices in a room, and the monsters sounded pretty cool too. The character voice acting (SUBBED) was pretty good as well.\\n\r\n*************************CHARACTERS(6+)**********************\\n\r\n  The characters were fine, they served their purposes well, and for the most part I enjoyed them. Yu's character development from the first season was a difficult slope, that at time, he would revert back to his more immature state with a lot of (family this, and family that, and \"he stabbed me but ill be fine cuz family\") but for the most part he did mature throughout the anime. Yu was really the only character with major development, most of the other characters stayed relatively static. The reason I don't rate them higher, or go to far in depth with them is because of my next reason.\\n\r\n*****************************STORY(IDK)***********************\\n\r\n  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know how I feel about this story. Do you want to know why I don't know? BECAUSE WHERE THE FUCKS THE REST OF IT? THATS WHY. There was just so much unanswered, there was so much started and never finished, they were still introducing characters towards the end of the second season, like the Guren look alike, and the entire Hiragi family outside of Shinoa, ok that one was closer to the beginning of the second season, but the ratio of story/plot/idea to episode  made the second season (feel) incredibly short. The producers of this anime could have milked this idea for days, they could have easily made a 3rd even a 4th season with what they were given, but no, it was rushed towards the end leaving a lot unexplained. Like what happened between the romance of Shinoa and Yu? What happened to Yu trying to change Mika back to a human, what Happened to Kimizuki's sister and how did she become the (SPOILERS) angle.  Now before anyone corrects me, I know there's a manga and I bet reading it would answer 91% of my questions but Im not talking about the manga. Another thing that bothered me about this story was the producers use of our old friend \"Deus ex machina\". An example would be(spoilers) in the later part of season two, Mika, after getting fucked up by the Demon army, saves Yu, and runs away from the fight, and even further away from the final plot location. And in a tense situation at said final plot area, look who shows up, arriving on the 9:30 Deus EXpress? Mika, Yu, and Guren, who previously was captured and injured. Another example would be Yu's several attempts at suicide, and every single time he was rushed to Saint Jude's ex machina children's hospital and saved for the next episode.\\n\r\n************************ENJOYMENT(8)**************************\\n\r\n  Aside from all this nit-pickey shit, I enjoyed this anime, it was something I looked forward to see on the weekend, and I plan to watch the OVA when it comes out. And if your reading this review I highly recommend watching it, its something fine to add to you collection of finished episodes, and it can be used to fill up any dry season... I even have a few desktop backgrounds ^.^\\n\r\n**************************OVERALL*****************************\\n\r\n  :)",

            "content": "-This is a review of both seasons of Owari no Seraph-\r\nThe tenacity of the human race is a topic often tackled in all sorts of mediums, and generally, humans are shown to be these cockroach like creatures which survive can survive any sort of catastrophe. We have seen post-apocalyptic world before not just in anime with shows like Shinsekai Yori but also in other mediums and if the Fallout franchise\u2019s popularity is any indication a lot of people, myself included, love post-apocalyptic settings for their fictional worlds.\r\nAs part of the Monthly Anime Club\u2019s \u201c24+ episode\u201d anime month I have been recommended the 2015 two couranime Owari no Seraph; an anime which tries, like many works before it, to show us just how the human race would behave if it was driven into a corner by some threat. This time the threat is, of all things, vampires.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of Owari no Seraph vampires aren\u2019t what you might be used to up until now; creatures which lurk in the shadows, fearing the sun and anything holy who only come out at night to feed on human blood. No, in Owari no Seraph our vampires got major buffs in that they are now immune to anything but special cursed weapons plus the really strong ones are one man armies who can destroy buildings in one sword swing. They still need to drink blood however and do have that weakness against those pesky cursed weapons.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Yuuichiro Hyakuya, is an orphan who has been captured by the vampires at a young age along with the other children from the orphanage, the most important of which is Mikaela Hyakuya, but we\u2019ll get to him later.\\n\r\nThis show still being very much a show aimed at young boys has our main character portrayed as a friend-loving dumbass has is a special snowflake that can even disobey military orders without being court-martialed. He is a shounen protagonist through and through and if you\u2019ve seen Blue Exorcist, he is most similar to Rin from that show.\\n\\n\r\nNext up we have Yuu\u2019s squad commander Shinoa Hiiragi. Shinoa is the only character who I think was in any way shape or form likeable, the others just left a lukewarm taste in my mouth. Shinoa is this show\u2019s \u201ctease\u201d character, by that I mean she loves to poke fun at anything our protagonist does and generally lights up the mood with her jokes.  I don\u2019t usually praise voice acting in Japanese dubs because, well, I don\u2019t speak Japanese but this time I do have to give some props to Shinoa\u2019s voice actor for really selling the character.\\n\\n\r\nYuu\u2019s squad consists of three more people, none of which get enough development and are just there because we need more archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly we have  Kimizuki who is this show\u2019s rival character and resident four-eyed good-at-everything badass. His purpose in the show is to be that one character who always clashes with the main protagonist but not in a bad way, just in a friendly rivalry sort of way. All shounens need one of these. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, we have our friendly neighbourhood wimp who fittingly enters the scene by getting bullied and \u201csaved\u201d by our main character. His purpose in the show is to always be better than the others when in comes to handling this shows \u201cmagic\u201d, the demonic Infernal Arms. He also likes to cry a lot and hug people.\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, we have our tsundere loli with an attitude problem. Oddly enough, the show seems to want to expand on her character more with a few scenes that at first seems to be building up into something bigger but nothing happens in the end. I guess they didn\u2019t want her to get more time than main-girl Shinoa.\\n\\n\r\nIt may seem like I am way too harsh and dismissive of these characters but there\u2019s honestly not a lot to talk about with them. They all have a single motive, a single bad memory of the past that drives them to join the army and hunt vampires.\\n\\n\r\nWhile we are on the topic of vampires let\u2019s talk about this shows Suzaku Kururugi; Mikaela Hyakuya. That one line should say most of what is to say about his character, he was once friends with the main character, now they are on different sides and they clash a few times. Though the relationship doesn\u2019t end like Suzaku\u2019s and Lelouch\u2019s, with Mikaela and Yuu having strong feelings for each other, feelings strong enough to make any fujoshi get nosebleeds.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also tries to whos both sides of the story as neutraly as it can but, oddly enough, it ends up portraying the vampires in a better light that the humans. It could also be that this was the intention since there is a lot of talk in the show about how bad and evil humans are and how good and pure vampires are. Even the clothing of the two parties shows hints of this with the vampires having pure white robes while the humans fight in black. Usually it would be the other way around. The humans are also not helped by the fact that their main weapons for fighting off vampires are contracts with demons which reside in powerful weapons.\\n\\n\r\nSince this show is a show about a war between two factions death should be inevitable, right? Not if you are part of the main gang. The main characters in this show must be wearing some extra strength plot armour because even though they, and when I say they I mostly mean Yuu, get situations which would kill other humans ten times over they get magically saved by something or other. This aspect of the show is especially aggravating since the main characters get constantly told that death is inevitable and that they should watch each other backs or otherwise they will get destroyed, but even when they make some huge mistake they aren\u2019t punished for it in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Owari no Seraph is actually really good with certain fight scenes being particularly well done, even if they cheat and use CG. Even so, the use of CG in the show is kept to a minimum and when it is used it is mostly unnoticeable.\\n\r\nThe personality of the show really comes from the colours chosen and the character designs. The colours for the characters uniforms and hair combining bright green with pastel colours and black and the predominantly grey and brown backgrounds manage to give this show a pretty unique look which not many shows manage to achieve. The design for character\u2019s eyes, in particular, is also rather unique, if I had to compare it to some other show I\u2019d say it\u2019s a more polished version of Shiki\u2019s eye design. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show does stick out from the crowd in the art and animation department, in the sound department it\u2019s not doing so hot. Out of all the openings and endings, only the last ending really stood out as something I might listen to without having the show as a support. Besides the endings and openings some of the shows songs combine orchestra music with synthetic beats which, in my opinion, is not a good combination. Though when the songs are good they can really add to the scene such as with the a song simply titled 108. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts\\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph is a show that I have been looking forward to watching but never really got around to. Now that I have seen it however, I am a little disappointed. The show could have done much more with its premise if only it had strayed away from a lot of the shounen tropes it is plagued by. It might be an enjoyable watch if you don\u2019t mind special snowflake main characters and plot armour almost as thick as Kirito\u2019s from SAO but for me this show only managed to keep me entertained enough to make me want to finish it. As much as I liked the animation and Shinoa this show is definitely not for me.\\n",

            "content": "Seraph of the End really did not get off on the right foot when it first arrived on the scene, did it? I mean when the premise of your show revolves around vampires ruling the world and massacring everyone you hold dear, the last thing you want to see in said world is a fucking high school. And yet somehow, that wasn't the worst problem to befall the series. Wit Studio has never been good at managing budget - which is fair considering they're still new and all - but even by their standards, Seraph of the End looked like complete ass. I'm not sureif it was fixed in the blu-ray, but the first cour was riddled with production problems that made the incredibly bland writing even blander, along with making Durarara!!x2 Shou look like it was animated by Madhouse on a good day. Awful character movement. Action scenes consisting of nothing but stills. Devoting entire episodes to generic \"friendship is everything\" bullshit. It'd be hilarious if it wasn't killing the show's pacing in the process.\\n\\n\r\nSo it was some trepidation that I watched Battle in Nagoya but apparently the studio had just been cured of a disease in-between cours because there's absolutely no production issues in the show whatsoever (or at least none that's really noticeable). The action scenes are consistently fluid for the most part and the pacing, whilst still taking a little too long to get places at times, actually gives off a feeling of stuff actually happening. Said feeling hit a speed bump when the show ends on yet another cliffhanger with little manga material to make a third season in the near future but hey, points for actually getting me somewhat into this series this time.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to bother recapping the plot since this is a second cour and you'd only care if you watched the first one, so let's just say that after Yu and Mika had their long-awaited gay reunion, ending with the former awakening to hilariously inaccurate monstrous powers that couldn't hit the broadside of a barn, the vampires and the anti-vampire military gear up for another war and Yu's squad leave their high school roots in order to train with the big boys. But as was hinted at the cliffhanger at the end of the first cour, said military isn't exactly the most pacifistic people on the planet, and unlike the military in Attack on Titan, they're not exactly open about it. As such, a lot of internal strife occurs whilst we wait for the two sides to clash, and it's not like the vampire side consists solely of BFFs either given how Mika still refuses to drink blood.\\n\\n\r\nI have a sneaking feeling that Wit Studio randomly came across the manga one day, noticed how similar it was to Attack on Titan, and that was all they needed to pick it up for adaptation, because Battle in Nagoya borrows a lot of plot points from that show and the director does his damn best to capture Araki's theatrical bombast whenever he can, what with the dramatic shoutings in regards to squad members whining about how they're all a family and the fight scenes themselves going for epic brutality. Although Seraph of the End's homosexual coupling of Yu and Mika brings Sunrise more to my attention given how much BL material always seems to make it into their stuff, right down to having an anime named after it. And good god does the show double down on the BL when the two finally meet again. Remember in Tokyo Ghoul how there was this human girl who was willing to let some of her flesh get eaten if it meant her ghoul boyfriend can stay alive? Well guess what Yu's solution is to keep Mika alive when he realizes that he can't survive without blood?\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Mika, he was always a bit of a whiner in regards to his best friend, but whilst he never becomes the male version of Yuno Gasai, his feelings for Yu border on the obsession here. You guys know about the Bechdel Test? Well replace \"women\" with \"Yu\" and Mika would fail it within the first fucking syllable of whatever sentence he speaks. And that's not even getting into the fact that he makes it very clear that anyone who's not Yu can die in a ditch, which Yu obviously has problems with given that he's still an incredibly generic protagonist who fights for his friends and will trust them even when they stab him in the back.\\n\\n\r\nMika's growing problems and Yu's lack of growth aside, I actually found the characters more engaging in this iteration, particularly Shinoa - who was more a snarky comic relief character in the first season, but mostly has to rely on using that personality as a defense mechanism now that shit has gone serious and the importance of her family name is afflicting one of her squad members. Most of them are still simplistically written and all, mostly acting as Yu's cheerleaders with the only real story being given to Shiho at the very end when it's revealed what happens to his sister, but since they're not given any more focus than necessary this time around, it's not hard to tolerate them. I'm not sure what the common consensus is for Guren himself, but whilst his story does make him more interesting, it's also incredibly predictable and I found myself really unable to care for the chemistry that Yu seems to have with him. Did he really help the kid that much to the point that Yu would sacrifice his life for him as much as his friends and Mika? I can't seem to recall anything in particular.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, whilst the execution is better, the core of Seraph is still about as substantial as Mac in Cheese without any salt or pepper put into it. The structure is the same as the first cour in that the first half or so is dedicated to building our protagonists up and the second cour is when things come to a clash before ending on a cliffhanger. And no amount of people dying bloody deaths along with the overall theatrical presentation can make me overlook the fact that the show doesn't put enough spins on its genre cliches to make that structure stand out in any way, unless you count what ultimately becomes of Yu's squad when Mika throws a wrench into the whole \"all vampires are evil\" way of thinking as fresh. It certainly opens the way to something fresh, as (spoilers) I've never seen a shonen action anime cast our protagonists as fugitives, Deathly Hallows-style, before. But that's at the very end, and everything prior to that is just a bunch of flamboyancy taken seriously so that it's kind of funny at times, but ultimately it's not doing anything new that you haven't seen before in vampire fiction (current or old). It's like a less stupid but still nothing \"must see\" version of that Let Me In film.\\n\\n\r\nSo whilst I can recommend Battle in Nagoya with much less reservations than the first Seraph, I think you guys are better off waiting for the Attack on Titan sequel...whenever that shows up.",

            "content": "As adaptations go, OwaSeri S2 has proven to be somewhat of a disappointment especially since I was awfully hyped for it. For newbies pondering on whether to pick this up, I strongly recommend you read the manga first, which has in my opinion much higher quality art, not to mention actual plot explanations which for some reason the anime has conveniently shaved off, understandably culminating in viewers new to the franchise writing it off as plotless and pointless. Only with an actual understanding of what the hell is actually going on will you be able to even begin to enjoy the anime for its lovelyanimation and superb soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nGoing into the second season of Owari no Seraph, I was afraid that the producers would pull another Fullmetal Alchemist and deviate completely from the manga's plotline. While they appear to have avoided such a catastrophe in the larger picture, they have also completely eradicated the nuances in the manga indicative of character growth and replaced them with scenes undoubtedly meant to pander to the likes of various shippers. Similarly, emotional scenes which most left an impact while reading have either completely disappeared or been redrawn in a manner that makes it nigh impossible to refute any judgements of predictability or cliche that this current season 2 has drawn. I've got my own ships and biases (YES, mika/yuu; guren/shinya) but still the manner in which these relationships were portrayed ... was just bad. Cringe-worthy- I say this as a shipper.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode overtakes the manga (at least the eng subbed version) so I understand and echo the confusion that arises from the sudden appearance of many GIANT plotholes; I'm hoping the manga will provide a comprehensive answer to my questions... then again, if we're talking about OwaSeri S2 as an anime in its own right, it shouldn't have to lean on its manga for quality plot and should (but has failed) to stand alone in this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, those new to the entire OnS franchise should give the anime a miss; delve straight into the manga and if it's enough to make you a fan come back to watch your favourite scenes being animated.",

It has everything to keep you occupied for a couple of hours but sadly not much else. \r\nStory is pretty dumb. It is just there to justify the characters movement across the screen. We have a lot of angst and pump up drama \u2013 teen with anger issues and so on. Nothing out of ordinary! Most of the mainstream anime titles are like this. The good thing is that the apocalyptic scenery is constantly been overlapped by clich\u00e9s such as school life, friendship and snippy remarks which makes the whole thing hilarious!For that help a lot the smugdere \u2013 Shinoa and here we go to the second point:\\n\r\nCharacters: Again nothing special. Overused archetypes and MC is fucked up emo shit but still their conversations are entertaining and cute at times. Not to mention the smugdere queen ;)\\n\r\nMusic: It is over average. It is not the best Sawano  work out there but it has more than enough good tracks. Especially in season two. OP/ED were nice as well. \\n\r\nArt/ character designs: Well good over all but not the greatest. The backgrounds were interesting but not used optimally much of the time. The characters are mostly bishies and bishoujos so no complains there.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For me it was entertaining enough. I don`t look for the deeper meaning so I was more than happy with what I got. \\n\r\nSpecial note: Shounen ai vibes during the anime. Yep! One of the things I found hilarious! Especially the comments afterwards LOL. Come on! A few longing face expressions haven`t killed anyone. Don`t make it such a big deal ;)\\n\r\nOverall: I like it but won`t watch it a second  time. \\n\r\nStory \u2013 5\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 7\\n\r\nMusic \u2013 8\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 9\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 7,2\\n",

The episodes leading up the ending genuinely scared me.  Seriously.\r\nSo, I'm believing the plot was basically all leading up to this, all of the experimentation on humans.  I never really did believe that the humans and vampires were doing human experimentation until the episode they actually showed one of the 'test subjects.' I thought it was all a lie for Mika to get Yuu to come with him.  Little didI know he was telling the truth, which was honestly very surprising for me, which led me to getting scared.  So, at the end of episode 12, it shows our new protagonists, Yuu; Mika; Shinoa; Kimizuki; Narumi; Yoichi; and Mitsuba. They are currently running from the humans and the vampires, doing their own thing, which is what Mika always wanted so yay for Mika!\\n\\n\r\nHere's my actual review for the anime! :\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning, I honestly very much liked this anime.  It used to be one of my favorites.  That was before I realized how very terrifying this actually was.  It reminds of a lot of giant Western franchises, as well, which is why I ranked it just a tad bit lower, ONLY because it might've just been a coincidence that this reminds me of so many things.\\n\\n\r\nThe story actually wasn't that bad in the beginning (TT^TT), though it was meant to take this dark turn, which wasn't really that dark, considering some things.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf I had actually watched this in HD (no, I don't use illegal streaming sites, or free streaming sites), it would've been AMAZING.  But to me it just looked like your average anime.  The animation, however, is amazing and must've been very hard to pull off, with Yuu transforming into the Seraph of the End, and the way some of the weapons have very unique textures and forming sequences. Overall, pretty awesome.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI always rate anime sounds high. :/ \\n\r\nThe music is amazing, reminds of when Sword Art Online was actually good.  But it doesn't remind me that much of it, which is amazing.  It also gives me a very nice vibe of uniqueness that is very hard to pull off.  The voice acting was amazing as well, which is NOT expected from what I was guessing it to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are three basic supernatural your character can be.  Human, vampire, or demon.  Pretty cliche unhumanly types, vampire and demon.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is there, it's just that you can get so much into the anime that you can't notice it, or you DO notice it because Yuu keeps saying \"I'm much stronger than before! ;)\"  Other than that, you can notice that there is a lot of character development, but it's not very interesting, just in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 4/10\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for the first season was way different, due to the fact I kinda... watched it in a day.  But for this season, I just watched because \\n\r\n1. cliffhanger\\n\r\n2. the community\\n\r\n3. the constant build-up of hype for the second season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would score this anime a 5, maybe a 5.5, still deciding whether or not I'll have nightmares.",

            "content": "Ah, Shonuen.  For most, it's the gateway genre into anime as beating the shit out of people through epic action sequences with swords, magic, what have you is quite amusing to many, and the power of friendship or something like that is also quite fun to watch, apparently.  But then you have series that just...sort of push the envelope on what they want to do and it just sort of...falls flat.\r\nStory: Picking up from where the first season of Owari no Seraph ended off, Nagoya, as I'll call this second season continues our adventures of our merry family of vampire killers as theycome across more secrets, more vampires, and well...a lot of spare blood dying.  \\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph has a very glaring issue when it comes to storytelling, and that is balance.  Like the season before it, Nagoya focuses heavily on the 'bonds' between the members of the main cast and their bond together as 'family.'  Now, as a concept, this would be ok, since most shonuen have this kind of concept to their storyline since most protagonists feel they need to SAVE EVERYONE or what have you.  But in Owari's case, they really shove it down your throat.  You can't really go five minutes in the show without someone shouting out either the word family or alluding to it, and it's just irritating.  They focus so much on these bland characters and their 'connection as a family' that the show as a whole takes a nosedive in quality because they try to make us care about them more so than the actual plot of the show, thus bringing me to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of Owari no Seraph is decently crafted.  Contrary to the first season, we get answers.  Not many answers mind you, but answers.  As such, the plot and what is happening does start to make some sense, and I genuinely think that the way this world was made is actually interesting.  But because the show puts so much focus on the people of the show and not so much as to what is happening, the show really suffers since it's not really able to expressively give itself out as a story while it has these half-assed characters drag itself down with it.  (Seriously though, the concept of the seraphs, demons, vampires, etc is all really interesting.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have one of the bigger issues aside from its bullshit family motif, the pacing.  The pacing of the show is subpar at best.  At time, it really drags itself out, while other times, it rushes itself a lot.  For the most part, these pacing issues occur during the 'character' and the 'plot' parts respectively since, as I've mentioned before, the show puts more focus on its characters rather than its plot.  In the end, we got a lot of possibly great storytelling with a lot of not so great parts in between it.  Especially since the last episode had so much, but was a horrible end because they rushed it to all hell without any explanation and essentially set up a season 3.  (Wit Studio, plz.  Don't do this.)  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good World (Honestly, the world that this show is in is quite interesting)\\n\r\n-  Pacing issues\\n\r\n-  Family motif.  (It's not so much as a motif as it is a word they shove down your throat when you're watching.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh, characters.  I have quite a bone to pick with these character not only because they're bad, but because they...are...insufferable.  A good majority of them are really quite bad to the point that you don't even want to root for them.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to most second season reviews I do, I have to mention these ones again.  Yuu, as our main protagonist has shifted his role this season from an Eren clone vampire-killing maniac, to the guy who cannot go a single sentence or set of lines without mentioning the word family.  It's so bad to the extent that I cannot really describe him any other way simply because that's what he is.  He's a very one-note character with literally one character trait and he just isn't very interesting.  In fact, he is a character, is one I could not really care much about simply because he's just so insufferable at times to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Mikasa.  Now, I am a strong believer that Mika would've made a much better protagonist than Yuu did before, since his entire deal in the series was to protect the last person that he considered his family, (still insufferable, but it made more sense here) and he dealt with the conflicts of now being a vampire when he was previously human.  In this season however, he comes back more as a one-note character since his entire purpose is to \"Protect Yuu-chan.  Protect Yuu-chan!\" which really isn't all that interesting and just adds to how average the characters are.  \\n\\n\r\nOther characters in the main cast, Shinoa, Mitsuba, Kimizuki, etc, are all pretty much shafted to the side.  Guren however gets this trait that isn't ever really explained (but you can kind of infer) but really, these characters all don't change and are less important than they were made out to be in season one.  That's not to say that's a bad thing since a lot of their character traits (except Shinoa, though, she is less snarky than she was before, and that's what made her great) are intolerable to listen to or deal with at times.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the side cast, or spare blood.  Now, a lot of the characters that we are introduced to in this new season are for the most part, just fodder for the series.  A lot of them get killed and it really doesn't really tug your heartstrings.  This is mostly due to the fact that the show tries to really emphasize its 'character' half of the show but fails on account of its generally one note cast.  As such, you have a lot of deaths that really either don't matter or are made without really any explanation as to why they were killed.  (Note, what happened in the last episode.)  Another issue is the lack of antagonist motivation.  Ever villain has a motive for doing what they do, but in this case, the show doesn't really have much explanation.  Both humans and vampires have villains with their own agenda, but because the show never fully devotes itself to the actual plot of the show, these 'villainous agendas' are left quite hung up to dry and really are just stupid for the most part since what they're doing is obviously dumb when you look at what's going on.  (How do you save humanity by killing your own people?  Anyone else see the fault in logic here?)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  One note characters\\n\r\n-  Most of the main cast kinda gets shafted\\n\r\n-  Most of the cast is just spare blood for the most part\\n\r\n-  Villains have unclear motivations\\n\r\n-  Mika kinda sucks now...\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Wit Studio, Nagoya boasts the same kind of animation quality that its first season had.  Having fluid battle scenes, high quality animation, and overall very nice effects, details, and stunning backgrounds.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's not really much to say about the art because it genuinely is good, and there's really nothing bad to say.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good, high quality art\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Inversely, the sound is a bit...meh.  With its new OP made by Fripside called \"Two souls\", Nagoya has a bit of a different feel to its first OP since it's a bit more generic than its first opening.  Fripside is a good artist, as she's done OPs for other shows like Black Bullet and Railgun, but this one...just doesn't seem to cut it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED on the other hand has a more of a gospel or choir feel to it, harking back to the \"seraph\" of the show which similar to its respective OP, is a good song, but isn't really memorable or really all that special.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good songs\\n\r\n-  Not really memorable or unique\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: I don't like Owari no Seraph.  As a series, I feel like it had so much potential, but falls VERY flat because it tried to make itself a character-based show, when it really should be a plot-based show because it had so much potential and so many great concepts that just were either not explained, or were rushed with little to no explanation.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI like the concept of the seraph and what it is in this series.  Lack of explanation didn't help the show, but hey, it's the concept that really intrigued me.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nPretty much...everything else.  The characters are insufferable, the concept of family is complete bullshit, the story is crap, the villains are crap, the amount of spare blood we have is stupidly large...need I say more?  If it wasn't clear enough, I personally think that Owari no Seraph is just bad.  There're far too many problems with it to make me even consider it as a half-decent series.  Also, that goddamn ferrari in episode 6.  Just...why was that even in there.  Why?\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nNo.  If you want to know anything about the series, read it.  The timeframe that this anime provides and the amount of family stuff they choke you with equated to a lackluster story and lack of explanation.  As such, a lot of the concepts that this show has is just not explained, the biggest reason as to why I say that this show is just not worth the time to watch.",

Lots of things I didn't like, but still it was a good show.\r\nGood things:\r\n1. The fighting: THE FIGHTING SCENES ARE AMAZING\r\n2. Character design and some character's secrets or development- the designs are probably my favorite part. also some characters are developed amazingly(while others are just left where they started) \r\nBad things:\r\n1. plot pacing- the plot pacing is not the same for all the episodes. There are episodes I really enjoyed and there are... well some that were solong and made me want to  stop watching. \\n\r\n2. the plan is not clear- so, in the series they have some kind of plan. \"what kind of plan?\", you may rightfully ask, well I WATCHED THE WHOLE THING AND HAVE NO IDEA.\\n\r\n3. the yu X mika ship- now, I don't have a problem with this ship or anything, but half the series focuses on this stupid romance thing and not on  the fucking plot. also the motivations for the characters are not clear at all.\\n\r\n4. inconsistencies- for example: kimizuki worries about mirai because [INSERT SPOILER HERE], but a second later is like \"nah i'll leave my sister to die nvm\"\\n\r\nyu's behavior when trying to save guren- when it's convenient for the plot he just forgets it.\\n\r\n5. protagonist syndrome- basically, yuu and mika can't die and yuu can become a demon- salt king- whatever thing hybrid and still survive and not kill any major character\\n\r\n6. plot convenience: some things just happen because yuu or plot. not really a solid reason. \\n\r\nI don't think I can count it as a point, but anytime yuu would burst through a wall or enter a battle in the middle I would just start laughing out loud.\\n\r\nStill, I thinks this anime is great.",

I find the set up fairly interesting, especially since I don't really care for vampires in general.  I really wanted to rate it a seven, but there were so many parts left unexplained, which will probably be shown in the third season... if it ever gets there.\r\nThe art was outstanding to me, and it's what I expected from Wit Studio.  Definitely, check out the Blu-Ray if you can.  The animation whileairing on tv has some bad quality, but it's still pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I thought the soundtrack was fair, I really did enjoy the English tracks on it.  I also love the first season's opening the most.  The song for the second season's ending was beautiful, even though I couldn't watch the ending since I just wanted to skip to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe major downfall of this show are the characters themselves, especially Yuu.  He is insufferable.  It's almost like the mangaka was trying to create the most annoying character, and combined every protagonist in Shonen Jump - and Kirito from SAO.  I really liked Shinoa, but the second season.  Jesus Christ.  Why would you not follow orders from your superiors when you're in a vampire apocalypse and everyone's lives are at stake?  The entire squad bothered me to no end.\\n\\n\r\nProps to Mikaela for being the best damn character in the show, though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really did enjoy the show.  I ended up binge-watching season two as soon as I finished season one on blu-ray.  It is a mediocre show, yes.  But I definitely think it's a good time waster.  If a third season does come out, I will be watching it, even if it is just for Mikaela alone.",

The first installment was dark and gloomy and showed us the pain that Yuu goes through after loosing his family. You can also see the struggle humanity has to face against the vampires, although the vampires are still immensely powerful in the second season it looses its dark touch on my option becoming more of a generic shounen anime. Never the less i enjoyed it due to it being Owari No Seraph related.\r\nThe main cast return once more so there's nothing much to say on thatend, however the relationships between them grow much more as they fight together. This on my opinion is a nice touch to the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn a whole give it a watch if you're a big fan of the series, otherwise i doubt you will enjoy it as much\\n\\n",

            "content": "We return to post-apocalyptic Japan, where years earlier, all humans over the age of 13 were killed due to a mysterious illness. Yuuichirou Hyakuya and the rest of the Shinoa squad are now full-fledged members of the Moon Demon Company, [supposedly] one of the most elite military groups in the Vampire Extermination Unit. This season focuses on the battles that take place in Nagoya, a territory that has been overrun by the vampires.\r\nOwari no Seraph first gained popularity as a less edgy version of the popular and wildly overrated anime Shingeki no Kyojin. Obviously the shows are very different, but the parallels certainly are there;some kind of supernatural threat (vampires, in this case) took over the world and wiped out a large portion of the human population. Humans survive by living inside a wall that said supernatural beings can't infiltrate. And our main character, like Eren Jaeger, is a hotheaded, ambitious teenage boy whose only goal is to defeat ALL the supernatural beings.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is one more similarity worth mentioning. Like Shingeki no Kyojin, Owari no Seraph is vastly overrated. The pilot episode of season 1 tells a compelling story of a boy who was forced to sacrifice his family in order to live and then swore revenge. It draws viewers in and elicits sympathy for the main character. However, the story quickly devolves into a vampire remix of traditional cliche shounen anime, filled with cheap asspull powerups and nakama speeches. Season 2 continues the Owari no Seraph tradition, but with even worse execution.\\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen has a few very large issues, but the biggest one in my opinion is with the plot. Even after 24 episodes, we the viewers have no idea what a seraph is, much less what a Seraph of the End is. We don't understand how demon possession works, or what the metaphysical foundation of the series is. It's never really clear what that big box in episode 11 is, nor do we ever learn what the mysterious trumpet is. Even the season finale introduces a lot of new concepts that we've never seen before. It has lots of completely new exposition, amounts SO copious it's alarming. We shouldn't be learning so much in a finale episode; we should be wrapping things up.\\n\\n\r\n(\"King of Salt,\" really? That sounds like a snarky internet blogger.)\\n\\n\r\nAs if this horrible plot and pacing weren't bad enough, the characters in Owari no Seraph are also dislikable. I had a hard time choosing which side I was cheering for, because I honestly didn't care for the humans or vampires. The only characters I moderately liked in season 1 were Ferid and Shinoa, yet both of them in season 2 lacked the quirkiness that made them so unique and lovable. The members of Shinoa's squad, which received considerable development in season 1, fade to the background in this new season, causing an unfortunate shift in focus towards Yuu and Mika.\\n\\n\r\nYuu is an impulsive, naive brat who is far too confident in his abilities and thinks his belief in \"kazoku\" (family) can trump any and all evil. Mika is a severely one-sided character who has absolutely NO personality outside of caring for Yuu. Plus, he has serious communication issues. (Really now, how hard would it have been for him to EXPLAIN why the humans were dangerous?!) The two of them make such pathetic main characters that I'm starting to wonder if they only got the spotlight to pander to fujoshis. They are both such uninteresting, unremarkable characters that the only way they can keep the audience's interest is if the audience SHIPS THEM.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the saving graces of Owari no Seraph season 1 was its music. The OP and ED were well received; however, season 2's themes don't really have the same impact. Again, the OP has a lot of yaoibait, most definitely so fujoshis on Tumblr would have something to rant about. The ED was nothing special either. And while Owari no Seraph's OST is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, season 2's soundtrack once again fails to stand out. Owari no Seraph has pretty good art, between the detailed character designs and controversial watercolor backgrounds. That said, season 2's art and animation suffered a noticeable decrease in quality at multiple times throughout the series. And with even the music and animation falling short, Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen doesn't have anything going for it, really.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it doesn't take a genius to see that Owari no Seraph was overrated from the beginning. That said, I was willing to give it multiple chances, as I have a weakness for hot vampires and good art. Unfortunately, however, Nagoya Kessen-hen was the final nail in the coffin. Unless I have a sudden change of heart or a hell of a lot of free time, I will NOT be watching any sequels that follow. The plot has deteriorated to such a point that I do not know--or CARE--what is happening. The entire story is riddled with tired shounen tropes that should have died out a long time ago. The characters aren't particularly endearing (minus Tsukki 2.0 and maybe Ferid), the music isn't that great, and the animation is unspectacular. There's nothing keeping me watching, and I kind of wish I hadn't wasted time on this season.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 3/10 \\n\r\nDo I recommend it? No.",

There are a lot of shocking and badass moments as well as crazy cliff hangers that drive you crazy and leave you just wanting to see more. I grew surprisingly attached to this series as it continued on along the season, but a matter that i couldn\u00b4t help but worry about was the plot. \r\nThe premise of the series as a whole is very interesting and quite promising, which is why it is such a pity seeing all that potential being crushed by an open ending that leavesit filled with plot holes that were never covered. All that anticipation that this series succeded to build through those amazing cliff hangers and shocking moments was never satisfyed at the end, which is equivalent to the series bitch-slapping the viewers on the face. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, if this doesn\u00b4t get a third season (which is most likely), the series wont be able to stand on itself as consistent story and would be just a bunch of cool scenes put together without any sense whatsoever because we didn\u00b4t get a full clear explanation of it all. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph is a lot like Attack on Titan. Almost to the point that it feels like the show was trying to be Attack on Titan, and perhaps this was what the producers were going for (Though you can't blame the original author who started the series before Titan hit mass popularity). That is; Owari no Seraph a messy anime that's chaotic, a plot that zips around like a cat on meth, leaves a lot of questions unanswered, has too many characters trying to be developed that it leaves all the characters only half-developed, and too many shounen tropes being blown out of proportion.But it manages to be successful and has a decent fanbase (At least in Japan) by playing on over-the-top edgy themes of humanity survival against monsters, stylish looking characters butting heads with one another, and political machinations being put everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a huge convoluted mess. Humans fighting for survival against vampires who want to use them as livestock, people making pacts with demons to gain power, rampaging monsters called Horsemen of the Apocalypse who slaughter things for unexplained reasons, mass genetic experimentation, biblical terms being thrown everywhere, angels descending down to punish everyone, and throughout it all everyone betraying one another to pursue their own agenda. All of this in one huge ball of mess and even after 24 episodes nothing is really answered or explained. The closing episode in fact can be described as an incoherent stack of legos a kid decided to make and chuck across the room where all the characters and plot crashes in a heaping mess. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this Owari no Seraph can be a decent show to watch if you don't take it seriously. If you're the type of person who needs things explained and you take anime seriously, you will hate this show. But for someone who wants to watch a Saturday cartoon on a boring weekend with \"cool\" and \"stylish\" characters shouting bombastic lines and trying to kill each other in a shounen mess, then Owari no Seraph is entertaining and even fun. It has decent animation and fights, there's quite a few clever jokes that can be funny, and a lot of the characters are likable even if they come off half-baked. You can't deny that the character designs are eye-catching, like the Demon Army in their imperial military uniform and pretty looking vampires in cape coats. It has orchestral music to go along with its edgy themes of apocalyptic world end. \\n\\n\r\nSerpah of the End is Attack on Titan that didn't hit massive popularity in the west. If it had the budget that Attack on Titan held and had a stronger beginning rather a slow and dull one it probably could have become the next big hit. Objectively though, Owari no Seraph is average and has a lot of problems trying to stay organized. It's a show you watch if you're bored and if you like themes of world end, humanity's survival, and fantasy shounen.",

The animation is poor at times.\r\nThe sound sometimes seems out of sync.\r\nBy episode 10 it is an utter snooze fest - plot lines are predictable, stupid at times because absolutely nothing made any sense.\r\nCharacters are lifeless and wooden, they took Mika's character and shit on it.\r\nWTF, where did the King of Salt come from?

So I gave the second season a watch of course~\r\nStory:\r\nThis season wasn't what I expected... But that's not necessarily a good thing. Slow when it shouldn't be, and too fast when it ought to be more deliberate! Barely any progression for one minute and changing courses the next! \r\nArt:\r\nThe same as the first season, very pretty but nothing too striking\r\nSound:\r\nThe music is appropriate for the scenarios, and the sound effects are on point and well edited\r\nCharacter:\r\nPractically no development,and the only one who truly changes I don't think everyone particularly agreed with how they went about it...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOK so it's pretty above average right? Yeah..the fighting sequences are cool and all at times. But the pacing made it more difficult than ever\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThis show is a soap opera, if you like the characters interactions it can be fun to watch, but that's about it. I had high hopes for this show... I won't be looking forward to the next season but I can't help but watch it to see what happens next o.o  \\n\\n\r\nOh well, at least there's the manga (and countless doujinshis *wink)",

            "content": "Better than the first season, but still lacking.\r\nAt least this time around they're actually doing something.  This might be a relatively short review, but here goes:\r\nOverall, I gave it a 6/10: Fair.  There were a few factors that worked really well in the series but it was held back by the two most important ones: Story and Characters.  We might as well talk about those first.\r\nCharacters: 5/10\r\nOh man are they all over the place.\r\nLtCol Guren does redeem himself a bit in this season.  He comes off a bit more as a competent commander of a special unit, whereas there were justsome actions in the first season that made him look like a joke.  That's something I just cannot get over.  One moment he's serious, and the next he's extremely immature.  It seems like the writers could not grasp a hold of the actual character.  Furthermore, they could have really done more to explain his relationship with his demon weapon.  You'll have to see it to know what I mean, but they barely covered it, leaving no effect on the audience whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nYoichi: Classic goodie-two-shoes. God I hate these worthless people.  Yoichi, during the series is portrayed as a competent squad member with high talent.  Okay, he does do a few things in combat that makes him not completely suck, but he's such a bland character that lacks strength and doesn't really have an emphasized level of intelligence either.  His only redeeming quality is that he is a supportive, good person. Bleh.\\n\\n\r\nShinoa: I did like her since the first season.  She's witty and antagonizing towards the main characters.  She's usually a decent Squad Leader, yet this season, and bits of the first one, she had a few lapses.  I guess they're still kids afterall.  Perhaps it's good writing to have the viewer both like and dislike the character in some ways, or maybe its that they can't decide on one personality for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe other squad members: Barely existed this season. Definitely true for Mitsuba, and I can't really think of much to write about Kimizuki. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nMika: Not too much to judge wrong with this character, though later on in the series, you run into a very BL interaction moment.  As we recall, Mika hates humans and hates vampires.  He hates everybody and is very conflicted.  You don't really get an idea of what he wants, other than the obvious, saving Yu. And even then, you don't really get an idea of how.\\n\\n\r\nKrul:  Alright, I must admit, I'm tired of the common vampires, zombies, werewolves, etc that are just flooding the fiction/fantasy world.  Krul is probably among 2 vampires that I actually like/pay any attention to.  (The other, of course is everyone's favorite little donut eating blonde).  There is definitely something intriguing about Krul's body language, her tone of voice and her special treatment of Mika. Plus, she's pretty hot, and not just because she's 2D.  She's confident, (obviously because she's the vampire queen), and you don't want to piss her off.  Ah, finally, another decent vampire character.\\n\\n\r\nHiiragi Shinya: He was also a pretty decent character. Skilled, cocky with a chip in his shoulder, at first you think he's extremely shady, but redeems himself immensely as the story goes on.  Not a bad dude.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there's quite a few minor characters that were present for an episode or two here and there.  Some I liked, some I didn't, and others I thought were used the wrong way in the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut, one of the ones I hated most of all:\\n\r\nYuuichirou.\\n\r\nMAIN CHARACTER SYNDROME.  His wiki entry should read, \"blah blah generic adolescent main character with typical main character haircut who is hot headed and wants revenge.  Between the first season and this one, he has rediscovered his idea of family, the people he wants to protect?  Is that really the only development he has? Really, that's it? ARGH! that's so overdone!  Also, he's a complete idiot.  You see him do things that completely endanger himself, the squad and the rest of the unit.  He just doesn't drop it.  Yuuichirou sucks.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSo while the first season pretty much was just an establishment, in this season the humans and vampires actually go into organized combat... For one battle anyway. Yes, the entire season pretty much focuses on the events of ONE battle.  Alright, that might not always be terrible, as there were some pretty good war movies out there about singular engagements.  But at least you get to finish those in one 2-hour sitting.  Not that I don't like battle scenes, but in an entire season, they could have honestly inserted more content.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the story was completely disjointed. Alright, so what developments occurred to influence the actions of Krul Tepes and Guren Ichinose?  Where did \"Owari no Seraph\" come from?  Why did it turn out to be (spoilers)?  Since when were the Hiiragi brass planning to enact their master plan?  None of this was covered in any detail or explained properly.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, not enough death occurred.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the two factors that worked in favor of a good rating for Owari no Seraph: Art & Sound.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's 2016. Good art in this day and age shouldn't be an astounding accomplishment.  Flashy effects, decent drawing and animation, plus one detailed scene of Shinoa that made me bite my lip.  Otherwise, they didn't try anything really new or groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Again, 7/10\\n\r\nThey did actually put together a good soundtrack.  In particular, the ED and some of the OSTs. You have to pay attention during a lot of the combat scenes to realize how well the OSTs are used.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, enjoyment and overall score:\\n\\n\r\nDespite the most crucial elements of the series falling very short (scattered story and mediocre characters), there's something that kept me watching. Maybe it was the industry standard placement of a cliffhanger at the end of every.single.episode, or the constant action.  Yeah, they didn't do too bad there.  I mean, if the show were not at least decent, or even good, I would not have been able to binge it over the course of one night and the following morning.\\n\\n\r\nI give enjoyment and the series an overall score of 6/10.  The first season was much worse, trust me.  If you've seen that, I suppose you might as well watch this season to make up for it.\\n",

            "content": "While Owari no Seraph is described as generic, typical shounen etc. I think once you look deeper into the story, it goes farther than generic. While it does have the typical themes of family, betrayal, powerful underdog characters, it does have a deeper meaning to it (in my opinion) Ill get to the review.\r\nStory- 8.5\r\nBad- both seasons had the constant theme of \"family\" being shoved down your throat, and also had some faults in the animation and kind of typical shounen themes\r\nGood- However, there is more to this than the \"typical shounen\", while i understand that many haven't read the Guren Ichinose light novels/the manga,the second season clarifies a lot of questions from the first season while leaving them open ended (with multiple answers). Like who to trust, what is their real reason (these weren't truly answered, they are just open ended questions), background stories etc. This season also gives us a layer of depth by introducing the Hiragiis and the vampire progenitor council. While some would brush this series plot as typical shounen, the story isn't to be taken lightly. If you pay more attention the story then you can spot deeper plot points that are crucial to it.  \\n\\n\r\nArt- 8.5\\n\r\nThe animation was average, but way better than the first season. I also enjoyed the backgrounds, and the animation style. With a slightly higher budget, Wit Studio touched up on the action scenes and other character movements (S1 Ep 3-6 had kind of sketchy character movements). \\n\\n\r\nSound- 10\\n\r\nI LOVE the soundtrack. The soundtrack would be played at the right moments and draw you more into the story. The music was really epic, I can't exactly put it into words how amazing the soundtrack was.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting- I watched the dub, and needless to say, it was pretty good. I felt like all of the voices fit perfectly, exception being Yoichi, he sounded kind of weird when he screamed/yelled. Guren, Yu, Mika, and Shinoa sounded really good. Mika was amazing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 9.5\\n\r\nWhile many would say that the characters are stereotypical/ didn't get enough characterizations. I agree that a few characters are stereotypical but I feel like that they have mostly good characterizations. Many of the characters had enough backgrounds to support the reasons behind the way they act. However, the characters that I feel like who didn't get enough backup on their backstories were, Shinoa, Guren, Mito, basically Guren's squad, Narumi's squad, Kureto, Aoi, and Mika. \\n\\n\r\nSince I've read the Guren Ichinose light novels, most of their character felt complete to me while I was watching the anime. However, I feel that they should've put some factors on how Mika was abused by his parents and more of what led him to dislike humans. But some of these have been answered like (spoiler from 1st season) how Yu  \\n\r\nwent berserk, (Guren Ichinose light novel spoiler) human experimentation by the Hyakuya sect, his hatred for the species  that murdered his family. Like I said, many questions have been answered in the second season but are still left open ended.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nI absolutely love this series, while there are some plotholes, these are all answered in the manga and the Guren Ichinose light novels. Also if you're new to anime, this has plenty of aspects similar to the Maze Runner series, some Percy Jackson, Harry Potter (Guren Ichinose light novels), and Attack on Titan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9.99\\n\r\nThis series is amazing in my eyes, once you get past the stereotypes, it gets really good. \\n\\n",

You can follow an apocalypsis with vamppires and humans into war and even demoniac possesions  with drama and touches of comedy. \r\nThe good thing here is that you can enjoy the plot and the story line pace even if you don't capture the meaning of each stuff from the manga, by the way, there are some changes from the manga in the animation. I guess all this was because of the fan-service, in fact , I believe thatthe relationship between the two principal characteres is \"canon\" even so, they don't showed that there is here anything more than an closely \"friendship\" or \"family relationship\"- Actually, that was one of the problems in the construction of the principal characters in my opinion and all the main story. There is a kind of complex , better to say, there is  an obssesion around the necessity of mantein and protect the link with the family or the people that they considerer important. \\n\r\nAt least I enjoyed the two seasons and it wasnt hard ended them fastly, thats one of the reasons because I recomend this anime, just give it a try.",

I guess you could call it unique but not necessarily in a positive way.\r\nThe art was consistent with the kind found in the first season - industry standard and well-made, though nothing special.  The backgrounds fit in well, accentuating rather than deterring from the scenes they were home to.The character designs were unique and none of the characters looked similar to one another.  The artists didn't skimp out on this one - they made every character look distinct.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were even less well-rounded than in the first season.  My review of the first season highlighted the lack of depth in the characters shown.  This season is an even worse offender in this regard.  The entire show surrounds a war between humans and vampires and doesn't stop to consider the feelings of the characters mindlessly taking part in the bloodshed.  That being said, the main antagonists turned out to be a surprise and not whom the viewer would expect to be villains.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't find much joy watching this season of Owari no Seraph.  However, it was necessary to complete the show and absorb as much of the storyline as possible.  If you're a fan of constant exaggerated anime-style warfare, you'll likely relate to this season.  I won't be rewatching Owari no Seraph unless the next season is released.  The show ends on a terrible cliffhanger/plot twist and leaves the viewer feeling lost in the dark.  Owari No Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen is not \"awful\" but there are certainly other anime out there more worthy of your time.",

            "content": "From the standpoint of someone who watched this just to kill time during the daily commute:\r\nNormally any such anime I watch just needs to have decent art/animation and explosions or similar to satisfy me. No character development or great story is expected. The first season fit this criteria, so I would have been fine with more of the same in the second.\r\nThe art and animation was fine, the fighting was fine, not too much drawn-out downtime nonsense, it should have had all the makings of a nice mediocre subway watch. But read on...\r\nNow, anytime I watch shounen stuff I mentally steel myself for the ridiculousconvictions the main characters tend to hold and spew forth at any given opportunity. But when it comes to Yu and his 'family', and their motivations and actions when it comes to 'family', I couldn't handle it. It got so much worse this second season. It's immature of me to be emotionally affected by an anime like this one but I will admit I got a little upset. The sheer stupidity and hypocrisy hit me like a sledgehammer. This is of course far from the only anime that contains this sort of thing but I simply cannot fathom why this IP is so popular given the above. I sure hope nobody thinks that his way of thinking is honorable or admirable. I was able to finish the season only because I held on to the improbable belief that all the main characters would die horribly as divine retribution.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr It was mediocre, but my personal sensitivity to the extreme nonsense that counts as the main character's reason for existence made it next to unwatchable. I finished it half because I am a glutton for punishment and half because it was just a timekiller on the commute anyway.",

Do not go ahead unless you don't care about the plot, which you shouldn't anyway because it's predictable as hell.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAnd here's the second season of the uninspiring, cliche spewing show of Owari no Seraph. \r\nTo begin, I don't remember too much of the first season because it was unimpactful, however I do believe that it was at the very least, more enjoyable than this season.\r\nLet's start with the OP. Why the hell was that song chosen for this series? It sounds like something for the Toaru no series, not this. Season 1 had a phenomenal OP and ED. However, this season'sOP is absolutely terrible both song-wise and its sequence. The sequence is basically just a bunch of people making poses for the camera... that's it. Now the ED is better than the OP, but still nothing like season 1's ED which had a great song as well as a breathtaking and even mind provoking sequence (if you really want to think that hard). This season's ED just looks like something for a drama/romance series. It has very little relevance to the theme of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNow the story for the second season is basically summarised in the title, \"Battle in Nagoya\". But before we get to that part there's a few episodes expanding on the situation and what not. \\n\\n\r\nSo firstly we're introduced to some kind of political infighting/stand off which results in Kimizuki and Yoichi getting tortured. But... they don't seem to mind (the entire party) because it seems to be something that should just occur naturally (wut). Kimizuki has a very good reason for accepting it (sister), but everyone else seems to accept it without too much issue. And I'll also mention that this event has no impact later whatsoever (or rather thus far).\\n\\n\r\nThe second event was 'demonic manifestation'. And how they overcome it, is basically the same as when they first got their weapons, just cos'. Demon makes illusion. User realises it's an illusion because the damn illusion itself is so unrealistic and out of whack within the story itself that even a five year old could probably distinguish it. And demon is overcomed... wow, such struggle...\\n\\n\r\nFor the main plot line it's basically just a bunch of fights with trash mobs (unimportant characters) dying off, probably to show 'maturity' (lol). And as for the fights themselves, they're very dull, boring and slow, making it feel worse than season 1. To describe it I will simply put it into three cases. The first is the faceless or generic faced vampires who basically get killed by a single offhanded practice swing, the second is the 'boss' fight which takes a little longer and results in either humans or vampires dying (depending which side's main character is present), and the last is background fighting where trash mobs swing at each other indefinitely or one of them gets on RNGesus's bad side and dies.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the conversations here's how it mainly goes between Yu and anyone else he talks to, basically:\\n\r\nOther person makes a realistic statement/evaluation about current situation which would be an logical remark at the time.\\n\r\nYu complains and pulls out one of three responses:\\n\r\n1. Nakama (friends)\\n\r\n2. Kazoku (family)\\n\r\n3. Revenge against vampires\\n\r\nAfterwards the other person will look at Yu with shock and awe and realise how silly their original realistic remark was and immediately agree with Yu and forget that they even had an original thought in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, if you liked season 1 would you like season 2? Maybe, but it does feel worse. If you didn't like season 1 would you like season 2? Definitely not, and you should probably go watch something else, like One Punch Man.",

            "content": "Despite giving this anime decent scores across the board, I would recommend against watching it.\r\nWhy? Because simply put, it ends in a cliffhanger and it seems unlikely it will ever be resolved. \r\nAnd even if it were, I don't see how any follow-up season can make up for the ridiculous lack of information in the first 2 seasons.\r\nThis anime has one major problem, it was present in season 1 and is even more notable in season 2. Namely - it doesn't explain shit. Like seriously, there is no explanations for half the stuff that happens. You're left wondering what's going on, as the show putsin zero effort to tell you why anything is happening. There aren't any hints either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's not like it's some mystery the main characters discover as the story moves forward. No. It's clear that a lot of the characters in the show have a decent idea of what's going on at all times, they just have no intention of sharing it with the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe most absurd events happen without the characters as much as blinking an eye at them, like it's all common knowledge, even though no line of reasoning could possibly explain what's happening on screen. \\n\\n\r\nBloody demon gods and angels and world ending events start happening and the characters are like: \"oh yeah, this makes sense, that makes sense\".\\n\\n\r\nThis whole season feels like 50 episodes of story and exposition was crunched into 12 episodes that also needed to feature a ton of action. \\n\\n\r\nWatch this show if you only care about mindless action scenes and some decent character interactions without understanding a damn thing about what's going on in the world.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler examples:\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the whole show is simple enough - vampires are real and after a big plague on humanity they took over a notable part of the world etc etc etc.\\n\\n\r\nAlready things are going off the rails because origin of vampires is never explained. Everyone just accepts their existence without question. Like \"oh yeah, they always existed for sure, right?\". Like seriously, at least give us 5 minutes of exposition saying they've been a myth that became real or something. Anything.\\n\\n\r\nThen suddenly, without the show explaining anything, characters are suddenly aware that Demons also exist, and for some reason inhabit weapons that humans wield against the vampires.\\n\\n\r\nNo explanation is ever given as to why Demons are a thing and how humans figured them out. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's some sort of magic also. Spells and curses. But again, zero explanation how it all came to be and why people are aware of them. Apparently shit just exists with half the characters treating it all like common knowledge you learn in kindergarten, while the other half has zero clue. Like which is it? Is magic and monsters and demons common knowledge or not?\\n\\n\r\nLike seriously, this show is like Attack on Titan without any character in the show ever asking what Titans are or where they come from or anything like that. Imagine Attack on Titan where the entire show is as it is with literally every exposition scene cut out. Because that's what Seraph of the End is. If actually feels like characters have 10 hours deep talks about the nature and history of the world, but it's all cut out in the anime because the studio couldn't be bothered to make more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's frustrating.",

            "content": "This anime\r\nCharacters (1/10): OMG! Has there ever been a group of characters more clique than these guys, the MC is a pain up the backside. He is so selfish, inconsiderate and impulsive its mind-numbing. A complete waste of space who you don't care about and don't want to route for the need to focus attention on him often means not being able to spend time on the other interesting elements in the story. While said elements are underdeveloped, part of the reason for this could well be the refusal of the series to allow us to leave the MC for an extended period of timeto catch up with other characters in a meaningful way. \\n\\n\r\nShinoa, AHHHH! She held so much promise in the first season, she was spunky, sarcastic, I liked her purple hair. This season she becomes a complete damsel in distress. I swear she did not use her weapon more than once this entire season. Every time she is about to defend herself the MC swoops in and saves her, HOW IS THAT FUCKING POSSIBLE? She has been in the Demon Army WAY LONGER THAN HIM, and yet she is completely incapable of defending herself! The other blonde chick whose name I can't remember is just useless and another girl whose crazy for the MC. \\n\\n\r\nShih\u014d Kimizuki's personality while somewhat different is still to close to that of the main character's to warrant him a place in this anime. We already have one hot headed guy with a sibling who they deeply care but are separated from, we don't need another. If giving them similar backstories was used to get them to relate to one and other and stop fighting it has been done in such an lame way that its not even worth giving credit to.\\n\\n\r\nNot talking about the brown haired dude, he does nothing as is of no importance, end of discussion.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two squads are boring as hell, I have no idea who they are and what their purpose is so I can't even really tell you about them or evaluate them.\\n\\n\r\nMikaela Hyakuya: The issue with this character is that he was created in relation to the personality of the MC and hence does not have any uniqueness to his character. All the traits which the MC has this guy, his adopted brother of sorts does not have. This obsession on the part of the creators for the two to be polar opposites at all times greatly limits the scope for character development. Its just a theory but one reason the MC never becomes as mature and logical as we would like him to be is because Mikaela in the creators eye's already fulfils this role and hence to have the MC gain such attributes to such an extent that no longer depends on Mikaela as much as he does would bring down the story. This of course is a load of bullshit. Negative and emotionless Mikaela is just annoying and someone who like the MC in fact does not want to seem to see what is right in front of him and face it head on. In fact he would much rather run away which he mentions multiple times to the MC. The situation however is that the conflict which they are both engulfed in makes this impossible. Also when your at war and you want to save those who love, man up, drink the blood and go full vampire! \\n\\n\r\nFetid Bathory: A character who I feel has potential but this is not reached through the duration of the show. In my opinion he goes from being an arsehole who is just messing around to someone who does in fact have a multi-layered plan to achieve his aims. As we have no idea as to his motivations however and we don't get to see him concocting his schemes this part of the narrative is not as engaging as it should be. I will however say that his walk is ON POINT. If he never gets kicked out of the army he needs to get himself on the catwalks of Paris. If you where heels or want to, get a notepad and learn something from this guy.\\n\\n\r\nGuren Ichinose: Positive first shall we? I love his demon mode. Over the past two seasons this is a man who its clear is holding back when it comes to facing his enemies. To see him at full strength and let go of his inhibitions was great to see. Also unlike the Seraph transformation I am glad that his human and demon selfs look pretty much exactly the same excluding the eyes. I think a monster who looks like a man is always more frighting than whatever the seraphs are meant to be. Like all the cast he suffers from lack of character development. Out of all the characters however he is the most well rounded I feel and if it were up to me I would much rather have had this story  be told from his perspective rather than the MC's.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL POINT. WHY IS ANYONE IN THIS ANIME EVEN FIGHTING? On both sides no one really seems to care if there side wins (they don't act in a way that would help anyway) and if they do they way in which they go about it is sneaky and downright inhumane so you can't even admire them for it. Everyone in this anime seems to be focused on something other than ensuring victory for their cause. By the end of the season most of the characters who did once care about beating the other side to a pulp (MC etc) no longer put that at the top of their priorities. Those who are still actively fighting for one side doing it because they have an ulterior motive, because their power hungry or because they have nothing better to do and warfare is all they know even if they can't stand it. As you can imagine because they don't care you don't care and the stakes feel non-existent. When your watching an anime about a war in a post apocalyptic world with two sides fighting for survival and you don't care who wins, you know there's a problem.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is solid in this anime however there are a few things in the character design I take issue with. First why do all the buildings look the same? I admit I have never been to Japan but the characters do cover significant ground in this season hence I don't understand how one part of the city can look the exact same as another.\\n\\n\r\nStory: WTF happened this season? This story was messy and all over the place, to be honset I cannot even tell you what happened. The pacing was so poor I skipped masses of minutes in episodes, and yes I can tell review this anime having done that because even if you don't watch about 2/3 of this anime the story STAYS THE SAME. Tons of filler with people standing around talking, often in the middle of battle. I often forgot there was even a war going on. Furthermore while this season was based around a campaign that was sold as having significance to the war against vampires overall this ramifications of Demon's Army's Plan was not made apparent until the very last episode. There was no buildup whatsoever, the preceding episodes were completely devoid of tension. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I hated this anime. I don't even know why I watched it, the first season made it appear as if this anime was going somewhere interesting and then this season just let me down completely. You will stare at your computer screen asking WTF AM I WATCHING THIS?! If your like me and have only been fully committed to anime for the last few years (3 for me) and still have alto of classics to get through like I do then don't watch this, there are way better this both old and recent than this. Heck if your a sane human being don't watch this! Its not anime but if I wanna see the two brothers, one crazy, overpowered and reckless as fuck and the other tormented, classy and controlled go through thick and thin I'll watch The Originals. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I did not go into all the areas of this anime because its so bad and the more I write the more I relieve it. I hope I gave you enough reasons TO NEVER WATCH THIS ANIME! Also I gave this anime a 4 which I now note is to high and will be changing ASAP.",

            "content": "I give Owari No Seraph as a whole a total rating of 6/10\r\nOwari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-Hen or better Owari no Seraph: \"Battle of the Cliches\" is an anime literally about vampire's vs humans in this post-apocalyptic world where all adults above the age of 13 have died. This anime could have been something really special but it has so many flaws that I wouldn't recommend this anime.\r\nLet's start with the good points about this anime (so we can get them out of the way):\r\n- The art in the anime wasn't really bad. I liked it as it gave us this classical but a modernvibe which I was really impressed from. I liked how the settings were shown as well as how the art showed the characters.\\n\r\n- The action scenes were good...well most of them. I really enjoyed when they had team fights and I was really impressed by the art that was done within these fights.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the bad points about this anime:\\n\r\n- THE BIGGEST PROBLEM with this anime is character development. Literally, I feel like the makers of this anime hardly put any emotions or screen time from the secondary characters such as Kimizuki, Yoichi and Mitsu. Sure they got like an episode dedicated to them each, but after that we hardly EVER saw them, especially Mitsu. Now i'm not a die-hard Mitsu fan, but she hardly appeared when the characters had a dialogue to speak. All she was there for was the combat. I feel this should have been improved to get a better feeling of other characters, and to be much more immersive. Other loved characters such as Krul and Yu's demon hardly got screentime as well.\\n\\n\r\n- Another problem about the character development and some people may get mad at me for this is they put in some romance and then poof, it disappeared? I love romance, and when Guren asked Shinoa if she had feelings for Yu, after she said she didn't know IT JUST DISSAPEARED. Where did the slight chance of romance go? I'm not going to lie but I was hoping for a couple to develop and it looks like it never did. They tried to put in \"Romance\" but it didn't work.\\n\\n\r\n- Yu's and Mika's relationship was nothing more that fan service. It first started of as brotherly love and then turned into some gay \"I want you with me always\" relationship. I have nothing against gay people or gay animes but the way the creators produces these characters relationships was way over the top. Every \"love\" story has it's limits.\\n\\n\r\n- The story was full of cliches. The story wasn't really original, its pretty much like every other action anime out there. Do this, do that, save the world blah blah blah nothing unique in this anime. I didn't hate the story myself, it just could have been developed into something better.\\n\\n\r\n- The Crowly fights were always boring in my opinion. Everytime they gained \"power\" they always got stopped on, and it became really repetitive and got boring. The ending wasn't really good either as the epic fight lasted only a total of 20 seconds.\\n\\n\r\n- The soundtrack wasn't really amazing either. It didn't really pump me up or made me feel sad. Neither was it immersive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I did like this anime but it needs ALOT of improving. Especially on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\nStory - 7\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nOverall - 6.4\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Watch this anime if you're up for a story you probably have seen before with some differences.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nFrom the storyline/plot, this anime is confusing much. It's easy to follow the story, but there are too many 'suddenly'. Suddenly he becomes that or suddenly that appears, suddenly this appears, suddenly this happen, suddenly this person was mentioned whom I never saw for the entire anime.\r\nEverything is lack of explanation and motivations/reasons as to why all of those happens? Who are actually the good guys? Who is siding with whom? Why is this guys like this? What and why are the reasons? It's all confusing.\r\nI detest reading and giving spoiler, however I'll mention this: probably you might have read a summary of this animesomewhere out there, mentioning that this anime has two groups: humans and vampires. One group are the antagonists and another is the protagonist. But, by the end of the day, you'll be wondering how many groups are actually there.\\n\\n\r\nIt was like there is an X and Y, but at the end it appears that X wanted to destroy Y, and Y wanted to destroy X, but then X got A who is making C, and there is B who is looking for E, and A wants to be friend with Y but destroy E (this is only an example, no relation whatsoever with the anime),\\n\r\nand everything happens without you knowing the reasons behind the action, not even until you finish the show.\\n\\n\r\nBut no worries, you can still follow the story somehow, idek, it's just since the past stories are vague, and so are the present.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's okay, but when the characters are not in close-up, they are becoming weird somehow. Idk.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSawano Hiroyuki? I bet most people are interested with this anime because of him, but the soundtracks are a nope for me... other anime soundtracks on its season definitely better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nFor the main and most of the supporting characters, you could see their character development, especially if you compare it from the previous season.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, there are several characters that are suddenly appear out of nowhere, or character who you can count how many times they appear suddenly have important roles out of the blue: without mentioning how and when and why.\\n\\n\r\nEach and every characters past and motivations are also vague.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm a whole for man - man main characters with less girls on the screen, so this anime is good for me despite the whole mess and confusing characterisations and plot. This anime happen for pleasing all fujoshi out there I believe, including me. \\n\\n\r\nSo, I 'm honestly found an enjoyment watching this especially for cliffhanger on several last episodes.\\n\r\nIf you don't have anymore anime to be watched or just deathly boring, you could try this anime..\\n\\n\r\nMy suggestion is just: don't think or you'll get totally confused, just enjoy the show and nods at everything they throw you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nHonestly, the first season of this anime is not my cup of tea, and the second season is still not my cup of tea either. This anime isn't so bad that I have to put it in my black list.",

            "content": "This is my first review for an anime, so excuse me if I gloss over anything important. (No Spoilers Below)\r\nTo start, I will say that this anime is very \"safe\". If you enjoyed the first season of Owari no Seraph, then I would say that 9/10 of those people will enjoy season 2. \r\nWhen I say Owari no Seraph plays it safe, I mean that it doesn't really try to do anything new, or adventurous. Honestly, it reads like the Shonen TV Tropes Entry. \r\nPrimarily a Fighting Series? - Check\r\nBackseat Romance Plot? - Check\r\nTeen Male Protagonist? - Check\r\nNow, the reason I give this anime a5 is not because it's bad. In fact, I enjoyed Owari. That doesn't change the fact that Owari is a middle of the pack anime. It doesn't do anything bad, but doesn't do anythng great either. You won't be debating plot lines with your friends, and proabably won't be purchasing any merchandise but at least you can say \"Oh ya, I saw that show. It's alright.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into action anime, I can recommend Owari. You could do a helluva lot worse. If you're into drama/plot driven anime, I strongly recommend you look elsewhere.",
