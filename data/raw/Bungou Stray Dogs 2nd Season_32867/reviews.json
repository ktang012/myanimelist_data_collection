Absolute improvement from what the first season offered.\r\n1st arc (13-16): Osamu Dazai and the Dark Era\r\n2nd Arc (17-20): Guild Arc; Double Black\r\n3rd Arc (21-24): Yin and Yang Arc\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFor the people who never watched Bungou Stray Dogs:\r\nWhat\u2019re you doing here? Go watch the first season.\r\nIf you were to ask me if I suggest watching Bungou Stray Dogs:\r\nWould I tell you Bungou Stray Dogs 1st season was great? Absolutely not.\r\nWould I tell youBungou Stray Dogs 2nd season was great? Absolutely.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe people I\u2019ve met back then made who I am now\u201d\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc is a prequel to the anime. It really shows you what happened in Dazai\u2019s past, including the people that were involved in his past. What\u2019s the best part about it though, it shows a darkness in which the first season is incomparable to. It\u2019s a very large difference, but also an enjoyable one at that. There\u2019s a lot more emotion put into this, and it\u2019s not so focused on terribly dark humor in which the first season pulled often. I\u2019m not saying there weren\u2019t any serious moments in the first season, though. What has been shown to us is actually some very heavy stuff for this part of the \u201csecond season.\u201d The story so far, in basic terms, is well brought out explanation to what happened to Dazai in the past and what he was involved in.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc might just be the most serious arc of the series. It continues where the story of the first season left off, and boy how it manifested the darkness in which the first season was leading up to. There's a new sinister feel in the air, in which there seems to be a war between the three organizations: The Guild, Port Mafia, and the Armed Detective Agency. There will be many more thrills to arrive, making me eagerly wait for each new episode of the week.\\n\\n\r\nThe third arc.. Was a phenomenal arc. It shows you that there\u2019s such a big difference between Atsushi Nakajima and Ryuunosuke Akutagawa, yet it is as if they\u2019re the same person. The goals that they seek to achieve are relevant, but from a far standpoint, they seemed so different. It was very well done, and I am glad they focused on that heavily in this arc. A very well done arc to end the series. \\n\\n\r\nBetween the three arcs in this second season, despite me saying that the third arc was phenomenal, the first arc was the absolute best arc. Oda Sakunosuke was the most notable character in this second season, despite him having only four episodes of screentime in the entire series. What that man goes through in this arc could be seen to reflect who Dazai became.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe high point of the series. Each character that is introduced into this series have their own strong resolve. The same characters that appeared in the first season took onto the screen again, along with the new group of people called The Guild. I will mostly be speaking about four extremely notable characters, no particular order of their notability. However, there is one character I found to be the best.\\n\\n\r\n1. Dazai Osamu. A well-developed character.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was seen as a very forced-comedic character with his forced-comedic suicidal attempts, turned to be one of the most beloved characters in the overall series. When he runs outside the range of the forced comedy, Dazai takes a dive into adult maturity, and becomes a very serious character in this second season. A very strong man, who was forced to witness too many things that a person really should not. A Port-Mafia blooded character, and the most Port Mafia-blooded character. Despite that being so, he becomes the most resolved individuals to walk across the screen in this series, and takes the trophy of being able to impress me with the improvement he receives. His reasons to his development made me see him as a very well-written character.\\n\\n\r\n2. Atsushi Nakajima. The main character. Yin of the duo.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is it like being kicked out of the orphanage? What is it like to be outcasted? Atsushi eventually grew to have a very strong drive in saving people who are outcasted. He learns what it means to be outcasted, and it makes him such a wonderful character. It is especially shown in this second season what he mentally goes through whenever he tries to do well for others, and it is spectacular. His resolve is trying to do well for others, as a way to approve himself. Despite his hatred for Ryuunosuke, it is as if those two were the same person in terms of resolve. Speaking of which.\\n\\n\r\n3. Ryuunosuke Akutagawa. Reflection of Atsushi. Yang of the duo.\\n\\n\r\nA powerful young man with a strong resolve, to prove to people who he truly is. A man who seeks approval from a specific audience. The absolute reflection of Nakajima Atsushi in terms of how they wish to achieve their resolve. He constantly pesters Atsushi with what seemed to be a self-righteous complex. However, it comes time to time where his true character was revealed, and it makes him become more notable every time. He means well for himself, but in Atsushi\u2019s eyes, it seemed not so. But, indeed, they were aiming for the same resolve.\\n\\n\r\n4.Oda Sakunosuke. Reason to Dazai\u2019s development. The best character.\\n\r\n\u201cMy throat hurt. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I heard someone screaming. I realized, because my throat hurt so much, that I was the one who was screaming.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOda Sakunosuke is one of the biggest reasons I could say that this season takes a dark turn. Everything this man goes through was absolutely dreadful, and it makes me sympathize his character. It releases his resolve, and is done so well when the big fight with him occurred. He had a very strong relationship with Dazai Osamu, and everything that Dazai Osamu does was due to him meeting this man. I was able to emotionally invest myself into this character, despite him having to appear only for four episodes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the other characters, most of them you find out why they are doing what they do in the first season, especially for the Armed Detective Agency. The formidable groups they have to go against are Port Mafia and The Guild. They all show to have extremely powerful individuals who are intelligent, and very-well experienced in defending their group. How will the Armed Detective Agency deal with these people?\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nStudio Bones decided for this second season that it was time to take a dive in their budget. The animation quality is such a beautiful improvement, it\u2019s like watching a beautiful painting constantly being made in front of my eyes. You can SEE the improvement in their budget when it comes to their animation. A spectrum of vivid colors being brought together so beautifully. The OP and ED\u2019s do not disappoint for this factor, either.\\n\\n\r\nWhen a sinister air reeks onto the battlefield, the animation matches the intensity so well. The atmosphere, comparing the two seasons, it is like the second season came from an absolutely different studios. It invokes what this season was trying to display and it is magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP has a very excited pace, in which they display each one of the groups within the story. I personally loved looking at the opening.\\n\\n\r\nThe symbolism in the ED between the three characters: Atsushi, Ryuunosuke, and Osamu. It heavily displays the relationship between the three, and it is stunning. It shows the development that occurs over time in the series, as it heavily focuses on the color blue, Dazai\u2019s straps, and blood. I thought it was stunning visuals.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, again, shows the improvement of studio Bones\u2019 budget. The voice acting is so well done, it is as if you can\u2019t tell if the actors ARE these characters. The most notable voice acting is Oda Sakunosuke. When everything takes place, the emotions being put into the voice acting by his seiyuu is exquisite, absolutely well-done. The voice acting for many of the characters changed so much in this second season. They come to take a very serious tone, especially Osamu and Atsushi. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were very catchy, and they fit very well to the atmosphere this second season has. The OP was done by the same people who made *Cough cough Musaigen no Phantom World cough* opening. However, they also did the Food Wars 2nd season opening, which I thought was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the OST, it gave off such a mafia-like vibe, which is definitely manifested within the story, so the OST very-well matched the second season\u2019s atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI personally love having my heart twisted around, and this second season doesn\u2019t hesitate at any cost in doing so. It is much more focused on the dark aspects than the first season, which had dry comedy about suicide, trying to be dark-humor based. The second season takes a very mature approach, which I found to be extremely enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.95\\n\r\nMature, dark, and spicy. Those are the three words I have for the second season. I\u2019m very amazed at the difference between first and second season. It focuses on more of an emotional aspect, while also being very dark. The first season is very mission focused, but the second season strongly focuses on the development of the characters and story. I think it did a great job in being able to have me emotionally invested into the story. Was it enough for me to think this story was great? Absolutely. Hopefully, it can do so for you too.",

            "content": "After watching the first season of Bungou Stray Dogs, I have to admit that the author made a rather bold attempt at constructing such a show based on literal characters. At its core, the series has an extraordinary cast of characters. By that, I mean they are able to perform supernatural feats that defies the logic of nature. The second season can also be described as extraordinary in more ways than one.\r\nOne of the most unique dynamics about Bungou Stray Dogs is about its characters. There\u2019s such a diverse and colorful cast. The main cast consists of the Armed Detective Agency with each character havingtheir own unique traits. Most prominently, we learn a lot more about Osamu Dazai. If we take a closer look, it also reveals more about not only Dazai\u2019s past but also the underworld system of where the series takes place. The truth is, there\u2019s actually more than we don\u2019t know from the surface. The first few episodes of the second season establishes Daizai as someone that seems to be easily influenced. His relationships with characters such as Sakaguchi Ango and and Sakunosuke Oda are told from his perspective which is more than enough for the viewers to understand him. At the same time, the show cleverly gives an insight about Oda and his own ideals. Despite being a new character, his moments are memorable through his relationship with Daizai and his nobility. That being said, viewers may take a little bit of time to get accustomed with the background storytelling. They are actually not based on the manga so my initial expectations at watching the first episodes of this season left me somewhat bewildered. But once you take in the story, it may give you a better insight about Daizai and who he really was.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does eventually re-enter the main story again. From this season, we also meet The Guild, an American organization led by Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald. They are very influential and possesses a great amount of power and authority. As such, expect them to take over the show as the series\u2019 main antagonists. Of course, Port Mafia still remains relevant with its core members such as Ryunnosuke Akutagawa. Somewhere in between, there\u2019s also Kyouka. Remember her? She\u2019s the girl that killed 35 people and became lost in the world of her purpose until Atsushi took her under the Armed Detective Agency. The problem now is that there are also others that wants her back, namely Port Mafia. Kyouka\u2019s struggle with her own personal demons are further amplified this season and she finds it difficult to get close to others. In the meantime, we are also introduced to other new members of The Guild such as John Steinback and H.P. Lovecraft. It\u2019s also no surprise that the characters of this series are based on their literature figures. A good example would be Margaret Mitchell, author of \u201cGone of the Wind\u201d with an ability that is named as such. Back to what I mentioned before, Bungou Stray Dogs excels at its diverse range of characters. Whether you\u2019re a fan of literature or not, the series is able to find ways to capitalize on each character. For their roles, personality, or abilities, many of them will likely remain memorable because of the show is able to push them as figures larger than life.\\n\\n\r\nA main major story conflict that develops seems to be a triple threat conflict between the Armed Detective Agency, Port Mafia, and The Guild. Each one wants to remain the last group standing while their members make key moves to ensure their successes. If you remember from season 1, Akutagawa had some major issues with Atsushi while the latter seems to have developed a personal rivalry with him. As such, expect their rivalry to escalate more into this sequel. The Armed Detective Agency also realizes the threat of The Guild and as such takes steps to counter against their influences. Other rivalries throughout the show between the three factions are also explored including the very cleverly crafted Ranpo Edogawa/Edgar Allen Poe feud. When you realize that imaginations can blend between fiction and reality, that\u2019s where the show really shines. Indeed, Bungou Stray Dogs is no stranger to exploring supernatural phenomenon whether they are abilities to cause malevolence, utility to help others, or means of influencing the world. The sequel brings out that to a very unique form with abilities such as the Black Cat in the Rue Mogue, Moby Dick, The Grapes of Wrath, among others. It\u2019s what makes the show that damn special.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of technicality, the sequel remains generally the same by retaining its strong visual dynamics. Characters expressions are what draws the viewers\u2019 attention the most especially with Kyouka\u2019s inner struggles and Atsushi\u2019s determination to prove himself to others. Akutagawa\u2019s personality becomes darker as attempts to fulfill his own goals. Character designs revolving around The Guild also gives them the impression of authority and aristocracy such as Margaret and Francis. In addition, we get memorable battles that takes the characters\u2019 abilities to their limits all thanks to Bones\u2019 talented staff and cast. The voice acting has always been impressive from this show that defines characters\u2019 personalities. It retains that level of credibility in season 2 and definitely not something to forget about. Oh and do I need to remind you of that stellar soundtrack? Don\u2019t forget your headphones!\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to sequels, fans are often expecting something that hopefully excels the first season. Bungou Stray Dogs\u2019 first few episodes may feel more like a prologue rather than expansion but the way it crafts its story structure ultimately works well in the end. As a show with a lot of creativity, there\u2019s a lot to take in at times. The storytelling and the characters all serves a meaningful purpose in one way or another. Now, do be aware that the manga is still ongoing as this is an incomplete adaptation. Yet somehow, it still manages to pull off a hard-boiled supernatural thriller with literature figures and a story that meets expectations.  \\n",

            "content": "Bungou Sleigh Bells returns just in time for the holidays. And just like that, I\u2019m already out of holiday puns.\r\nTo be honest, following Bambi Stray Dogs throughout the season was a surprisingly difficult task. Not just because of the weird and scattered narrative, but also because Crunchyroll changed its release schedule at least thirty-five times, just like the number of people Kyouka killed. So, my recollection of this series, which I only finished watching about twelve minutes ago, is rather hazy.\r\nLooking back at the first cour from the spring, Stray Doggos was a decent time that seemed to have some sort of identity crisis. Ithad fun characters with crazy powers and an interesting concept with the main cast being a group of detectives rivaled against a mafia, but the story took some sharp turns in conflicting directions and was plagued by slapstick comedy about as appropriately-timed as someone\u2019s ringtone of ACDC\u2019s \u2018Highway to Hell\u2019 going off in the middle of their father-in-law\u2019s funeral. Hey, I found it funny. Can\u2019t say the same for the guy\u2019s wife, though.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the question everyone wants to know: Does the second season improve on the first in this regard?\\n\\n\r\nEh\u2026\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, Stray Puppers makes a strong first impression. It kicks off with a prequel focused on Dazai and has a more dark and consistent tone despite Dazai being the silliest character of the series. Yet, even this gets tiring after a couple episodes.\\n\r\nFor some reason, the arc stops focusing on Dazai, the fan-favorite of the series, and instead moves the spotlight to a guy who\u2019s name I don\u2019t know, because he wasn\u2019t even in the first season. Who the hell\u2019s this guy? Why should I care about him? He\u2019s not particularly interesting beyond having one of the coolest powers of the series: a premonition-based power that activates when he\u2019s about to die so that he can avoid it. The way Studio Bones visualizes it is entrancing. But the guy himself isn\u2019t worth cheering for, because you know exactly how the arc is going to end. The point is that Dazai leaves the Port Mafia due to the events in this arc. A little clarification is nice to have for Dazai\u2019s past, but did it need last a third of the cour?\\n\r\nImagine watching this on a binge. You clear twelve episodes in a day or two. You\u2019re finally invested in the people in the Armed Detective Agency and are excited about seeing the story evolve. Then, without warning, the anime cuts to new characters loosely related to the overall narrative and focuses on them instead, without looking back at the past season or even reassuring you that they\u2019ll be back. I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d be a little strange. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, after a few episodes the anime returns the spotlight to Sushi Guy, who got kicked out of thirty-five orphanages. The comedy doesn\u2019t cut through everything as sharply and it introduces a new group of villains on top of the already-established Port Mafia, creating a three-sided war. It\u2019s pretty interesting\u2026 but I could never connect much with the villains. Many of the people in this season just show up and leave after a couple episodes, and the shifting focus on Bucko\u2019s myriad characters can make it hard to follow. It did for me, especially given that Pokemon Moon absorbed about a month of my life. Praise Mimikyu.\\n\\n\r\nThe more serious plotline leaves less room for characters to dick around all day, so there aren\u2019t a lot of funny, memorable moments like there were with the first season, and no one really changes. With the first season, I thought Atsushi was a decent lead character who had a lot of room to develop, and I was interested in seeing that happen in the second. Nope. He still acts like a bitch all the time--in fact, his bitchiness seems to have increased somehow, because the slightest of mistakes will trigger the Naruto-level repetitive flashback of thirty-five people kicking him out of an orphanage. Yeah, that didn\u2019t stop happening either. I\u2019m not even sure why he\u2019s the main character. Everyone else hypes up his tiger-transforming power as if it\u2019s the most impressive thing in the world, but it\u2019s actually not when he gets his ass kicked by literally everyone, just like how he got kicked out of an orphanage. And although he has the determined, ambitious attitude of a common anime lead, his reduced screentime makes it even more difficult to justify his placement in the series.\\n\r\nKyouka, who killed thirty-five people, is a gem from the first season that also deserved some more polish. Eh\u2026 She develops a little more, which is nice, but I can\u2019t say that anything about her is remarkable aside from her gorgeous character design, but frankly that can be said for basically everyone else. She\u2019s the cute, quiet girl who\u2019s trying to fit in. There\u2019s nothing else to say about her, besides the fact that she got kicked out of thirty-five people, which makes the end of the season pretty hilarious. They try setting up a big emotional moment even though she was almost as useless as Sushiman.\\n\\n\r\nThe highlight of Bouncy is the fights, for sure. I wasn\u2019t too interested in the powers from the first season beyond the incredible diversity, but this season introduces a new cast inspired by Western authors with matching abilities. My favorite was probably the last one, \u2018The Great Fitzgerald\u2019, which powers up the user depending on how much money they have and are willing to spend. Obviously there\u2019s no real logic behind this or most other powers, but it\u2019s still creative and a lot of fun, and that\u2019s what counts.\\n\\n\r\nProduction\u2019s about the same, not much that\u2019s new to comment on. The art is as good as it was from the first season because based Bones, though I don\u2019t know how often they used blank faces back then. For some reason, most scenes will just remove people\u2019s faces entirely when they\u2019re at a distance. I somewhat appreciate the artistic approach here, but it just looks strange. \\n\\n\r\nTaku Iwasaki still remains a mixed bag to me, some of the backing music sounds hype as hell, and some of it sounds like he put a randomizer on some music studio on his computer. The opening song isn\u2019t as good as GRANRODEO\u2019s \u2018Trash Candy\u2019, which for me is one of my favorite\u2019s this year, but SCREEN mode did a pretty nice job regardless. The accompanying animation wasn\u2019t very memorable, but still appreciable because there are three different sequences, with the first two only showing up for a single episode. The ED sounds familiar because it\u2019s by the same band who did the first season\u2019s; it\u2019s as good for me because its slow start makes for a great transition, and the moderate energy of the song makes it a good way to end an action-based show. Strong marks for this. Insert joke about Kyouka murdering people for consistency.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this second season of Gumball improved the show somewhat, but still opened up some new holes. It\u2019s like sitting on a nice boat in the middle of a lake, but then you notice a hole, and now the boat\u2019s sinking. You cover up the hole with your hands, but then another hole opens somewhere else, and it just keeps repeating. You can\u2019t cover them all because you only have two hands and there are thirty-five holes. And the boat\u2019s actually an orphanage.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10\\n\r\nPeople killed by Kyouka - 35/10\\n\r\nOverall - 5.0 (Score range: 4.0-6.0)\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium",

Amazing story and great battle sequences aside, the show in its 2nd season did a much better job with explaining plot concepts and the characters all improvedwith the introduction of Dazai's story and the Guild.  Some (myself included) would be reasonably annoyed with the beginning of this season as it decided to tell Dazai's past instead of keeping with the current events of the present story line (especially considering the suspense that 1st season left off with).  This ended up being a small issue as, the backstory was awesome, and the main story that resumed was improved because of it.  From the point the show resumed the present plotline it just got better with each episode, from 3-way conflict giving way to an unlikely partnership to a final fight worthy of the show's 2 season long buildup finishing with a peace tainted by the juicy plot-hook of yet another more menacing foe, this is how i like my anime, 12/10 would recommend to anyone.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: With the conflict between the Armed Detective Agency and the Port Mafia already raging on, the appearance of The Guild further endangers the balance of the city. The stage has been set for a three-way gifted war between the organizations and by the end, only one will be left standing. Atsushi (Uemura Yuto), Dazai (Miyano Mamoru), and the rest of the Armed Detective Agency confront their strongest foes yet as the city wavers on the brink of destruction.\r\n[Characters]: \r\nPerhaps the most marked difference between the first and second season of Bungou Stray Dogs is the secondseasons\u2019 first 4 episodes which feature a stand-alone, prequel arc centering around Dazai\u2019s past and the founding of the Armed Detective Agency. It offers a far more serious tone than the season that proceeds it and the characters and subject matter are similarly adjusted to fit this alternative kind of story. Gone are the dopey gags and whimsical suicide jokes and in their place is a mystery thriller full of organized crime, action, and subterfuge. It\u2019s a promising start to the new season and it does away with many of the aspects of the first installment that most significantly hampered its success.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the shift in tone, the cast of the prequel arc behaves fundamentally different from that of the first season. The characters have actual depth to them. Dazai isn\u2019t bogged down by his cripplingly stupid suicide gag \u2013 he\u2019s menacing and intellectual. Oda Sakunosuke, a newcomer, is wonderfully compelling and offers a genuinely engaging personality, skill set, and moral awareness that really embodies what makes the first 4 episodes of the show so interesting. For the first time you get a sense of purpose from these characters that isn\u2019t derived from asinine comedy or Atsushi being hung up on the same orphanage flashback for over a season. In this regard, Bungou Stray Dogs pulled off the impossible and actually made me enjoy watching its characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo what then when the story shifts back to its previous setting and cast of familiar characters. Does it relax into its old ways and forget its recent progress? Luckily this isn\u2019t the case but its not a complete turn-around either. The tone lightens up a good deal after the prequel arc concludes however in its wake remains a sense of gravity and seriousness that continues to influence the show for the better. The tonally disrupting humor makes a return but appears far less frequently than before, almost disappearing entirely during the show\u2019s later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast remains much the same as they were before. Atsushi is still Atsushi and the rest of the Armed Detective Agency and the Port Mafia go about their business just as they did before. The majority of the characters remain fairly one-dimensional and the things that motivate them are pretty underwhelming but there are a handful of interesting additions to this season. While the convention of slapping the names of renowned authors on to various characters and giving them superpowers had about as little depth as it did before, Lovecraft and his style of horror beyond comprehension was fairly well conceived. The cast features a small number of improvements in this regard but as a whole remains almost insultingly simplistic and leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: \\n\\n\r\nIn respect to Bungou Stray Dogs\u2019 visuals, not much has changed and the second season maintains the fluid and consistent style of the first series. There are a number of new flashy abilities to look at and the fight sequences are well animated and generally entertaining to watch when they don\u2019t boil down to play-by-play ability exposition. Bungou Stray Dogs is a good looking show and if it could stand by its solid animation, great environments, and vibrant colors alone, it would be a relatively strong show.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: \\n\\n\r\nAs highlighted earlier, the beginning of the new season begins with a flashback arc consisting of 4 episodes that immediately surpassed all of the proceeding content. The more serious tone and far more measured approach to the show\u2019s poor sense of comedy does it a lot of favors. It doesn\u2019t escape moments like Dazai screaming his head off about a mobile game while his men recover the bodies of 3 of his underlings but this initial arc presents a significant step forward for the show none the less. It plays out as more of an organized crime mystery than the superpower action show that makes up the rest of Bungou Stray Dogs. It\u2019s got a good character story at its core centering around Dazai, Oda Sakunosuke, and Sakaguchi Ango and features some compelling plot developments and action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the show that follows is far more in the vein of the previous series though as I\u2019ve said it thankfully takes a slightly more serious approach this time around. While the offbeat comedy doesn\u2019t get in the story\u2019s way in the same way it once did, there are still a handful of narrative issues afoot that keep the second season of Bungou Stray Dogs from creating anything as compelling as its introductory arc. The season as a whole revolves around the three-way conflict between the Armed Detective Agency, the Port Mafia, and The Guild however what they are actually fighting over and what drives their conflict is a bit obscure. To some degree, its the city itself but the Armed Detective Agency is mostly out to save people, the Port Mafia is out to\u2026 do bad stuff and The Guild wants to capture Atsushi the weretiger\u2026 or find a book\u2026 or some such thing.\\n\\n\r\nThough their reasons for fighting each other are a little flaky, what\u2019s perhaps even more disconcerting is the way their bouts actually pan out most of the time. Despite boasting truly powerful and terrifying abilities and spending most of their dialogue threatening opposing faction members, none of the characters seem to have much of an interest in killing anyone. Sometimes two opposing factions clash and they fight to the death but in other instances, they simply nod and see each other on their way. It\u2019s supposed to speak to this high-minded elegance behind the scenes but when each faction-head claims they want to win and don\u2019t seem to be taking the most straightforward steps to doing so, it somewhat compromises the seriousness of their conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThough it presents these weaknesses, between the prequel arc, the shift in tone, and the more interesting subject matter, the second season of the show is markedly more entertaining than the first. It tends to repeat itself for the sake of oversimplification, the characters are pretty one-dimensional but its got good production standards, plenty of fight scenes, and somewhat inciting character interactions to keep things fresh.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]: \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack sees a return of the previous themes that made up the bulk of the show\u2019s music with a few new additions. For whatever reason, the music stood out to me more this season than it did during the first and I can say it supported each scene reasonably well.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nThis second season of Bungou Stray Dogs was more entertaining than I would have expected it to be going in after such a forgettable first season. The conclusion of the show was fairly tight but the mentalities of all of the characters involved left me kind of baffled as to why any of them would act the way they did. This season was a significant step in the right direction but not to the degree that it became anything \u2018great\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 5\\n\\n\r\nI gave the second season of Bungou Stray Dogs a 5 because, while it still suffers from uninteresting characters and a handful of narrative complications, the more sincere tone allows for the show to take itself more seriously and thus adds at least some legitimacy to its conflict and cast. The prequel arc was engaging and the action scenes that crop up throughout the rest of the show were entertaining. Bungou Stray Dogs isn\u2019t a show with a lot going on behind the eyes. Its predictability renders it rather uneventful on some occasions but its action scenes and animation at least provide something stimulating to tide things over.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]: \\n\\n\r\nIf you already enjoyed the first series and are looking into checking out this sequel season, then I\u2019m sure it will meet and surpass your expectations. If you enjoyed it for its comedy, it\u2019s still present. If you liked its action scenes or supernatural abilities \u2013 there are more of them than ever. If, like me, you didn\u2019t care for the first season, I\u2019d give the first 4 episodes a shot and see if it catches your interest any.",

            "content": "First of all i been a fan of Bungo stray dogs since the first season and as such i was looking forward to this season when it was announced. \r\nLets get started \r\nThe story of Bungo stray dogs revolves around people with special abilities that are referred to as gifted within the story. The story itself takes place in a fictional representation of the city of Yokohama. As with the first season of the anime the gifted within the city are divided into different factions with this season introducing the American gifted organisation the Guild in addition to the Armed Detective agency and the PortMafia that was introduced in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character of the series is Atsuchi who until discovery of his powers back in the first season was a rather unlucky person that was treated harshly by nearly everyone that he had met. An orphan that was abandoned by his parents for his perceived curse he was taken in by an orphanage that was just as harsh. \\n\\n\r\nUntil he was found by the armed detective agency Atsuchi was rather weak and cowardly and had rather low self esteem. However this changed after joining the agency and he become more confident and determined and found something that he had been lacking all along which was friendship and a place that he can belong to. \\n\\n\r\nIn season 2 Atsushi has matured somewhat from his season 1 self and has become a far more confident person and has far more control of his abilities than before. He has developed a sort of mentor relationship between himself and the character of Kyouka. One trait of his that manifested in this season that i admire about the most was his selflessness in that he will do his utmost to protect people even for people that he had just met. Perhaps his most prominent trait that i also find amazing is his determination as he will try his hardest to achieve a task no matter the odds that are stacked against him. \\n\\n\r\nAs with all gifted's on the anime Atsushi also has a power of his own with his being able to turn into a white tiger or morph one of his limbs into the tiger equivalent. In this Atsuchi's strength is increased substantially and he also gains the ability to regenerate his limbs. \\n\\n\r\nKyouka voiced by veteran seiyuu Sumire Morohoshi is a character that was introduced in the first season as a member of the Port Mafia as a assassin of sorts. After an encounter with Atsushi who managed to convince her not to throw her life away Kyouka decided to leave the port Mafia and was taken in by the agency with Atsuchi mentoring her. Despite leaving the Port Mafia Kyouka still has doubts whether she can an effective member of the agency as her ability Demon snow which summons a sword wielding phantom can only be used to kill people and only listens to orders from a mobile phone that she has and not her own will. Indeed the first reaction that Kyouka does when feeling a threat is to kill which makes it hard for Atsushi and the others to help her. Kyouka's struggles form one of the story arcs for the anime and was an interesting one as i found it allowed her to develop her own personality and discover the direction that her life should be going on her own rather than being dictated by her gifts and her bosses. The relationship between Kyouka and Atsuchi was also pretty cute and both had very similar upbringings and backstories which is why they get along so well.\\n\\n\r\nDazai is a member of the Armed detective agency and was the one that discovered Atsushi and recruited him into it. Although Dazai may appear to be carefree and only interested in flirting and suicide this is but a facade as behind this is a keen and calculating mind that is often able to see several steps ahead. Most often than not the strategies that the agency uses was formulated by him. \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 didn't wrought as much changes to Dazai as it did to Atsuchi but did expand on Dazai's backstory that proved to be a really interesting story arc of its own. Unlike the first season Dazai in the second season is more of a support character but never less does provide guidance and support for Atsushi and co when they need it. Dazai's power is called No longer Human and is the ability to cancel out another gifted's ability. Because of this it acts as a sort of trump card within the story but thankfully its never overused. Despite being relegated to a support role Dazai is still as dependable and reliable as ever and his advice and strategies are always on point. \\n\\n\r\nAkutagawa is a member of the Port Mafia and serves as one of their main enforcers. When Dazai was still in the Port Mafia Akutagawa served as one of his subordinates and he respected Dazai a great deal. Despite that Dazai never once acknowledged his strength and as a result he has a rather interesting relationship with Dazai. Within the story Akutagawa serves as a sort of nemesis for Atsushi although in season 2 he has a much smaller role due to the guild being the main enemies. Despite that Akutagawa serves as the polar opposite to Atsushi not just in terms of ability but also in terms of reasons to fight. Despite that watching these two fight again and again really lets you see that they are in fact quite similar and that if they are able to put aside their differences to fight for a common cause they will be able to beat just about anyone. \\n\\n\r\nChuya is a member of the Port Mafia and was Dazai's former partner. Despite being an executive of the Port Mafia Chuya still resents Dazai for leaving both him and the organisation that they both serve and joining the armed detective agency. This resentment takes the forms of many things usually with Chuya being angry with Dazai to which i find most humorous. Dazai usually takes these in stride by by commenting on Chuya's height and appearance which he dislikes immensely which causes no small amount of hilarity. Chuya's gift is called the For the tainted Sorrow which allows him to manipulate a gravity vector and the strength of objects within it. \\n\r\nOne thing about Chuya's ability is that when he goes all out he loses control of himself and can only be stopped by others. This can lead to a rather embarrassing situation if that person just leaves lol. \\n\\n\r\nMori is the leader of the Port Mafia and while only given a guest role in the first season was given a much larger role in this season. Despite looking like a doctor to which he was one Mori is every bit the strategist that the agencies leader is and perhaps even more so. Mori is very adapt at using guile and trickery as well as his intelligence to make events go his way. Mori despite being the leader of an organisation like the Port Mafia treats everyone whether allies or not with respect and does not look like a crime lord at all. Despite this Mori understands that sometimes alliances are necessary and that debts must be repaid once owed. \\n\\n\r\nSakunosuke Oda known as Odasaku to his friends was a member of the Port Mafia and one of Dazai's oldest friends. When Dazai was still in the port Mafia Odasaku was one of his best friends. Despite being of different ranks within the port mafia this made no difference to them and they still shared drinks with each other. Despite being a member of the Port Mafia Odasaku wasn't a horrible person and in fact took care of a number of orphans that he had found over the years. His prominent trait was that despite being armed he until the tragic events near of his arc did not even use it once as part of his duties. \\n\\n\r\nOdasaku's storyline was one of the story arcs that was featured in this season and arguably it was one of the saddest stories i have ever seen. His fight with the villain of that arc who had the same ability of his which was predicting the future several seconds ahead was extremely well done and executed and his voice actor Junichi Suwabe of Gate and Fate stay night fame really did a great job portraying him. \\n\\n\r\nFrancis Scott key Fitzgerald that i call Francis is the leader of the American gifted organisation the Guild otherwise known as the fellowship of the guild. Intelligent, quick thinking, charismatic and confident Francis serves as the main villain of the second season. Despite appearing arrogant Francis does not let hubris get in the way of his goals and pursues his objectives tenaciously with the help of his large number of subordinates. Additionally he is also a rather quick thinker able to adapt and pre empt his opponents moves quite easily while at the same time allowing them to fall into his traps. Francis's power is called the Great Gatsby which allows him to increase his strength in proportion to the amount of money that he uses. Nothing like using up 100,000 dollars to gain the equivalent in terms of strength increase lol. \\n\\n\r\nFrancis i felt was a great villain as he was both calculating and smart while at the same time powerful in combat meaning that to beat him the main cast had to outsmart him which is not easy and at the same time outfight him which is ditto. This difficulty was what ultimately caused one of the most unlikeliest alliances to be formed. \\n\\n\\n\r\nLucy voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa and my 3rd favorite seiyuu is a member of the guild and was actually first introduced back in the first season where she was one of the first guild members to reveal themselves when she attacked Atsuchi and Mori. Due to being defeated by Atsushi Lucy was demoted in status and in season 2 was more of a maid than anything. Lucy's gift is called Anne of Abyssal Red which allows her to create a alternate reality called Anne's room in which resides a giant doll called Anne the monster that imprisons people it manages to catch. \\n\\n\r\nLucy was very similar to Atsuchi in that both were orphan's that were abused by the people that took them in and both suffered trauma from that. The difference here is that while Atsushi recovered from it somewhat Lucy never did and rather developed a rather psychotic personality. Like Atsuchi she developed a dependence on the organisation that took her in and accepted her for what she was and thus giving her some pride and status in her eyes. \\n\\n\r\nAs as result you can see that Lucy and Atsushi has a rather interesting relationship that is more like a love hate kind of thing. Despite that its this kind of shared trauma that allowed one of the most intense escapes on the show to take place. Lucy i felt i was a great character and seeing her change when confronted by Atsushi was interesting. Kana Hanazawa as always gave a flawless performance here portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nJohn Steinback that i call Grapeman due to his gift is a operative of the guild and is Lovecrafts partner. Unlike most characters on the show John joined the guild to provide money for his family which seems to be a large one. A farm boy from a farming family John is usually carefree and relaxed outside of battle but once in battle he can be cruel and merciless to the point of being a psycho. Johns gift is called Grapes of wrath that allow him to sprout grape vines that can be used to graft to other plants and allow him to take control of them using them as eyes for him to extend his range. \\n\\n\r\nLovecraft is a member of the guild and arguably one of the most bizarre characters i ever came across in any anime. A rather deadpan person Lovecraft tends to get distracted by the simple of things which can be really funny if he's looking for the main characters. His gift though or rather ability is to morph into a large tentacle monster that he calls the great old one that can only be destroyed from the inside. Despite this Lovecraft is a very capable combatant and is able to fight even Dazai on a even footing and strangely enough even Dazai is unable to cancel out Lovecraft's ability with his own. \\n\\n\r\nThe remaining members of the Armed detective agency who served as the main characters in the first season was largely given the backseat role this season due to the focus being on the guild and Atsuchi however they still get some memorable fights in this season with examples being Dappo and Junichiro's fight with Lovecraft and John and Ranpo and Akiko's little excursion into a alternate book world. The same can be said of the Port Mafia as well. \\n\\n\r\nKouyou Ozaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Ami Koshimizu is a port member executive and one of Mori's closest advisers and seem to have a rather close relationship with him. Kouyou served as Kyouka's master during her time in the Port Mafia and actually does care about her well being. Her gift is called Golden demon which summons a spirit wielding a sword that is controlled by her will alone similar but different to Kyouka. Kouyou isn't a true villain as she does care about Kyouka and only wants her to stay in the Port Mafia to watch over her and guide her even though it doesn't give Kyouka any choice. \\n\\n\r\nOne member of the Port Mafia that deserves mention is Kyusaku Yumeno known as Q who while still a teenager has a rather powerful gift which he calls Dogra Magra that allows him to control someone by injuring someone with his doll. Despite being carefree and relaxed Q has quite a psychotic personality and as such was imprisoned by the Port Mafia. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\r\nThe music for Bungo stray dogs i felt was really good as the scene music was appropriate for the scenes that featured them and both the opening and ending themes were excellent and really gets you psyched up for the episode. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\\n\r\nAnimation for Bungo stray dogs was pretty well done and especially the fight scenes which was well designed and animated. Animation was also pretty clear and clean as was the colors. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting as ever was excellent with Yuto Uemura who voiced Atsushi and Sumire Morohoshi who voiced Kyouka deserving particular praise. Junichi Suwabe and Kana Hanazawa who voiced Odasaku and Lucy respectively as mentioned were two of my favorite characters on the show and these two seiyuu's did a fantastic job portraying their characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 of Bungo stray dogs i felt was a massive step up from the first season that it had a much better overall story, a larger cast of characters and some really impressive fight scenes that was animated beautifully. The stakes of the story also felt much higher than before due to the guild's tactics. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a great season that improved upon everything that season 1 created and built upon it. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The will of each and every human always seems to beg and scream for different things despite all of us being a part of the same species.  Our walks of life, our experiences, and our day to day lives mold the very fabric of our being, eventually leading us to divergent paths that give us different drives towards the common goal of giving us self-validation and a reason to continue onward.  And so, we continue the stories of the people in Yokohama, where a war between three factions, three ways of life, and three times the number of personal stories and journeys arewritten.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: Bungou Stray dogs 2 continues the story that we were left with in the first season with a slight plot twist in the beginning by giving us a backstory about one of the more predominant characters in the series, Dazai.  It does this for roughly half of the series before going back to the main plot in the present day with the brewing three-way war between the three factions presented in the series: The Armed Detective Agency, the Port Mafia, and The Guild.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot's two halves put the audience in a difficult spot due to the very sudden shift in tone at the beginning due to it not being a direct continuity from the first season, then doing the same dramatic shift to get back to the main plot of the series, there is very little to actually complain about the overall content of what we get.  Aside from maybe a few pacing issues, the series does a very good job at guiding the audience through its plotline and ensures that what we're presented with ultimately comes together in the end.  \\n\\n\r\nMore importantly, the plot of Stray Dogs gives us the story of its characters alongside the main plot of trying to win the three faction war.  Many new characters that we're presented with as members of the Guild and in the initial backstory are given a healthy amount of screentime, importance, and motives that give them the illusion of being more fleshed out than thinking back, they actually were.  \\n\\n\r\nSo with the culmination of an overarching story as well as a heaping amount of character growth, what does that actually say for the series's quality?  In truth, I really can't find many faults with the way that the series played out.  Sure a couple of the characters were a bit shallow simply because they were only important for maybe one half of an episode (looking at you, Poe), the Guild's goal was haphazardly placed because it was just a tiny line shoved into the end of the second to last episode to make sure the third faction's reason for fighting was known to the audience, and maybe Dazai is a bit of a Deus-Ex-Machina since everything he says and does goes and does is done a bit too perfectly, but when compared to how well the series built up its characters, summing it all up into a clash of ideals almost to the level of some of anime's greatest one on one fights, all of those flaws are pretty much inconsequential.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Wonderful character building\\n\r\n+ Well-made mix of plot with characters\\n\r\n-  Some jarring shifts in pacing (with some rushing near the end)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: If there's anything that Bungou Stray Dogs does extremely well, it's characters.  Due to the series focusing on the three faction war, a lot of the \"non-important\" characters have been shoved off to the side, or have very minimalistic roles to make room for new ones and/or characters that are more important to this arc.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the Armed Detective Agency, the most prominent members in this arc are Atsushi (obviously), Dazai (again, obviously), and Kyouka.  Dazai of course, gets the most attention in this series due to the fact that he's not only a part of the first half of this season with his very own flashback, but because he fulfills his pivotal role in the series as being the end all be all character that virtually every important character from the ADA and Port Mafia is influenced by.  Atsushi and Kyouka get their time in the spotlight in the latter half as the largest players from the ADA.  Aside from just being main characters, the series gives a lot of attention to their characters and never wastes a second they're given to gradually move them closer to their end goals as people.  They have wants and needs, regrets and worries, and really speak the ideal of wanting to make something of yourself.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Port Mafia group has probably the least amount of characters actually important to the overall plotline despite their immense involvement in the three part war.  Their cast comes predominantly with the involvment of Akutagawa and Oda, a friend of Dazai, as the main contributors to the series with a few others here and there (like Kouyou, voiced by the lovely Ami Koshimizu) and the Port Mafia's leader, Mori.  As far as roles go, Oda provides the majority of the story for the first half and gives us insight as to what was happening in the Port Mafia before the time of the series while Akutagawa provides us with the antithesis to Atsushi, supporting the series with his presence to the climax that we see near the end of the series.  While small in number, the Port Mafia characters provide a very strong presence to the series and helps provide a well thought out version of the \"Different path, same goal\" -style antagonist group.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have the Guild, arguably the least important important group (despite being the new threat) with the most amount of characters introduced.  Due to the fact that the Guild is something new to the series, all of the Guild's character, subordinates, leader, and all, are given time in the spotlight and take up a large majority of the character moments in the first part of the second half as almost each member tells their story and why they ended up as a member of a Gifted organization, thus giving the illusion of fleshed out characters due to how many one-off stories that we're introduced with.  The only problem is the fact that these characters are pretty much one and done, as this entire arc is pretty much their only turn to shine.  As mentioned before, the Guild's ultimate goal isn't revealed until the end of the series, so combined with the somewhat sloppy writing for their members, those involved with the Guild aren't really as memorable as the other characters mentioned above.  Which is a shame, because all of their gifted powers are based off of American novels, and some of them are arguably pretty cool and imaginative as far as powers go.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, what of the other characters that didn't get their time in the spotlight?  Well, they're still there.  The rest of the ADA still have their moment to shine, other members of the Port Mafia still have a role, but due to the show's shift towards focusing solely on specific characters and the new threat, there just isn't enough room to squeeze everyone in.  Bit of a shame, but they only had twelve episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great character development for those in the Port Mafia and ADA \\n\r\n+ Some interesting new additions (Kouyou was great.  Shut up, I have a favorite Seiyuu, ok?)\\n\r\n+/-  Miscellaneous characters are still there, but not as important\\n\r\n-  Guild characters suffered from being only seemingly important\\n\\n\r\nArt: Bones comes back in full force with the same slightly muted color palette and crisp artstyle that they used in the original Bungou Stray Dogs.  Honestly, there really isn't much to say about the art because it's the same quality as the studio produced when they were doing the first season.  The action's fluid, the effects are well made, and they still make the characters look choppy or nonchalant whenever something funny's happening (which I still find quite amusing.)\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing though that I personally wasn't happy with was the fact that there were never faces on the people who were facing the camera from a distance.  Anyone who was standing far away was always faceless, and personally, I found that very strange and wondered why they couldn't just draw eyes or animate something resembling a face on those individuals.  I don't remember if they did it in the first season or not, but it was just something that irked me personally.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Consistent, well-made quality\\n\r\n+ Fluid action\\n\r\n-  The lack of faces in distance shots irked me\\n\\n\r\nSound: As far as the OST goes, the overall soundtrack for the second season leans towards electronic rock with heavy emphasis on drums, keyboard, electric guitar.  Both its opening \"Reason Living\" and ending \"Kaze ga Fuku Machi\" represent this style of music and are all equally enjoyable tracks, even if the multiple endings do sound somewhat similar.  (I honestly can't remember what the other ending songs sound like.)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  I like Bungou Stray Dogs.  Despite its flaws in its usage with the Guild and a couple pacing issues, Stray Dogs is an excellent example of everything that I like in an anime.  It's got comedy, it's got an overarching plot with character development melded into its plotline, good enough pacing, and Ami Koshimizu.  (Yes, I love her work that much.)  But I think what really stuck to me most was with the note that the series ended on, and just what the characters that we've been following for roughly twenty two episodes have culminated into in the series's climax.  It was a brawl that I loved watching and is the kind of emotional and physical fight that when done right, is exhilarating and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nAs far as personal gripes go, I'm honestly a bit irritated by how much of a Deus-Ex-Machina character that Dazai is.  True he has slipped up in the past, but a lot of his actions have gone so perfectly that I'm a bit \"eh\" on the way things go cause everything that he comes up with goes along well enough that there's little reason to worry about how things will go, no matter how drastic it may be.  (Plus, his ability's pretty OP.  Nullification too stronk.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched Bungou 1 and liked it, well, you should've already watched this.  If you already watched season 1 and were still left wanting more,  then what're you doing sitting around?  Watch it!  As for the Stray Dogs series as a whole, anyone who wants a good shonen story without many of the pitfalls that Shonen anime fall into, then I would suggest giving the Stray Dogs series a shot.  It's got a lot of merit to it, as no one side in the series is completely free from fault, and it shows us that everyone has their own reason to continue forward and live.",

Are they both good? Definitely...but I'll explain just what made season two better.\r\nOk, so, the first 4 episodes are set in the past and we get to learn more about Dazai's, well, past. This includes his relationships and why he's the person he is. I absolutely love this. But it's also this which creates the shift to a darker storyline. After that, it's back to the present. There's tons of action and interesting scenariosand situations in this season as well. While the story of season one was kinda episodic, the story of season two seems more developed and doesn't include elements that were mainly a \"one episode only\" thing such as the cases that they solved in season 1. After they found out who committed the crime, they didn't really go back to those cases.  In season two, everything is more connected. Also, Atsushi's backstory is used in a better way this time. From what I remember, each time it was shown, there was something different which takes away the repetitiveness from season 1.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are better this time around since they were either developed or were made more realistic because they had motivations or at least something that made them interesting. I didn't have a problem with any of the characters in the first place though since they had a little something to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art's amazing as always. The abilities still look cool as heck but, this time, I think the detail that went into making it is more apparent. The animation is great as well. There's no awkwardness or anything that's stiff or weird looking. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack got much better. It was good before but the music this time around just sounded better and seems more memorable. The opening song is just as good as the first and the same goes for the ending song. I really like how they brought back the first ending song for the last episode. All of the music really fits the mood and everything that's going on.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's really easy to just fall in love with this anime. There are so many things that it does a great job at. It's entertaining, contains psychological elements, has great fight scenes, the humor doesn't feel forced, and there are mystery elements. Bungou Stray Dogs Season 2 gets a 10! I'm sure it was obvious that I was going to give that score...",

            "content": "\"Extremely Beautiful, Shockingly Versatile and Diverse!\"\r\nWarning: This review contains typographical and grammatical errors waiting to be criticized. Do not proceed if bothered. Anyways, this is purely my opinion about the show. I let my review speak for itself.\r\nBungou Stray Dogs centers a story about a poor, unemployed, orphan named Nakajima Atsushi who was recklessly kicked out of the orphanage. Mid the series of unfortunate events, he met an eccentric man named Dazai Osamu who is a suicidal maniac and is a current partner of a hot-tempered, organized, idealist, Kunikida Doppo. One second, Atsushi was very thankful of how thoughtful the two are for saving himon a brink of death and starvation but after learning that they are from the Armed Detective Agency, an elite known for solving impossible cases beyond military police can handle and helping citizens of Yokohama from danger, and are in the works to find a man-eating tiger, his expression drastically changed. Caught by his suspiscious act, he is forced to help Dazai and Kunikida capture the creature who's wrecking havoc in the city. From then on, several occasions changed his life forever involving him and the tiger.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Tone/Mood:\\n\r\nAnd now that we are done with the synopsis, let us break down its tone and mood. Bungou Stray Dogs is one of a kind series that does not settle down to a numbered genres. If you already watched it, you might have noticed that it switches from different tones and variations. I do admit I admire it's shapeshifting. It may be shocking but I really found it <on point> and helpful. From a humurous communication styles to a serious, fatal & lethal negotiations, to even the characters' decisions based on the given situations and cases, the series takes you to a roller coaster ride without feeling nauseous but rather exciting, thrilling and unquestionably fascinating. Many animes may have had attempted to input several genres in a series but only a few succeeded in maintaining its spot and uniqueness. Surprisingly, Bungou Stray Dogs survived this dilemma. It can be confusing from another's point of view but it just simply wants to create a huge quality leaving the viewers hanging and wanting for more. It seeks alliance from various shades of flavor to generate a beautiful, decent, yet simple style. The tones are well balanced and if you pay attention to the series or manga, it isn't selfish for explanations. It is certainly its beauty that allows it to mix sorts of elements. If it weren't for it's limitless boundary, it would only be your typical clich\u00e9d mystery-tragedy anime that's forgettable in many aspect and worst case scenario, leaves you a boring impression. Its strategic goal of being diverse and versatile eventually became its assets to make it to the top shelf.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Some tones in the series/manga: \\n\r\n\u300eEntertaining, Mysterious, Serious, Humurous, Sympathetic, Secretive, Ambivalent, Scared, Hopeful, Excited, Sad, Pessimistic, Optimistic, Determined, Sentimental, Egotistical, Philosophical, Thoughtful, Informative, Comical, Nostalgic, Chaos, Impassioned\u300f\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Script/Plot/Arc\\n\r\nIndeed when it comes to exchange of words and arrangement of dialogues, the script is very well-written. Inheriting quotes and works of art characterized by the real-life authors are a very smart move of the mangaka. It isn't really distinctive using counterparts from the real world but it is a very artistic way pulling a series made up of literary motivated acts. For instance, the battle between Armed Detective Agency and Port Mafia involves heavily, dramatic, bloodbath, action, scene stirred by delicate, powerful, confrontational, self-reinforcing and logical lines of the characters. The humurous tag involved in the series isn't that hilarious but gives you a good laugh and rather a relief sigh that the characters can be dangerous but at the same time embarrassingly awkward. It balances well with the other elements considering its main genres. \\n\\n\r\nThe arcs are undeniably challenging and offer incentives such as \"the one who stays at the end will find the story very intriguing and enthralling\". Another example is The Guild Arc and Dazai's past (Both from Season 2), now we are alt+tab in a more serious environment. We see the comical mood fades into view as we are now more exposed of the darker side of the story. More and more villains are introduced and we see ourselves having trust issues. But still the series never really loses its foundation\u2014Diversity/Versatility. The emotions surrounding the different arcs are forsooth saturated and we are given a clear detail of the characters' principles and what and who they are or want to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some argues that it has no actual plot, but the constant fighting for justice and saving people lead us to crave for more (and it is still ongoing for both anime and manga). Moreover, the characters are believable and realistic when socializing, narrating and battling. I wouldn't mind telling you that the manga is doing better and better so I hope for more of Armed Detective Agency, Port Mafia and other known and unknown organizations in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the series by far did not disappoint when it comes to visualizing the characters' past and little backgrounds gathering the conclusion that its script opens opportunities for both the characters and the story plot to improve and grow better than its current state. Kudos for a very good written script!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Sounds & Cinematography:\\n\r\nBefore moving onto the characters, let's first take a look at its cinematography. Some series are totally saved by the animations or cameraworks. And Bungou Stray Dogs is not an exemption. Its cinematography is quite the philisophy of art. It uses various colors that implement different definitions. For example, brown and white are dominant when the mood is pretty stable and used in a normal conversation featuring Armed Detective Agency members. Red and black refers to Port Mafia's activities, positions, and abilities while Yellow and Green represents the power and theme of The Guild organization.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP from Seasons 1 and 2 have an excellent remarks to display. Every angle has different transitions that suits the mood of the video. The color matches the characters and the setting. It has accurate speed for actions, enough spoiler, good exposure time for the involved characters that make the viewers drop their jaws. It uses faded, darker filters and heavy amount of vignette expressing its action-mystery genre. The lightings and backgrounds prove its instagrammable status and shout aesthetics. The use of color neon green wallpapered the actions intelligently and highlights the important details that need attention. The sound is used esthetically organized by drums and electric guitars & such, (and of course Chuuya's voice yas!), Granrodeo and SCREEN Mode fearlessly gave it a wonderful performance. Trash Candy and Reason Living are your energetic and pretty catchy soundtracks you wouldn't miss whilst watching Bungou Stray Dogs.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the ending songs, compared to the opening songs, sit down to one filter for a feed. If you observe them, it focuses on blue and white colors maintaining the balance between peace and acceptance combined with dramatic lyrics of Luck Life's \"Namae wo Yobuyo\" and \"Kaze ga Fuku Machi\". The message brought by the songs are heavily filled with emotions and drives, and thus, obviously, can put you to tears. (IT IS SO TOUCHING THAT I PERSONALLY PUT IT IN MY PLAYLIST and play it everyday when I come to school). In other words, the ending songs are really, really heartwarming as the singers and the band delivered it beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up its sounds and cinematography, Bungou Stray Dogs states a perfect presentation, status, and position.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOut of all the areas I'm assessing, Bungou Stray Dogs' characters are its triumph card. From being <Gifted> and having an incredible ability to bringing life to the famous authors and their works, Asagiri has executed his characters very well. Their visuals and arts are highly clean and decent from the costumes they wear and the weapons they use. Despite introducing numerous characters from different arcs, I personally believe that everyone of them had made enough screen time and allowed the viewers and readers to adore and determine who they are. Though some of them has longer amount of exposure, it borrows us distance to recall the newest and recent characters. For example, taking the time of your life indulging the Anne of Abyssal Red ability, Rashomon, Beast Beneath the Moonlight, No Longer Human, Thou Shalt Not Die, Undefeated by the Rain, or Ultra Deduction, you'll find yourself being enchanted by other amazing abilities such as Perfect Crime, Dangai, The Great Old Ones, or Crime and Punishment.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Protagonist: \\n\r\nThe MC is kind, sentimental and genuinely cares for others because of his traumatic past that promotes us the benefit-of-the-doubt to hold on to his story longer as he proves himself he isn't just \"good-for-nothing\" to the readers and viewers. His repeated torture scenes and deja vus from his past is forgivable considering teenagers are frequently fragile. Believe it or not, it's kind of impressing because Atsushi represents millenials' moodswings and treacherous decisions. I really, really like the way Asagiri describes Atsushi. He deserves to be a protagonist despite the fact that Dazai had one of the best screen time and story. I believe this is because of his relatable past and personality.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Supporting Characters and Antagonist/s:\\n\r\nFrom my perspective, the villains as well as the side characters acted their roles the way the story wants them to and I did not feel any annoying overpowered (which is sometimes exhausting) aura among them. Each has their own SWOT Analysis\u2014 Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, which is really marvelous and wonderful. In the case of Dazai's ability, it is proven in both manga and anime that he is the most powerful among ability users but is weak in comes of physical combat and other aspect. On account of that he only temporarily nullifies ability when he touches the target. (Still, I love Dazai!)\\n\\n\r\nI hereby announce that Bungou Stray Dogs is proven... GUILTY for being ambitious and versatile, collaborating such concepts that are admirable and therefore successfully creating a well-desired product that will secure its sustained competitive advantage.\\n\\n\r\nSO STAN LEGENDS, STAN BUNGOU STRAY DOGS!",

            "content": "And so...the story continues.....\r\nActually not quite since the first half of the second season of Bungou Stray Dogs is a prequel involving Dazai in his time in the Port Mafia. But nonetheless even the first half is quite intriguing as we didn't know much about Dazai's Port Mafia days. The second half?...is the \"conclusion\" to the war against the Agency and the Port Mafia but it quickly changes as another powerful organization called the Guild comes and wrecks havoc to both organizations, thus more literary superhumans!!!.\r\nOk, let's start quite obviously with the first half, Dazai's Port Mafia days, really in brings into focus at toWHY Dazai left Port Mafia in the first place by going into an overly detailed backstory with some of Dazai's friends among the Port Mafia, the ones being Sakunosuke Oda voiced by Junichi Sawabe and Ango Sakaguchi voiced by Jun Fukuyama. Really, the basis of even having a PREQUEL in your second season at the start would at first is ok, again getting to know Dazai's mysterious past in Port Mafia, but where this prequel felt like it had a bit of a fault would go to how long this backstory for Dazai is, ohhh LA gets why this backstory is somewhat essential to Dazai's relationship to the Port Mafia as well as giving crucial character development to Dazai's insists to dodge this backstory and still lingers even after he left and becomes a somewhat plotline in the second half, but it just felt like it went one episode too long, but it's LA nitpicking at best for this. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half really reigns in all the organizations (Agency, Guild and Port Mafia) embroiled into a civil war where Kyouka, Ryuunosuke Akutagawa, Atsushi and the newer character in the forefront Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald voiced by Takahiro Sakurai all mixed into this. Atsushi does goes through some forced regression/confused morals in character development about him wanting to be \"useful\" which is compounded by Kyouka's involvement to the Guild making it all the more straining to Atsushi. Akutagawa more or less still has his goal from the first season and again at it out for Atsushi and the newest villain Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald are a catalyst to all this happening. The second half does dedicate episodes to the previous members of the Agency and the Port Mafia (like Ranpo and his newest rival Edgar Allan Poe, Chuuya Nakahara though he's an outlier by having character development in both \"arcs\" due to him being a former friend of Dazai in the Port Mafia in which they take on John Steinbeck and Lovecraft (no seriously)).\\n\\n\r\nReally if anything goes by with character development we wanted more from both \"arcs\", we get a plethora of them from all sides (Agency and the Port Mafia mainly, The Guild at best Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald gets the major focus of it, the rest are \"powers = personality\" due to the vast amount of characters the Guild even has, it made sense to focus on the major villain of this season).\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, where once again done by Studio Bones, well it's essentially the same aesthetics it had from the shounen-esque character designs but having those chibi animation during comedic moments, again LA think LA covered this in LA's first season review, Bungou Stray Dogs 2 has same flavour it had in the first season, just ramp up the amount of CRAZY battles especially during the final 2 episodes. Really not much to say about the second season's animation, it's as consistent as it's first season.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, well due to the second season having to get Atsushi along with Sakunosuke Oda goes through some vocal range in this second season, LA could be spouting LOTS of voice actors to did great in their literary superhuman roles but LA will say at least three at got LA's attention, bringing in a favourite from these three are hard enough so, *ahem*, Yuto Uemura as Atsushi, Sumire Morohoshi as Kyouka and going wild card here but Shunsuke Takeuchi as the creepy Lovecraft.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending did a slight bait switch during the climax of the anime and the \"final battle\" although was brilliantly animated and pumped full of adrenaline, the bait and switch it pulled, it kinda went to \"happy ending\" for the majority of the cast it went to and let's not forgot the \"NEW VILLAIN\" it added in goading to have another season on this, which seemed it also \"ruined\" the happy ending as it just another day at the office for the Agency. The ending really did kinda puzzled LA. Did they \"want a happy ending\" or \"ruin it by shoving in a new villain and obviously hinting at a third season, thus WON'T be a happy ending anyways\"...having a third season wouldn't be bad, but again \"puzzled\" is all LA can say about the finale of the second season. Ohhh and the ending also added in the \"according to plan\" remarks that lead it down to the ending it went to that although clever, could have been a bit more subtle about it.\\n\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs second season as both a prequel and a continuation of the first season has it's strengths in it's vast vast VAST amount of characters as well as bringing in the focus to it's main characters of Atsushi, Dazai and Akutagawa, but also it's weaknesses in bringing in a new organization filled with even more characters to that. By all means LA felt that the second season did better than it's previous season in terms of character and plot focus reigning in character involvement to a greater and bigger picture, but it also almost discards first season characters along with some of it's newer characters, sure some episodes were dedicated to the supporting and newer villains but with it's focus squarely on the bigger picture especially during the second half (The first half is rather an exception as it develops Dazai as a character as well as Sakunosuke and Ango and is has a cohesive narrative concerning these characters, the second half just has SOO many characters under differing factions and betrayals and indecisiveness, it's hard to keep up) and if the final scenes of that the ending is to go by, it's hinting at a third season, LA felt like the second season should have kept it's \"happy ending\" and end it on a high, instead of goading this anime for more. Nonetheless, if you wanted more from Bungou Stray Dogs, after Bungou Stray Dogs' first season just started to get good, then quite easily watch it, especially if you want to know more about Dazai, as for the second half, well besides developing Atsushi and Akutagawa...it'll vary on how you look at it. For LA, it's second season has it's strengths and weaknesses from it's characters in general, but LA will say merely because of Dazai's backstory, it did better than it's first season at the very best.",

            "content": "I personally enjoyed Bungou Stray Dogs a lot....It may not be the greatest anime out there but it definitely is a great one! \r\nIt\u2019s not your typical anime as you\u2019ll hardly find cliched moments and it\u2019s the uniqueness which makes it a must watch if you\u2019re into these type of genres. One thing which stood out for me is how all the characters are named after prolific writers and their abilities are named after the works of those writers. For example, Nathanial Hawthorne\u2019s (character) ability is the scarlet letter, Osamu Dazai\u2019s is No longer human and so on.\r\nI just loved how they portrayed these booksas abilities \\n\r\nAnd it was really interesting learning about all these Japanese and English authors and their works in a fun way.\\n\r\nPlus they quote lines from the books here and there which i really liked. I\u2019d definitely check out the books too!\\n\r\nI got to learn a lot of things from the characters. They say really deep things which had me in awe. So it definitely is a deep anime. You need to read between the lines as well as there\u2019s too much being said indirectly. \\n\r\nThe art and animation are really good and the action scenes are very well done too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne shortcoming that I\u2019d point out is that it may seem fast paced at first but I was personally ok with it \\n\r\nAs you\u2019ve already seen the first season is just character introduction, each episode is about a character but things get heated up in season 2\\n\r\nThe first 4 episodes of season 2 show Dazai\u2019s past story. Dazai is my favourite character and I wouldn\u2019t have minded seeing more of his episodes but I was a bit hesitant because I was wondering if the whole season would deal with Dazai\u2019s back story...But thankfully the main story line continued after ep 16. Also I think adding Dazai\u2019s back story at the start of season 2 was a good step. It explained a lot about him and his attitude and we get to see the references in later episodes.\\n\r\nAlso I wish the whole guild arc was a bit longer because it felt a bit rushed towards the end but even though it was rushed it was done nicely and not abruptly \\n\\n\r\nSo the question, should you watch it?!\\n\r\nI\u2019d say absolutely! And if you haven\u2019t seen season 1 then definitely watch it\\n\r\nThe characters are great and even the villain characters are great. I didn\u2019t dislike any of them.\\n\r\nThe osts are nice too especially the endings\\n\r\nSo If you\u2019re looking for something new and unique then definitely give it a try\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s my first time writing a review so I would be happy if this can be of any help :)",

            "content": "So far this is the 1st anime to end for this winter season of 2016 (I think) and now a new season begins on 2017. What we have here isn't much of a new season but a combination of a prequel, referring to Dazai's past , up to a continuation of the fist season, where a 3rd party comes in, called the \"Guild.\" So in all aspects , this is how I rated it:\r\nStorywise, is was very good when we were introduce to Dazai's past as to how he came to be, it was even better when a new party comes crashing in between theAgency and the Port Mafia. You could say that the genre did played the way it was suppose to be so kudos to anime writer Y\u014dji Enokido, so , it's a very good 8, here.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise: pretty decent, don't expect any zettai ryoki around here, nor any panty flash from Akiko Yosano, Ky\u014dka Izumi, Kirako Haruno, Naomi Tanizaki, Kouyou Ozaki, Louisa May Alcott and Margaret Mitchell, But fashionwise, the cooler ones are Dazai, Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald,  Ch\u016bya Nakahara and Doppo Kunikida. The dorky ones were, Ranpo Edogawa who kinda looks like a awful mix of Sherlock and a Scottsman, Akiko Yosano, could have been the sexy femme fatal , but wasn't exploited, too bad she could have been the eye candy here, the same goes with  Kouyou Ozaki and Margaret Mitchell , they, also, if illustrated as sexy risque eye candy would have added some spice to this anime's art. Aktugawa's fashion on the other hand, has that poor combination of goth and Dracula outlook, and I really don't get the long thing behind Nakajima's pant's , I mean , is that a very long belt or some string that needs snipping? So it's a decent 4 for this category. \\n\\n\r\nSound, though, I have no comment as who did the character's voice, I simply attribute a very good 8 for the opening theme, \"REASON LIVING\" by  Screen. It definitely matches the anime itself.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter, it was as mediocre as number 4, since they're the same character from the 1st season, also, the characters themselves, were the usual people with special abilities who were either trying to be heroes or just running amuck, Also, I kinda hate it that creator Kafka Asagiri, has to named them after famous literally authors, where it kinda desecrate them in big way, since they don't look like people who would resort to such violence in real life.....I think. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, it was a god 7 but.....not very good , since it left us with another villain in the name of   Fyodor Dostoyevsky, so in this anime it may be a clean open ending, it really wasn't, that clean, since only two Guild member who met his demise, and the rest were just allowed to go free as it nothing happens, so in this anime's overall it was fair enough to be a 6 and that' as far as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Holidays to everyone.",

            "content": "Boy oh boy, it's that time of the year where anime seasons end left and right and it's time to write up some reviews.\r\nBungou Stray Dogs 2 picks up right where season 1 left us after a weird final episode that was half filler and half plot. I was actually really hyped for this season, having read the manga and knowing what was to come. Did it live up to my hype?\r\nYes. No. Kinda. Hear me out on this.\r\nWarning: Slight spoilers for season 1 but I am assuming you finished it if you think about watching this season anyway.\r\nStory:\r\nWith the way the season is structuredI would like to say that despite the description of the season, Bungou Stray Dogs 2 is not completely a sequel to Bungou Stray Dogs season 1. It is part a prequel and a sequel, with the first four episodes being about Dazai and his friend Osadaku four years prior to the series while everything after that takes place after season 1.\\n\\n\r\nI make that distinction because story wise those two parts are very different beasts.\\n\\n\r\nBeing based on the second light novel, the first four episodes show Dazai when he was still in the mafia. He and Odasaku try to find their mutual friend Ango who went missing. It\u2019s part mystery, part thriller, part action and it\u2019s every bit intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of that short arc is told really well, with every episode filled with twist that felt so tight that I had to take a nap each time I finished one. I learnt later that the Odasaku arc is a fan favourite and it shows with how beautifully it\u2019s translated into animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside of that arc is though that since it takes up four episodes, the rest of the series has to suffer for it. Right after the mini-arc ends the story picks up where season 1 left off: the Guild is right at the Agency\u2019s doorstep and a three way war on it\u2019s way. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fantastic setting worthy of cool fights and character development but it falls short. A lot of things happen in this arc, from characters being introduced to dynamics of some of the established characters changing but with the little time they had it felt very rushed which not only made the plot and characters feel a lot less substantial but also created a few plot holes that the viewer had to guess to fill out.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t help that it sometimes feels the director threw pacing out of the window in favour of pretty stylistic shots. I will go into it later but they leave a lot of blank space where the characters don\u2019t really do anything. It messed up the pacing a lot, making you pause instead feeling natural to the progression of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the mini arc in the beginning is great but is sadly pulled down by the actual plot of the season. Which isn\u2019t terrible by any means just\u2026 not that great. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nOkay, the for what the story lacks it makes up in artistry and I really mean that. The character models are fantastic, the shots of Yokohama gorgerous and the animation as top notch as season 1. Colours and style are used to emphasize characters and their actions to beautiful effect. It\u2019s an overall solid looking anime which is a feast to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nExcept for those artistic shots I mentioned. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they are gorgerous and pretty to look at but their placement just feels\u2026 off. You can see it best in the opening and ending where right after strong and beautiful shots the animation just\u2026 stops and turns slow. Where there could be movement or progression like the music implies we instead have static images with subtle movement. It\u2019s not exciting or engaging it\u2019s just there to be pretty and be there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s a problem that occurs a lot outside of the Odasaku arc. It makes the animation, while pretty, lack impact and feel anti-climatic. I can\u2019t say if it\u2019s due to the directing or art design but it\u2019s not good and definitely a minus. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nTry as I might, I can\u2019t find any flaws with the soundtrack. It\u2019s great music used to great effect in the series. The opening and ending especially are gorgerous and I listen to them all the time.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, that is only for the Odasaku arc though. The rest of the season, while still great, misses a lot of the beats, pun not intended, that the mini arc had. The blend in of the ending at the end of episodes stands out especially, feeling a bit off at times, as if it set in just a bit too early. The set in of the opening also feels a bit off sometimes as well as if the producers didn\u2019t quite know where to place it themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a game breaker and the usage of the rest of the soundtrack is still good but it does earn a bit of a minues. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, again I have to draw a clear line between the Odasaku arc and the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of it\u2019s focus on two characters, four if you count Ango and the villain, each character is given enough attention to know who they are, what their motivation and what their role in the story is. Each of their actions has an impact and all of them get their ending, whether we like how their ending is or not.\\n\\n\r\nWe might not know a lot of those characters besides Dazai and hell we don\u2019t even know that much about Dazai either now that I think about it, but we know enough. Enough to care about them and worry about their dreams and aspirations.\\n\\n\r\nThe main series on the other hand gets the short end of the stick. A lot of characters are introduced and each of them have interesting abilities and personalities on their own but the anime just doesn\u2019t have the time to introduce them properly. Yes, they do get introductions but they are very rushed and don\u2019t quite have the impact they deserve.\\n\\n\r\nEven the established characters don\u2019t get away because even they get shafted to the side to instead rush the story along. Things that should have huge impacts on the motivations and relationships of characters leave a lot of things out or clumsily execute them to the point that it feels like none of it matters. It\u2019s a real shame because even in the moments when it\u2019s supposed to be their time to shine, the characters need to take a backseat to the pacing which means that less time is spent on them as characters and more on their fighting which is over in minutes.\\n\\n\r\nIt really hurts me to do this because I love these characters but I can\u2019t really overlook the rushed nature of it all. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIt might not sound that way with the way I gripe on this series, but I do truly enjoy it. I enjoy watching characters based on authors duke it out out with their superpowers. I enjoy watching the characters struggle against their morals and adversaries. I really enjoy all these various characters with various powers coming together and see what would happen.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the pacing and character development issues it has, I truly enjoy this series because I enjoy the characters. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nI really love Bungou Stray Dogs. It\u2019s a fascinating concept and this series does well to build on what season 1 created. It has flaws, many, many flaws, but it\u2019s still really good. The Odasaku arc almost makes up for the pacing issues in the rest of the series but only almost. If you can stomach bad pacing but great characters that sadly don\u2019t get the attention they deserve but with great animation and visuals, then this is definitely worth a watch.",

The plot became much more generic and mainstream that it didn't reflect well on that amazing prequel arc i just watched. Finishing the season i was Disappointed and would've loved if they continued with the dark and gritty stuff with the port mafia.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nI love the art, it's one of the best things in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nIt's good\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters oh my gosh, I love everyone in the prequel arc.\\n\r\nThe current timeline guys are pretty boring and are the anchor of this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI'm half and half on it but the prequel arc really saved it for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this season and was a great improvement over season 1, but the story for Atsushi needs to be much better.",

            "content": "Well, why I liked Bungou Stray Dogs Second Season so much? Because they adapted few of my favourite writers in a way that left me speechless. \r\nI'm an hardcore reader (especially books) and when it comes to literature... well, everything is just fine for me. But! There is always a but. ,\r\nLet's start from the bottom. The story: we are left where the first season ended and that's quite normal for an ordinary season like Bungou Stray Dogs (BSD from now on). All the characters return on screen and they are not changed. If you are reading this review and you have not seen thefirst season, well, why are you reading it, then?\\n\r\nReturning to the point: the story goes just fine. The ending is a bit wow! But not too much. In fact, i'll say that the story of BSD is the only \"weak spot\" that the anime has. \\n\r\nBut, even in its weak spot, BSD can surprise us: the beginning of the season is a little diamond. I loved it. (Especially because i found some references to my real life, as a reader.)\\n\r\nBut it's, however, an ordinary story in the anime world. \\n\r\nClimbing the ladder, there is the art: quite enjoyable. I liked it. Smooth, sometimes darker, sometimes lighter. \\n\r\nSound: songs, background themes, sounds, voices were just fine. Nice job in adapting the manga. Nice job, really. \\n\r\nHere we come at the juicy part: Characters! All the characters in BSD are based on real writers of the XIX and XX century. Japanese and non, the characters are imaginary created on the real authors that at their time founded literary movements and new thinking stream (such as HP Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, Fitzgerald, Dazai, Izumi Kyouka etc...). The author created, also, powers for each, based on their work (No Longer Human - Dazai, for example is a classic Japanese). That's, for me, a paradise, a valhalla. I managed to discover so many authors, poet and writers that I... \\n\r\nBack to the ground, folks. I loved the characters because they are not the classic \"oh another normal character\". They are created with a reason in mind: entertain. Even secondary ones.\\n\r\nBut for the non-hardcore readers like me, BSD can be, in my opinion, a bit boring. As the story reveals its secret, one can easily predict the future of the season. For me it's a plain 10, for personal reason, but for another would be a modest rating. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: well, i think that I explained myself enough in the previous point. I say only that i enjoyed watching BSD.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: BSD II is not just the ordinary sequel for another ordinary work. If you could search a bit deeper, you could find that BSD hide something bigger: a memory. Memory of those who created the modern literature. And if you don't want to search (because you have the right to say \"no, I want to watch BSD and not giving a brick about anything\") you would, however, enjoy a nicely done work. \\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: Just a bit piece of spoiler ahead (Dont worry it wont even count as a spoiler, nothing that big)\r\nLet me begin, by saying that I am not one of those people (no offence) that will give this season a higher rating, just because we got to see Dazai's past. \r\n-Story\r\n The second season was well written compared to the first. This might come in a little off because of my foreword but, Dazai's past is my favourite arc. Because of everything begins from there.\r\n I guess we could say that the first season was just for introducing the characters, and giving you ideas asto what it may revolve around. The second season is where things get serious. Even if I say serious, the light-heartedness of some aspects of the anime still remain. \\n\r\n-Art\\n\r\n The art was very well done, as expected of Bones. The fight scenes, facial expressions, and the one thing I love: their eyes. Colorful/colourful little stuff right there.\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\n One of the things I also love about this anime is...they have all of my favourite voice actors! Great voice actors in a great anime? Man, that's a must watch (For Durarara fans: its fun seeing Kida/Dazai still being a womanizer, and Izaya/Ranpo changing job, from an information broker to a super detective) The voice acting is perfect, no need to worry about that (because I know the feeling, that frustrating moment where the VA's doesn't follow the character's personality, importantly, their expressions) The OST's are good, especially that epic music of when the Port Mafia's about to do a badass thing is a must listen.\\n\r\n-Character\\n\r\n The hugest, if not the the greatest, element of the whole story. Can you just imagine, how one character's appearence or their way of living would not be present if it wasn't for an another character. Oda Sakunosuke, friend of Dazai, literally became my favourite character, even if he had only like, 3 or 4 episodes of screen time. Because of him, everything happened. If it wasn't for him, Dazai would not be in the Agency, Im sure he would still be in Port Mafia, sinking deeper and deeper in to the dark side, eventually unable to see or reach the bright side anymore. If Dazai was not present in the Agency, then we wouldn't see our main protagonist, Atsushi in the Agency. He would probably be already dead, because of how he has bounty on his head and being unaware of his powers. And if Atsushi was not in the Agency, we wouldn't see our dear Kyouka being brought to the bright side. She would probably have already killed more than 35 people. Or we might not even see her at all. Just imagine, if all that happened, what would become of the anime? That is just how big of an impact Oda has in the anime. \\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\n I enjoyed it very much, and is looking forward to a season 3, if there ever will be one. You will get a hint (or just a bad joke, hope its not) as to whether there might a one or not at the end of the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall its a 8/10 from me :) \\n\r\nHappy watching!",

I don't have much to say about this anime, because it explains itself and it is just an amazing anime.\r\nStory:\r\nI like it that three organisations fight against each other and that each person has different powers. There is a lot of comedy in it too especially with Osamu Dazai XD, who tries to commit suicide all the time but it never works in a comedy way. \r\nCharacters:\r\nCharacters like Dazai or Akutagawa are really cool, because of the way of their personality and the bonds they have witheach other. They are like one big family who care for each other and protect each other.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this an 8 because of the good comedy which is in it and the action in general which is also good because of their different powers.",

The rest of the season continues where they left off from season 1 the was exceptionally thrilling the action and the battles you get a rush of adrenaline. The plot line was a emotional mess cause it sad, happy, exciting, nerve-wrecking and hilarious throughout the seasonand you can't stop watching it. My personal highlight was the character development, the characters through their faults and weaknesses they grow strong. Be the good guys or the bad guys they keep fighting for something they love which is admirable. Overall every aspect of the story was fantastic.",

            "content": "This one is short review I copy from my blog. ( Visit here for more detailed version but contains spoiler \u00bb http://rui-anime.weebly.com/ruis-anime-blog/bungou-stray-dogs-s2-review-spoiler )\r\nThe ending of Season 1 was hanging with the emergence from Port Mafia boss & The Guild member. Back then, I was thinking that Bungou Stray Dogs [\u6587\u8c6a\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30c3\u30b0\u30b9] Season 1 would be 24 episodes rather than 12 episodes to continue the story. The fate rang another option. Season 2 announced when the hype of the 1st season was still in the air. My expectation for Season 2 definitely, as Mori-san said in the last episode of the 1st, \u201cchallenging wartime situation\u200b,\u201d with newcomersenter the battle field of the Gifted.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT: 9\\n\r\nIn brief the 2nd season of Bungou Stray Dogs is divided into two parts. The first part elucidates Dazai\u2019s past experience. It is not just a quick glance in an episode, it takes more than two episodes for past life events only. Gladly we\u2019re offered by Dazai\u2019s past that contains several information (which has relation now) and insight to characters as the members of Port Mafia. This past experience of his life has a strong relation with what happens now in the background after 4 years of it. The second part, of course, is all about war XD whoopsie not really but yesh I guess. The second part of it has several issues: where does Kyouka belong?; the fight over Atsushi; the fight among three Gifted organizations; and some of characters intimacy (reunion).\\n\\n\r\nThe flash-forward or flashback chronological order is like a peek-a-boo, I felt mocked when I was waiting for the explanation of what The Guild ulterior motive really is as they appeared in the last episode of Season 1. But, it\u2019s just awhile I felt like that. I absorbed by the storyline of this kind of flashback and sat quietly to watch each episode. The flashback succeed to make correlation in the past and present of current characterizations and events. The masterpiece parts of this series happen after that. All of the fight, troublesome issues, brilliant strategies, advices, characters development, and of course for action-supranatural anime, the visualization aspect. The story if I can say in a phrase, is, splendid like games of mind.\\n\\n\r\nART & CHAR DEV: 9 & 10\\n\r\nThe past experience of Dazai appeared to be sullen with dark and shades, not much details in the surrounding I could find there. I think the focus is only for the story itself. Jump up to the current situation with fucking tension everywhere, the comedy scenes are less than the previous season. There aren\u2019t many silly scenes (which is appropriate for such complicated situation, but I miss the comedy parts like the 1st season). The visualization is much more appealing than the first season. I don\u2019t know which is the most suitable reason for it, but I guess it\u2019s because the anime is also embedded feelings in it. So many feelings (but not an emotional one). Sometimes I even got motivated by it, or sometimes touched. Even if the series has so many characters, even more than the first season, I gave it two-thumbs up for being able to cover their roles in right parts. Every major characters development can be seen clearly, particularly their self. The main supporting roles assist the major characters development as well as the sequence of issues. The minor supporting roles are still there, with momentary scenes but fill up well. I never expected about the very reasoning of a few characters act or say for the things they do, they have firm mindset and value about things. The character development is intently mesmerizing, one after another. Since we are being served with also the past life of the organizations here we can grab more the information about the relationship between them (their potential connection). even their mindset all pouring in 12 eps of second season. Such a large amount of chars but presented in a fucking right portion unexpectedly. The visualization is supported by characters development is in line with the problematic troubles that must be beared, The pressure is real. The visualization is magnificent. I still recall many scenes there.\\n\r\n\u200b\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nOP Theme Song is sung by SCREEN mode, \u201cReason Living\u201d. I love it in an instant, the lyrics are great as it should be. Check it out MV SCREEN mode - Reason Living. The ED song is sung by Luck Life. Luck Life also sang the theme song for Bungou Stray Dogs 1st season. Meanwhile, \u201cNamae wo Yobu yo\u201d in the 1st season is more relaxing, the ED theme song for the 2nd season, \u201cKaze ga Fuku Machi (\u98a8\u304c\u5439\u304f\u8857)\u201d is an upbeat one. Luck Life is not disappointing me even with the upbeat song, MV Kaze ga Fuku Machi. If you\u2019re looking for the lyric, the song portrays the inner-self of characters in Bungou Stray Dogs precisely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s definitely common to find such a promising series got supported for Season 3. I wish this one is going to be that way too. 9++! All hail Bungou Stray Dogs series, I\u2019m considering to join fandom now /slapped/.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Those freaking animation. better than the well-made 1st season\\n\r\n- More competitive story and supporting by balanced char dev. It\u2019s a mind game. the series drives me crazy (hyped up when watch it)\\n\r\n- Nice theme songs",

Maybe it's because I don't speak Japanese, the subtitels sometimes go to fast or because English isn't my first language, but I completely missed the memo that it was a flashback and thought nothing made sense. It took me 3 episodes to find out it was a flashback.\r\nI also thought the flashback was.. boring. Then again, maybe it's just me because I like action and the flashback was 90%talking.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the flashback stopped, I was confused again because I forgot what happened at the end of the first season. I had finished the first season the evening before I started watching the second season, but the flashback just completely got me out of it.\\n\\n\r\nBut the second season did not disappoint me besides that flashback. The new characters were just as amazing as the others and I couldn't stop watching.

            "content": "A Bungou Stray Dogs (2nd season) Review - Rewritten and Revised\r\nSpoiler-free if you have watched the first season, not so much if you haven't.\r\nTL;DR: A lot more serious and darker than the first season. Absolute improvement from what the first season offered.\r\n1st arc (13-16): Osamu Dazai and the Dark Era\r\n2nd Arc (17-20): Guild Arc; Double Black\r\n3rd Arc (21-24): Yin and Yang Arc\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFor the people who never watched Bungou Stray Dogs:\r\nWhat\u2019re you doing here? Go watch the first season.\r\nIf you were to ask me if I suggest watching Bungou Stray Dogs:\r\nWould I tell you Bungou Stray Dogs 1st season was great? Absolutely not.\r\nWould I tell youBungou Stray Dogs 2nd season was great? Absolutely.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe people I\u2019ve met back then made who I am now\u201d\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc is a prequel to the anime. It really shows you what happened in Dazai\u2019s past, including the people that were involved in his past. What\u2019s the best part about it though, it shows a darkness in which the first season is incomparable to. It\u2019s a very large difference, but also an enjoyable one at that. There\u2019s a lot more emotion put into this, and it\u2019s not so focused on terribly dark humor in which the first season pulled often. I\u2019m not saying there weren\u2019t any serious moments in the first season, though. What has been shown to us is actually some very heavy stuff for this part of the \u201csecond season.\u201d The story so far, in basic terms, is well brought out explanation to what happened to Dazai in the past and what he was involved in.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc might just be the most serious arc of the series. It continues where the story of the first season left off, and boy how it manifested the darkness in which the first season was leading up to. There's a new sinister feel in the air, in which there seems to be a war between the three organizations: The Guild, Port Mafia, and the Armed Detective Agency. There will be many more thrills to arrive, making me eagerly wait for each new episode of the week.\\n\\n\r\nThe third arc.. Was a phenomenal arc. It shows you that there\u2019s such a big difference between Atsushi Nakajima and Ryuunosuke Akutagawa, yet it is as if they\u2019re the same person. The goals that they seek to achieve are relevant, but from a far standpoint, they seemed so different. It was very well done, and I am glad they focused on that heavily in this arc. A very well done arc to end the series. \\n\\n\r\nBetween the three arcs in this second season, despite me saying that the third arc was phenomenal, the first arc was the absolute best arc. Oda Sakunosuke was the most notable character in this second season, despite him having only four episodes of screentime in the entire series. What that man goes through in this arc could be seen to reflect who Dazai became.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe high point of the series. Each character that is introduced into this series have their own strong resolve. The same characters that appeared in the first season took onto the screen again, along with the new group of people called The Guild. I will mostly be speaking about four extremely notable characters, no particular order of their notability. However, there is one character I found to be the best.\\n\\n\r\n1. Dazai Osamu. A well-developed character.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was seen as a very forced-comedic character with his forced-comedic suicidal attempts, turned to be one of the most beloved characters in the overall series. When he runs outside the range of the forced comedy, Dazai takes a dive into adult maturity, and becomes a very serious character in this second season. A very strong man, who was forced to witness too many things that a person really should not. A Port-Mafia blooded character, and the most Port Mafia-blooded character. Despite that being so, he becomes the most resolved individuals to walk across the screen in this series, and takes the trophy of being able to impress me with the improvement he receives. His reasons to his development made me see him as a very well-written character.\\n\\n\r\n2. Atsushi Nakajima. The main character. Yin of the duo.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is it like being kicked out of the orphanage? What is it like to be outcasted? Atsushi eventually grew to have a very strong drive in saving people who are outcasted. He learns what it means to be outcasted, and it makes him such a wonderful character. It is especially shown in this second season what he mentally goes through whenever he tries to do well for others, and it is spectacular. His resolve is trying to do well for others, as a way to approve himself. Despite his hatred for Ryuunosuke, it is as if those two were the same person in terms of resolve. Speaking of which.\\n\\n\r\n3. Ryuunosuke Akutagawa. Reflection of Atsushi. Yang of the duo.\\n\\n\r\nA powerful young man with a strong resolve, to prove to people who he truly is. A man who seeks approval from a specific audience. The absolute reflection of Nakajima Atsushi in terms of how they wish to achieve their resolve. He constantly pesters Atsushi with what seemed to be a self-righteous complex. However, it comes time to time where his true character was revealed, and it makes him become more notable every time. He means well for himself, but in Atsushi\u2019s eyes, it seemed not so. But, indeed, they were aiming for the same resolve.\\n\\n\r\n4.Oda Sakunosuke. Reason to Dazai\u2019s development. The best character.\\n\r\n\u201cMy throat hurt. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I heard someone screaming. I realized, because my throat hurt so much, that I was the one who was screaming.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOda Sakunosuke is one of the biggest reasons I could say that this season takes a dark turn. Everything this man goes through was absolutely dreadful, and it makes me sympathize his character. It releases his resolve, and is done so well when the big fight with him occurred. He had a very strong relationship with Dazai Osamu, and everything that Dazai Osamu does was due to him meeting this man. I was able to emotionally invest myself into this character, despite him having to appear only for four episodes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the other characters, most of them you find out why they are doing what they do in the first season, especially for the Armed Detective Agency. The formidable groups they have to go against are Port Mafia and The Guild. They all show to have extremely powerful individuals who are intelligent, and very-well experienced in defending their group. How will the Armed Detective Agency deal with these people?\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nStudio Bones decided for this second season that it was time to take a dive in their budget. The animation quality is such a beautiful improvement, it\u2019s like watching a beautiful painting constantly being made in front of my eyes. You can SEE the improvement in their budget when it comes to their animation. A spectrum of vivid colors being brought together so beautifully. The OP and ED\u2019s do not disappoint for this factor, either.\\n\\n\r\nWhen a sinister air reeks onto the battlefield, the animation matches the intensity so well. The atmosphere, comparing the two seasons, it is like the second season came from an absolutely different studios. It invokes what this season was trying to display and it is magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP has a very excited pace, in which they display each one of the groups within the story. I personally loved looking at the opening.\\n\\n\r\nThe symbolism in the ED between the three characters: Atsushi, Ryuunosuke, and Osamu. It heavily displays the relationship between the three, and it is stunning. It shows the development that occurs over time in the series, as it heavily focuses on the color blue, Dazai\u2019s straps, and blood. I thought it was stunning visuals.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, again, shows the improvement of studio Bones\u2019 budget. The voice acting is so well done, it is as if you can\u2019t tell if the actors ARE these characters. The most notable voice acting is Oda Sakunosuke. When everything takes place, the emotions being put into the voice acting by his seiyuu is exquisite, absolutely well-done. The voice acting for many of the characters changed so much in this second season. They come to take a very serious tone, especially Osamu and Atsushi. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were very catchy, and they fit very well to the atmosphere this second season has. The OP was done by the same people who made *Cough cough Musaigen no Phantom World cough* opening. However, they also did the Food Wars 2nd season opening, which I thought was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the OST, it gave off such a mafia-like vibe, which is definitely manifested within the story, so the OST very-well matched the second season\u2019s atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI personally love having my heart twisted around, and this second season doesn\u2019t hesitate at any cost in doing so. It is much more focused on the dark aspects than the first season, which had dry comedy about suicide, trying to be dark-humor based. The second season takes a very mature approach, which I found to be extremely enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.95\\n\r\nMature, dark, and spicy. Those are the three words I have for the second season. I\u2019m very amazed at the difference between first and second season. It focuses on more of an emotional aspect, while also being very dark. The first season is very mission focused, but the second season strongly focuses on the development of the characters and story. I think it did a great job in being able to have me emotionally invested into the story. Was it enough for me to think this story was great? Absolutely. Hopefully, it can do so for you too.",

            "content": "After watching the first season of Bungou Stray Dogs, I have to admit that the author made a rather bold attempt at constructing such a show based on literal characters. At its core, the series has an extraordinary cast of characters. By that, I mean they are able to perform supernatural feats that defies the logic of nature. The second season can also be described as extraordinary in more ways than one.\r\nOne of the most unique dynamics about Bungou Stray Dogs is about its characters. There\u2019s such a diverse and colorful cast. The main cast consists of the Armed Detective Agency with each character havingtheir own unique traits. Most prominently, we learn a lot more about Osamu Dazai. If we take a closer look, it also reveals more about not only Dazai\u2019s past but also the underworld system of where the series takes place. The truth is, there\u2019s actually more than we don\u2019t know from the surface. The first few episodes of the second season establishes Daizai as someone that seems to be easily influenced. His relationships with characters such as Sakaguchi Ango and and Sakunosuke Oda are told from his perspective which is more than enough for the viewers to understand him. At the same time, the show cleverly gives an insight about Oda and his own ideals. Despite being a new character, his moments are memorable through his relationship with Daizai and his nobility. That being said, viewers may take a little bit of time to get accustomed with the background storytelling. They are actually not based on the manga so my initial expectations at watching the first episodes of this season left me somewhat bewildered. But once you take in the story, it may give you a better insight about Daizai and who he really was.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does eventually re-enter the main story again. From this season, we also meet The Guild, an American organization led by Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald. They are very influential and possesses a great amount of power and authority. As such, expect them to take over the show as the series\u2019 main antagonists. Of course, Port Mafia still remains relevant with its core members such as Ryunnosuke Akutagawa. Somewhere in between, there\u2019s also Kyouka. Remember her? She\u2019s the girl that killed 35 people and became lost in the world of her purpose until Atsushi took her under the Armed Detective Agency. The problem now is that there are also others that wants her back, namely Port Mafia. Kyouka\u2019s struggle with her own personal demons are further amplified this season and she finds it difficult to get close to others. In the meantime, we are also introduced to other new members of The Guild such as John Steinback and H.P. Lovecraft. It\u2019s also no surprise that the characters of this series are based on their literature figures. A good example would be Margaret Mitchell, author of \u201cGone of the Wind\u201d with an ability that is named as such. Back to what I mentioned before, Bungou Stray Dogs excels at its diverse range of characters. Whether you\u2019re a fan of literature or not, the series is able to find ways to capitalize on each character. For their roles, personality, or abilities, many of them will likely remain memorable because of the show is able to push them as figures larger than life.\\n\\n\r\nA main major story conflict that develops seems to be a triple threat conflict between the Armed Detective Agency, Port Mafia, and The Guild. Each one wants to remain the last group standing while their members make key moves to ensure their successes. If you remember from season 1, Akutagawa had some major issues with Atsushi while the latter seems to have developed a personal rivalry with him. As such, expect their rivalry to escalate more into this sequel. The Armed Detective Agency also realizes the threat of The Guild and as such takes steps to counter against their influences. Other rivalries throughout the show between the three factions are also explored including the very cleverly crafted Ranpo Edogawa/Edgar Allen Poe feud. When you realize that imaginations can blend between fiction and reality, that\u2019s where the show really shines. Indeed, Bungou Stray Dogs is no stranger to exploring supernatural phenomenon whether they are abilities to cause malevolence, utility to help others, or means of influencing the world. The sequel brings out that to a very unique form with abilities such as the Black Cat in the Rue Mogue, Moby Dick, The Grapes of Wrath, among others. It\u2019s what makes the show that damn special.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of technicality, the sequel remains generally the same by retaining its strong visual dynamics. Characters expressions are what draws the viewers\u2019 attention the most especially with Kyouka\u2019s inner struggles and Atsushi\u2019s determination to prove himself to others. Akutagawa\u2019s personality becomes darker as attempts to fulfill his own goals. Character designs revolving around The Guild also gives them the impression of authority and aristocracy such as Margaret and Francis. In addition, we get memorable battles that takes the characters\u2019 abilities to their limits all thanks to Bones\u2019 talented staff and cast. The voice acting has always been impressive from this show that defines characters\u2019 personalities. It retains that level of credibility in season 2 and definitely not something to forget about. Oh and do I need to remind you of that stellar soundtrack? Don\u2019t forget your headphones!\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to sequels, fans are often expecting something that hopefully excels the first season. Bungou Stray Dogs\u2019 first few episodes may feel more like a prologue rather than expansion but the way it crafts its story structure ultimately works well in the end. As a show with a lot of creativity, there\u2019s a lot to take in at times. The storytelling and the characters all serves a meaningful purpose in one way or another. Now, do be aware that the manga is still ongoing as this is an incomplete adaptation. Yet somehow, it still manages to pull off a hard-boiled supernatural thriller with literature figures and a story that meets expectations.  \\n",

            "content": "Bungou Sleigh Bells returns just in time for the holidays. And just like that, I\u2019m already out of holiday puns.\r\nTo be honest, following Bambi Stray Dogs throughout the season was a surprisingly difficult task. Not just because of the weird and scattered narrative, but also because Crunchyroll changed its release schedule at least thirty-five times, just like the number of people Kyouka killed. So, my recollection of this series, which I only finished watching about twelve minutes ago, is rather hazy.\r\nLooking back at the first cour from the spring, Stray Doggos was a decent time that seemed to have some sort of identity crisis. Ithad fun characters with crazy powers and an interesting concept with the main cast being a group of detectives rivaled against a mafia, but the story took some sharp turns in conflicting directions and was plagued by slapstick comedy about as appropriately-timed as someone\u2019s ringtone of ACDC\u2019s \u2018Highway to Hell\u2019 going off in the middle of their father-in-law\u2019s funeral. Hey, I found it funny. Can\u2019t say the same for the guy\u2019s wife, though.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the question everyone wants to know: Does the second season improve on the first in this regard?\\n\\n\r\nEh\u2026\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, Stray Puppers makes a strong first impression. It kicks off with a prequel focused on Dazai and has a more dark and consistent tone despite Dazai being the silliest character of the series. Yet, even this gets tiring after a couple episodes.\\n\r\nFor some reason, the arc stops focusing on Dazai, the fan-favorite of the series, and instead moves the spotlight to a guy who\u2019s name I don\u2019t know, because he wasn\u2019t even in the first season. Who the hell\u2019s this guy? Why should I care about him? He\u2019s not particularly interesting beyond having one of the coolest powers of the series: a premonition-based power that activates when he\u2019s about to die so that he can avoid it. The way Studio Bones visualizes it is entrancing. But the guy himself isn\u2019t worth cheering for, because you know exactly how the arc is going to end. The point is that Dazai leaves the Port Mafia due to the events in this arc. A little clarification is nice to have for Dazai\u2019s past, but did it need last a third of the cour?\\n\r\nImagine watching this on a binge. You clear twelve episodes in a day or two. You\u2019re finally invested in the people in the Armed Detective Agency and are excited about seeing the story evolve. Then, without warning, the anime cuts to new characters loosely related to the overall narrative and focuses on them instead, without looking back at the past season or even reassuring you that they\u2019ll be back. I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d be a little strange. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, after a few episodes the anime returns the spotlight to Sushi Guy, who got kicked out of thirty-five orphanages. The comedy doesn\u2019t cut through everything as sharply and it introduces a new group of villains on top of the already-established Port Mafia, creating a three-sided war. It\u2019s pretty interesting\u2026 but I could never connect much with the villains. Many of the people in this season just show up and leave after a couple episodes, and the shifting focus on Bucko\u2019s myriad characters can make it hard to follow. It did for me, especially given that Pokemon Moon absorbed about a month of my life. Praise Mimikyu.\\n\\n\r\nThe more serious plotline leaves less room for characters to dick around all day, so there aren\u2019t a lot of funny, memorable moments like there were with the first season, and no one really changes. With the first season, I thought Atsushi was a decent lead character who had a lot of room to develop, and I was interested in seeing that happen in the second. Nope. He still acts like a bitch all the time--in fact, his bitchiness seems to have increased somehow, because the slightest of mistakes will trigger the Naruto-level repetitive flashback of thirty-five people kicking him out of an orphanage. Yeah, that didn\u2019t stop happening either. I\u2019m not even sure why he\u2019s the main character. Everyone else hypes up his tiger-transforming power as if it\u2019s the most impressive thing in the world, but it\u2019s actually not when he gets his ass kicked by literally everyone, just like how he got kicked out of an orphanage. And although he has the determined, ambitious attitude of a common anime lead, his reduced screentime makes it even more difficult to justify his placement in the series.\\n\r\nKyouka, who killed thirty-five people, is a gem from the first season that also deserved some more polish. Eh\u2026 She develops a little more, which is nice, but I can\u2019t say that anything about her is remarkable aside from her gorgeous character design, but frankly that can be said for basically everyone else. She\u2019s the cute, quiet girl who\u2019s trying to fit in. There\u2019s nothing else to say about her, besides the fact that she got kicked out of thirty-five people, which makes the end of the season pretty hilarious. They try setting up a big emotional moment even though she was almost as useless as Sushiman.\\n\\n\r\nThe highlight of Bouncy is the fights, for sure. I wasn\u2019t too interested in the powers from the first season beyond the incredible diversity, but this season introduces a new cast inspired by Western authors with matching abilities. My favorite was probably the last one, \u2018The Great Fitzgerald\u2019, which powers up the user depending on how much money they have and are willing to spend. Obviously there\u2019s no real logic behind this or most other powers, but it\u2019s still creative and a lot of fun, and that\u2019s what counts.\\n\\n\r\nProduction\u2019s about the same, not much that\u2019s new to comment on. The art is as good as it was from the first season because based Bones, though I don\u2019t know how often they used blank faces back then. For some reason, most scenes will just remove people\u2019s faces entirely when they\u2019re at a distance. I somewhat appreciate the artistic approach here, but it just looks strange. \\n\\n\r\nTaku Iwasaki still remains a mixed bag to me, some of the backing music sounds hype as hell, and some of it sounds like he put a randomizer on some music studio on his computer. The opening song isn\u2019t as good as GRANRODEO\u2019s \u2018Trash Candy\u2019, which for me is one of my favorite\u2019s this year, but SCREEN mode did a pretty nice job regardless. The accompanying animation wasn\u2019t very memorable, but still appreciable because there are three different sequences, with the first two only showing up for a single episode. The ED sounds familiar because it\u2019s by the same band who did the first season\u2019s; it\u2019s as good for me because its slow start makes for a great transition, and the moderate energy of the song makes it a good way to end an action-based show. Strong marks for this. Insert joke about Kyouka murdering people for consistency.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this second season of Gumball improved the show somewhat, but still opened up some new holes. It\u2019s like sitting on a nice boat in the middle of a lake, but then you notice a hole, and now the boat\u2019s sinking. You cover up the hole with your hands, but then another hole opens somewhere else, and it just keeps repeating. You can\u2019t cover them all because you only have two hands and there are thirty-five holes. And the boat\u2019s actually an orphanage.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10\\n\r\nPeople killed by Kyouka - 35/10\\n\r\nOverall - 5.0 (Score range: 4.0-6.0)\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium",

Amazing story and great battle sequences aside, the show in its 2nd season did a much better job with explaining plot concepts and the characters all improvedwith the introduction of Dazai's story and the Guild.  Some (myself included) would be reasonably annoyed with the beginning of this season as it decided to tell Dazai's past instead of keeping with the current events of the present story line (especially considering the suspense that 1st season left off with).  This ended up being a small issue as, the backstory was awesome, and the main story that resumed was improved because of it.  From the point the show resumed the present plotline it just got better with each episode, from 3-way conflict giving way to an unlikely partnership to a final fight worthy of the show's 2 season long buildup finishing with a peace tainted by the juicy plot-hook of yet another more menacing foe, this is how i like my anime, 12/10 would recommend to anyone.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: With the conflict between the Armed Detective Agency and the Port Mafia already raging on, the appearance of The Guild further endangers the balance of the city. The stage has been set for a three-way gifted war between the organizations and by the end, only one will be left standing. Atsushi (Uemura Yuto), Dazai (Miyano Mamoru), and the rest of the Armed Detective Agency confront their strongest foes yet as the city wavers on the brink of destruction.\r\n[Characters]: \r\nPerhaps the most marked difference between the first and second season of Bungou Stray Dogs is the secondseasons\u2019 first 4 episodes which feature a stand-alone, prequel arc centering around Dazai\u2019s past and the founding of the Armed Detective Agency. It offers a far more serious tone than the season that proceeds it and the characters and subject matter are similarly adjusted to fit this alternative kind of story. Gone are the dopey gags and whimsical suicide jokes and in their place is a mystery thriller full of organized crime, action, and subterfuge. It\u2019s a promising start to the new season and it does away with many of the aspects of the first installment that most significantly hampered its success.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the shift in tone, the cast of the prequel arc behaves fundamentally different from that of the first season. The characters have actual depth to them. Dazai isn\u2019t bogged down by his cripplingly stupid suicide gag \u2013 he\u2019s menacing and intellectual. Oda Sakunosuke, a newcomer, is wonderfully compelling and offers a genuinely engaging personality, skill set, and moral awareness that really embodies what makes the first 4 episodes of the show so interesting. For the first time you get a sense of purpose from these characters that isn\u2019t derived from asinine comedy or Atsushi being hung up on the same orphanage flashback for over a season. In this regard, Bungou Stray Dogs pulled off the impossible and actually made me enjoy watching its characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo what then when the story shifts back to its previous setting and cast of familiar characters. Does it relax into its old ways and forget its recent progress? Luckily this isn\u2019t the case but its not a complete turn-around either. The tone lightens up a good deal after the prequel arc concludes however in its wake remains a sense of gravity and seriousness that continues to influence the show for the better. The tonally disrupting humor makes a return but appears far less frequently than before, almost disappearing entirely during the show\u2019s later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast remains much the same as they were before. Atsushi is still Atsushi and the rest of the Armed Detective Agency and the Port Mafia go about their business just as they did before. The majority of the characters remain fairly one-dimensional and the things that motivate them are pretty underwhelming but there are a handful of interesting additions to this season. While the convention of slapping the names of renowned authors on to various characters and giving them superpowers had about as little depth as it did before, Lovecraft and his style of horror beyond comprehension was fairly well conceived. The cast features a small number of improvements in this regard but as a whole remains almost insultingly simplistic and leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: \\n\\n\r\nIn respect to Bungou Stray Dogs\u2019 visuals, not much has changed and the second season maintains the fluid and consistent style of the first series. There are a number of new flashy abilities to look at and the fight sequences are well animated and generally entertaining to watch when they don\u2019t boil down to play-by-play ability exposition. Bungou Stray Dogs is a good looking show and if it could stand by its solid animation, great environments, and vibrant colors alone, it would be a relatively strong show.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: \\n\\n\r\nAs highlighted earlier, the beginning of the new season begins with a flashback arc consisting of 4 episodes that immediately surpassed all of the proceeding content. The more serious tone and far more measured approach to the show\u2019s poor sense of comedy does it a lot of favors. It doesn\u2019t escape moments like Dazai screaming his head off about a mobile game while his men recover the bodies of 3 of his underlings but this initial arc presents a significant step forward for the show none the less. It plays out as more of an organized crime mystery than the superpower action show that makes up the rest of Bungou Stray Dogs. It\u2019s got a good character story at its core centering around Dazai, Oda Sakunosuke, and Sakaguchi Ango and features some compelling plot developments and action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the show that follows is far more in the vein of the previous series though as I\u2019ve said it thankfully takes a slightly more serious approach this time around. While the offbeat comedy doesn\u2019t get in the story\u2019s way in the same way it once did, there are still a handful of narrative issues afoot that keep the second season of Bungou Stray Dogs from creating anything as compelling as its introductory arc. The season as a whole revolves around the three-way conflict between the Armed Detective Agency, the Port Mafia, and The Guild however what they are actually fighting over and what drives their conflict is a bit obscure. To some degree, its the city itself but the Armed Detective Agency is mostly out to save people, the Port Mafia is out to\u2026 do bad stuff and The Guild wants to capture Atsushi the weretiger\u2026 or find a book\u2026 or some such thing.\\n\\n\r\nThough their reasons for fighting each other are a little flaky, what\u2019s perhaps even more disconcerting is the way their bouts actually pan out most of the time. Despite boasting truly powerful and terrifying abilities and spending most of their dialogue threatening opposing faction members, none of the characters seem to have much of an interest in killing anyone. Sometimes two opposing factions clash and they fight to the death but in other instances, they simply nod and see each other on their way. It\u2019s supposed to speak to this high-minded elegance behind the scenes but when each faction-head claims they want to win and don\u2019t seem to be taking the most straightforward steps to doing so, it somewhat compromises the seriousness of their conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThough it presents these weaknesses, between the prequel arc, the shift in tone, and the more interesting subject matter, the second season of the show is markedly more entertaining than the first. It tends to repeat itself for the sake of oversimplification, the characters are pretty one-dimensional but its got good production standards, plenty of fight scenes, and somewhat inciting character interactions to keep things fresh.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]: \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack sees a return of the previous themes that made up the bulk of the show\u2019s music with a few new additions. For whatever reason, the music stood out to me more this season than it did during the first and I can say it supported each scene reasonably well.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nThis second season of Bungou Stray Dogs was more entertaining than I would have expected it to be going in after such a forgettable first season. The conclusion of the show was fairly tight but the mentalities of all of the characters involved left me kind of baffled as to why any of them would act the way they did. This season was a significant step in the right direction but not to the degree that it became anything \u2018great\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 5\\n\\n\r\nI gave the second season of Bungou Stray Dogs a 5 because, while it still suffers from uninteresting characters and a handful of narrative complications, the more sincere tone allows for the show to take itself more seriously and thus adds at least some legitimacy to its conflict and cast. The prequel arc was engaging and the action scenes that crop up throughout the rest of the show were entertaining. Bungou Stray Dogs isn\u2019t a show with a lot going on behind the eyes. Its predictability renders it rather uneventful on some occasions but its action scenes and animation at least provide something stimulating to tide things over.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]: \\n\\n\r\nIf you already enjoyed the first series and are looking into checking out this sequel season, then I\u2019m sure it will meet and surpass your expectations. If you enjoyed it for its comedy, it\u2019s still present. If you liked its action scenes or supernatural abilities \u2013 there are more of them than ever. If, like me, you didn\u2019t care for the first season, I\u2019d give the first 4 episodes a shot and see if it catches your interest any.",

            "content": "First of all i been a fan of Bungo stray dogs since the first season and as such i was looking forward to this season when it was announced. \r\nLets get started \r\nThe story of Bungo stray dogs revolves around people with special abilities that are referred to as gifted within the story. The story itself takes place in a fictional representation of the city of Yokohama. As with the first season of the anime the gifted within the city are divided into different factions with this season introducing the American gifted organisation the Guild in addition to the Armed Detective agency and the PortMafia that was introduced in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character of the series is Atsuchi who until discovery of his powers back in the first season was a rather unlucky person that was treated harshly by nearly everyone that he had met. An orphan that was abandoned by his parents for his perceived curse he was taken in by an orphanage that was just as harsh. \\n\\n\r\nUntil he was found by the armed detective agency Atsuchi was rather weak and cowardly and had rather low self esteem. However this changed after joining the agency and he become more confident and determined and found something that he had been lacking all along which was friendship and a place that he can belong to. \\n\\n\r\nIn season 2 Atsushi has matured somewhat from his season 1 self and has become a far more confident person and has far more control of his abilities than before. He has developed a sort of mentor relationship between himself and the character of Kyouka. One trait of his that manifested in this season that i admire about the most was his selflessness in that he will do his utmost to protect people even for people that he had just met. Perhaps his most prominent trait that i also find amazing is his determination as he will try his hardest to achieve a task no matter the odds that are stacked against him. \\n\\n\r\nAs with all gifted's on the anime Atsushi also has a power of his own with his being able to turn into a white tiger or morph one of his limbs into the tiger equivalent. In this Atsuchi's strength is increased substantially and he also gains the ability to regenerate his limbs. \\n\\n\r\nKyouka voiced by veteran seiyuu Sumire Morohoshi is a character that was introduced in the first season as a member of the Port Mafia as a assassin of sorts. After an encounter with Atsushi who managed to convince her not to throw her life away Kyouka decided to leave the port Mafia and was taken in by the agency with Atsuchi mentoring her. Despite leaving the Port Mafia Kyouka still has doubts whether she can an effective member of the agency as her ability Demon snow which summons a sword wielding phantom can only be used to kill people and only listens to orders from a mobile phone that she has and not her own will. Indeed the first reaction that Kyouka does when feeling a threat is to kill which makes it hard for Atsushi and the others to help her. Kyouka's struggles form one of the story arcs for the anime and was an interesting one as i found it allowed her to develop her own personality and discover the direction that her life should be going on her own rather than being dictated by her gifts and her bosses. The relationship between Kyouka and Atsuchi was also pretty cute and both had very similar upbringings and backstories which is why they get along so well.\\n\\n\r\nDazai is a member of the Armed detective agency and was the one that discovered Atsushi and recruited him into it. Although Dazai may appear to be carefree and only interested in flirting and suicide this is but a facade as behind this is a keen and calculating mind that is often able to see several steps ahead. Most often than not the strategies that the agency uses was formulated by him. \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 didn't wrought as much changes to Dazai as it did to Atsuchi but did expand on Dazai's backstory that proved to be a really interesting story arc of its own. Unlike the first season Dazai in the second season is more of a support character but never less does provide guidance and support for Atsushi and co when they need it. Dazai's power is called No longer Human and is the ability to cancel out another gifted's ability. Because of this it acts as a sort of trump card within the story but thankfully its never overused. Despite being relegated to a support role Dazai is still as dependable and reliable as ever and his advice and strategies are always on point. \\n\\n\r\nAkutagawa is a member of the Port Mafia and serves as one of their main enforcers. When Dazai was still in the Port Mafia Akutagawa served as one of his subordinates and he respected Dazai a great deal. Despite that Dazai never once acknowledged his strength and as a result he has a rather interesting relationship with Dazai. Within the story Akutagawa serves as a sort of nemesis for Atsushi although in season 2 he has a much smaller role due to the guild being the main enemies. Despite that Akutagawa serves as the polar opposite to Atsushi not just in terms of ability but also in terms of reasons to fight. Despite that watching these two fight again and again really lets you see that they are in fact quite similar and that if they are able to put aside their differences to fight for a common cause they will be able to beat just about anyone. \\n\\n\r\nChuya is a member of the Port Mafia and was Dazai's former partner. Despite being an executive of the Port Mafia Chuya still resents Dazai for leaving both him and the organisation that they both serve and joining the armed detective agency. This resentment takes the forms of many things usually with Chuya being angry with Dazai to which i find most humorous. Dazai usually takes these in stride by by commenting on Chuya's height and appearance which he dislikes immensely which causes no small amount of hilarity. Chuya's gift is called the For the tainted Sorrow which allows him to manipulate a gravity vector and the strength of objects within it. \\n\r\nOne thing about Chuya's ability is that when he goes all out he loses control of himself and can only be stopped by others. This can lead to a rather embarrassing situation if that person just leaves lol. \\n\\n\r\nMori is the leader of the Port Mafia and while only given a guest role in the first season was given a much larger role in this season. Despite looking like a doctor to which he was one Mori is every bit the strategist that the agencies leader is and perhaps even more so. Mori is very adapt at using guile and trickery as well as his intelligence to make events go his way. Mori despite being the leader of an organisation like the Port Mafia treats everyone whether allies or not with respect and does not look like a crime lord at all. Despite this Mori understands that sometimes alliances are necessary and that debts must be repaid once owed. \\n\\n\r\nSakunosuke Oda known as Odasaku to his friends was a member of the Port Mafia and one of Dazai's oldest friends. When Dazai was still in the port Mafia Odasaku was one of his best friends. Despite being of different ranks within the port mafia this made no difference to them and they still shared drinks with each other. Despite being a member of the Port Mafia Odasaku wasn't a horrible person and in fact took care of a number of orphans that he had found over the years. His prominent trait was that despite being armed he until the tragic events near of his arc did not even use it once as part of his duties. \\n\\n\r\nOdasaku's storyline was one of the story arcs that was featured in this season and arguably it was one of the saddest stories i have ever seen. His fight with the villain of that arc who had the same ability of his which was predicting the future several seconds ahead was extremely well done and executed and his voice actor Junichi Suwabe of Gate and Fate stay night fame really did a great job portraying him. \\n\\n\r\nFrancis Scott key Fitzgerald that i call Francis is the leader of the American gifted organisation the Guild otherwise known as the fellowship of the guild. Intelligent, quick thinking, charismatic and confident Francis serves as the main villain of the second season. Despite appearing arrogant Francis does not let hubris get in the way of his goals and pursues his objectives tenaciously with the help of his large number of subordinates. Additionally he is also a rather quick thinker able to adapt and pre empt his opponents moves quite easily while at the same time allowing them to fall into his traps. Francis's power is called the Great Gatsby which allows him to increase his strength in proportion to the amount of money that he uses. Nothing like using up 100,000 dollars to gain the equivalent in terms of strength increase lol. \\n\\n\r\nFrancis i felt was a great villain as he was both calculating and smart while at the same time powerful in combat meaning that to beat him the main cast had to outsmart him which is not easy and at the same time outfight him which is ditto. This difficulty was what ultimately caused one of the most unlikeliest alliances to be formed. \\n\\n\\n\r\nLucy voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa and my 3rd favorite seiyuu is a member of the guild and was actually first introduced back in the first season where she was one of the first guild members to reveal themselves when she attacked Atsuchi and Mori. Due to being defeated by Atsushi Lucy was demoted in status and in season 2 was more of a maid than anything. Lucy's gift is called Anne of Abyssal Red which allows her to create a alternate reality called Anne's room in which resides a giant doll called Anne the monster that imprisons people it manages to catch. \\n\\n\r\nLucy was very similar to Atsuchi in that both were orphan's that were abused by the people that took them in and both suffered trauma from that. The difference here is that while Atsushi recovered from it somewhat Lucy never did and rather developed a rather psychotic personality. Like Atsuchi she developed a dependence on the organisation that took her in and accepted her for what she was and thus giving her some pride and status in her eyes. \\n\\n\r\nAs as result you can see that Lucy and Atsushi has a rather interesting relationship that is more like a love hate kind of thing. Despite that its this kind of shared trauma that allowed one of the most intense escapes on the show to take place. Lucy i felt i was a great character and seeing her change when confronted by Atsushi was interesting. Kana Hanazawa as always gave a flawless performance here portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nJohn Steinback that i call Grapeman due to his gift is a operative of the guild and is Lovecrafts partner. Unlike most characters on the show John joined the guild to provide money for his family which seems to be a large one. A farm boy from a farming family John is usually carefree and relaxed outside of battle but once in battle he can be cruel and merciless to the point of being a psycho. Johns gift is called Grapes of wrath that allow him to sprout grape vines that can be used to graft to other plants and allow him to take control of them using them as eyes for him to extend his range. \\n\\n\r\nLovecraft is a member of the guild and arguably one of the most bizarre characters i ever came across in any anime. A rather deadpan person Lovecraft tends to get distracted by the simple of things which can be really funny if he's looking for the main characters. His gift though or rather ability is to morph into a large tentacle monster that he calls the great old one that can only be destroyed from the inside. Despite this Lovecraft is a very capable combatant and is able to fight even Dazai on a even footing and strangely enough even Dazai is unable to cancel out Lovecraft's ability with his own. \\n\\n\r\nThe remaining members of the Armed detective agency who served as the main characters in the first season was largely given the backseat role this season due to the focus being on the guild and Atsuchi however they still get some memorable fights in this season with examples being Dappo and Junichiro's fight with Lovecraft and John and Ranpo and Akiko's little excursion into a alternate book world. The same can be said of the Port Mafia as well. \\n\\n\r\nKouyou Ozaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Ami Koshimizu is a port member executive and one of Mori's closest advisers and seem to have a rather close relationship with him. Kouyou served as Kyouka's master during her time in the Port Mafia and actually does care about her well being. Her gift is called Golden demon which summons a spirit wielding a sword that is controlled by her will alone similar but different to Kyouka. Kouyou isn't a true villain as she does care about Kyouka and only wants her to stay in the Port Mafia to watch over her and guide her even though it doesn't give Kyouka any choice. \\n\\n\r\nOne member of the Port Mafia that deserves mention is Kyusaku Yumeno known as Q who while still a teenager has a rather powerful gift which he calls Dogra Magra that allows him to control someone by injuring someone with his doll. Despite being carefree and relaxed Q has quite a psychotic personality and as such was imprisoned by the Port Mafia. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\r\nThe music for Bungo stray dogs i felt was really good as the scene music was appropriate for the scenes that featured them and both the opening and ending themes were excellent and really gets you psyched up for the episode. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\\n\r\nAnimation for Bungo stray dogs was pretty well done and especially the fight scenes which was well designed and animated. Animation was also pretty clear and clean as was the colors. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting as ever was excellent with Yuto Uemura who voiced Atsushi and Sumire Morohoshi who voiced Kyouka deserving particular praise. Junichi Suwabe and Kana Hanazawa who voiced Odasaku and Lucy respectively as mentioned were two of my favorite characters on the show and these two seiyuu's did a fantastic job portraying their characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 of Bungo stray dogs i felt was a massive step up from the first season that it had a much better overall story, a larger cast of characters and some really impressive fight scenes that was animated beautifully. The stakes of the story also felt much higher than before due to the guild's tactics. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a great season that improved upon everything that season 1 created and built upon it. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The will of each and every human always seems to beg and scream for different things despite all of us being a part of the same species.  Our walks of life, our experiences, and our day to day lives mold the very fabric of our being, eventually leading us to divergent paths that give us different drives towards the common goal of giving us self-validation and a reason to continue onward.  And so, we continue the stories of the people in Yokohama, where a war between three factions, three ways of life, and three times the number of personal stories and journeys arewritten.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: Bungou Stray dogs 2 continues the story that we were left with in the first season with a slight plot twist in the beginning by giving us a backstory about one of the more predominant characters in the series, Dazai.  It does this for roughly half of the series before going back to the main plot in the present day with the brewing three-way war between the three factions presented in the series: The Armed Detective Agency, the Port Mafia, and The Guild.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot's two halves put the audience in a difficult spot due to the very sudden shift in tone at the beginning due to it not being a direct continuity from the first season, then doing the same dramatic shift to get back to the main plot of the series, there is very little to actually complain about the overall content of what we get.  Aside from maybe a few pacing issues, the series does a very good job at guiding the audience through its plotline and ensures that what we're presented with ultimately comes together in the end.  \\n\\n\r\nMore importantly, the plot of Stray Dogs gives us the story of its characters alongside the main plot of trying to win the three faction war.  Many new characters that we're presented with as members of the Guild and in the initial backstory are given a healthy amount of screentime, importance, and motives that give them the illusion of being more fleshed out than thinking back, they actually were.  \\n\\n\r\nSo with the culmination of an overarching story as well as a heaping amount of character growth, what does that actually say for the series's quality?  In truth, I really can't find many faults with the way that the series played out.  Sure a couple of the characters were a bit shallow simply because they were only important for maybe one half of an episode (looking at you, Poe), the Guild's goal was haphazardly placed because it was just a tiny line shoved into the end of the second to last episode to make sure the third faction's reason for fighting was known to the audience, and maybe Dazai is a bit of a Deus-Ex-Machina since everything he says and does goes and does is done a bit too perfectly, but when compared to how well the series built up its characters, summing it all up into a clash of ideals almost to the level of some of anime's greatest one on one fights, all of those flaws are pretty much inconsequential.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Wonderful character building\\n\r\n+ Well-made mix of plot with characters\\n\r\n-  Some jarring shifts in pacing (with some rushing near the end)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: If there's anything that Bungou Stray Dogs does extremely well, it's characters.  Due to the series focusing on the three faction war, a lot of the \"non-important\" characters have been shoved off to the side, or have very minimalistic roles to make room for new ones and/or characters that are more important to this arc.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the Armed Detective Agency, the most prominent members in this arc are Atsushi (obviously), Dazai (again, obviously), and Kyouka.  Dazai of course, gets the most attention in this series due to the fact that he's not only a part of the first half of this season with his very own flashback, but because he fulfills his pivotal role in the series as being the end all be all character that virtually every important character from the ADA and Port Mafia is influenced by.  Atsushi and Kyouka get their time in the spotlight in the latter half as the largest players from the ADA.  Aside from just being main characters, the series gives a lot of attention to their characters and never wastes a second they're given to gradually move them closer to their end goals as people.  They have wants and needs, regrets and worries, and really speak the ideal of wanting to make something of yourself.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Port Mafia group has probably the least amount of characters actually important to the overall plotline despite their immense involvement in the three part war.  Their cast comes predominantly with the involvment of Akutagawa and Oda, a friend of Dazai, as the main contributors to the series with a few others here and there (like Kouyou, voiced by the lovely Ami Koshimizu) and the Port Mafia's leader, Mori.  As far as roles go, Oda provides the majority of the story for the first half and gives us insight as to what was happening in the Port Mafia before the time of the series while Akutagawa provides us with the antithesis to Atsushi, supporting the series with his presence to the climax that we see near the end of the series.  While small in number, the Port Mafia characters provide a very strong presence to the series and helps provide a well thought out version of the \"Different path, same goal\" -style antagonist group.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have the Guild, arguably the least important important group (despite being the new threat) with the most amount of characters introduced.  Due to the fact that the Guild is something new to the series, all of the Guild's character, subordinates, leader, and all, are given time in the spotlight and take up a large majority of the character moments in the first part of the second half as almost each member tells their story and why they ended up as a member of a Gifted organization, thus giving the illusion of fleshed out characters due to how many one-off stories that we're introduced with.  The only problem is the fact that these characters are pretty much one and done, as this entire arc is pretty much their only turn to shine.  As mentioned before, the Guild's ultimate goal isn't revealed until the end of the series, so combined with the somewhat sloppy writing for their members, those involved with the Guild aren't really as memorable as the other characters mentioned above.  Which is a shame, because all of their gifted powers are based off of American novels, and some of them are arguably pretty cool and imaginative as far as powers go.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, what of the other characters that didn't get their time in the spotlight?  Well, they're still there.  The rest of the ADA still have their moment to shine, other members of the Port Mafia still have a role, but due to the show's shift towards focusing solely on specific characters and the new threat, there just isn't enough room to squeeze everyone in.  Bit of a shame, but they only had twelve episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great character development for those in the Port Mafia and ADA \\n\r\n+ Some interesting new additions (Kouyou was great.  Shut up, I have a favorite Seiyuu, ok?)\\n\r\n+/-  Miscellaneous characters are still there, but not as important\\n\r\n-  Guild characters suffered from being only seemingly important\\n\\n\r\nArt: Bones comes back in full force with the same slightly muted color palette and crisp artstyle that they used in the original Bungou Stray Dogs.  Honestly, there really isn't much to say about the art because it's the same quality as the studio produced when they were doing the first season.  The action's fluid, the effects are well made, and they still make the characters look choppy or nonchalant whenever something funny's happening (which I still find quite amusing.)\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing though that I personally wasn't happy with was the fact that there were never faces on the people who were facing the camera from a distance.  Anyone who was standing far away was always faceless, and personally, I found that very strange and wondered why they couldn't just draw eyes or animate something resembling a face on those individuals.  I don't remember if they did it in the first season or not, but it was just something that irked me personally.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Consistent, well-made quality\\n\r\n+ Fluid action\\n\r\n-  The lack of faces in distance shots irked me\\n\\n\r\nSound: As far as the OST goes, the overall soundtrack for the second season leans towards electronic rock with heavy emphasis on drums, keyboard, electric guitar.  Both its opening \"Reason Living\" and ending \"Kaze ga Fuku Machi\" represent this style of music and are all equally enjoyable tracks, even if the multiple endings do sound somewhat similar.  (I honestly can't remember what the other ending songs sound like.)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  I like Bungou Stray Dogs.  Despite its flaws in its usage with the Guild and a couple pacing issues, Stray Dogs is an excellent example of everything that I like in an anime.  It's got comedy, it's got an overarching plot with character development melded into its plotline, good enough pacing, and Ami Koshimizu.  (Yes, I love her work that much.)  But I think what really stuck to me most was with the note that the series ended on, and just what the characters that we've been following for roughly twenty two episodes have culminated into in the series's climax.  It was a brawl that I loved watching and is the kind of emotional and physical fight that when done right, is exhilarating and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nAs far as personal gripes go, I'm honestly a bit irritated by how much of a Deus-Ex-Machina character that Dazai is.  True he has slipped up in the past, but a lot of his actions have gone so perfectly that I'm a bit \"eh\" on the way things go cause everything that he comes up with goes along well enough that there's little reason to worry about how things will go, no matter how drastic it may be.  (Plus, his ability's pretty OP.  Nullification too stronk.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched Bungou 1 and liked it, well, you should've already watched this.  If you already watched season 1 and were still left wanting more,  then what're you doing sitting around?  Watch it!  As for the Stray Dogs series as a whole, anyone who wants a good shonen story without many of the pitfalls that Shonen anime fall into, then I would suggest giving the Stray Dogs series a shot.  It's got a lot of merit to it, as no one side in the series is completely free from fault, and it shows us that everyone has their own reason to continue forward and live.",

            "content": "1. Since this is season two, I'm assuming that anyone who reads this has already seen season one.\r\n2. The second season of Bungou Stray Dogs is better than the first season. Are they both good? Definitely...but I'll explain just what made season two better.\r\nOk, so, the first 4 episodes are set in the past and we get to learn more about Dazai's, well, past. This includes his relationships and why he's the person he is. I absolutely love this. But it's also this which creates the shift to a darker storyline. After that, it's back to the present. There's tons of action and interesting scenariosand situations in this season as well. While the story of season one was kinda episodic, the story of season two seems more developed and doesn't include elements that were mainly a \"one episode only\" thing such as the cases that they solved in season 1. After they found out who committed the crime, they didn't really go back to those cases.  In season two, everything is more connected. Also, Atsushi's backstory is used in a better way this time. From what I remember, each time it was shown, there was something different which takes away the repetitiveness from season 1.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are better this time around since they were either developed or were made more realistic because they had motivations or at least something that made them interesting. I didn't have a problem with any of the characters in the first place though since they had a little something to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art's amazing as always. The abilities still look cool as heck but, this time, I think the detail that went into making it is more apparent. The animation is great as well. There's no awkwardness or anything that's stiff or weird looking. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack got much better. It was good before but the music this time around just sounded better and seems more memorable. The opening song is just as good as the first and the same goes for the ending song. I really like how they brought back the first ending song for the last episode. All of the music really fits the mood and everything that's going on.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's really easy to just fall in love with this anime. There are so many things that it does a great job at. It's entertaining, contains psychological elements, has great fight scenes, the humor doesn't feel forced, and there are mystery elements. Bungou Stray Dogs Season 2 gets a 10! I'm sure it was obvious that I was going to give that score...",

            "content": "\"Extremely Beautiful, Shockingly Versatile and Diverse!\"\r\nWarning: This review contains typographical and grammatical errors waiting to be criticized. Do not proceed if bothered. Anyways, this is purely my opinion about the show. I let my review speak for itself.\r\nBungou Stray Dogs centers a story about a poor, unemployed, orphan named Nakajima Atsushi who was recklessly kicked out of the orphanage. Mid the series of unfortunate events, he met an eccentric man named Dazai Osamu who is a suicidal maniac and is a current partner of a hot-tempered, organized, idealist, Kunikida Doppo. One second, Atsushi was very thankful of how thoughtful the two are for saving himon a brink of death and starvation but after learning that they are from the Armed Detective Agency, an elite known for solving impossible cases beyond military police can handle and helping citizens of Yokohama from danger, and are in the works to find a man-eating tiger, his expression drastically changed. Caught by his suspiscious act, he is forced to help Dazai and Kunikida capture the creature who's wrecking havoc in the city. From then on, several occasions changed his life forever involving him and the tiger.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Tone/Mood:\\n\r\nAnd now that we are done with the synopsis, let us break down its tone and mood. Bungou Stray Dogs is one of a kind series that does not settle down to a numbered genres. If you already watched it, you might have noticed that it switches from different tones and variations. I do admit I admire it's shapeshifting. It may be shocking but I really found it <on point> and helpful. From a humurous communication styles to a serious, fatal & lethal negotiations, to even the characters' decisions based on the given situations and cases, the series takes you to a roller coaster ride without feeling nauseous but rather exciting, thrilling and unquestionably fascinating. Many animes may have had attempted to input several genres in a series but only a few succeeded in maintaining its spot and uniqueness. Surprisingly, Bungou Stray Dogs survived this dilemma. It can be confusing from another's point of view but it just simply wants to create a huge quality leaving the viewers hanging and wanting for more. It seeks alliance from various shades of flavor to generate a beautiful, decent, yet simple style. The tones are well balanced and if you pay attention to the series or manga, it isn't selfish for explanations. It is certainly its beauty that allows it to mix sorts of elements. If it weren't for it's limitless boundary, it would only be your typical clich\u00e9d mystery-tragedy anime that's forgettable in many aspect and worst case scenario, leaves you a boring impression. Its strategic goal of being diverse and versatile eventually became its assets to make it to the top shelf.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Some tones in the series/manga: \\n\r\n\u300eEntertaining, Mysterious, Serious, Humurous, Sympathetic, Secretive, Ambivalent, Scared, Hopeful, Excited, Sad, Pessimistic, Optimistic, Determined, Sentimental, Egotistical, Philosophical, Thoughtful, Informative, Comical, Nostalgic, Chaos, Impassioned\u300f\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Script/Plot/Arc\\n\r\nIndeed when it comes to exchange of words and arrangement of dialogues, the script is very well-written. Inheriting quotes and works of art characterized by the real-life authors are a very smart move of the mangaka. It isn't really distinctive using counterparts from the real world but it is a very artistic way pulling a series made up of literary motivated acts. For instance, the battle between Armed Detective Agency and Port Mafia involves heavily, dramatic, bloodbath, action, scene stirred by delicate, powerful, confrontational, self-reinforcing and logical lines of the characters. The humurous tag involved in the series isn't that hilarious but gives you a good laugh and rather a relief sigh that the characters can be dangerous but at the same time embarrassingly awkward. It balances well with the other elements considering its main genres. \\n\\n\r\nThe arcs are undeniably challenging and offer incentives such as \"the one who stays at the end will find the story very intriguing and enthralling\". Another example is The Guild Arc and Dazai's past (Both from Season 2), now we are alt+tab in a more serious environment. We see the comical mood fades into view as we are now more exposed of the darker side of the story. More and more villains are introduced and we see ourselves having trust issues. But still the series never really loses its foundation\u2014Diversity/Versatility. The emotions surrounding the different arcs are forsooth saturated and we are given a clear detail of the characters' principles and what and who they are or want to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some argues that it has no actual plot, but the constant fighting for justice and saving people lead us to crave for more (and it is still ongoing for both anime and manga). Moreover, the characters are believable and realistic when socializing, narrating and battling. I wouldn't mind telling you that the manga is doing better and better so I hope for more of Armed Detective Agency, Port Mafia and other known and unknown organizations in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the series by far did not disappoint when it comes to visualizing the characters' past and little backgrounds gathering the conclusion that its script opens opportunities for both the characters and the story plot to improve and grow better than its current state. Kudos for a very good written script!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Sounds & Cinematography:\\n\r\nBefore moving onto the characters, let's first take a look at its cinematography. Some series are totally saved by the animations or cameraworks. And Bungou Stray Dogs is not an exemption. Its cinematography is quite the philisophy of art. It uses various colors that implement different definitions. For example, brown and white are dominant when the mood is pretty stable and used in a normal conversation featuring Armed Detective Agency members. Red and black refers to Port Mafia's activities, positions, and abilities while Yellow and Green represents the power and theme of The Guild organization.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP from Seasons 1 and 2 have an excellent remarks to display. Every angle has different transitions that suits the mood of the video. The color matches the characters and the setting. It has accurate speed for actions, enough spoiler, good exposure time for the involved characters that make the viewers drop their jaws. It uses faded, darker filters and heavy amount of vignette expressing its action-mystery genre. The lightings and backgrounds prove its instagrammable status and shout aesthetics. The use of color neon green wallpapered the actions intelligently and highlights the important details that need attention. The sound is used esthetically organized by drums and electric guitars & such, (and of course Chuuya's voice yas!), Granrodeo and SCREEN Mode fearlessly gave it a wonderful performance. Trash Candy and Reason Living are your energetic and pretty catchy soundtracks you wouldn't miss whilst watching Bungou Stray Dogs.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the ending songs, compared to the opening songs, sit down to one filter for a feed. If you observe them, it focuses on blue and white colors maintaining the balance between peace and acceptance combined with dramatic lyrics of Luck Life's \"Namae wo Yobuyo\" and \"Kaze ga Fuku Machi\". The message brought by the songs are heavily filled with emotions and drives, and thus, obviously, can put you to tears. (IT IS SO TOUCHING THAT I PERSONALLY PUT IT IN MY PLAYLIST and play it everyday when I come to school). In other words, the ending songs are really, really heartwarming as the singers and the band delivered it beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up its sounds and cinematography, Bungou Stray Dogs states a perfect presentation, status, and position.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOut of all the areas I'm assessing, Bungou Stray Dogs' characters are its triumph card. From being <Gifted> and having an incredible ability to bringing life to the famous authors and their works, Asagiri has executed his characters very well. Their visuals and arts are highly clean and decent from the costumes they wear and the weapons they use. Despite introducing numerous characters from different arcs, I personally believe that everyone of them had made enough screen time and allowed the viewers and readers to adore and determine who they are. Though some of them has longer amount of exposure, it borrows us distance to recall the newest and recent characters. For example, taking the time of your life indulging the Anne of Abyssal Red ability, Rashomon, Beast Beneath the Moonlight, No Longer Human, Thou Shalt Not Die, Undefeated by the Rain, or Ultra Deduction, you'll find yourself being enchanted by other amazing abilities such as Perfect Crime, Dangai, The Great Old Ones, or Crime and Punishment.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Protagonist: \\n\r\nThe MC is kind, sentimental and genuinely cares for others because of his traumatic past that promotes us the benefit-of-the-doubt to hold on to his story longer as he proves himself he isn't just \"good-for-nothing\" to the readers and viewers. His repeated torture scenes and deja vus from his past is forgivable considering teenagers are frequently fragile. Believe it or not, it's kind of impressing because Atsushi represents millenials' moodswings and treacherous decisions. I really, really like the way Asagiri describes Atsushi. He deserves to be a protagonist despite the fact that Dazai had one of the best screen time and story. I believe this is because of his relatable past and personality.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Supporting Characters and Antagonist/s:\\n\r\nFrom my perspective, the villains as well as the side characters acted their roles the way the story wants them to and I did not feel any annoying overpowered (which is sometimes exhausting) aura among them. Each has their own SWOT Analysis\u2014 Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, which is really marvelous and wonderful. In the case of Dazai's ability, it is proven in both manga and anime that he is the most powerful among ability users but is weak in comes of physical combat and other aspect. On account of that he only temporarily nullifies ability when he touches the target. (Still, I love Dazai!)\\n\\n\r\nI hereby announce that Bungou Stray Dogs is proven... GUILTY for being ambitious and versatile, collaborating such concepts that are admirable and therefore successfully creating a well-desired product that will secure its sustained competitive advantage.\\n\\n\r\nSO STAN LEGENDS, STAN BUNGOU STRAY DOGS!",

            "content": "And so...the story continues.....\r\nActually not quite since the first half of the second season of Bungou Stray Dogs is a prequel involving Dazai in his time in the Port Mafia. But nonetheless even the first half is quite intriguing as we didn't know much about Dazai's Port Mafia days. The second half?...is the \"conclusion\" to the war against the Agency and the Port Mafia but it quickly changes as another powerful organization called the Guild comes and wrecks havoc to both organizations, thus more literary superhumans!!!.\r\nOk, let's start quite obviously with the first half, Dazai's Port Mafia days, really in brings into focus at toWHY Dazai left Port Mafia in the first place by going into an overly detailed backstory with some of Dazai's friends among the Port Mafia, the ones being Sakunosuke Oda voiced by Junichi Sawabe and Ango Sakaguchi voiced by Jun Fukuyama. Really, the basis of even having a PREQUEL in your second season at the start would at first is ok, again getting to know Dazai's mysterious past in Port Mafia, but where this prequel felt like it had a bit of a fault would go to how long this backstory for Dazai is, ohhh LA gets why this backstory is somewhat essential to Dazai's relationship to the Port Mafia as well as giving crucial character development to Dazai's insists to dodge this backstory and still lingers even after he left and becomes a somewhat plotline in the second half, but it just felt like it went one episode too long, but it's LA nitpicking at best for this. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half really reigns in all the organizations (Agency, Guild and Port Mafia) embroiled into a civil war where Kyouka, Ryuunosuke Akutagawa, Atsushi and the newer character in the forefront Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald voiced by Takahiro Sakurai all mixed into this. Atsushi does goes through some forced regression/confused morals in character development about him wanting to be \"useful\" which is compounded by Kyouka's involvement to the Guild making it all the more straining to Atsushi. Akutagawa more or less still has his goal from the first season and again at it out for Atsushi and the newest villain Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald are a catalyst to all this happening. The second half does dedicate episodes to the previous members of the Agency and the Port Mafia (like Ranpo and his newest rival Edgar Allan Poe, Chuuya Nakahara though he's an outlier by having character development in both \"arcs\" due to him being a former friend of Dazai in the Port Mafia in which they take on John Steinbeck and Lovecraft (no seriously)).\\n\\n\r\nReally if anything goes by with character development we wanted more from both \"arcs\", we get a plethora of them from all sides (Agency and the Port Mafia mainly, The Guild at best Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald gets the major focus of it, the rest are \"powers = personality\" due to the vast amount of characters the Guild even has, it made sense to focus on the major villain of this season).\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, where once again done by Studio Bones, well it's essentially the same aesthetics it had from the shounen-esque character designs but having those chibi animation during comedic moments, again LA think LA covered this in LA's first season review, Bungou Stray Dogs 2 has same flavour it had in the first season, just ramp up the amount of CRAZY battles especially during the final 2 episodes. Really not much to say about the second season's animation, it's as consistent as it's first season.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, well due to the second season having to get Atsushi along with Sakunosuke Oda goes through some vocal range in this second season, LA could be spouting LOTS of voice actors to did great in their literary superhuman roles but LA will say at least three at got LA's attention, bringing in a favourite from these three are hard enough so, *ahem*, Yuto Uemura as Atsushi, Sumire Morohoshi as Kyouka and going wild card here but Shunsuke Takeuchi as the creepy Lovecraft.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending did a slight bait switch during the climax of the anime and the \"final battle\" although was brilliantly animated and pumped full of adrenaline, the bait and switch it pulled, it kinda went to \"happy ending\" for the majority of the cast it went to and let's not forgot the \"NEW VILLAIN\" it added in goading to have another season on this, which seemed it also \"ruined\" the happy ending as it just another day at the office for the Agency. The ending really did kinda puzzled LA. Did they \"want a happy ending\" or \"ruin it by shoving in a new villain and obviously hinting at a third season, thus WON'T be a happy ending anyways\"...having a third season wouldn't be bad, but again \"puzzled\" is all LA can say about the finale of the second season. Ohhh and the ending also added in the \"according to plan\" remarks that lead it down to the ending it went to that although clever, could have been a bit more subtle about it.\\n\\n\r\nBungou Stray Dogs second season as both a prequel and a continuation of the first season has it's strengths in it's vast vast VAST amount of characters as well as bringing in the focus to it's main characters of Atsushi, Dazai and Akutagawa, but also it's weaknesses in bringing in a new organization filled with even more characters to that. By all means LA felt that the second season did better than it's previous season in terms of character and plot focus reigning in character involvement to a greater and bigger picture, but it also almost discards first season characters along with some of it's newer characters, sure some episodes were dedicated to the supporting and newer villains but with it's focus squarely on the bigger picture especially during the second half (The first half is rather an exception as it develops Dazai as a character as well as Sakunosuke and Ango and is has a cohesive narrative concerning these characters, the second half just has SOO many characters under differing factions and betrayals and indecisiveness, it's hard to keep up) and if the final scenes of that the ending is to go by, it's hinting at a third season, LA felt like the second season should have kept it's \"happy ending\" and end it on a high, instead of goading this anime for more. Nonetheless, if you wanted more from Bungou Stray Dogs, after Bungou Stray Dogs' first season just started to get good, then quite easily watch it, especially if you want to know more about Dazai, as for the second half, well besides developing Atsushi and Akutagawa...it'll vary on how you look at it. For LA, it's second season has it's strengths and weaknesses from it's characters in general, but LA will say merely because of Dazai's backstory, it did better than it's first season at the very best.",

            "content": "I personally enjoyed Bungou Stray Dogs a lot....It may not be the greatest anime out there but it definitely is a great one! \r\nIt\u2019s not your typical anime as you\u2019ll hardly find cliched moments and it\u2019s the uniqueness which makes it a must watch if you\u2019re into these type of genres. One thing which stood out for me is how all the characters are named after prolific writers and their abilities are named after the works of those writers. For example, Nathanial Hawthorne\u2019s (character) ability is the scarlet letter, Osamu Dazai\u2019s is No longer human and so on.\r\nI just loved how they portrayed these booksas abilities \\n\r\nAnd it was really interesting learning about all these Japanese and English authors and their works in a fun way.\\n\r\nPlus they quote lines from the books here and there which i really liked. I\u2019d definitely check out the books too!\\n\r\nI got to learn a lot of things from the characters. They say really deep things which had me in awe. So it definitely is a deep anime. You need to read between the lines as well as there\u2019s too much being said indirectly. \\n\r\nThe art and animation are really good and the action scenes are very well done too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne shortcoming that I\u2019d point out is that it may seem fast paced at first but I was personally ok with it \\n\r\nAs you\u2019ve already seen the first season is just character introduction, each episode is about a character but things get heated up in season 2\\n\r\nThe first 4 episodes of season 2 show Dazai\u2019s past story. Dazai is my favourite character and I wouldn\u2019t have minded seeing more of his episodes but I was a bit hesitant because I was wondering if the whole season would deal with Dazai\u2019s back story...But thankfully the main story line continued after ep 16. Also I think adding Dazai\u2019s back story at the start of season 2 was a good step. It explained a lot about him and his attitude and we get to see the references in later episodes.\\n\r\nAlso I wish the whole guild arc was a bit longer because it felt a bit rushed towards the end but even though it was rushed it was done nicely and not abruptly \\n\\n\r\nSo the question, should you watch it?!\\n\r\nI\u2019d say absolutely! And if you haven\u2019t seen season 1 then definitely watch it\\n\r\nThe characters are great and even the villain characters are great. I didn\u2019t dislike any of them.\\n\r\nThe osts are nice too especially the endings\\n\r\nSo If you\u2019re looking for something new and unique then definitely give it a try\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s my first time writing a review so I would be happy if this can be of any help :)",

            "content": "So far this is the 1st anime to end for this winter season of 2016 (I think) and now a new season begins on 2017. What we have here isn't much of a new season but a combination of a prequel, referring to Dazai's past , up to a continuation of the fist season, where a 3rd party comes in, called the \"Guild.\" So in all aspects , this is how I rated it:\r\nStorywise, is was very good when we were introduce to Dazai's past as to how he came to be, it was even better when a new party comes crashing in between theAgency and the Port Mafia. You could say that the genre did played the way it was suppose to be so kudos to anime writer Y\u014dji Enokido, so , it's a very good 8, here.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise: pretty decent, don't expect any zettai ryoki around here, nor any panty flash from Akiko Yosano, Ky\u014dka Izumi, Kirako Haruno, Naomi Tanizaki, Kouyou Ozaki, Louisa May Alcott and Margaret Mitchell, But fashionwise, the cooler ones are Dazai, Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald,  Ch\u016bya Nakahara and Doppo Kunikida. The dorky ones were, Ranpo Edogawa who kinda looks like a awful mix of Sherlock and a Scottsman, Akiko Yosano, could have been the sexy femme fatal , but wasn't exploited, too bad she could have been the eye candy here, the same goes with  Kouyou Ozaki and Margaret Mitchell , they, also, if illustrated as sexy risque eye candy would have added some spice to this anime's art. Aktugawa's fashion on the other hand, has that poor combination of goth and Dracula outlook, and I really don't get the long thing behind Nakajima's pant's , I mean , is that a very long belt or some string that needs snipping? So it's a decent 4 for this category. \\n\\n\r\nSound, though, I have no comment as who did the character's voice, I simply attribute a very good 8 for the opening theme, \"REASON LIVING\" by  Screen. It definitely matches the anime itself.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter, it was as mediocre as number 4, since they're the same character from the 1st season, also, the characters themselves, were the usual people with special abilities who were either trying to be heroes or just running amuck, Also, I kinda hate it that creator Kafka Asagiri, has to named them after famous literally authors, where it kinda desecrate them in big way, since they don't look like people who would resort to such violence in real life.....I think. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, it was a god 7 but.....not very good , since it left us with another villain in the name of   Fyodor Dostoyevsky, so in this anime it may be a clean open ending, it really wasn't, that clean, since only two Guild member who met his demise, and the rest were just allowed to go free as it nothing happens, so in this anime's overall it was fair enough to be a 6 and that' as far as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Holidays to everyone.",

I was actually really hyped for this season, having read the manga and knowing what was to come. Did it live up to my hype?\r\nYes. No. Kinda. Hear me out on this.\r\nWarning: Slight spoilers for season 1 but I am assuming you finished it if you think about watching this season anyway.\r\nStory:\r\nWith the way the season is structuredI would like to say that despite the description of the season, Bungou Stray Dogs 2 is not completely a sequel to Bungou Stray Dogs season 1. It is part a prequel and a sequel, with the first four episodes being about Dazai and his friend Osadaku four years prior to the series while everything after that takes place after season 1.\\n\\n\r\nI make that distinction because story wise those two parts are very different beasts.\\n\\n\r\nBeing based on the second light novel, the first four episodes show Dazai when he was still in the mafia. He and Odasaku try to find their mutual friend Ango who went missing. It\u2019s part mystery, part thriller, part action and it\u2019s every bit intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of that short arc is told really well, with every episode filled with twist that felt so tight that I had to take a nap each time I finished one. I learnt later that the Odasaku arc is a fan favourite and it shows with how beautifully it\u2019s translated into animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside of that arc is though that since it takes up four episodes, the rest of the series has to suffer for it. Right after the mini-arc ends the story picks up where season 1 left off: the Guild is right at the Agency\u2019s doorstep and a three way war on it\u2019s way. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fantastic setting worthy of cool fights and character development but it falls short. A lot of things happen in this arc, from characters being introduced to dynamics of some of the established characters changing but with the little time they had it felt very rushed which not only made the plot and characters feel a lot less substantial but also created a few plot holes that the viewer had to guess to fill out.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t help that it sometimes feels the director threw pacing out of the window in favour of pretty stylistic shots. I will go into it later but they leave a lot of blank space where the characters don\u2019t really do anything. It messed up the pacing a lot, making you pause instead feeling natural to the progression of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the mini arc in the beginning is great but is sadly pulled down by the actual plot of the season. Which isn\u2019t terrible by any means just\u2026 not that great. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nOkay, the for what the story lacks it makes up in artistry and I really mean that. The character models are fantastic, the shots of Yokohama gorgerous and the animation as top notch as season 1. Colours and style are used to emphasize characters and their actions to beautiful effect. It\u2019s an overall solid looking anime which is a feast to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nExcept for those artistic shots I mentioned. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they are gorgerous and pretty to look at but their placement just feels\u2026 off. You can see it best in the opening and ending where right after strong and beautiful shots the animation just\u2026 stops and turns slow. Where there could be movement or progression like the music implies we instead have static images with subtle movement. It\u2019s not exciting or engaging it\u2019s just there to be pretty and be there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s a problem that occurs a lot outside of the Odasaku arc. It makes the animation, while pretty, lack impact and feel anti-climatic. I can\u2019t say if it\u2019s due to the directing or art design but it\u2019s not good and definitely a minus. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nTry as I might, I can\u2019t find any flaws with the soundtrack. It\u2019s great music used to great effect in the series. The opening and ending especially are gorgerous and I listen to them all the time.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, that is only for the Odasaku arc though. The rest of the season, while still great, misses a lot of the beats, pun not intended, that the mini arc had. The blend in of the ending at the end of episodes stands out especially, feeling a bit off at times, as if it set in just a bit too early. The set in of the opening also feels a bit off sometimes as well as if the producers didn\u2019t quite know where to place it themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a game breaker and the usage of the rest of the soundtrack is still good but it does earn a bit of a minues. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, again I have to draw a clear line between the Odasaku arc and the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of it\u2019s focus on two characters, four if you count Ango and the villain, each character is given enough attention to know who they are, what their motivation and what their role in the story is. Each of their actions has an impact and all of them get their ending, whether we like how their ending is or not.\\n\\n\r\nWe might not know a lot of those characters besides Dazai and hell we don\u2019t even know that much about Dazai either now that I think about it, but we know enough. Enough to care about them and worry about their dreams and aspirations.\\n\\n\r\nThe main series on the other hand gets the short end of the stick. A lot of characters are introduced and each of them have interesting abilities and personalities on their own but the anime just doesn\u2019t have the time to introduce them properly. Yes, they do get introductions but they are very rushed and don\u2019t quite have the impact they deserve.\\n\\n\r\nEven the established characters don\u2019t get away because even they get shafted to the side to instead rush the story along. Things that should have huge impacts on the motivations and relationships of characters leave a lot of things out or clumsily execute them to the point that it feels like none of it matters. It\u2019s a real shame because even in the moments when it\u2019s supposed to be their time to shine, the characters need to take a backseat to the pacing which means that less time is spent on them as characters and more on their fighting which is over in minutes.\\n\\n\r\nIt really hurts me to do this because I love these characters but I can\u2019t really overlook the rushed nature of it all. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIt might not sound that way with the way I gripe on this series, but I do truly enjoy it. I enjoy watching characters based on authors duke it out out with their superpowers. I enjoy watching the characters struggle against their morals and adversaries. I really enjoy all these various characters with various powers coming together and see what would happen.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the pacing and character development issues it has, I truly enjoy this series because I enjoy the characters. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nI really love Bungou Stray Dogs. It\u2019s a fascinating concept and this series does well to build on what season 1 created. It has flaws, many, many flaws, but it\u2019s still really good. The Odasaku arc almost makes up for the pacing issues in the rest of the series but only almost. If you can stomach bad pacing but great characters that sadly don\u2019t get the attention they deserve but with great animation and visuals, then this is definitely worth a watch.",

The plot became much more generic and mainstream that it didn't reflect well on that amazing prequel arc i just watched. Finishing the season i was Disappointed and would've loved if they continued with the dark and gritty stuff with the port mafia.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nI love the art, it's one of the best things in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nIt's good\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters oh my gosh, I love everyone in the prequel arc.\\n\r\nThe current timeline guys are pretty boring and are the anchor of this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI'm half and half on it but the prequel arc really saved it for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this season and was a great improvement over season 1, but the story for Atsushi needs to be much better.",

            "content": "Well, why I liked Bungou Stray Dogs Second Season so much? Because they adapted few of my favourite writers in a way that left me speechless. \r\nI'm an hardcore reader (especially books) and when it comes to literature... well, everything is just fine for me. But! There is always a but. ,\r\nLet's start from the bottom. The story: we are left where the first season ended and that's quite normal for an ordinary season like Bungou Stray Dogs (BSD from now on). All the characters return on screen and they are not changed. If you are reading this review and you have not seen thefirst season, well, why are you reading it, then?\\n\r\nReturning to the point: the story goes just fine. The ending is a bit wow! But not too much. In fact, i'll say that the story of BSD is the only \"weak spot\" that the anime has. \\n\r\nBut, even in its weak spot, BSD can surprise us: the beginning of the season is a little diamond. I loved it. (Especially because i found some references to my real life, as a reader.)\\n\r\nBut it's, however, an ordinary story in the anime world. \\n\r\nClimbing the ladder, there is the art: quite enjoyable. I liked it. Smooth, sometimes darker, sometimes lighter. \\n\r\nSound: songs, background themes, sounds, voices were just fine. Nice job in adapting the manga. Nice job, really. \\n\r\nHere we come at the juicy part: Characters! All the characters in BSD are based on real writers of the XIX and XX century. Japanese and non, the characters are imaginary created on the real authors that at their time founded literary movements and new thinking stream (such as HP Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, Fitzgerald, Dazai, Izumi Kyouka etc...). The author created, also, powers for each, based on their work (No Longer Human - Dazai, for example is a classic Japanese). That's, for me, a paradise, a valhalla. I managed to discover so many authors, poet and writers that I... \\n\r\nBack to the ground, folks. I loved the characters because they are not the classic \"oh another normal character\". They are created with a reason in mind: entertain. Even secondary ones.\\n\r\nBut for the non-hardcore readers like me, BSD can be, in my opinion, a bit boring. As the story reveals its secret, one can easily predict the future of the season. For me it's a plain 10, for personal reason, but for another would be a modest rating. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: well, i think that I explained myself enough in the previous point. I say only that i enjoyed watching BSD.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: BSD II is not just the ordinary sequel for another ordinary work. If you could search a bit deeper, you could find that BSD hide something bigger: a memory. Memory of those who created the modern literature. And if you don't want to search (because you have the right to say \"no, I want to watch BSD and not giving a brick about anything\") you would, however, enjoy a nicely done work. \\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: Just a bit piece of spoiler ahead (Dont worry it wont even count as a spoiler, nothing that big)\r\nLet me begin, by saying that I am not one of those people (no offence) that will give this season a higher rating, just because we got to see Dazai's past. \r\n-Story\r\n The second season was well written compared to the first. This might come in a little off because of my foreword but, Dazai's past is my favourite arc. Because of everything begins from there.\r\n I guess we could say that the first season was just for introducing the characters, and giving you ideas asto what it may revolve around. The second season is where things get serious. Even if I say serious, the light-heartedness of some aspects of the anime still remain. \\n\r\n-Art\\n\r\n The art was very well done, as expected of Bones. The fight scenes, facial expressions, and the one thing I love: their eyes. Colorful/colourful little stuff right there.\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\n One of the things I also love about this anime is...they have all of my favourite voice actors! Great voice actors in a great anime? Man, that's a must watch (For Durarara fans: its fun seeing Kida/Dazai still being a womanizer, and Izaya/Ranpo changing job, from an information broker to a super detective) The voice acting is perfect, no need to worry about that (because I know the feeling, that frustrating moment where the VA's doesn't follow the character's personality, importantly, their expressions) The OST's are good, especially that epic music of when the Port Mafia's about to do a badass thing is a must listen.\\n\r\n-Character\\n\r\n The hugest, if not the the greatest, element of the whole story. Can you just imagine, how one character's appearence or their way of living would not be present if it wasn't for an another character. Oda Sakunosuke, friend of Dazai, literally became my favourite character, even if he had only like, 3 or 4 episodes of screen time. Because of him, everything happened. If it wasn't for him, Dazai would not be in the Agency, Im sure he would still be in Port Mafia, sinking deeper and deeper in to the dark side, eventually unable to see or reach the bright side anymore. If Dazai was not present in the Agency, then we wouldn't see our main protagonist, Atsushi in the Agency. He would probably be already dead, because of how he has bounty on his head and being unaware of his powers. And if Atsushi was not in the Agency, we wouldn't see our dear Kyouka being brought to the bright side. She would probably have already killed more than 35 people. Or we might not even see her at all. Just imagine, if all that happened, what would become of the anime? That is just how big of an impact Oda has in the anime. \\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\n I enjoyed it very much, and is looking forward to a season 3, if there ever will be one. You will get a hint (or just a bad joke, hope its not) as to whether there might a one or not at the end of the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall its a 8/10 from me :) \\n\r\nHappy watching!",

There is a lot of comedy in it too especially with Osamu Dazai XD, who tries to commit suicide all the time but it never works in a comedy way. \r\nCharacters:\r\nCharacters like Dazai or Akutagawa are really cool, because of the way of their personality and the bonds they have witheach other. They are like one big family who care for each other and protect each other.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this an 8 because of the good comedy which is in it and the action in general which is also good because of their different powers.",

The rest of the season continues where they left off from season 1 the was exceptionally thrilling the action and the battles you get a rush of adrenaline. The plot line was a emotional mess cause it sad, happy, exciting, nerve-wrecking and hilarious throughout the seasonand you can't stop watching it. My personal highlight was the character development, the characters through their faults and weaknesses they grow strong. Be the good guys or the bad guys they keep fighting for something they love which is admirable. Overall every aspect of the story was fantastic.",

( Visit here for more detailed version but contains spoiler \u00bb http://rui-anime.weebly.com/ruis-anime-blog/bungou-stray-dogs-s2-review-spoiler )\r\nThe ending of Season 1 was hanging with the emergence from Port Mafia boss & The Guild member. Back then, I was thinking that Bungou Stray Dogs [\u6587\u8c6a\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30c3\u30b0\u30b9] Season 1 would be 24 episodes rather than 12 episodes to continue the story. The fate rang another option. Season 2 announced when the hype of the 1st season was still in the air. My expectation for Season 2 definitely, as Mori-san said in the last episode of the 1st, \u201cchallenging wartime situation\u200b,\u201d with newcomersenter the battle field of the Gifted.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT: 9\\n\r\nIn brief the 2nd season of Bungou Stray Dogs is divided into two parts. The first part elucidates Dazai\u2019s past experience. It is not just a quick glance in an episode, it takes more than two episodes for past life events only. Gladly we\u2019re offered by Dazai\u2019s past that contains several information (which has relation now) and insight to characters as the members of Port Mafia. This past experience of his life has a strong relation with what happens now in the background after 4 years of it. The second part, of course, is all about war XD whoopsie not really but yesh I guess. The second part of it has several issues: where does Kyouka belong?; the fight over Atsushi; the fight among three Gifted organizations; and some of characters intimacy (reunion).\\n\\n\r\nThe flash-forward or flashback chronological order is like a peek-a-boo, I felt mocked when I was waiting for the explanation of what The Guild ulterior motive really is as they appeared in the last episode of Season 1. But, it\u2019s just awhile I felt like that. I absorbed by the storyline of this kind of flashback and sat quietly to watch each episode. The flashback succeed to make correlation in the past and present of current characterizations and events. The masterpiece parts of this series happen after that. All of the fight, troublesome issues, brilliant strategies, advices, characters development, and of course for action-supranatural anime, the visualization aspect. The story if I can say in a phrase, is, splendid like games of mind.\\n\\n\r\nART & CHAR DEV: 9 & 10\\n\r\nThe past experience of Dazai appeared to be sullen with dark and shades, not much details in the surrounding I could find there. I think the focus is only for the story itself. Jump up to the current situation with fucking tension everywhere, the comedy scenes are less than the previous season. There aren\u2019t many silly scenes (which is appropriate for such complicated situation, but I miss the comedy parts like the 1st season). The visualization is much more appealing than the first season. I don\u2019t know which is the most suitable reason for it, but I guess it\u2019s because the anime is also embedded feelings in it. So many feelings (but not an emotional one). Sometimes I even got motivated by it, or sometimes touched. Even if the series has so many characters, even more than the first season, I gave it two-thumbs up for being able to cover their roles in right parts. Every major characters development can be seen clearly, particularly their self. The main supporting roles assist the major characters development as well as the sequence of issues. The minor supporting roles are still there, with momentary scenes but fill up well. I never expected about the very reasoning of a few characters act or say for the things they do, they have firm mindset and value about things. The character development is intently mesmerizing, one after another. Since we are being served with also the past life of the organizations here we can grab more the information about the relationship between them (their potential connection). even their mindset all pouring in 12 eps of second season. Such a large amount of chars but presented in a fucking right portion unexpectedly. The visualization is supported by characters development is in line with the problematic troubles that must be beared, The pressure is real. The visualization is magnificent. I still recall many scenes there.\\n\r\n\u200b\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nOP Theme Song is sung by SCREEN mode, \u201cReason Living\u201d. I love it in an instant, the lyrics are great as it should be. Check it out MV SCREEN mode - Reason Living. The ED song is sung by Luck Life. Luck Life also sang the theme song for Bungou Stray Dogs 1st season. Meanwhile, \u201cNamae wo Yobu yo\u201d in the 1st season is more relaxing, the ED theme song for the 2nd season, \u201cKaze ga Fuku Machi (\u98a8\u304c\u5439\u304f\u8857)\u201d is an upbeat one. Luck Life is not disappointing me even with the upbeat song, MV Kaze ga Fuku Machi. If you\u2019re looking for the lyric, the song portrays the inner-self of characters in Bungou Stray Dogs precisely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s definitely common to find such a promising series got supported for Season 3. I wish this one is going to be that way too. 9++! All hail Bungou Stray Dogs series, I\u2019m considering to join fandom now /slapped/.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Those freaking animation. better than the well-made 1st season\\n\r\n- More competitive story and supporting by balanced char dev. It\u2019s a mind game. the series drives me crazy (hyped up when watch it)\\n\r\n- Nice theme songs",

Maybe it's because I don't speak Japanese, the subtitels sometimes go to fast or because English isn't my first language, but I completely missed the memo that it was a flashback and thought nothing made sense. It took me 3 episodes to find out it was a flashback.\r\nI also thought the flashback was.. boring. Then again, maybe it's just me because I like action and the flashback was 90%talking.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the flashback stopped, I was confused again because I forgot what happened at the end of the first season. I had finished the first season the evening before I started watching the second season, but the flashback just completely got me out of it.\\n\\n\r\nBut the second season did not disappoint me besides that flashback. The new characters were just as amazing as the others and I couldn't stop watching. I loved how they just continued the story like it wasn't interupted by a flashback.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the flashback, I can't give this season a 10/10, but it definitly deserves a 9/10.",

            "content": "The second season of Bungou Stray Dogs builds on the successes, and some of the flaws, of the first. For the most part, it\u2019s an improvement on almost all aspects of the first season, including the animation, soundtrack and even the story. The story is mentioned in a skeptical light because the second season still follows the same format as the first, although not in the first four episodes known as the prequel arc. That format is a series of high-stakes battles between characters with superhuman abilities.\r\nTo fully understand the format mentioned, I\u2019d recommend the first season, which aired in the spring season, be seento completion. It would not only help you understand the improvements made to the second season but also help you adjust your expectations for the show in general. Bungou Stray Dogs is not a bad series by any means; it\u2019s excellent at its technical aspects but suffers from its wealth of characters and the lack of a concrete plot.\\n\\n\r\n[A vast improvement on the first season]\\n\r\nAs identified earlier, the second season greatly improves on many aspects of the first. This is immediately noticed with the grittier, more detailed character and background art and animation as seen in the first few scenes of the show. The opening also shows the improvement to the music in the show, with an introduction (in the second episode) to the excellent song \u2018Reason Living\u2019 by SCREEN, which closely depicts the characters\u2019 struggles with the looming menace present in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe more remarkable improvement comes with the overall mood of the show; the switch from the more comical and episodic storytelling of the first episodes of the first season, to a darker tone. The comedy, which usually seemed out of place in the first season, is almost non-existent. In its place are violent scenes that better depict the show\u2019s time period, characters that show the appropriate emotions when in peril as well as a deeper, more mysterious plot - at least for the first four episodes. The epitome of these improvements is shown in the prequel arc: the first four episodes of the show.\\n\\n\r\n[The prequel arc]\\n\r\nWhere the first season provides hints into the background of one of its most interesting characters, the prequel arc provides the details. It tells the story of Oda Sakunosuke, a low-ranked Port Mafia enforcer, and his influence on Dazai. Like the officers of the Port Mafia, Oda has a special ability: he\u2019s able to see six seconds into the future. While the ability makes for exciting battle scenes, it\u2019s not the central focus of the arc. The prequel arc focusses on Oda\u2019s struggles as he works with Dazai to solve a mystery. Their roles as members of the Port Mafia lends a darker, more violent mood to the series.\\n\\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the prequel arc, the show returns to the characters of the Special Detective Agency and the Port Mafia. They are joined by The Guild, another group of individuals with special abilities, introducing a three-way conflict that\u2019s accompanied by many battles. The members of Guild swell the already huge cast of characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\n[The perils of a wealth of characters:]\\n\r\nThe plot of series past the prequel arc returns to the format of the first season albeit with a darker, more serious tone; it\u2019s replete with character introductions and battles. Each encounter with a Guild member introduces another renowned author and a special ability based on one of their books but the novelty wears off soon and we\u2019re left with the ensuing battles. Unfortunately, the lack of motives and substantial build-up reduces the fights to a series of well-animated scenes. Almost all the Guild members simply serve as villains for the main characters and are seen in no other light.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the huge cast makes it difficult to develop the characters, a few of the characters from the first season show improvement. Atsushi is less whiny, becoming more dependable and persistent; Dazai remains the powerful character he always was but does show a few vulnerable moments; Akutagawa draws closer to earning the approval he yearns for.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall:]\\n\r\nThe second season of Bungou Stray Dogs could be summarized as a brilliant show in all the technical aspects that struggled to provide depth for all of its large cast. The improved animation and music made for more engaging battles and I occasionally looked up the inspiration for a new character whenever he/she was introduced.\\n\\n\r\n[Grade:]\\n\r\nOverall (sub): 7\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nMusic: 9\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n",

            "content": "Combat-\r\n       In every anime there you have individuals have  any type of power it is important to build a confine in which powers will be in.Even if  power's are super natural having them abide to few key rules gives audience bedrock on which they can start understanding how anime's universe works,without  them viewer will feel lost and not invested.This issue that Stray Dogs is facing. powers are called gifts and what gift can be has no limits.Anime  gives no effort to explain what gifts are , how one might have it and what constitutes powersit might have. Watching fight seens gave me a feeling of watching sport i dont know rules off, sure there is action but it feels up in air nothing to base off.One of reasons what made HunterxHunter fights so immersive and enjoyable is because its  power system had well defined limits and even most powerful individuals had to abide to those limitations. Groundless power system becomes especially tedious  in second half as dozen newer and newer gifted individuals are  introduced at which point all the powers were starting to give me a head ache . While this is  issue all the way.Fights in first half are still interesting to watch as they are technical  , while second half turns into cliche shounen, with fights being won who can scream harder. \\n\\n\r\nP.S another issue is death as it is rather inconsistent , one civilian will take entire magazine of bullets and walk it off while others will die in one or two shoots \\n\r\nCharecters-\\n\r\n              Show has alot of interesting and fun characters i often noticed my self laughing at them or along side them. however They have colorful personalities , none of them get any back story. There was only singel arc touching  Charecter \"Dazai's\" past. Even main protagonist gets very surfice level back story not to mention rest of cast is fully neglected, even main villans . \\n\r\nStory-\\n\r\n           Anime has ups and downs. Beginning of the show is very good , as it does good job combing  comedy, worldbuilding, charecter interaction in episodic manner. Show often has moments then it suddenly drops serious tone to a comedic and it was joy to watch. Second half starts off strong however falls into very cliche shounen defeat  big nasty villan category.\\n\r\nAnimation-\\n\r\n          Animation is rather good, its nothing ground breacking but it does its job and does it well. It wants you to focus on on screen action there are great particle and charecter animation.Does it want to to more focus on charecter's dialoge , it adapts simplistic art style while keeping minimalistic body language. Does it want to focus on comedy factor is becomes guffy and colorful. This rotation between different art styles kept it fresh  and made sure you would not get bored with same  art form.\\n\r\n  Would i recommend it?\\n\r\n yes i would while it did have it faults , overall it was fun to watch .\\n\\n\\n",

But other than that I loved it.\r\nAfter a while I saw that season 2 is airing, it didn't get my interest at first but after I saw that they made nendoroid of Dazai and Chuuya, it got me interest again. So I watched season 2, and thisis my review.\\n\\n\\n\r\n( Spilers ahead )\\n\\n\r\n[ STORY ]  10\\n\r\nI LOVE IT SO MUCH! The first arc was SO good, Dazai looks so much cooler when he was still in port mafia. Season 2 plot is so interesting, the Guild started a war with the Agency and Port Mafia, and then the Agency collaborate with Port Mafia. It has been so long that I got really excited for an anime. Especially when Dazai fight the Guild with Chuuya as his partner again, tho I wish they show us the time when Dazai was still in Port Mafia and do mission with Chuuya then it will be more awesome. If I can rate the story more than 10 I will.\\n\\n\r\n[ ART ]  10\\n\r\nSince season 1, the art was already good. But season 2, I really love the first arc about Dazai, Odasaku and Ango. Cause it got the mafia vibes you know, it's rare for an anime, too many friendly type anime these days, that's why Bungo is definitely an anime you should watch.\\n\\n\r\n[ SOUND ]  10\\n\r\nThe opening is badass and as always the ending is so good, tho season 1 ED is better than season 2 in my opinion. And I definitely love the video for the opening in the first arc better.\\n\\n\r\n[ CHARACTER ]  10\\n\r\nDazai Osamu\\n\r\nI love Dazai even more in season 2, he can be funny and scary at the same time, tho he is much cooler when he wears black in the Port Mafia.\\n\\n\r\nChuuya Nakahara\\n\r\nOkay so I immediately loved him when I saw him in season 1 when Dazai teased him and he got all mad, but at the same time he is cool and a strong person. In season 2 there's a scene when he fight with Dazai again againts the Guild, and it got me chills seeing they being partners again even tho it was just for the night\\n\\n\r\n[ ENJOYMENT ]  10\\n\r\nI REALLY ENJOYED IT. I probably going to watch it again lol.\\n\\n\r\n[ OVERALL ]  10\\n\r\nI LOVED IT. I hope they'll make season 3, because it certainly an anime that I can't wait to watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story - 6\r\nA lot of people praise this anime for its unique plot and interesting story. And yes, I agree the concept is amazing and very well thought out. However, I did not find the plot as outstanding as I did with other anime. Maybe it was the constant literature references, over half which I didn't get (apart from the characters of the Guild, who were not as well developed as the main characters). Maybe my expectations were just too high, after hearing so many great things about this anime. Or maybe it was just generally the fast pacing of each of the episodes yetthe slow pacing of the entire series itself. Either way, the story was not terrible, but not a work of masterpiece either. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I thought was a bit mediocre was the use of comedy. The constant switch from seriousness to lightheartedness was sometimes refreshing, at other times felt too forced. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes, character designs, all of them were truly outstanding. One of the best art I have ever seen, apart from a select few other anime which I've watched and enjoyed. Nothing much to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were great. I didn't pay as much focus to the soundtrack during the anime as I did with the openings and endings however, being too caught up with the actual scenes of the anime. However, apart from the openings and endings, nothing really stood out to me, \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sole reason I gave a seven to the characters was because I didn't feel like enough of the large cast was developed enough apart from our fellow Armed Detective Agency characters and a few from Port Mafia. The Guild Members, for example. Two of the characters only barely appeared in one episode, and were never heard of or mentioned again. One we know barely of, only that he is \"special\" compared to other members. The main villain's backstory we mainly get a glimpse of, and while at an attempt to make us feel sorry for him, I found it still hard to. The character I enjoyed the most was probably the main character from the flashback of the first four episodes of season 2, which I gotta say were one of the most powerful and well-written episodes of the series. Apart from that, while the first four eps of the second season were supposed to be Dazai's backstory, mostly focuses on another character. And although I found that interesting, it still didn't clear up many questions I had for Dazai himself. \\n\\n\r\nAnother are the powers of the characters. Maybe I missed this by chance, but how come Atsushi can turn his body parts into a tiger when they said he could only transform into a tiger in the moonlight? Did they mean a full-body tiger? If so, how did Atsushi learn to transform his arms and legs to tiger so easily?\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing, probably, was how none of the characters actually died. Some came close, but were miraculously saved at the right place at the right time, even when they definitely should have been killed off. \\n\\n\r\nBut, now to the good sides. Overall I loved the colorful personalities each of the characters had. No two characters were the same, and that was amazing. The fact that these characters' names, backstories, and ability names are all based on Japanese and Western literature is also amazingly well done. How the creators weaved in the history of these literature geniuses into a complete story of an anime was  truly outstanding and, in my opinion, what made this anime completely unique and stand out on its own. The fact that one episode was dedicated to one character of the Armed Detective Agency, and how we got to know them through our protagonist's eyes, was great. We truly got a feel of each of the characters through this, while also being able to sympathize and fall in love with them. Although I feel like the backstories of the characters, especaially with Kunikida, could have been touched on a bit more, along with more powerful emotional responses to some of the events in the story, but maybe this is just personal preference. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I also appreciated was the lack of fanservice. Apart from the occasional hints of incest here and there (and the devilishly hot characters) there weren't any forced scenes of characters' private parts (especially the female characters' chests) shoved into your face every time, nor did they sexualize a fourteen year old, which I've seen plenty of anime do these days. It was so refreshing to finally see an anime with minimal to no fanservice ever shown on the screen. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\\n\r\nAll these factors combined, and my enjoyment score is a solid 7. The characters and sometimes the comedy made things very interesting, but the jumbly narrative along with some confusing and skimmed plot lines sort of took away from the many great things about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nTo recap: The story itself in my opinion was not good nor bad, just somewhere in the middle. Perhaps I should read the manga to get a better understanding of the story, if that would help. The art was once again, amazing, and the character designs were unique, fun, and corresponded very well to the characters themselves and their personalities. The music was good in my opinion, just didn't stand out much. The characters were great, just with the huge cast some didn't feel well-developed, while others barely made an appearance nor appeared. Overall, this was an interesting series to watch, definitely worth my time. For those who love amazing characters and a somewhat interesting storyline, this is the anime for you.",

            "content": "*contain spoilers*\r\nTo be honest, I almost gave up on this show because there were some episodes (in 1st and 2nd season) that quite boring in my opinion. There were not much improvement on the story around those episodes. The Agency was basically just running around chasing the bad guys and getting to know with each character in each episodes. \r\nBUT, I'm glad that I decided to keep watching the show and see how it goes. And yes, now I know why many people like this show. The last eight episodes were EPIC. I didn't expect The Agency to work together with Port Mafia to defeatThe Guild. And every battle after that is just GREAT. The battle between The Guild's members vs Chuuya-Dazai and the final battle of Atsushi-Akutagawa were the most entertaining, breathtaking battles in this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is also great, it has the 'slice of life genre' type of style and also the 'action genre' type of style. And it created something that is not too heavy/serious but also not too light (honestly I don't know how to explain this). The animators did a pretty good job in combining these two styles. The seiyuus also did a great job, the expressions of every characters were perfect, especially with the jokes! The jokes are AWESOME! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review may contain SPOILERS!!!\r\nSeconds season starts off four years before the events of the first season for the first four episodes. It shows what Dazai was like in his dark past; how he went from being a part of Port Mafia to the Armed Detective Agency. The arc was really dark and sad.\r\nAfter the first four episodes, it continues from where it left off with the first season which is the second arc (episode 5, 6, 7, 8 of second season). Now, there's a war going on between the gifted organizations; the Armed Detective Agency, Port Mafia, and the Guild.\r\nSince the Guild are reallypowerful and that they want to burn the city the two opposing team live in, both Armed Detective Agency and Port Mafia decides to team up with each other to defeat the Guild.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the 8th episode, the third arc comes in. In this arc, the Armed Detective Agency and Port Mafia defeat the Guild and put an end to them. It focuses a lot on Atsushi and Akutagawa, showing that there is a big difference between the two but yet, they seem so similar. Their goals are relevant but, from a afar standpoint, the two seemed totally different.\\n\r\nAtsushi stops pitying himself at this point. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the same as first season as season two was made in the same year as it is still splendid. It still has the funny expressions as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound quality is still great. The opening soundtrack is pretty good and is a lot better than the first.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA few more interesting characters with cool abilities were introduced in this season and some of the  previous ones received some more backstory to them. Dazai, Lucy, and Mori were some of those who had their backstory shown, especially Dazai's. These characters' expressions are still funny as ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I did not like for character design was Francis' ability, The Great Fitzgerald, to spend money for power and then when he runs out, he becomes weak which I find really stupid. His motive for burning down an entire city is pretty stupid as well.\\n\\n\r\nSide note: A theory of mine but each gifted organization has at least an orphan on their side, this makes me assume that the anime's title is based on this. There were also orphans that were being taken care of by Dazai's friend in the first arc of this season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSecond season was really enjoyable. All three arcs had a great story. The first was interesting and it also left me in tears at certain scenes. The second was pretty exciting, seeing what each organization comes up for a plan to protect themselves and to oppose others. The third left me in awe with it's turn of events and epic battles, especially the last one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this gets a 9/10 and a MUST watch for those who have seen the first season!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It was in no way shape or form so bad that it's unwatchable but considering the hype that surrounds it, I expected more. While in technicalities this was a pretty good sequel to the first season with lots of character and plot development, beautifully animated fight scenes and unique storyline I couldn't help but feel something was lacking.\r\n Bungou Stray Dogs feels very rough around the edges, the main characters albeit Atsushi are well designed and interesting but Atsushi as the main character just doesn't do itfor me. He of all characters felt the least developed and any improvement he did make was so lacklustre I couldn't find me caring. I was more moved by Akutagawa's growth until I found out he's just a whiny bitch dying for Dazai's approval. I did however really enjoy Dazai's backstory and Kyouka's arc and the over events in this season.\\n\r\n The storyline of this season was honestly engaging but I feel like they could have been dealt with in a better way. Every time something was getting interesting it was over and the anime moved on leaving me feeling like a whole lot of nothing happened. \\n\r\n  The opening and closing songs were nothing special either but I did enjoy the animation in those sequences. \\n\r\n  I think I will give season 3 a stab as I am invested in some of the characters but overall I have to say I'm expecting pretty big things from season 3 for it to live up to it's hype.",

And surprisingly, my hope paid off.\r\nNot only did they significantly improve on the methods through which the characters and character relationships were developed, but their attempt at creating an enticing storyline was unexpectedly impressive. \r\nStarting off the season with a full 4 episodes of context-building backstory regarding Dazai's past in the Port Mafia and why he betrayed them that did not rely on contrived, desperate plotlinesor excess exposition but rather built a touching story in and of itself gave me refreshing new feelings towards this series as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of a shaky yet powerful alliance between the Port Mafia and Armed forces allows for natural character relationship development and backstory reveals, giving the storyline a natural flow that the first season somewhat missed out on by not giving the characters an ultimate goal.\\n\\n\r\nThe more frequent references to the books written by the authors that inspired the characters finally gave the series the musty, bookshelf, literary air that I believe they hoped to create from the moment of its conception. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, several of the characters still are less than original (or possibly redrawn/recoloured versions of characters from other Anime), and while we now know that both the Port Mafia and the Armed forces love the city they share, this just makes me question why they were fighting in the first place more.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the pleasant surprise of this second season being a good way to binge watch away my life at 2 am in the morning without getting bored has me in a good mood, so I shall partially overlook these aspects for now. \\n\\n\r\nGood series.

The development in the characters, the animation, and the plot itself for only FOUR EPISODES, is what's truly memorable. The episodes really made an overall okay season worth it for me, and maybe it willbe worth watching for you as well.",
