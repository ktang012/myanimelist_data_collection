            "content": "As someone who aspires to work in the video games industry, I find Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online incredibly fascinating. Unlike most virtual reality stories, GGO actually explores video games in interesting ways beyond just a flashy action spectacle. And yes, it has the spectacle as well. \r\nGGO is far different, and better than the rest of the Sword Art Online franchise; for starters, you don\u2019t even need to watch the originals to watch this spinoff. There are no related characters, no Kirito. The only similarity they share is the world they take place in. The original SAO is mentioned a few timesand surprisingly the new series writer frequently criticises the old one. GGO focuses on the in-depth details of its game world and the friendships between the cast, rather than the melodrama and cheesy romance of the original. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in 2026, GGO follows Karen a college student with a height complex, namely she\u2019s way taller than she\u2019d like to be. Walking into signs, gawked at by passersby, low self-confidence, and constantly comparing herself to the group of cute short girls she sees every day. When she discovers VR games like SAO, she\u2019s hesitant because of the controversy over people being trapped in the game is still discussed on the news. But she is willing to try them if it means she\u2019d get the chance to be shorter. The character creator system being randomized is the only outright bad game design decision in GGO, but that\u2019s just how the original series wrote it. This minor issue can be excused because it eventually leads Karen to Gun Gale Online, a gritty first-person shooter where she\u2019s able to be her ideal short height. The lead character has a pretty good motivation to play the game makes the show all the more compelling, it\u2019s perhaps a simple reason but much more than we were ever given for Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nSimplistic characterization is all GGO really needs because it\u2019s main focus is on the intense firefights. The first episode serves to thoroughly explain the mechanics of the game so that the rest of the series can play with the established rules. For what is essentially an exposition episode, the information is presented by showing rather than just telling in the Battle Royale style game mode called Squad Jam. While the visuals are simply above average, the action is surprisingly engaging with the strategizing and tactics explained through banter between the protagonist, plucky pink camouflaged Karen, but with the in-game name LLENN and her partner M. Their group\u2019s dynamic is clear from the start, LLENN is the one who has to run into the fight as a decoy and draw away the attention of enemies while M takes a vantage point to snipe them while they\u2019re distracted. Their personalities perfectly fitted to their roles in the fight; LLENN is anxious with plenty of funny reaction faces, sporadically running into the battlefield. While M is patient and unwavering, coldly issuing orders with the goal of winning regardless of the danger it puts his partner in. \\n\\n\r\nPlayed out like a game of chess, careful planning and positioning are invaluable. Seeing the strategies LLENN and others use to lead them to success is incredibly satisfying; they're not professionals so there's always a chance they will run into mistakes now and then, and their flaws are part of each character. For LLENN and M, we're given enough details to know their relationship is based in needing one another to execute their strategy, the bait and switch, but beyond that, they\u2019re two incompatible pieces. Through seeing them fight and their banter we learn the mechanics of the game; an intermittent scan reveals every challenger\u2019s location, the red lasers indicating bullet trajectory, dead players can be used as human shields, health and bullet count are detailed and are at consistent values throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe writer\u2019s knowledge of the inner workings of a complex video game is what makes GGO so believable. Look no further than the tense action scenes, despite being acknowledged as just a game they still have stakes. The original SAO had poorly explained rules to its game, so instead it chose to contrive tension by trapping the players in the game world and punishing anyone who died in-game with death in reality. But there is no such lazy writing here. In the original SAO no one of importance ever died because they\u2019d be gone for good, but in GGO there is no such plot armor. They\u2019re in a fight to the death after all so it's inevitable most characters will die or be gravely wounded. \\n\r\nGGO is tense to watch in the same way watching a professional streamer is, you\u2019re rooting for them not just because they're an enjoyable host but because you want to see them overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds they face. \\n\\n\r\nThe action spectacle itself is well done too, it\u2019s clear that Studio 3Hz was having a lot of fun making this. There\u2019s no shortage of slow-mo climactic moments in firefights with bullets flying past players like The Matrix. A few thrilling vehicle fights happen as well. There\u2019s even a lightsaber later on in the series used to devastating effect unlike anything else seen in the show. Considering combat is the main focus of the series, it\u2019s great that GGO is always able to keep it refreshing. Guns are rendered with excellent detail, CGI is frequently used quite well to allow the camera to move freely and to ensure action scenes are fast-paced and flow well. Character animation is fluid when it counts with close-ups and slow-motion used to raise the tension in close encounters. \\n\\n\r\nPlenty of long shots of the battlefield are shown so you can keep track of the proximity of players and can follow the action as well as the protagonist does. What creates the most thrills is the visceral audiovisual feedback of the gunshots. Environments that are shot are visibly blasted, with loud shots suited to the wide variety of gun types used, and the effects on players who are shot. Violence is styled to the video game with red pixels that spurt out from wounds like blood. One might think a video game would limit the possibilities of the violence, but GGO has its fair share of decapitations and limbs being lopped off in combat. Battles gradually escalate in intensity throughout the show, the game mechanics established from the start remain consistent and they're experimented with to exciting effect. Eri Aoi\u2019s opening song \u201cRyusei\u201d is well suited to the battle-oriented series along with a striking showcase of the cast. The soundtrack is equally stellar. Whether it be the hard rock or the frantic techno pieces, all of the background music serves to electrify action scenes. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the action, there is enough intrigue in GGO\u2019s characters writing for it to provide a thoughtful discussion on video games. With the writer of Kino\u2019s Journey, Keiichi Sigsawa, there\u2019s depth to the characters in spite of the series\u2019 focus on gunplay. Escapism is a theme intrinsic to any video game story, thankfully Sigsawa understands this and weaves it into every character. Karen enters the game to become a shorter, more ideal version of herself, her skill in game grants her confidence in real life to overcome her complex. The first friend she meets, Pitohui plays the game to escape stress and relieve her anger, a portrayal leaning more on the negative end of escapism which leads her to become the antagonist of the second half. The show tries to sell her as a crazed SAO fanatic, but at first it doesn\u2019t seem believable enough because we merely hear about her insanity from M. Once we see the brutal ways she kills her foes in her Squad Jam against LLENN, it becomes much easier to believe she\u2019s out of touch with reality. \\n\\n\r\nPitohui\u2019s rather serious subject matter unexpectedly fits with the show\u2019s more wryly comedic tone because of her outlandish personality and character design. From the cross tattoos on her face to scare off creeps online, to the absurd levels of frivolity she treats her enemies in combat, she\u2019s one of the most entertaining rivals of the season. In the latter half of the show when Karen\u2019s friend Fuka joins her for the Squad Jam, much of the in-depth tactics are thrown out the window by her lack of care for the game which brings about the campiest and wild action sequences the show provides. Perhaps they\u2019re not as intelligently planned out, but they make up for it with entertainment value and homages to classic action movies and moment to moment humor in the midst of chaos. All of their seiyuu do a great job of selling their overdone personalities in the game world while toning it down to a believable level in reality. \\n\\n\r\nShown in a more positive light is the gymnastics team, fans of LLENN, that play Squad Jams to communicate better with one another. In between the Squad Jams, the show revisits the real world to catch up with the cast and mainly to discuss the next game and future Squad Jams. These scenes are a good reprieve from Gun Gale\u2019s battlefields. Serving to even out the pacing and introduce characters. The gymnastics team is just a bunch of kids who walk by Karen in real life and wish to be as tall as her (a sort of role reversal) and after fighting one another in the first Squad Jam they enter the second as allies. They\u2019re admittedly a bit one note, but I wouldn't call them cliched or stereotypical. They all have an attribute in their game avatar and how they behave in-game which is reflected in their real-world counterpart. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series, there\u2019s a noticeable change in all of the characters that is directly connected to the ways the game affected them. The ending provided a satisfying final stance on the bigger themes of positive versus negative escapism, as well as a completion to LLENN's arc that's as monumental and satisfying as the show had foreshadowed it to be. The final episode is one of the funniest, most shockingly great endings of the season that rewards you for following along with the minor story details and provides the best tongue-in-cheek comedy of the series.\\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\n[Story: 7/10] In-depth game world, sparse plot.\\n\r\n[Art: 7/10] Modest budget, dynamic action scenes. \\n\r\n[Sound: 8/10] Great music and enjoyable seiyuus. \\n\r\n[Character: 7/10] Simplistic, but they each offer intrigue.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 9/10] Thrilling fights, plenty of variation, fun and likable cast. \\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 7.6/10]\\n\r\nSword Art Online Alternative is the most entertaining entry in the franchise, it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously while also providing enough depth to be compelling. What it lacks in narrative high points it more than makes up for with a well-written game world that remains consistent with its logic throughout the show. Upon first glance, the cast seems paper thin, but with time it becomes clear how much care went into interweaving their arcs with interesting video game related themes.",

            "content": "6 years ago when Sword Art Online first aired, that piece of work caused controversy that still generates discussion to this very day. Then Summer 2014 came and we got the sequel known as Sword Art Online II. While being an improvement of the original series, it didn\u2019t really amplify itself as a big improvement. Four years later, here we are again. Except this time, it\u2019s not an actual continuation of the main series. Instead, we got this spinoff known as Sword Art Online: Alternative Online.\r\nTo be clear, you don\u2019t need to watch any of the previous series in the franchise. In fact, it doesn\u2019teven matter if it\u2019s the first time you found out this show exists. SAO: Alternative Online is the title as it suggests, an alternative story that takes place based on the SAO franchise. The original light novel is written by Keiichi Sigsawa rather than Reki Kawhara although he does provide supervision for the series. It takes place in a shared universe in the virtual world known as Gun Gale Online. The story deals with a university student named Karen Kohiruimaki who decided to join GGO under the alias \u201cLLENN\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019ll be frank. I\u2019m actually a bit of a fan of the Sword Art Online video games. I\u2019ve played Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization and more recently, Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet. The games actually contains a fair amount of enticing gameplay. After clocking a decent amount of hours in Fatal Bullet, I came to realize that Alternative Gun Gale Online isn\u2019t so much different than the game itself. My impression of the first few episodes felt like the anime dropped me inside a video game. We have the main character LLEEN as she enters the Gun Gale Online world. She\u2019s rather petite with a short height. In the real world, Karen is actually tall and has a height complex. As such, she takes on her chibi form in the virtual world to build her own self-esteem. There\u2019s quite a bit difference in their personalities between her real life and virtual character that they almost seem like two different people. However, the anime spends a majority of the time on her in-game avatar.\\n\\n\r\nThe show set some red flags at first because of this premise. First of all, how are we supposed to take a character like LLEEN seriously when she looks like a kid dressed in pink and a rabbit-looking hat? The first few episodes chronicles her life in the GGO world as we learn about her role. It also drops a fair amount of exposition about the mechanics of the game she participates in. Similar ro the SAO II, this series mainly involves firearms. This is also similar in comparison to the Fatal Bullet game as we see a variety of weaponry. LLEEN\u2019s choice of weapon is a pink P90 submachine-gun she nicknamed \u201cP-chan\u201d. It matches her style because of her speed and agility. In the meantime, the episode also introduces both allies and rivals as LLEEN spends more time in the GGO world. These include characters such a Pitohui, M, and Fuzarioh. Along the way, it\u2019s easy to see LLEEN\u2019s confidence develop as a player compared to her real life persona. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t really say the main cast of the series are memorable characters. LLENN is probably the only character that\u2019s worth investing time into despite being having a childish personality. This is a bit contrast to Pito, who seems to have some psychological issues especially when she\u2019s on the battlefield. M is a character that may feel like a comic relief after you realize his real personality. Finally, Fuka is LLEEN\u2019s partner and best friend with a big obsession with VR games. While there\u2019s definitely character chemistry between the main cast members, there\u2019s not much development at all involving them. It\u2019s a shame since the show could have really took the opportunity to make them into larger than life characters. Instead, they are just participants in the game for their roles. In real life, their characters are too average to be marketable and doesn\u2019t really sell their personalities in any appealing way. All other characters in the series are easily forgettable and in fact a disgrace to the game itself, especially the perverted men. I think at one point, LLENN even asked \u201cDo only lechers play this game?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nBy this point, you may be asking yourself if this show is worth watching. Honestly, it\u2019s not a hard question to answer but be prepared for a typical sci-fi/shounen story. The series feels like it\u2019s mainly aimed for gamers and fans of the franchise. If you\u2019re not a fan of this type of genre, then you may not get the best experience from this. Even after I played the games, I felt like show could of done more to develop the plot. Every episode that takes place in the GGO world feels the same with the battle royale-esque vibe and exposition. I do admit that the battles themselves can be quite exciting at times but once you\u2019ve seen a lot of it, the hype dies quickly. The cheesy words used in dialogues borders to creep factor at times while the comedy remains generally lighthearted throughout the show. On the other hand, the real life portrayal of characters in later episodes steps it up to the plate. Some segments are genuinely heartwarming to watch and a few are rather important to establish character roles. It blurs the line between fiction and reality like the way it should be.\\n\\n\r\nThis is 3Hz\u2019s first attempt at adapting a light novel series. Previously, they worked on original projects and a manga adaptation back in 2016. To me, they did a fair job although not an overly impressive one. I should say that praise should be given for the battle choreography as it feels like how a video game is portrayed. It has a similar style of the Fatal Bullet game including the death scenes. Camera angles, body movements, and character expressions are also well decorated to bring out memorable moments. Even the comedic factors sells well with the clever timings. There\u2019s also a variety of weapons that are accurately portrayed from the light novel and games such as the P90, M107A1 (anti-material rifle), KTR-09 (Assault Rifle), photon energy sword, and among others. It does fell flat in the monster gallery though as the show focuses much more on conflict between the players. Unfortunately, I have to admit the overall world setting really doesn\u2019t set the bar high for a virtual game. Every battleground environment looks the same that after you\u2019ve seen it once, it feels like you\u2019ve seen it all. The barren landscapes may looks suitable for the show but it\u2019s extremely tedious and lacks creativity. There\u2019s not even any diverse maps this season.\\n\\n\r\nOn the contrary, I will say the anime\u2019s soundtrack lived up expectations and perhaps gone a bit beyond. The battle OST creates an exciting mood as we see players fight for their lives. Character voices may sound a bit generic but I confess that they work wonderfully for their personalities. The theme songs brings back the familiar mood of the previous SAO series if you\u2019re a fan of those. In essence, it really works.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online: Alternative Online felt more like playing a video game than a watching an anime. After finishing this series, it felt like the creator wanted us to experience what\u2019s like being part of the GGO world. As I mentioned before, this anime seems to adhere to fans of the franchise and video game players. The sensation of battle royale games has been a phenomenon in the most recent years. It took the world by storm and may remain that way for awhile. For a show like this though, there\u2019s still room for improvement.",

            "content": "I've never touch this series before but after watching this show aswell reading what other people thinks about this show, it gave me an idea just a bit about the plot. But either way, I haven't seen any plot development. What I was trying to say is, the story is still shallow, empty. I wasn't mad about that, but considering this is a 12-episode adaptation, 4 episode with no development for the story was kind of a risky move.\r\nArt Style, well, the only thing that I like the most is the guns but that aswell wasn't unique. Nonetheless, I got no problem with the ArtStyle,Animation and anything related with it.\\n\\n\r\nSounds/Music was also had no difference. They are the same for those show that using gun sounds. But the Opening was pretty good if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are also facing the same problem similar to the plot. Both lack something. I feel the characthers are still shallow, empty. Due to the fact I still got the same information about the characthers. They are just playing a virtual game to escape reality. Farming stuff, shooting stuff, what so ever you can do with a gun...\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that enjoy is, of course, the guns. Yes, I like guns but don't give a damn about their info. If it shoots, cool, I'll take it. The first episode was fun to watch but I also disappointed as our MC is pretty much OP as hell. Its not about her gun which is the P-90, or P-chan which our MC calls it. She just got a tiny legs that she can use to run faster before you can see her.\\n\\n\r\nMy ratings seem to be kind of low to this one, but either way I give it a overall score of 9. You might get confused after I just said every flaws this show had. Those flaws doesn't bother me that makes me hate it. The scores I gave for the shows I watch wasn't labeled by its flaws or perfection but my enjoyment. If I enjoy it then expect me to give you a good score. I can't say that this show for you after I say those problems and considering the hate this series were given, but if you are the kind of person that watch a show base of his enjoyment or feelings then give this show a try.",

            "content": "Video games have been part of our everday life. Either from anime and to our real world, this type of entertainment have grown massive for years and it is still growing until now. Back in Summer 2012, the whole anime community was stunned as the first season of Sword Art Online came.\r\nWith its mixed reviews saying it was either the worst or the best series, the whole community is divided until now even a season 2 came, along with the movie Ordinal Scale. Looking back to the past recent season which was Spring 2018, we were given a ton of new shows and sequels. Alongcame a spin-off that will judge anime fans, who have watched Sword Art Online. That is the spin-off 'Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online', which I am going to review on now.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story is alternative to Sword Art Online 2, where we are first introduced to a virtual shooter game named GGO (Gun Gale Online). Alternative, meaning the characters will be different as well and the story, giving us a relief from the main problem of the original series, which are the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Karen Kohiruimaki (Llenn), who has a problem about her tall height. Her complexity have been her problems. From being jealous to cute, little girls and always knocking her head into a high platform, this has become a nuisance on her real life basis. But this complexity of hers is a good character quality. We, audience, have given a bit of a background of her issue which leads us speculating possible outcomes of her overcoming it and we audience are anticipating that. Unlike, the main character from the original Sword Art Online series, which is Kirito, we really don't know his past or characteristics in real life. We just know that he is a beta tester, concluding that he is good with the game SAO and with this we can speculate the outcomes that our main protagonist can get out of the game.\\n\\n\r\nHere on SAO Alternative, we have a clumsy main character, who found her dream into the game of Gun Gale Online, which is to be a cute little girl (a loli). Though it sounds ridiculous, it was by chance that she got the avatar she wanted all along. We have seen her going through other games and still having that enormous height of hers. We've seen her struggle because of it making her log-out automatically. She was lucky she got the character she wanted. Another thing I want to point out to the main character of Alternative is that inspiration from the character is there. And that is her favorite singer 'Elsa Kanzaki'. This gives us another information that this MC is not really strong or confident in life (due to her complexity), that is except if she has any inspiration, which is the music of her favorite singer. This applies on real life as well. Each and every one of us have inspiration either to someone, dream or things that can support our works.\\n\\n\r\nThen comes her game mechanics. On the first few episodes, I can already tell that she is easy to spot on or killed if she is not taking 'M's advices or go with him. The fact that she is so clueless to the game let us see what she can do. Is she going to be like the main character of SAO, who is so overpowered? Or is she going to be just a  nuisance to the team? The answer is right through the middle. Although we see her with her sonic-like abilities, we have to agree that without strategizing, if she goes on to a team fight, she will just get shot to death.\\n\\n\r\nThat is why 'M' as the character supporting her in the few episodes have an impact to the situation of \"overpowered characters\" on anime. Unlike other characters from other series that have over the top powers, Llenn... is just a \"The Flash\" of GGO. A pro team can single handedly deflect her speed advantage and strategizing it to lure her and get the kill. Without M's guidance or knowledge on the first Squad Jam, Llenn would have been butchered by those \"kids\". Then we have 'Pitohui', the one who give Llenn more guidance to the game and her first friend. Pitohui's role on the story as a villain is quite good as for some reason her antagonistic traits comes part only at the final episodes. Her avatar does look like an assassin or a mercenary, which is have antagonistic traits, but on their first meetings, the two were friends. Though this friendship is tested by upcoming revelations throughout the episodes. Gun Gale Online's Squad Jam showed the viewers other characters but most notable supporting ones are the SHINC, which comprises of tall and strong women on the first squad jam. Earlier I talked about Llenn being useless or can easily be killed if she is not strategizing against a pro team. The SHINC made an accurate example of it on the final battle on the first Squad Jam. Then after their defeat, revelations of their real life self stunned Karen and actually made her more confident about her complexity which backsup to the 'character development' that a protagonist should have.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with her development and confidence on herselve in real life, we are shown by her strategic development in game on the second Squad Jam. This tells that experience is far more superior than power and along with Shinohara, Miyu (Fukaziroh), the second Squad Jam highlighted the 'Pink Devil' development. It is as if on the second Squad Jam, comparing it to the first one, Fukaziroh was like Llenn (the clueless one in the first squad jam) and Llenn was M (the one who knows what to do). This characters are very notable and unique which gives the anime itself on my opinion a better version of the original series. With its opening having the same singer from the season 2's GGO arc, to the pleasant and heart-warming ending of the anime, this show is really spot-on. Not to mention the art of this anime being simple but watcheable. Who doesn't like a pink loli going up against players and beating the heck out of them? And I am not even done yet. Like in the past, Sword Art Online was a massive, hit not only to the anime community but around the world, as its timing of its genre was very on point. With the launch of Virtual Reality and it being popular to the masses, Sword Art Online was like an intake to the VR world. Giving us questions like what are the possibilities of this technology be?..\\n\\n\r\nAlternative does the same thing but not Virtual Reality but 'Battle Royale' games in a whole. For the past months, this type of games have been popular even if you only have PC, PS4, or XBOX, this type of game hits the masses. From H1Z1, Player Unknown's Battlegrounds then to Fortnite, this games have been trending for months on ever single websites on the internet. Even anime fans plays this type of games and coincidentally, Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online came out April 2018 this year which was a month where Battle Royale games like Fortnite and Player Unknown's Battlegrounds are on the top list of online games. This anime deliver the 'Battle Royale' genre into the screen perfectly from tactics, weapons, equipments, team fights, and a whole lot more. Of course there are still some differences of the Squad Jam on GGO being different to the 'Battle Royale' games on our generation for example, the scan and it being virtual reality. Although, I could say it is very close to it and that is why Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online is a very entertaining show. With its great protagonist and antagonist which have character developments and backgrounds along with the other characters supporting each other from the action scenes to inspiration, Sword Art Online Alternative is a great show to give a try on if you dislike the original series' intake of characters and plot.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "Sword Art Online or SAO for short is the most polarising\u00a0anime series of all time. It is the definition a series that you will either love or hate. Like with many people on net I have a very low option of Sword Art Online because it was a terrible series. While I don\u2019t completely despise the series anymore mainly because I have seen anime that are in my opinion worse than Sword Art Online it is still a series that I really dislike with a passion\r\nWhen I first heard about this series being announced a couple moths back after I watched the painfully subpar SwordArt Online movie I was really excited to check it out. The main reason why I really excited for this is because that they are completely removing three of the nasty SAO elements that made the franchise such a piece of shit.\\n\\n\r\nThe first nasty element of SAO which the spinoff removed was the Gary Sue preaching idiot Kirito who is by far one of the worst anime protagonists to ever exist from this medium.\\n\\n\r\nThe second nasty element of SAO which the spinoff removed is that it was going to be done by A1 Picture aka the EA of Anime. There\u2019s honestly not much to say on this part because if you have seen any almost anime from A1 Pictures you would know incompetent the studio and the staff are.\\n\\n\r\nThe final nasty element of SAO which the spinoff removed is that it was going to be written by one of the worst writers ever Rei Kawahara which was honestly the best part about that anncoument because the spinoff is actually going be done a more talented writer Keiichi Sigawa who also did the Kino\u2019s franchise.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of these nasty elements of SAO killed off in the spinoff I thought the spinoff could how a different and more appealing light to a series where many other such as myself hate. Now watching all 12 episodes of this spinoff as well the hilarious recap episode I have to say this\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a terrible SAO spinoff however on its own Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online is a pretty good anime its own right that barely functions as typical SAO product. Now with that all said hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online and with that out of the way let\u2019s begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a Tokyo university student named Karen Kohiruimaki, who's insecure about her height and an introvert. One day, she decides to join GGO on the advice of a friend in order to improve her self-esteem, using the name LLENN. Along the way, she makes friends as she plays the game with other GGO players and fight against hostile players aka PKers and monsters.\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna a lie I thought the story was pretty good for the most part.\\n\r\nRight out the gate this anime makes a great first impression by introducing our main character Karen or LLENN who is trying to adapt to her new surroundings in the Gun Gale Online where instead of being this overpowered Mary Sue she actually takes her time to understand the game as trying to find escapism from the real world thanks to her height complex. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that really loved about this anime is how it was able to present all of it\u2019s game machermise to the audience to a point where anyone can understand the game machemes as well what it has to offer to the player.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the original SAO series were all the games that were featured in that series were fundamentally broken thanks to poor world-building and poorly explained game mechanics Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online actually takes it\u2019s time to build its world in the game of Gun Gale Online where it actually propley explains the games mechanics from battle locations, weapon types, weapon attachments, battle tactics, etc. This alone really makes the world of Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online feel alive. It\u2019s not just worldbuiding though. The dialogue too is great as it prefects captures the tone of the battle royal setting where character are seen actually communicating with other and working together instead of being edgy solo players in a battle royal game.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the way the characters\u00a0 in the show interact while playing the battle royal game is great as they all feel like actually gamers who would like to work together to accomplish they goal from talking about stragicly, saving teammates from death, actually honouring squad mates deaths with respect etc. These are the type of stuff that I want to see more in a anime that has a MMORPG/ Battle Royal Setting.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I liked about SAO Alternative Gun Gale Online it how self-aware it is. VR Gaming being overall better it still has that issue where the game uses RNG to create an avatar that\u2019s she want by failing with hilarious results thanks to her height.\\n\\n\r\nAs much I want to continue praising the show with its solid writing and theme exploration I have now address some of the show issues. While the problems in Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online not series breaking issue still had a couple of issues that I couldn\u2019t ignore at all.\\n\\n\r\nIssue 1. Plot armour. I will admit the plot armour is not as a big problem here when compare to the original Sword Art Online series by Reki Kawahara there were some plot armour moments in the show that kinda upset me. For example in episode 5 after Eva shooting down P chan she literally gets angry and fight backs hand to hand combat Kirito style killing Eva in the progress. I understand that the show want\u2019s to showcase the aggressive hand to hand combat in the series but this was just a cheap and lazy to do it.\\n\\n\r\nIssue 2. Weapon damage constantly. Like with Issue 1 it wasn\u2019t really a big problem however they was a certain battle that bother me and that is\u00a0 one of Fukaziroh Grenade Launcher bullet\u2019s did not explode the target\u2019s face on impact. Grenade Launcher bullet\u2019s don\u2019t work like this. Unless she has some special type of grenade launcher that would not explode on impact where the show never tells us that she has bullets like that her shooting out the bland grenade launcher was an asspull and never explained.\\n\\n\r\nWhile issues 1 and 2 were minor problems that the issue 3 one really made me upset quite a bit of how the show even kept one of it\u2019s SAO elements from the Aincrad arc and that is if you die in the game you die in real life bullshit.\\n\r\nThe moment when M said that in episode 5 the show kinda lost me because as a person who dislikes main original series of SAO I went into to this series expecting a fun battle royal spinoff that doesn\u2019t feature any of the shitty SAO elements. Luckly that shitty SAO element only affects one to two characters and while everyone is safe from dying in real life by a video game. Speaking of episode 5 the whole episode was out of context and contrived. This was defiantly a low point from this spinoff but least it\u2019s not as bad as any arc in the original SAO series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought the story was pretty above average. It may have some issues but I don\u2019t think they were series breaking like in the original series.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters of Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online I thought they were pretty good. They may not be well written but they were all fun, interesting and entertaining characters that I liked.\\n\r\nKaren is a pretty solid protagonist overall. Unlike Kirito her reasoning to escape into video games is more justice as she doesn\u2019t like her own height in the real world so to counteract this she goes to GGO and upon surprise the game let\u2019s her be that cute small girl that she\u2019s always wanted to be. This doesn\u2019t stop there she also discovers that she is genuinely enjoys being in that game and because of that GGO becomes her escapism from the real world. This is how you write a character who wants\u2019 escapism in the real world through video games. Also unlike Kirito she actually a interesting character who develops quite a bit in the show by meeting new friends, and rivals that are in GGO.\\n\r\nThe rest of characters were pretty solid overall and while they are not excually well written characters because come on this is SAO after all but least the other characters in this show are fun, entertaining and at time interesting compare to any character in the original series.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online is pretty good overall. Yes it may have it\u2019s art failures every now and then but least this show for the most remained consistent.\\n\r\nThe characters designs are good for what they are as they look like avatars that you will see in a MMORPG games that features heavy use of guns. The background scenery for both in the game and real world is very polish and well detailed.\\n\r\nThe animation is on the other hand is well animated and unlike the original SAO series there was no instance of messy animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe may come off as unpopular opinion here but really like the soundtrack in SAO Alternative Gun Gale Online more than the original series mainly because apart from swordland, confront battle and some others tracks the soundtrack for original series were not that memorable but that just me.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online is great that is filed with techno, Sci-Fi and gaming tracks that blends well with the overall setting and scenes of the show.\\n\r\nThe opening theme Ryuusei by Aoi Eir is a fantastic and catchy opening theme that was a joy to watch.\\n\r\nThe ending \u00a0theme To see the future by the Seiyuu of Karen Tomori Kusunoki is a great ending theme despite being different in tone.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this show is top notice as you expect as every Seiyuu in the show did a great job with the roles that they were given.\\n\r\nHopefully this show will get an English Dub sometime in the future.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nI was honestly shocked of how good Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online. Yes it had quite a bit of issues alone the way but they were not constant problems that plagued the original anime to the bottom. The story while having some issues was still fun and entertaining. The characters ranged from good, entertaining to decent, the visuals were great and the soundtrack was awesome. As a person who doesn\u2019t like Sword Art Online this was a good and fun experience that showcased a bit of light from this rabbit hole of a series that people like to make fun off.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t seen anything Sword Art Online releated or if you hate the Reki Kawahara side of SAO then I recommend Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online. It may not be one of the better animes of the year but it was still a fairly good show that I liked for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 7.5/10",

            "content": "This will be my first review on MAL. What compelled me to write this reivew is not because I enjoyed SAO Gun Gale, but rather what an abhorrent disaster it is. Few of the animes I have watched in mylife time where I get to the point of throwing up just watching it. Recenlty SAO-GG & Tokyo Ghoul:re are top on that list.\r\nStory: 0/10\r\nPeople who have watched SAO series do know the basic formula how SAO series is based around MMORPGs or JRPGS games. It's much appealing to individuals who have played such games they can kind of relate to it. SAO-GG is not basedon RPG style but PUBG,COD & Battlefield style. You just go out in full-drive and just shoot people in game for the heck of it, there seems to be no real objective,no  goals or no tasks, so there is never a sense of something bigger going on. I can't even call the story a shallow one, as it doesn't have a story. Who approved it for airing warrants an invistigation in it self.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\n Characters are as shallow as they come. No character development, all of them are designed the same, no depth, as a gamer you cannot relate in the least. They give gaming a bad name. It just become so hard to watch them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\r\nThis anime is not enjoyable in the least. It will leave a bad taste in your mouth and may start to wonder how can someone make such a catostraphe. I found its humour lacking, character bad looking, music tasteless, even the game world is bad to look at. SAO Aincard world was a treat to look at, it had imagination and art, it gave a feeling if RPGs became a reality how would it look. But this SAO-GG, its just plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI was expecting an anime which would contain a story in which stakes would be high. The gameworld would be great to look at, their would be tension n suspense in the fights. Mature character which would make sound decisions and leave us baffled. But instead we got kid girly characters with not sense of tension of suspense. Plan stupid story line, Overpowered protaginist and that for no reason. Things moulded into ways to just make the work easy for the writer.It's just the very definition of a bad tv show. Don't watch it. Simple as that.",

Still don't know the plot and I hope TO GOD they're not pulling another video game anime where they venture into irl.\r\n3. No character development other than P-Chan (the gun LOL)\r\n4. Haven't seen any difference in their online persona vs. their real ones. Which really defeats the purpose of an isekai?\r\nI started out the anime same as all of you, wanting to see if they could recreate the magic from episode one, two and half of three. However they couldn't. Pulling a Kirito (not a spoiler it happens multiple times in the span of fourepisodes). She gets a \"power up.\" AN UNEXPLAINABLE ONE???\\n\\n\r\nThen she gets a gun which seeeemmmmssss to be a lot better than all the others despite being the newest player in the game and likely the least experienced. \\n\\n\r\nPK'ing never got an explanation after seven episodes. We are somehow supposed to believe a basic level based, grind it, role playing game was easy for a girl in pink clothing to kill players in the sand. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, all their explanations are full of dues ex machina. It's a crap ton of \"SIKE IM GOD MODE.\" Then we are forced fed an explanation in the span of two minutes. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, their was an opportunity for these guys to create something great but they just slap everything onto you. By the seventh episode you'll be asking yourself...\"Wait...what? Why, How? From where...\"",

What is Karen fighting for and why should we care and root for her? The premise is she play GGO because the character that she got is short and cute, and therefore she is playing GGO. However, beyond this,  I can't really find why Karen is playing this game, which leads to the character being boring and uninteresting. What does winning the tournament means to Karen, and what does she gain from it? Well... All I see is nothing. All I knowafter the first arc is that Pito might be really bad for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nThrow away all the bullshit action and how it doesn't make sense. I just want to talk about the story. Even in SAO, we know that the protagonist wants to escape the death game by winning it. In ALO, we know that the protagonist's waifu is in danger and he wants to save her. In GGO, we know that there's is a death gun in the game which the protagonist needs to fight against. In ALO2, there's a girl dying? Despite the story being mediocre, there's still a story and a conflict. In GGO alternative, except for a random tournament which leads to nothing, we can't really see the conflict and what drives the protagonist to move forward.\\n\\n\r\nIn one sentence, this anime is even \"trash-er\" than SAO season 1 and 2 despite written by another author.

Plot development doesn't really exist because the story is just way too predictable, though next to nothing happens in the first place anyway.

This is true especially given the fact that the MC is a speed-hacking, invulnerable teleporting omnipotent 4-dimensional nano-hitbox with an annoying voice. Nothing interesting happens in the game when its focus is on the MC because every event is predominantly determined by her speed hacks. This anime would tell a more interesting story if the SAO theme of it didn't exist.",

            "content": "In 2012, we are introduced to the world of Sword Art Online, where it features the most hated over-the-top OP character Kirito, the main MC along with his shenanigans of fantasy-drama with the cast of SAO, and his foundation brings him over to 2014 where we have SAO Season 2: the world of Gun Gale Online (or GGO), with an entirely new cast (but not without the original cast (since it\u2019s a cross-over)) that manages to do well but garner less attention from the original series, but in all essence, Kirito stood still: He saw, he came, and he conquered\u2026ALL, with much hate from theanime consensus.\\n\\n\r\nThis year, we have an entirely different GGO, not written by the original creator Reki Kawahara (thank goodness!), but by the author of Kino\u2019s Journey, Keiichi Sigsawa. Knowing the gun-crazy novelist, as mentioned from Pitohui: \u201cWell, he\u2019s a gun freak and a not-so-novelist but afterword writer (that takes serious pride in his work but doesn\u2019t take himself seriously and just wanna have fun). This is what you get when they are combined.\u201d And much to my amazement, SAO Alternative is a damn good and impressive series of not just its light novel adaptation, but the anime series here provided so much fun and realism that\u2019s NOT what the original SAO had with OP characters, the MMORPG or game-fantasy setting and fanservice, just plain old good shooting and characters to boot AND finally THE SAO series that is worthy to be discussing about here.\\n\\n\r\nThis story follows the main best girl (IMO) Karen \u201cLLENN\u201d Kohirumaki, not the typical kind of girl that you see on the streets, because she is insanely tall (183cm or 6 ft\u2019) and has problems coinciding with society that are the status quo. Relinquished, but not out, she sets on the task of finding the best VR game that suits her wellbeing of being shorter and chibi-fied, and none other than GGO (with her AmuSphere) is she able to take advantage of her small sized avatar of her dreams! And it is there that she finds the friendly, yet sadistic Pitohui, just the typical friend looking out for each other at first\u2026until her invitation (and pressure) to LLENN to enter in \u201cSquad Jam\u201d (which is SAO Season 2\u2019s Bullet of Bullets (BoB) team battle royale variation) faces both a challenge and a fight to the death as Pitohui\u2019s obsession with the original SAO features made her lose consciousness (or rather, becoming the 2nd Kirito) and her fight in SJ2 proves that.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with the storytelling and how director Masayuki Sakoi (one of the best from Studio 3Hz) decided to pace Sigsawa\u2019s adaptation, it is apparent that for those who entered this with no know-how of SAO Season 2: GGO will be lost (but not by much), and the pacing of the series which is fast, but progressively it slows down to give the plot more context and its true intentions here and there. Overall, it is a well-thought-out story which gives more exposition and its characters life out of the ordinary. And\u2026not to mention that recap episode where Sigsawa himself has lavished out his own parody (as he is famous for that) in Episode 5.5 where he \u2018sponsors\u2019 SJ inserts through his self-acclaimed \u201cafterword\u201d (or after-credit rolls) through silly voices and sounds into the battle footage, oh what a bliss!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here tell the exact same story from how they are made from the ground-up, and as a result, they flow much better than the SAO counterparts it came from:\\n\\n\r\nLLENN, as a character, much from her chibi avatar cuteness that cannot be mistaken as a kindred spirit in battle, she is a character that goes all-out in doing what she does best: Shooting, make and gather friends, more shooting, and a blood-bath between her and Pitohui rounds up what her activities lie in. Be warned as her real and VR life are two separate entities: the tall yet humble self vs. the crazy, all-pink character mascot that she has garnered popularity amongst Squad Jam players as one with the most potential. Engaging with LLENN felt like a journey of sorts (see the similarity?), from her alliance with Goushi Aousgi (better known as M in GGO) in the first Squad Jam to friendship with Miyu and fighting together in SJ2 against Pitohui and M and their mercenaries. Overall, LLENN is a character that can best be resembled as another Sinon, but not to that extent where it gets all technical, and with her P90 (often calls it P-chan), she can go anywhere. Overall, LLENN\u2019s character writing may not be brilliant, but it\u2019s fun to see her insane adventures and risks to be the best of the best.\\n\\n\r\nPitohui, the character that is out of form and looks hideous, first appears like the stereotypical challenger out from the ashes, but immediately her scarred or tattooed face immediately gives away the vibe that she is not the typical challenger like the many out there in SJ. Suffice to say, it\u2019s her addiction through the SAO back then that made her this way: the aggressive, careful and meticulous yet murderous intent that shaped her the way in GGO, even though the 2nd round of Squad Jam where she mercilessly slaughters enemies the EXACT way how Kirito did in GGO with the light saber. But thankfully, this is one of the few traces of the original series and doesn\u2019t go to an extent to replicate what happened, so crisis averted. Overall, Pitohui is a character you wouldn\u2019t want to mess with, because she gets her work cut out and done on the spot.\\n\\n\r\nM, the armour/guards-man, he is the typical buff character\u2026until his deal with Pito shows up his desperate face, just as many out there (but not as stressful as the original series where you die in the game, it\u2019s game over in real life). But I can tell one thing, he\u2019s as robust as a rock with his tank-like shield which repels shots to the maximum and I have to say that M makes light work of how a support character and a team member should be. The man with guts to analyze the best of the situation, I approve!\\n\r\nThe characters don\u2019t quite have much to boot and/or say, given their exposure that doesn\u2019t give much information from the start, but as the series subsequently progresses, it gives the characters much substance and their identity uncovered and recognized.\\n\\n\r\nIn the art and animation department, it is absolute proof that Studio 3Hz could take any adaptation, fill in with their own unique quirks and still make the series look as realistic as it is. Unfortunately, as much as the original series (SAO S2: GGO) has been shown, the art style may lack in some areas which A-1 Pictures have done well capturing the essence of GGO in its entirety. But what it makes up for with sacrificing art quality is with animation, and it helps that 3Hz is hands down one of the best when it comes to animation quality, and throughout the immense action, it doesn\u2019t sweat a beat, and fuses with the art style quite well, making a decent art style still look appealing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical department, is quite frankly, the high point of the series. Eir Aoi has done it again, with the 1st OP of SAO: GGO \u201cIgnite\u201d in 2014, and in comes the alternate version with \u201cRyuusei\u201d as the OP, and honestly, is lit and on fire, and immensely watchable, so much that I never escape the OP just to hear the goddess come back to reign in her high-pitched voice that truly is just satisfying to listen to. And let\u2019s not forget LLENN\u2019s VA, famous seiyuu Tomori Kusunori with her ED \u201cTo see the future\u201d, and just like the OP, is a good ED to end the series\u2019 episodes, and overall, this OST is a soundtrack that\u2019s worth having, and is my No.1 favourite this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SAO Alternative: GGO is a series that if you\u2019re coming in from SAO and reeling in from the saltiness of the series (which I don\u2019t blame you), it\u2019s hard to get adjusted of this gem of a show, albeit done by an author of jokes and a different production team, but promise me, forget the travesty you know that is SAO and stride into the Alternate: GGO that is everything except what Reki Kawahara had envisioned, with absolutely no expectations, and see how much this show will amaze you from the get-go. If you haven\u2019t watched SAO, GOOD, go watch this one, because you don\u2019t need to know GGO to enjoy this series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for myself, this is my AOTS alongside Golden Kamuy, and this has been proven by an ex-SAO fan who thinks that this was none other than exceptional, more so than the originals. A great job and well done, Studio 3Hz and the production team for providing an SAO that mirrors Sigsawa\u2019s ideals instead of Kawahara\u2019s, and is fun and enjoyable from start to finish.",

            "content": "TL;DR at the bottom\r\nWell for the people that hate Kirito he is not here so good for them, but it does not make the show better for it. Instead the show is centered around a girl with a height complex. So how tall is she you may ask is she 6'2\" maybe a even 7' feet tall? No she is 6' tall which is very big for a girl but is about 3\" bigger then the average Japaneses male. People say this show dose not have have any of the old SAO cast but the main is sinon with a height complex instead of agun complex.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nFor the most part there is not much here only plot armor and more plot armor. If SOA had one thing going for it its that the bullshit plot armor was not linked to a stat that everyone has. If agility helped soo much why would anyone build anything else. Then there is the military man who teaching the short girl to F***ing use a knife reverse grip making her reach shorter then it already was because anime looking cool does not = practical.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nArt was good nothing else to say just good\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSame as art just good no bug problems here\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nNothing much here yet, 4 episodes in but in a 12 episode show this is a bit worrying\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAverage, nether here nor there if u can get over the bullshit plot armor that no one else has even tho they may have played longer then the main character\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nThe animation, sound, and voice acting is good but there are over 100+ anime that are leagues ahead of the quality of this anime and the whole SOA Franchise, such as Darling in the FranXX and many others. So for the SOA haters that which this and praise this for not being a shit as the original you do not need to go far to get better writing then shit and this show is about a good as a fan fic set in the shitshow that is GGO, wish they went with one of the other seeds that they showed in the character creation episode they all looked better then GGO T_T. \\n\\n\r\nPS. The writer of this LN knows that being shorter does not make that stride of your legs longer right? Generally it makes you slower which is why most of the fastest runners have long legs.",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE* \r\nWhen Sword Art Online first came out, I was still an anime newbie. Ignorant to harems and perfect Gary Stu characters, I was impressed by Kirito, and just like most young kids, I thought he was great. \r\nIn hindsight, I decided I didn't like him for the same reasons I used to like him. I assumed that if he was written better, then Sword Art Online and Gun Gale Online would have been better-- but alas, even when he's not even in this show, I find myself bored to tears. \r\nAs a geek myself, I thought I would enjoy the whole Gun GaleOnline world. After all, I did develop a liking for Sinon from the second season of SAO, and I also liked the virtual reality idea, both in SAO and in virtual reality arcs in other shows like Hunter x Hunter. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this show just wasn't what I wanted. It is dull and repetitive and very predictable. Not to mention that the characters are flat and boring. I don't give a flying fuck about a single one of them-- which is rare for me, seeing as I adopt characters as my children regularly. In the first few episodes, the characters showed promise. It seemed they might actually stand a chance of being different from the stereotypes of SAO. However, they read kinda like outlines of characters rather than full-fledged characters. It's boring to watch it because the people in it are so dull. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I'm not sure where the plot is going and I'm not sure if there is a plot, really. It seems to go in a lot of different directions but it fails to keep the audience interested. The entire show is just two VERY long fight sequences. I was hoping for perhaps a Gon-Hisoka (Hunter x Hunter) style face-off-- main character is weaker than opponent at first and gets beat, and then later garners enough strength to beat the opponent through perseverance and training. However, this was just two long battles split up into about 4-5 episodes each. That's pretty much it. I was also hoping we would get a bit more of LENN/Karen's character in here since one of the main selling points was her playing games because of her insecurity. While she does grow more comfortable with her height at some point, it's not really gradual or explained. She's just suddenly okay with it after being embarrassed of it her whole life, and the subplot just ends there. \\n\\n\r\nThe songs (the opening and closing especially) are pretty mediocre, but the Elsa Kanzaki bits are pretty good in my opinion. The background music and animation is also pretty stunning, so if you're not too interested in characters and plot, this might still be a really good watch for you. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: like guns, like long fight sequences, like lolita chicks, like femdom, like sadism/masochism relationships\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: want something with plot, like having deep characters with actual personalities, don't really like shows that are just continuous action, want some more meaningful or overarching plot like the imminent death plot of SAO, want a hero/heroine that grows or changes, hate sadistic/masochistic characters/relationships \\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "content": "For years, Sword Art Online franchise told us a story about being inside a VRMMO game (or ARMMO in Ordinal Scale case) and while the setting or the world building is very good enough, they never have given us any good story or protagonist characterization (I'm looking at you, Kirito). Suddenly an adaptation of a light novel spin-off based on Sword Art Online franchise came to us and exceeded its original story it based on. Using the game setting of Sword Art Online : Phantom Bullet arc, the VRMMO game called Gun Gale Online, I will tell you why this spin-off is far more betterthan its original story.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important thing is of course, characterization. They used one important theme around building LLENN as a character and that is insecurity. It is very shown that LLENN or Karen have an insecurity about her height that is far taller than anyone else. She thought that being tall was not cute at all. Hence, she hoped that if she entered the world of VR, she could become shorter and cuter. She hopped from one game to another just to get a perfect avatar for her to fulfill her insecurity. Pitohui on the other side used game to suppress her suicidal tendency and sadistic nature just for LLENN to enter the fray and snap her out of it. For me, I have the same way of thinking as LLENN. Game is somewhere that you should have fun because sometimes reality is harsh and you just want to run from them for a while.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the original story itself has already made a good game mechanics, this spin-off really used them well and even added more things that really interesting. First, how the stats really pay off at the battles. LLENN have more AGI than most people it made her very insanely fast while Fukaziroh have more STR than most people it affected her ability to wield more weapons than anyone and of course, her power to do melee. Second, how they used the bullet line as a signaling system. Until now, bullet line just shown as a prediction line to avoid the bullets. To actually used them as an effective way of communication, it never crossed my mind until this adaptation came. They used it as a marking for party members to move stealthy or separately. And lastly, the immortal object. I think it is very smart to use dead bodies as shield as it was an immortal object that cannot be penetrated. It was a perk that is very interesting to be part of our strategy in a game about guns and bullets.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is certainly good. The songs that being sung by the voice of Kanzaki Elza have this vibe of Aimer in her voice making the songs feel deeper and better in my opinion. Of course, you should never miss the opening song. After a long time of hiatus, Eir Aoi came back and sang the opening for this anime. For me, it is fitting since she was the one who sang the first opening of SAO II and it was a great reunion for the fans of both SAO and Eir Aoi in general.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has exceeded all of my expectations and rise above its original source, Sword Art Online. With how the anime ended, I do really wish to see this anime being continued into second season if the source material or the light novel still have more story to go. It is a huge kudos for the writer of both the source material and anime.",

            "content": "The fact that the original SAO has a higher score than this is frankly appalling.\r\nLooking around reviews on here and Crunchyroll, as well as several anime discord servers, I usually see people rating this anime negatively either because it is SAO, or because it isn't SAO enough, rather than being judged on it's own (\"Alternative\") merits.\r\nI don't need to go through the flaws of the original SAO, it's already been beaten to a pulp in the anime community. What I do need to say though, is that besides the immediately noticeable decreased production value, Gun Gale Online is a clear improvement over the original SAOin almost every narrative aspect.\\n\r\nWhile the original focused more on the actions that Kirito did within the world of Sword Art Online, GGO focuses more on what outside reason each character has for playing a virtual reality game. The theme of escapism is more poignant and relevant, and is less seemingly set up for romance. The main character, LLENN, is also instantly more relatable and likable in 5 episodes than Kirito in two full anime seasons and a movie. Her motives, personality, and goals are set up very well and as a character, she is continuing to flesh out and become a big favorite of mine within the isekai genre. She feels like her own character and not a bizarre power fantasy.\\n\r\nThe fight scenes, while not as flashy or expensive as the original anime series, are instantly more compelling due to the extensive (and ridiculous) tactics that are involved and feel at home in a battle royale setting.\\n\r\nGGO's supporting cast aren't as fleshed out or feel as close to the protagonist as they could be at this point in the series, but each character feels like they belong in the setting with their own motive for playing the game and escaping into it.\\n\r\nI can only hope that the pacing kicks up and that the production doesn't fall apart, I'll be reviewing this in full again once the series concludes.",

            "content": "Story: The story takes place a few years after the release of Sword Art Online. It centers around our main heroine Karen Kohiruimaki. She enters the world of Gun Gale online to get away from the issue she has being a very tall woman. She tries many different games but each one gives her a tall default character. That is until she enters Gun Gale online and becomes the Pink Devil LLENN.\r\nI actually liked the idea of why Karen wanted to play games. Because honestly thats what we do. When we are sick of dealing with situations we don't want to deal with we turnto Anime, Video games or whatever else to distract us from our problems.\\n\\n\r\nShe then meets a fun amount of people including Pito, M, the Amazons. With this the Gun Gale story builds into something stronger.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art and animation were fantastic in my opinion. Taking out blood and replacing it with red pixels was a great. you could still sense it when someone was getting shot or cut.\\n\r\nThe main thing I liked about the animation was the First Person Point of view they went to at certain times. For instance LLENN is running in episode one but they have it so that you, the viewer, is seeing what she sees. I though that was pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Voice acting was great and i thought the BGM and music throughout the anime was really well done as well. A lot of intense parts were paired with some great music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Aww man Pito and LLENN were all you really needed in this anime. I was constantly struggling deciding who my favorite is between the two of them. (After the last episode it ended up being LLENN/Karen) The supporting cast was really fun too. M was hilarious at times and Miyu was pretty funny. I wish she was in the anime more in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I am surprised how much I enjoyed this anime. I thought it was not going ot be anything special but it turned out to be really great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I honestly found this better then the original Sword Art Online. Now I did like Gun Gale better but only slightly. I just felt like this anime had everything that Sword Art didn't. An overall better cast of characters, better story, no romantic drama garbage, and a good ending.\\n\r\nIt's nothing like Sword Art and is basically a stand alone show. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun shootem up type of anime.",

            "content": "Honestly this anime is insanely enjoyable. This review is spoiler free by the way.\r\nAfter finishing this show I went to write a review immediately because of how much I loved the ending and how it wrapped up.\r\nFirst the ending. This is the most complete, wrapped up, and satisfying endings I have seen in a while. I felt so complete after watching it. The characters ALL grew and developed and it fit so perfectly that I wouldn't have ended it another way. In the trend of seasonal, 12 episode anime; this is definitely one of the most complete anime I have seen.\r\nThe story progressed very well,from the beginning to end the motivations were clear. LLENN/Karen wanted to play a video game to kind of escape here height anxiety. Probably one of the most realistic motives I have seen for a VRMMORPG series I have read or watched. A lot of people, but not all who go online and make online friend do it because of issues/insecurities in real life as LLENN does in this story. This alone really gives the watchers a lot of reason to relate to LLENN as a character even if you aren't an internet person, people go places or do things to escape the hard parts of reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all very enjoyable LLENN is fun to watch, while some people see her as annoying, I can only disagree. M is very funny to watch especially as it gets closer to the end and seeing LLENN's reaction to some of the stuff he says. The gel of characters really adds natural sort of unforced comedy that I think is hard to come by these days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall without spoiling I don't really have much to else say but, this show is VERY enjoyable and worth the watch, the real rating of the show is probably closer to an 8 but because i enjoyed every second i gave it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad in this show is just a lot of the logical stuff though, all the characters beside the main ones of course have a lot of trouble aiming because they aren't main characters. LLENN is extremely broken and can run faster then anyone, problems with the game mechanics etc. These issues are able to be over looked easily by me due to my personal investment with the characters  and story, I don't really see the game mechanics and game logic flaws as a problem because i don't see it as a focus, but I can see how some other people might find this awfully annoying and are unable to get over it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is worth your time and thank you for reading my first review.",

Gave it a 10 because it's just pure enjoyment for me that I can overlook the small things.\r\nThe pace of the anime is slow. It leaves you really excited to watch the next one but that gets tiring fast when it's a week between episodes. Would much rather binge this then watch one at a time.\r\nComparing to the manga they have stayed mostly 1-1 so both are a good investment if you like one you will probably like the other. There are onlyminor differences between the two\\n\\n\r\nCombat is very SAO not too much tactical shooter involved but they make it interesting none the less.\\n\\n\r\nLLENN is adorable and has much more expression than her irl counter part.",

            "content": "At the time of writing this the anime has barely started, but the impression of it really has struck me as something i look forward to every week.\r\nThe main reason for this is the creator, instead of the moron who pieced together the rest of the SAO franchise: Reki Kawahara. \r\nInstead SAO Alternative: Gun gale online, was created by Keiichi Sigawa, he manages to create characters that dosn't need some gimmick to have his characters act seriously when it comes to games. Its not some type of death game, where one death means the actual death of you as a player, a much bigger priceis on the line. Your pride as a gamer. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone who plays PVP games competitively know this feeling, and strive to become the best no matter what. Even if your wins outweigh your losses, one loss has 10x the impact of a win. You have failed to prove yourself as a competent player and have lost because of it. The feeling of playing against someone who is better then you, and you not even being able to stand a chance against them, it feels so bad because someone else is better then you, it feels as if you could have won, you didn't.\\n\r\nPeople take games seriously for their own reasons, and that's something Kawehara just dosn't understand.\\n\\n\r\nWhen i watched this, and my first reaction was \"How big a thing did Player Unknowns Battlegrounds become in Japan?\" Then my friend told me battle royales have been in Japan for years & linked me to a Japanese movie with the name \"Battle Royale\" from year 2000..\\n\\n\r\nBut just following the anime further, i realized something. It has none of the limits for characters like sao because it focuses on the main cast. So i thought that made it better, but that wasn't just that. Its more competent and actually follows the rules of the game, it has actual tactics and feels real. The characters have reasons for what they are doing, and there is no real risk other then losing pride.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ever reaction of \"What??? The dude who made SAO couldn't possibly have made this\", Rushing to see who the writer of the source material was, and it made me happy and excited. it wasn't the SAO guy, but some rando called Keiichi Sigsawa, having never seen anything from him prior, but seeing he actually know what he's writing about. It still doesn't feel like someone who has much experience with games, but it really feels like he knows for some reasons for people to play games.\\n\r\nSome play games for fun, for nothing to do. But some do it to escape their real life and be someone they cannot be for one reason or another, in real life.\\n\\n\r\nIt mixes someone who just wants to be her ideal cute, but that's impossible for her in the real world. She starts trying to find an avatar that is just that, to fulfill her greatest wish, when she does she decides playing the game she found it on. (This is because of the non existent character creation these games have, its a terrible game flaw for the entire system). Every time she faced the same problem in the game as her real self, her pulse rose to the point that she got booted out of the system because it thinks she's in danger. It shows how badly her anxiety really is, when she cant face her problems in a virtual setting even.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings me into one of my favorite parts of this: The gameplay.\\n\r\nGame mechanics, exploiting, using the mechanics and knowledge from guns irl to actually do better with them, its amazing. I just love how the anime shows how flawed the game system actually is, the main character has to register multiple accounts just to get an avatar she likes, and with no seeming drawbacks, making me wonder if its a common strategy, since it looks almost like it could be. (although if it was, there'd be a lot more with smaller player characters because having a small hitbox in a shooter is ideal)\\n\r\nActual strategy, making use of that, to hide in places and use unconventional cover. \\n\r\nExplaining how the system assisted aiming is good for weapons to hit further away, or hit more accurately is good for newbies with guns, but it gives the enemy an advantage because they see where the system aim is set, and if you just turn that off and use the gun properly the enemy wont see what hit em. Things like this is what i love delving more into, and i love that the anime works with the game in its broken state, and makes excuses and explains how it works in depth.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope it keeps up the way these first episodes have gone, its super fun and actually interesting, and as someone who has some of the same problems as the main girl faces, i really like it. Its not something you see too often being discussed, and this format is perfect for it.\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone who liked the concept of GGO & would like to see a more fulfilling, less cheaty anime then sao2 was.\\n\r\nSAO Alternative: GGO is definitely the best entry into SAO to date. (And how SAO is going the route of Kirito becoming the reason Accel World is going to exist, i hate the main line of SAO even more, so it looks like it'll stay the best entry until another spinoff like this comes out.)",

            "content": "SAO Alternative GGO: A fun series that served as the opening act\r\nSAO Alternative GGO had only one function: to warm up the public for the arrival of the main dish of the franchise, Alicization, which is coming in October. And the series fulfilled.\r\nThe novel written by Keiichi Sigsawa (known for novels like Allison and its sequels \"Lillia and Treize\" and \"Meg and Seron\", which resulted in the anime Allison & Lillia) and supervised by Reki Kawahara (creator of SAO) was never ambitious nor did it seek to overshadow the original story\r\nTherefore, it was foreseeable that after the announcement of the start of Alicization for nextOctober, the GGO anime will be released before; this in order to prepare the stage. Doing it later or during would not have made sense because all the attention would be focused on the work of Kawahara and this spinoff would have passed without pain or glory.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget that the 3Hz studio, with just 5 years of foundation, is still a novel studio that seeks to position itself within a highly competitive industry; for that reason, seeking to adapt something from one of the most successful franchises in the medium, and then try to compete with their Magnum Opus would have been totally absurd.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, I'm not even going to enter the debate on whether this spinoff is better or worse than the original work. It is true that the arches of the novel adapted in the first two seasons of the anime (Aincrad, Fairy Dance, Phantom Bullet, Early and Late and Mother's Rosario) have many flaws (for something Kawahara himself is rewriting all that in the SAO Progressive saga ); however, when we enter the world of Underworld, within the arc of Alicization, everything changes and the rest of the frames, spinoff included, are reduced to mere companions.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I have to talk about Alicization I will elaborate on this point, but for now let's go back to what brought us here today. SAO Alternative GGO was a series told in good form, with an easy to follow plot, loaded with good action and combat sequences that were handled in a great way. By the way, from here Spoilers come.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, if it had stayed there it would have been a series of round action. Unfortunately, Sigsawa wanted to put the element \"someone's life in the game is in danger\" and that's where the plot (and therefore the series) showed the seams.\\n\\n\r\nSince then, there were many attempts to sell us that Pitohui was in danger of death; however, the more they explained it, the more absurd it was. So much so, that it went against the much-needed \"suspension of disbelief\", which ends up taking the spectator out of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention that trying to make us believe that the only way to help this maniac was defeating her in the game was even more bizarre. And the police? Even in the Aincrad incident, the government got involved almost from the start; which also did in the case of Death Gun, so there is no reason to believe that they would turn a blind eye on this occasion.\\n\\n\r\nEven accepting that Goushi really is a good for nothing, that he is, Karen from the beginning proved to be a competent woman, so her attitude did not make sense. It would have been more reasonable for everything to be taken for a game and to simply go with the flow. However, seeing her try to defeat Pitohui with the conviction that she was saving her life; and worse, with the fear that the maniac could die was simply surreal.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, every time this was mentioned, all the magic and atmosphere of the series was lost. It was as if all of a sudden they turned on the light while they told you a horror story. Fortunately, in the end that did not have all the relevance that was tried to give and the focus was always more towards the side of the action and the combats; Otherwise, the series would have ended very badly.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, it seemed to me a good point that the whole matter of Llenn and Pitohui's encounter in the real world was handled with humor, because it marked a change of tone that was unexpected and appropriate in equal parts. Above all, considering that the series did a terrible job hiding the true identity of Pitohui.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the fact that the letter that Karen sent to Elsa was used as a main part of the outcome served very well so that point would not remain as a loose end.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical section, 3Hz studio did a competent job in character design, direction and animation. Of the three, I highlight the last because the combat sequences were very well worked; and let's not forget that they are the heart of an action anime.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the soundtrack, I'll say that Kajiura-sensei's absence is quite noticeable, but Starving Trancer made a great effort to show us themes that accompanied what happened on screen without clashing. Of course, within this section I have to highlight the opening \"Ryuusei\", played by Eir Aoi, which came as a glove to this anime. It was a nice touch to choose Eir as a gesture to connect with the main series.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a very moving series, with excellent combat sequences and a simple, but well-armored plot, which fully fulfilled its role of heating engines for the arrival of the crown jewel, Alicization. It is true, that its attempt to sell us that Pitohui was in danger of death and could only be saved by beating her in the game was a joke; But at the end of the day, SAO Alternative GGO was not a dramatic series, but an action anime, so do not give it too many laps.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nA series of well-armed action that only got messed up when it wanted to get into the drama.\\n\\n",

And also, none of that Asuna-Kirito and what not BS. This here is FANSERVICE lol.\r\nBasically, I think that the original SAO is absolutely terrible compared to this.\r\nAlso if you have an interest in guns like me you might like it even more.\r\nOkay! The story.. (no spoilers). For me personally it doesn't look likea clich\u00e9. It's basically about this girl that has a pretty standard life and doesn't feel too comfortable this way. So she heard about VR games on TV and the story picks up from there. Maybe it's just me who hasn't watched enough Anime though who knows?\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks phenomenal and I think Studio 3Hz has done a great job. I think it looks better than the \"original\" one.\\n\\n\r\nSounds are fine as well but the gun sounds are not really the best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoy this show a lot and I can never wait for the next episode.\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier the main point is not the isekai but the characters' lives (or at least for me), but I am also not saying that if you like isekai you're not going to enjoy this. Go for it.\\n\r\nI don't love this show but I like it a lot!\\n\r\nLet's hope the show takes it's turns to the best!",

            "content": "As someone who aspires to work in the video games industry, I find Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online incredibly fascinating. Unlike most virtual reality stories, GGO actually explores video games in interesting ways beyond just a flashy action spectacle. And yes, it has the spectacle as well. \r\nGGO is far different, and better than the rest of the Sword Art Online franchise; for starters, you don\u2019t even need to watch the originals to watch this spinoff. There are no related characters, no Kirito. The only similarity they share is the world they take place in. The original SAO is mentioned a few timesand surprisingly the new series writer frequently criticises the old one. GGO focuses on the in-depth details of its game world and the friendships between the cast, rather than the melodrama and cheesy romance of the original. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in 2026, GGO follows Karen a college student with a height complex, namely she\u2019s way taller than she\u2019d like to be. Walking into signs, gawked at by passersby, low self-confidence, and constantly comparing herself to the group of cute short girls she sees every day. When she discovers VR games like SAO, she\u2019s hesitant because of the controversy over people being trapped in the game is still discussed on the news. But she is willing to try them if it means she\u2019d get the chance to be shorter. The character creator system being randomized is the only outright bad game design decision in GGO, but that\u2019s just how the original series wrote it. This minor issue can be excused because it eventually leads Karen to Gun Gale Online, a gritty first-person shooter where she\u2019s able to be her ideal short height. The lead character has a pretty good motivation to play the game makes the show all the more compelling, it\u2019s perhaps a simple reason but much more than we were ever given for Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nSimplistic characterization is all GGO really needs because it\u2019s main focus is on the intense firefights. The first episode serves to thoroughly explain the mechanics of the game so that the rest of the series can play with the established rules. For what is essentially an exposition episode, the information is presented by showing rather than just telling in the Battle Royale style game mode called Squad Jam. While the visuals are simply above average, the action is surprisingly engaging with the strategizing and tactics explained through banter between the protagonist, plucky pink camouflaged Karen, but with the in-game name LLENN and her partner M. Their group\u2019s dynamic is clear from the start, LLENN is the one who has to run into the fight as a decoy and draw away the attention of enemies while M takes a vantage point to snipe them while they\u2019re distracted. Their personalities perfectly fitted to their roles in the fight; LLENN is anxious with plenty of funny reaction faces, sporadically running into the battlefield. While M is patient and unwavering, coldly issuing orders with the goal of winning regardless of the danger it puts his partner in. \\n\\n\r\nPlayed out like a game of chess, careful planning and positioning are invaluable. Seeing the strategies LLENN and others use to lead them to success is incredibly satisfying; they're not professionals so there's always a chance they will run into mistakes now and then, and their flaws are part of each character. For LLENN and M, we're given enough details to know their relationship is based in needing one another to execute their strategy, the bait and switch, but beyond that, they\u2019re two incompatible pieces. Through seeing them fight and their banter we learn the mechanics of the game; an intermittent scan reveals every challenger\u2019s location, the red lasers indicating bullet trajectory, dead players can be used as human shields, health and bullet count are detailed and are at consistent values throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe writer\u2019s knowledge of the inner workings of a complex video game is what makes GGO so believable. Look no further than the tense action scenes, despite being acknowledged as just a game they still have stakes. The original SAO had poorly explained rules to its game, so instead it chose to contrive tension by trapping the players in the game world and punishing anyone who died in-game with death in reality. But there is no such lazy writing here. In the original SAO no one of importance ever died because they\u2019d be gone for good, but in GGO there is no such plot armor. They\u2019re in a fight to the death after all so it's inevitable most characters will die or be gravely wounded. \\n\r\nGGO is tense to watch in the same way watching a professional streamer is, you\u2019re rooting for them not just because they're an enjoyable host but because you want to see them overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds they face. \\n\\n\r\nThe action spectacle itself is well done too, it\u2019s clear that Studio 3Hz was having a lot of fun making this. There\u2019s no shortage of slow-mo climactic moments in firefights with bullets flying past players like The Matrix. A few thrilling vehicle fights happen as well. There\u2019s even a lightsaber later on in the series used to devastating effect unlike anything else seen in the show. Considering combat is the main focus of the series, it\u2019s great that GGO is always able to keep it refreshing. Guns are rendered with excellent detail, CGI is frequently used quite well to allow the camera to move freely and to ensure action scenes are fast-paced and flow well. Character animation is fluid when it counts with close-ups and slow-motion used to raise the tension in close encounters. \\n\\n\r\nPlenty of long shots of the battlefield are shown so you can keep track of the proximity of players and can follow the action as well as the protagonist does. What creates the most thrills is the visceral audiovisual feedback of the gunshots. Environments that are shot are visibly blasted, with loud shots suited to the wide variety of gun types used, and the effects on players who are shot. Violence is styled to the video game with red pixels that spurt out from wounds like blood. One might think a video game would limit the possibilities of the violence, but GGO has its fair share of decapitations and limbs being lopped off in combat. Battles gradually escalate in intensity throughout the show, the game mechanics established from the start remain consistent and they're experimented with to exciting effect. Eri Aoi\u2019s opening song \u201cRyusei\u201d is well suited to the battle-oriented series along with a striking showcase of the cast. The soundtrack is equally stellar. Whether it be the hard rock or the frantic techno pieces, all of the background music serves to electrify action scenes. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the action, there is enough intrigue in GGO\u2019s characters writing for it to provide a thoughtful discussion on video games. With the writer of Kino\u2019s Journey, Keiichi Sigsawa, there\u2019s depth to the characters in spite of the series\u2019 focus on gunplay. Escapism is a theme intrinsic to any video game story, thankfully Sigsawa understands this and weaves it into every character. Karen enters the game to become a shorter, more ideal version of herself, her skill in game grants her confidence in real life to overcome her complex. The first friend she meets, Pitohui plays the game to escape stress and relieve her anger, a portrayal leaning more on the negative end of escapism which leads her to become the antagonist of the second half. The show tries to sell her as a crazed SAO fanatic, but at first it doesn\u2019t seem believable enough because we merely hear about her insanity from M. Once we see the brutal ways she kills her foes in her Squad Jam against LLENN, it becomes much easier to believe she\u2019s out of touch with reality. \\n\\n\r\nPitohui\u2019s rather serious subject matter unexpectedly fits with the show\u2019s more wryly comedic tone because of her outlandish personality and character design. From the cross tattoos on her face to scare off creeps online, to the absurd levels of frivolity she treats her enemies in combat, she\u2019s one of the most entertaining rivals of the season. In the latter half of the show when Karen\u2019s friend Fuka joins her for the Squad Jam, much of the in-depth tactics are thrown out the window by her lack of care for the game which brings about the campiest and wild action sequences the show provides. Perhaps they\u2019re not as intelligently planned out, but they make up for it with entertainment value and homages to classic action movies and moment to moment humor in the midst of chaos. All of their seiyuu do a great job of selling their overdone personalities in the game world while toning it down to a believable level in reality. \\n\\n\r\nShown in a more positive light is the gymnastics team, fans of LLENN, that play Squad Jams to communicate better with one another. In between the Squad Jams, the show revisits the real world to catch up with the cast and mainly to discuss the next game and future Squad Jams. These scenes are a good reprieve from Gun Gale\u2019s battlefields. Serving to even out the pacing and introduce characters. The gymnastics team is just a bunch of kids who walk by Karen in real life and wish to be as tall as her (a sort of role reversal) and after fighting one another in the first Squad Jam they enter the second as allies. They\u2019re admittedly a bit one note, but I wouldn't call them cliched or stereotypical. They all have an attribute in their game avatar and how they behave in-game which is reflected in their real-world counterpart. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series, there\u2019s a noticeable change in all of the characters that is directly connected to the ways the game affected them. The ending provided a satisfying final stance on the bigger themes of positive versus negative escapism, as well as a completion to LLENN's arc that's as monumental and satisfying as the show had foreshadowed it to be. The final episode is one of the funniest, most shockingly great endings of the season that rewards you for following along with the minor story details and provides the best tongue-in-cheek comedy of the series.\\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\n[Story: 7/10] In-depth game world, sparse plot.\\n\r\n[Art: 7/10] Modest budget, dynamic action scenes. \\n\r\n[Sound: 8/10] Great music and enjoyable seiyuus. \\n\r\n[Character: 7/10] Simplistic, but they each offer intrigue.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 9/10] Thrilling fights, plenty of variation, fun and likable cast. \\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 7.6/10]\\n\r\nSword Art Online Alternative is the most entertaining entry in the franchise, it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously while also providing enough depth to be compelling. What it lacks in narrative high points it more than makes up for with a well-written game world that remains consistent with its logic throughout the show. Upon first glance, the cast seems paper thin, but with time it becomes clear how much care went into interweaving their arcs with interesting video game related themes.",

            "content": "6 years ago when Sword Art Online first aired, that piece of work caused controversy that still generates discussion to this very day. Then Summer 2014 came and we got the sequel known as Sword Art Online II. While being an improvement of the original series, it didn\u2019t really amplify itself as a big improvement. Four years later, here we are again. Except this time, it\u2019s not an actual continuation of the main series. Instead, we got this spinoff known as Sword Art Online: Alternative Online.\r\nTo be clear, you don\u2019t need to watch any of the previous series in the franchise. In fact, it doesn\u2019teven matter if it\u2019s the first time you found out this show exists. SAO: Alternative Online is the title as it suggests, an alternative story that takes place based on the SAO franchise. The original light novel is written by Keiichi Sigsawa rather than Reki Kawhara although he does provide supervision for the series. It takes place in a shared universe in the virtual world known as Gun Gale Online. The story deals with a university student named Karen Kohiruimaki who decided to join GGO under the alias \u201cLLENN\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019ll be frank. I\u2019m actually a bit of a fan of the Sword Art Online video games. I\u2019ve played Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization and more recently, Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet. The games actually contains a fair amount of enticing gameplay. After clocking a decent amount of hours in Fatal Bullet, I came to realize that Alternative Gun Gale Online isn\u2019t so much different than the game itself. My impression of the first few episodes felt like the anime dropped me inside a video game. We have the main character LLEEN as she enters the Gun Gale Online world. She\u2019s rather petite with a short height. In the real world, Karen is actually tall and has a height complex. As such, she takes on her chibi form in the virtual world to build her own self-esteem. There\u2019s quite a bit difference in their personalities between her real life and virtual character that they almost seem like two different people. However, the anime spends a majority of the time on her in-game avatar.\\n\\n\r\nThe show set some red flags at first because of this premise. First of all, how are we supposed to take a character like LLEEN seriously when she looks like a kid dressed in pink and a rabbit-looking hat? The first few episodes chronicles her life in the GGO world as we learn about her role. It also drops a fair amount of exposition about the mechanics of the game she participates in. Similar ro the SAO II, this series mainly involves firearms. This is also similar in comparison to the Fatal Bullet game as we see a variety of weaponry. LLEEN\u2019s choice of weapon is a pink P90 submachine-gun she nicknamed \u201cP-chan\u201d. It matches her style because of her speed and agility. In the meantime, the episode also introduces both allies and rivals as LLEEN spends more time in the GGO world. These include characters such a Pitohui, M, and Fuzarioh. Along the way, it\u2019s easy to see LLEEN\u2019s confidence develop as a player compared to her real life persona. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t really say the main cast of the series are memorable characters. LLENN is probably the only character that\u2019s worth investing time into despite being having a childish personality. This is a bit contrast to Pito, who seems to have some psychological issues especially when she\u2019s on the battlefield. M is a character that may feel like a comic relief after you realize his real personality. Finally, Fuka is LLEEN\u2019s partner and best friend with a big obsession with VR games. While there\u2019s definitely character chemistry between the main cast members, there\u2019s not much development at all involving them. It\u2019s a shame since the show could have really took the opportunity to make them into larger than life characters. Instead, they are just participants in the game for their roles. In real life, their characters are too average to be marketable and doesn\u2019t really sell their personalities in any appealing way. All other characters in the series are easily forgettable and in fact a disgrace to the game itself, especially the perverted men. I think at one point, LLENN even asked \u201cDo only lechers play this game?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nBy this point, you may be asking yourself if this show is worth watching. Honestly, it\u2019s not a hard question to answer but be prepared for a typical sci-fi/shounen story. The series feels like it\u2019s mainly aimed for gamers and fans of the franchise. If you\u2019re not a fan of this type of genre, then you may not get the best experience from this. Even after I played the games, I felt like show could of done more to develop the plot. Every episode that takes place in the GGO world feels the same with the battle royale-esque vibe and exposition. I do admit that the battles themselves can be quite exciting at times but once you\u2019ve seen a lot of it, the hype dies quickly. The cheesy words used in dialogues borders to creep factor at times while the comedy remains generally lighthearted throughout the show. On the other hand, the real life portrayal of characters in later episodes steps it up to the plate. Some segments are genuinely heartwarming to watch and a few are rather important to establish character roles. It blurs the line between fiction and reality like the way it should be.\\n\\n\r\nThis is 3Hz\u2019s first attempt at adapting a light novel series. Previously, they worked on original projects and a manga adaptation back in 2016. To me, they did a fair job although not an overly impressive one. I should say that praise should be given for the battle choreography as it feels like how a video game is portrayed. It has a similar style of the Fatal Bullet game including the death scenes. Camera angles, body movements, and character expressions are also well decorated to bring out memorable moments. Even the comedic factors sells well with the clever timings. There\u2019s also a variety of weapons that are accurately portrayed from the light novel and games such as the P90, M107A1 (anti-material rifle), KTR-09 (Assault Rifle), photon energy sword, and among others. It does fell flat in the monster gallery though as the show focuses much more on conflict between the players. Unfortunately, I have to admit the overall world setting really doesn\u2019t set the bar high for a virtual game. Every battleground environment looks the same that after you\u2019ve seen it once, it feels like you\u2019ve seen it all. The barren landscapes may looks suitable for the show but it\u2019s extremely tedious and lacks creativity. There\u2019s not even any diverse maps this season.\\n\\n\r\nOn the contrary, I will say the anime\u2019s soundtrack lived up expectations and perhaps gone a bit beyond. The battle OST creates an exciting mood as we see players fight for their lives. Character voices may sound a bit generic but I confess that they work wonderfully for their personalities. The theme songs brings back the familiar mood of the previous SAO series if you\u2019re a fan of those. In essence, it really works.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online: Alternative Online felt more like playing a video game than a watching an anime. After finishing this series, it felt like the creator wanted us to experience what\u2019s like being part of the GGO world. As I mentioned before, this anime seems to adhere to fans of the franchise and video game players. The sensation of battle royale games has been a phenomenon in the most recent years. It took the world by storm and may remain that way for awhile. For a show like this though, there\u2019s still room for improvement.",

            "content": "I've never touch this series before but after watching this show aswell reading what other people thinks about this show, it gave me an idea just a bit about the plot. But either way, I haven't seen any plot development. What I was trying to say is, the story is still shallow, empty. I wasn't mad about that, but considering this is a 12-episode adaptation, 4 episode with no development for the story was kind of a risky move.\r\nArt Style, well, the only thing that I like the most is the guns but that aswell wasn't unique. Nonetheless, I got no problem with the ArtStyle,Animation and anything related with it.\\n\\n\r\nSounds/Music was also had no difference. They are the same for those show that using gun sounds. But the Opening was pretty good if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are also facing the same problem similar to the plot. Both lack something. I feel the characthers are still shallow, empty. Due to the fact I still got the same information about the characthers. They are just playing a virtual game to escape reality. Farming stuff, shooting stuff, what so ever you can do with a gun...\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that enjoy is, of course, the guns. Yes, I like guns but don't give a damn about their info. If it shoots, cool, I'll take it. The first episode was fun to watch but I also disappointed as our MC is pretty much OP as hell. Its not about her gun which is the P-90, or P-chan which our MC calls it. She just got a tiny legs that she can use to run faster before you can see her.\\n\\n\r\nMy ratings seem to be kind of low to this one, but either way I give it a overall score of 9. You might get confused after I just said every flaws this show had. Those flaws doesn't bother me that makes me hate it. The scores I gave for the shows I watch wasn't labeled by its flaws or perfection but my enjoyment. If I enjoy it then expect me to give you a good score. I can't say that this show for you after I say those problems and considering the hate this series were given, but if you are the kind of person that watch a show base of his enjoyment or feelings then give this show a try.",

            "content": "Video games have been part of our everday life. Either from anime and to our real world, this type of entertainment have grown massive for years and it is still growing until now. Back in Summer 2012, the whole anime community was stunned as the first season of Sword Art Online came.\r\nWith its mixed reviews saying it was either the worst or the best series, the whole community is divided until now even a season 2 came, along with the movie Ordinal Scale. Looking back to the past recent season which was Spring 2018, we were given a ton of new shows and sequels. Alongcame a spin-off that will judge anime fans, who have watched Sword Art Online. That is the spin-off 'Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online', which I am going to review on now.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story is alternative to Sword Art Online 2, where we are first introduced to a virtual shooter game named GGO (Gun Gale Online). Alternative, meaning the characters will be different as well and the story, giving us a relief from the main problem of the original series, which are the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Karen Kohiruimaki (Llenn), who has a problem about her tall height. Her complexity have been her problems. From being jealous to cute, little girls and always knocking her head into a high platform, this has become a nuisance on her real life basis. But this complexity of hers is a good character quality. We, audience, have given a bit of a background of her issue which leads us speculating possible outcomes of her overcoming it and we audience are anticipating that. Unlike, the main character from the original Sword Art Online series, which is Kirito, we really don't know his past or characteristics in real life. We just know that he is a beta tester, concluding that he is good with the game SAO and with this we can speculate the outcomes that our main protagonist can get out of the game.\\n\\n\r\nHere on SAO Alternative, we have a clumsy main character, who found her dream into the game of Gun Gale Online, which is to be a cute little girl (a loli). Though it sounds ridiculous, it was by chance that she got the avatar she wanted all along. We have seen her going through other games and still having that enormous height of hers. We've seen her struggle because of it making her log-out automatically. She was lucky she got the character she wanted. Another thing I want to point out to the main character of Alternative is that inspiration from the character is there. And that is her favorite singer 'Elsa Kanzaki'. This gives us another information that this MC is not really strong or confident in life (due to her complexity), that is except if she has any inspiration, which is the music of her favorite singer. This applies on real life as well. Each and every one of us have inspiration either to someone, dream or things that can support our works.\\n\\n\r\nThen comes her game mechanics. On the first few episodes, I can already tell that she is easy to spot on or killed if she is not taking 'M's advices or go with him. The fact that she is so clueless to the game let us see what she can do. Is she going to be like the main character of SAO, who is so overpowered? Or is she going to be just a  nuisance to the team? The answer is right through the middle. Although we see her with her sonic-like abilities, we have to agree that without strategizing, if she goes on to a team fight, she will just get shot to death.\\n\\n\r\nThat is why 'M' as the character supporting her in the few episodes have an impact to the situation of \"overpowered characters\" on anime. Unlike other characters from other series that have over the top powers, Llenn... is just a \"The Flash\" of GGO. A pro team can single handedly deflect her speed advantage and strategizing it to lure her and get the kill. Without M's guidance or knowledge on the first Squad Jam, Llenn would have been butchered by those \"kids\". Then we have 'Pitohui', the one who give Llenn more guidance to the game and her first friend. Pitohui's role on the story as a villain is quite good as for some reason her antagonistic traits comes part only at the final episodes. Her avatar does look like an assassin or a mercenary, which is have antagonistic traits, but on their first meetings, the two were friends. Though this friendship is tested by upcoming revelations throughout the episodes. Gun Gale Online's Squad Jam showed the viewers other characters but most notable supporting ones are the SHINC, which comprises of tall and strong women on the first squad jam. Earlier I talked about Llenn being useless or can easily be killed if she is not strategizing against a pro team. The SHINC made an accurate example of it on the final battle on the first Squad Jam. Then after their defeat, revelations of their real life self stunned Karen and actually made her more confident about her complexity which backsup to the 'character development' that a protagonist should have.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with her development and confidence on herselve in real life, we are shown by her strategic development in game on the second Squad Jam. This tells that experience is far more superior than power and along with Shinohara, Miyu (Fukaziroh), the second Squad Jam highlighted the 'Pink Devil' development. It is as if on the second Squad Jam, comparing it to the first one, Fukaziroh was like Llenn (the clueless one in the first squad jam) and Llenn was M (the one who knows what to do). This characters are very notable and unique which gives the anime itself on my opinion a better version of the original series. With its opening having the same singer from the season 2's GGO arc, to the pleasant and heart-warming ending of the anime, this show is really spot-on. Not to mention the art of this anime being simple but watcheable. Who doesn't like a pink loli going up against players and beating the heck out of them? And I am not even done yet. Like in the past, Sword Art Online was a massive, hit not only to the anime community but around the world, as its timing of its genre was very on point. With the launch of Virtual Reality and it being popular to the masses, Sword Art Online was like an intake to the VR world. Giving us questions like what are the possibilities of this technology be?..\\n\\n\r\nAlternative does the same thing but not Virtual Reality but 'Battle Royale' games in a whole. For the past months, this type of games have been popular even if you only have PC, PS4, or XBOX, this type of game hits the masses. From H1Z1, Player Unknown's Battlegrounds then to Fortnite, this games have been trending for months on ever single websites on the internet. Even anime fans plays this type of games and coincidentally, Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online came out April 2018 this year which was a month where Battle Royale games like Fortnite and Player Unknown's Battlegrounds are on the top list of online games. This anime deliver the 'Battle Royale' genre into the screen perfectly from tactics, weapons, equipments, team fights, and a whole lot more. Of course there are still some differences of the Squad Jam on GGO being different to the 'Battle Royale' games on our generation for example, the scan and it being virtual reality. Although, I could say it is very close to it and that is why Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online is a very entertaining show. With its great protagonist and antagonist which have character developments and backgrounds along with the other characters supporting each other from the action scenes to inspiration, Sword Art Online Alternative is a great show to give a try on if you dislike the original series' intake of characters and plot.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "Sword Art Online or SAO for short is the most polarising\u00a0anime series of all time. It is the definition a series that you will either love or hate. Like with many people on net I have a very low option of Sword Art Online because it was a terrible series. While I don\u2019t completely despise the series anymore mainly because I have seen anime that are in my opinion worse than Sword Art Online it is still a series that I really dislike with a passion\r\nWhen I first heard about this series being announced a couple moths back after I watched the painfully subpar SwordArt Online movie I was really excited to check it out. The main reason why I really excited for this is because that they are completely removing three of the nasty SAO elements that made the franchise such a piece of shit.\\n\\n\r\nThe first nasty element of SAO which the spinoff removed was the Gary Sue preaching idiot Kirito who is by far one of the worst anime protagonists to ever exist from this medium.\\n\\n\r\nThe second nasty element of SAO which the spinoff removed is that it was going to be done by A1 Picture aka the EA of Anime. There\u2019s honestly not much to say on this part because if you have seen any almost anime from A1 Pictures you would know incompetent the studio and the staff are.\\n\\n\r\nThe final nasty element of SAO which the spinoff removed is that it was going to be written by one of the worst writers ever Rei Kawahara which was honestly the best part about that anncoument because the spinoff is actually going be done a more talented writer Keiichi Sigawa who also did the Kino\u2019s franchise.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of these nasty elements of SAO killed off in the spinoff I thought the spinoff could how a different and more appealing light to a series where many other such as myself hate. Now watching all 12 episodes of this spinoff as well the hilarious recap episode I have to say this\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a terrible SAO spinoff however on its own Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online is a pretty good anime its own right that barely functions as typical SAO product. Now with that all said hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online and with that out of the way let\u2019s begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a Tokyo university student named Karen Kohiruimaki, who's insecure about her height and an introvert. One day, she decides to join GGO on the advice of a friend in order to improve her self-esteem, using the name LLENN. Along the way, she makes friends as she plays the game with other GGO players and fight against hostile players aka PKers and monsters.\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna a lie I thought the story was pretty good for the most part.\\n\r\nRight out the gate this anime makes a great first impression by introducing our main character Karen or LLENN who is trying to adapt to her new surroundings in the Gun Gale Online where instead of being this overpowered Mary Sue she actually takes her time to understand the game as trying to find escapism from the real world thanks to her height complex. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that really loved about this anime is how it was able to present all of it\u2019s game machermise to the audience to a point where anyone can understand the game machemes as well what it has to offer to the player.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the original SAO series were all the games that were featured in that series were fundamentally broken thanks to poor world-building and poorly explained game mechanics Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online actually takes it\u2019s time to build its world in the game of Gun Gale Online where it actually propley explains the games mechanics from battle locations, weapon types, weapon attachments, battle tactics, etc. This alone really makes the world of Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online feel alive. It\u2019s not just worldbuiding though. The dialogue too is great as it prefects captures the tone of the battle royal setting where character are seen actually communicating with other and working together instead of being edgy solo players in a battle royal game.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the way the characters\u00a0 in the show interact while playing the battle royal game is great as they all feel like actually gamers who would like to work together to accomplish they goal from talking about stragicly, saving teammates from death, actually honouring squad mates deaths with respect etc. These are the type of stuff that I want to see more in a anime that has a MMORPG/ Battle Royal Setting.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I liked about SAO Alternative Gun Gale Online it how self-aware it is. VR Gaming being overall better it still has that issue where the game uses RNG to create an avatar that\u2019s she want by failing with hilarious results thanks to her height.\\n\\n\r\nAs much I want to continue praising the show with its solid writing and theme exploration I have now address some of the show issues. While the problems in Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online not series breaking issue still had a couple of issues that I couldn\u2019t ignore at all.\\n\\n\r\nIssue 1. Plot armour. I will admit the plot armour is not as a big problem here when compare to the original Sword Art Online series by Reki Kawahara there were some plot armour moments in the show that kinda upset me. For example in episode 5 after Eva shooting down P chan she literally gets angry and fight backs hand to hand combat Kirito style killing Eva in the progress. I understand that the show want\u2019s to showcase the aggressive hand to hand combat in the series but this was just a cheap and lazy to do it.\\n\\n\r\nIssue 2. Weapon damage constantly. Like with Issue 1 it wasn\u2019t really a big problem however they was a certain battle that bother me and that is\u00a0 one of Fukaziroh Grenade Launcher bullet\u2019s did not explode the target\u2019s face on impact. Grenade Launcher bullet\u2019s don\u2019t work like this. Unless she has some special type of grenade launcher that would not explode on impact where the show never tells us that she has bullets like that her shooting out the bland grenade launcher was an asspull and never explained.\\n\\n\r\nWhile issues 1 and 2 were minor problems that the issue 3 one really made me upset quite a bit of how the show even kept one of it\u2019s SAO elements from the Aincrad arc and that is if you die in the game you die in real life bullshit.\\n\r\nThe moment when M said that in episode 5 the show kinda lost me because as a person who dislikes main original series of SAO I went into to this series expecting a fun battle royal spinoff that doesn\u2019t feature any of the shitty SAO elements. Luckly that shitty SAO element only affects one to two characters and while everyone is safe from dying in real life by a video game. Speaking of episode 5 the whole episode was out of context and contrived. This was defiantly a low point from this spinoff but least it\u2019s not as bad as any arc in the original SAO series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought the story was pretty above average. It may have some issues but I don\u2019t think they were series breaking like in the original series.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters of Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online I thought they were pretty good. They may not be well written but they were all fun, interesting and entertaining characters that I liked.\\n\r\nKaren is a pretty solid protagonist overall. Unlike Kirito her reasoning to escape into video games is more justice as she doesn\u2019t like her own height in the real world so to counteract this she goes to GGO and upon surprise the game let\u2019s her be that cute small girl that she\u2019s always wanted to be. This doesn\u2019t stop there she also discovers that she is genuinely enjoys being in that game and because of that GGO becomes her escapism from the real world. This is how you write a character who wants\u2019 escapism in the real world through video games. Also unlike Kirito she actually a interesting character who develops quite a bit in the show by meeting new friends, and rivals that are in GGO.\\n\r\nThe rest of characters were pretty solid overall and while they are not excually well written characters because come on this is SAO after all but least the other characters in this show are fun, entertaining and at time interesting compare to any character in the original series.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online is pretty good overall. Yes it may have it\u2019s art failures every now and then but least this show for the most remained consistent.\\n\r\nThe characters designs are good for what they are as they look like avatars that you will see in a MMORPG games that features heavy use of guns. The background scenery for both in the game and real world is very polish and well detailed.\\n\r\nThe animation is on the other hand is well animated and unlike the original SAO series there was no instance of messy animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe may come off as unpopular opinion here but really like the soundtrack in SAO Alternative Gun Gale Online more than the original series mainly because apart from swordland, confront battle and some others tracks the soundtrack for original series were not that memorable but that just me.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online is great that is filed with techno, Sci-Fi and gaming tracks that blends well with the overall setting and scenes of the show.\\n\r\nThe opening theme Ryuusei by Aoi Eir is a fantastic and catchy opening theme that was a joy to watch.\\n\r\nThe ending \u00a0theme To see the future by the Seiyuu of Karen Tomori Kusunoki is a great ending theme despite being different in tone.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this show is top notice as you expect as every Seiyuu in the show did a great job with the roles that they were given.\\n\r\nHopefully this show will get an English Dub sometime in the future.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nI was honestly shocked of how good Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online. Yes it had quite a bit of issues alone the way but they were not constant problems that plagued the original anime to the bottom. The story while having some issues was still fun and entertaining. The characters ranged from good, entertaining to decent, the visuals were great and the soundtrack was awesome. As a person who doesn\u2019t like Sword Art Online this was a good and fun experience that showcased a bit of light from this rabbit hole of a series that people like to make fun off.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t seen anything Sword Art Online releated or if you hate the Reki Kawahara side of SAO then I recommend Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online. It may not be one of the better animes of the year but it was still a fairly good show that I liked for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 7.5/10",

            "content": "This will be my first review on MAL. What compelled me to write this reivew is not because I enjoyed SAO Gun Gale, but rather what an abhorrent disaster it is. Few of the animes I have watched in mylife time where I get to the point of throwing up just watching it. Recenlty SAO-GG & Tokyo Ghoul:re are top on that list.\r\nStory: 0/10\r\nPeople who have watched SAO series do know the basic formula how SAO series is based around MMORPGs or JRPGS games. It's much appealing to individuals who have played such games they can kind of relate to it. SAO-GG is not basedon RPG style but PUBG,COD & Battlefield style. You just go out in full-drive and just shoot people in game for the heck of it, there seems to be no real objective,no  goals or no tasks, so there is never a sense of something bigger going on. I can't even call the story a shallow one, as it doesn't have a story. Who approved it for airing warrants an invistigation in it self.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\n Characters are as shallow as they come. No character development, all of them are designed the same, no depth, as a gamer you cannot relate in the least. They give gaming a bad name. It just become so hard to watch them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\r\nThis anime is not enjoyable in the least. It will leave a bad taste in your mouth and may start to wonder how can someone make such a catostraphe. I found its humour lacking, character bad looking, music tasteless, even the game world is bad to look at. SAO Aincard world was a treat to look at, it had imagination and art, it gave a feeling if RPGs became a reality how would it look. But this SAO-GG, its just plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI was expecting an anime which would contain a story in which stakes would be high. The gameworld would be great to look at, their would be tension n suspense in the fights. Mature character which would make sound decisions and leave us baffled. But instead we got kid girly characters with not sense of tension of suspense. Plan stupid story line, Overpowered protaginist and that for no reason. Things moulded into ways to just make the work easy for the writer.It's just the very definition of a bad tv show. Don't watch it. Simple as that.",

            "content": "After seven episodes I am...\r\n1. Not attached to any characters.\r\n2. Still don't know the plot and I hope TO GOD they're not pulling another video game anime where they venture into irl.\r\n3. No character development other than P-Chan (the gun LOL)\r\n4. Haven't seen any difference in their online persona vs. their real ones. Which really defeats the purpose of an isekai?\r\nI started out the anime same as all of you, wanting to see if they could recreate the magic from episode one, two and half of three. However they couldn't. Pulling a Kirito (not a spoiler it happens multiple times in the span of fourepisodes). She gets a \"power up.\" AN UNEXPLAINABLE ONE???\\n\\n\r\nThen she gets a gun which seeeemmmmssss to be a lot better than all the others despite being the newest player in the game and likely the least experienced. \\n\\n\r\nPK'ing never got an explanation after seven episodes. We are somehow supposed to believe a basic level based, grind it, role playing game was easy for a girl in pink clothing to kill players in the sand. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, all their explanations are full of dues ex machina. It's a crap ton of \"SIKE IM GOD MODE.\" Then we are forced fed an explanation in the span of two minutes. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, their was an opportunity for these guys to create something great but they just slap everything onto you. By the seventh episode you'll be asking yourself...\"Wait...what? Why, How? From where...\"",

            "content": "After 5 episodes in which is almost half of the whole series, GGO still fails to give us the motivation of protagonist(Karen). What is Karen fighting for and why should we care and root for her? The premise is she play GGO because the character that she got is short and cute, and therefore she is playing GGO. However, beyond this,  I can't really find why Karen is playing this game, which leads to the character being boring and uninteresting. What does winning the tournament means to Karen, and what does she gain from it? Well... All I see is nothing. All I knowafter the first arc is that Pito might be really bad for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nThrow away all the bullshit action and how it doesn't make sense. I just want to talk about the story. Even in SAO, we know that the protagonist wants to escape the death game by winning it. In ALO, we know that the protagonist's waifu is in danger and he wants to save her. In GGO, we know that there's is a death gun in the game which the protagonist needs to fight against. In ALO2, there's a girl dying? Despite the story being mediocre, there's still a story and a conflict. In GGO alternative, except for a random tournament which leads to nothing, we can't really see the conflict and what drives the protagonist to move forward.\\n\\n\r\nIn one sentence, this anime is even \"trash-er\" than SAO season 1 and 2 despite written by another author.

            "content": "In 2012, we are introduced to the world of Sword Art Online, where it features the most hated over-the-top OP character Kirito, the main MC along with his shenanigans of fantasy-drama with the cast of SAO, and his foundation brings him over to 2014 where we have SAO Season 2: the world of Gun Gale Online (or GGO), with an entirely new cast (but not without the original cast (since it\u2019s a cross-over)) that manages to do well but garner less attention from the original series, but in all essence, Kirito stood still: He saw, he came, and he conquered\u2026ALL, with much hate from theanime consensus.\\n\\n\r\nThis year, we have an entirely different GGO, not written by the original creator Reki Kawahara (thank goodness!), but by the author of Kino\u2019s Journey, Keiichi Sigsawa. Knowing the gun-crazy novelist, as mentioned from Pitohui: \u201cWell, he\u2019s a gun freak and a not-so-novelist but afterword writer (that takes serious pride in his work but doesn\u2019t take himself seriously and just wanna have fun). This is what you get when they are combined.\u201d And much to my amazement, SAO Alternative is a damn good and impressive series of not just its light novel adaptation, but the anime series here provided so much fun and realism that\u2019s NOT what the original SAO had with OP characters, the MMORPG or game-fantasy setting and fanservice, just plain old good shooting and characters to boot AND finally THE SAO series that is worthy to be discussing about here.\\n\\n\r\nThis story follows the main best girl (IMO) Karen \u201cLLENN\u201d Kohirumaki, not the typical kind of girl that you see on the streets, because she is insanely tall (183cm or 6 ft\u2019) and has problems coinciding with society that are the status quo. Relinquished, but not out, she sets on the task of finding the best VR game that suits her wellbeing of being shorter and chibi-fied, and none other than GGO (with her AmuSphere) is she able to take advantage of her small sized avatar of her dreams! And it is there that she finds the friendly, yet sadistic Pitohui, just the typical friend looking out for each other at first\u2026until her invitation (and pressure) to LLENN to enter in \u201cSquad Jam\u201d (which is SAO Season 2\u2019s Bullet of Bullets (BoB) team battle royale variation) faces both a challenge and a fight to the death as Pitohui\u2019s obsession with the original SAO features made her lose consciousness (or rather, becoming the 2nd Kirito) and her fight in SJ2 proves that.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with the storytelling and how director Masayuki Sakoi (one of the best from Studio 3Hz) decided to pace Sigsawa\u2019s adaptation, it is apparent that for those who entered this with no know-how of SAO Season 2: GGO will be lost (but not by much), and the pacing of the series which is fast, but progressively it slows down to give the plot more context and its true intentions here and there. Overall, it is a well-thought-out story which gives more exposition and its characters life out of the ordinary. And\u2026not to mention that recap episode where Sigsawa himself has lavished out his own parody (as he is famous for that) in Episode 5.5 where he \u2018sponsors\u2019 SJ inserts through his self-acclaimed \u201cafterword\u201d (or after-credit rolls) through silly voices and sounds into the battle footage, oh what a bliss!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here tell the exact same story from how they are made from the ground-up, and as a result, they flow much better than the SAO counterparts it came from:\\n\\n\r\nLLENN, as a character, much from her chibi avatar cuteness that cannot be mistaken as a kindred spirit in battle, she is a character that goes all-out in doing what she does best: Shooting, make and gather friends, more shooting, and a blood-bath between her and Pitohui rounds up what her activities lie in. Be warned as her real and VR life are two separate entities: the tall yet humble self vs. the crazy, all-pink character mascot that she has garnered popularity amongst Squad Jam players as one with the most potential. Engaging with LLENN felt like a journey of sorts (see the similarity?), from her alliance with Goushi Aousgi (better known as M in GGO) in the first Squad Jam to friendship with Miyu and fighting together in SJ2 against Pitohui and M and their mercenaries. Overall, LLENN is a character that can best be resembled as another Sinon, but not to that extent where it gets all technical, and with her P90 (often calls it P-chan), she can go anywhere. Overall, LLENN\u2019s character writing may not be brilliant, but it\u2019s fun to see her insane adventures and risks to be the best of the best.\\n\\n\r\nPitohui, the character that is out of form and looks hideous, first appears like the stereotypical challenger out from the ashes, but immediately her scarred or tattooed face immediately gives away the vibe that she is not the typical challenger like the many out there in SJ. Suffice to say, it\u2019s her addiction through the SAO back then that made her this way: the aggressive, careful and meticulous yet murderous intent that shaped her the way in GGO, even though the 2nd round of Squad Jam where she mercilessly slaughters enemies the EXACT way how Kirito did in GGO with the light saber. But thankfully, this is one of the few traces of the original series and doesn\u2019t go to an extent to replicate what happened, so crisis averted. Overall, Pitohui is a character you wouldn\u2019t want to mess with, because she gets her work cut out and done on the spot.\\n\\n\r\nM, the armour/guards-man, he is the typical buff character\u2026until his deal with Pito shows up his desperate face, just as many out there (but not as stressful as the original series where you die in the game, it\u2019s game over in real life). But I can tell one thing, he\u2019s as robust as a rock with his tank-like shield which repels shots to the maximum and I have to say that M makes light work of how a support character and a team member should be. The man with guts to analyze the best of the situation, I approve!\\n\r\nThe characters don\u2019t quite have much to boot and/or say, given their exposure that doesn\u2019t give much information from the start, but as the series subsequently progresses, it gives the characters much substance and their identity uncovered and recognized.\\n\\n\r\nIn the art and animation department, it is absolute proof that Studio 3Hz could take any adaptation, fill in with their own unique quirks and still make the series look as realistic as it is. Unfortunately, as much as the original series (SAO S2: GGO) has been shown, the art style may lack in some areas which A-1 Pictures have done well capturing the essence of GGO in its entirety. But what it makes up for with sacrificing art quality is with animation, and it helps that 3Hz is hands down one of the best when it comes to animation quality, and throughout the immense action, it doesn\u2019t sweat a beat, and fuses with the art style quite well, making a decent art style still look appealing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical department, is quite frankly, the high point of the series. Eir Aoi has done it again, with the 1st OP of SAO: GGO \u201cIgnite\u201d in 2014, and in comes the alternate version with \u201cRyuusei\u201d as the OP, and honestly, is lit and on fire, and immensely watchable, so much that I never escape the OP just to hear the goddess come back to reign in her high-pitched voice that truly is just satisfying to listen to. And let\u2019s not forget LLENN\u2019s VA, famous seiyuu Tomori Kusunori with her ED \u201cTo see the future\u201d, and just like the OP, is a good ED to end the series\u2019 episodes, and overall, this OST is a soundtrack that\u2019s worth having, and is my No.1 favourite this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SAO Alternative: GGO is a series that if you\u2019re coming in from SAO and reeling in from the saltiness of the series (which I don\u2019t blame you), it\u2019s hard to get adjusted of this gem of a show, albeit done by an author of jokes and a different production team, but promise me, forget the travesty you know that is SAO and stride into the Alternate: GGO that is everything except what Reki Kawahara had envisioned, with absolutely no expectations, and see how much this show will amaze you from the get-go. If you haven\u2019t watched SAO, GOOD, go watch this one, because you don\u2019t need to know GGO to enjoy this series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for myself, this is my AOTS alongside Golden Kamuy, and this has been proven by an ex-SAO fan who thinks that this was none other than exceptional, more so than the originals. A great job and well done, Studio 3Hz and the production team for providing an SAO that mirrors Sigsawa\u2019s ideals instead of Kawahara\u2019s, and is fun and enjoyable from start to finish.",

            "content": "TL;DR at the bottom\r\nWell for the people that hate Kirito he is not here so good for them, but it does not make the show better for it. Instead the show is centered around a girl with a height complex. So how tall is she you may ask is she 6'2\" maybe a even 7' feet tall? No she is 6' tall which is very big for a girl but is about 3\" bigger then the average Japaneses male. People say this show dose not have have any of the old SAO cast but the main is sinon with a height complex instead of agun complex.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nFor the most part there is not much here only plot armor and more plot armor. If SOA had one thing going for it its that the bullshit plot armor was not linked to a stat that everyone has. If agility helped soo much why would anyone build anything else. Then there is the military man who teaching the short girl to F***ing use a knife reverse grip making her reach shorter then it already was because anime looking cool does not = practical.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nArt was good nothing else to say just good\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSame as art just good no bug problems here\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nNothing much here yet, 4 episodes in but in a 12 episode show this is a bit worrying\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAverage, nether here nor there if u can get over the bullshit plot armor that no one else has even tho they may have played longer then the main character\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nThe animation, sound, and voice acting is good but there are over 100+ anime that are leagues ahead of the quality of this anime and the whole SOA Franchise, such as Darling in the FranXX and many others. So for the SOA haters that which this and praise this for not being a shit as the original you do not need to go far to get better writing then shit and this show is about a good as a fan fic set in the shitshow that is GGO, wish they went with one of the other seeds that they showed in the character creation episode they all looked better then GGO T_T. \\n\\n\r\nPS. The writer of this LN knows that being shorter does not make that stride of your legs longer right? Generally it makes you slower which is why most of the fastest runners have long legs.",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE* \r\nWhen Sword Art Online first came out, I was still an anime newbie. Ignorant to harems and perfect Gary Stu characters, I was impressed by Kirito, and just like most young kids, I thought he was great. \r\nIn hindsight, I decided I didn't like him for the same reasons I used to like him. I assumed that if he was written better, then Sword Art Online and Gun Gale Online would have been better-- but alas, even when he's not even in this show, I find myself bored to tears. \r\nAs a geek myself, I thought I would enjoy the whole Gun GaleOnline world. After all, I did develop a liking for Sinon from the second season of SAO, and I also liked the virtual reality idea, both in SAO and in virtual reality arcs in other shows like Hunter x Hunter. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this show just wasn't what I wanted. It is dull and repetitive and very predictable. Not to mention that the characters are flat and boring. I don't give a flying fuck about a single one of them-- which is rare for me, seeing as I adopt characters as my children regularly. In the first few episodes, the characters showed promise. It seemed they might actually stand a chance of being different from the stereotypes of SAO. However, they read kinda like outlines of characters rather than full-fledged characters. It's boring to watch it because the people in it are so dull. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I'm not sure where the plot is going and I'm not sure if there is a plot, really. It seems to go in a lot of different directions but it fails to keep the audience interested. The entire show is just two VERY long fight sequences. I was hoping for perhaps a Gon-Hisoka (Hunter x Hunter) style face-off-- main character is weaker than opponent at first and gets beat, and then later garners enough strength to beat the opponent through perseverance and training. However, this was just two long battles split up into about 4-5 episodes each. That's pretty much it. I was also hoping we would get a bit more of LENN/Karen's character in here since one of the main selling points was her playing games because of her insecurity. While she does grow more comfortable with her height at some point, it's not really gradual or explained. She's just suddenly okay with it after being embarrassed of it her whole life, and the subplot just ends there. \\n\\n\r\nThe songs (the opening and closing especially) are pretty mediocre, but the Elsa Kanzaki bits are pretty good in my opinion. The background music and animation is also pretty stunning, so if you're not too interested in characters and plot, this might still be a really good watch for you. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: like guns, like long fight sequences, like lolita chicks, like femdom, like sadism/masochism relationships\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: want something with plot, like having deep characters with actual personalities, don't really like shows that are just continuous action, want some more meaningful or overarching plot like the imminent death plot of SAO, want a hero/heroine that grows or changes, hate sadistic/masochistic characters/relationships \\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "content": "For years, Sword Art Online franchise told us a story about being inside a VRMMO game (or ARMMO in Ordinal Scale case) and while the setting or the world building is very good enough, they never have given us any good story or protagonist characterization (I'm looking at you, Kirito). Suddenly an adaptation of a light novel spin-off based on Sword Art Online franchise came to us and exceeded its original story it based on. Using the game setting of Sword Art Online : Phantom Bullet arc, the VRMMO game called Gun Gale Online, I will tell you why this spin-off is far more betterthan its original story.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important thing is of course, characterization. They used one important theme around building LLENN as a character and that is insecurity. It is very shown that LLENN or Karen have an insecurity about her height that is far taller than anyone else. She thought that being tall was not cute at all. Hence, she hoped that if she entered the world of VR, she could become shorter and cuter. She hopped from one game to another just to get a perfect avatar for her to fulfill her insecurity. Pitohui on the other side used game to suppress her suicidal tendency and sadistic nature just for LLENN to enter the fray and snap her out of it. For me, I have the same way of thinking as LLENN. Game is somewhere that you should have fun because sometimes reality is harsh and you just want to run from them for a while.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the original story itself has already made a good game mechanics, this spin-off really used them well and even added more things that really interesting. First, how the stats really pay off at the battles. LLENN have more AGI than most people it made her very insanely fast while Fukaziroh have more STR than most people it affected her ability to wield more weapons than anyone and of course, her power to do melee. Second, how they used the bullet line as a signaling system. Until now, bullet line just shown as a prediction line to avoid the bullets. To actually used them as an effective way of communication, it never crossed my mind until this adaptation came. They used it as a marking for party members to move stealthy or separately. And lastly, the immortal object. I think it is very smart to use dead bodies as shield as it was an immortal object that cannot be penetrated. It was a perk that is very interesting to be part of our strategy in a game about guns and bullets.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is certainly good. The songs that being sung by the voice of Kanzaki Elza have this vibe of Aimer in her voice making the songs feel deeper and better in my opinion. Of course, you should never miss the opening song. After a long time of hiatus, Eir Aoi came back and sang the opening for this anime. For me, it is fitting since she was the one who sang the first opening of SAO II and it was a great reunion for the fans of both SAO and Eir Aoi in general.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has exceeded all of my expectations and rise above its original source, Sword Art Online. With how the anime ended, I do really wish to see this anime being continued into second season if the source material or the light novel still have more story to go. It is a huge kudos for the writer of both the source material and anime.",

            "content": "The fact that the original SAO has a higher score than this is frankly appalling.\r\nLooking around reviews on here and Crunchyroll, as well as several anime discord servers, I usually see people rating this anime negatively either because it is SAO, or because it isn't SAO enough, rather than being judged on it's own (\"Alternative\") merits.\r\nI don't need to go through the flaws of the original SAO, it's already been beaten to a pulp in the anime community. What I do need to say though, is that besides the immediately noticeable decreased production value, Gun Gale Online is a clear improvement over the original SAOin almost every narrative aspect.\\n\r\nWhile the original focused more on the actions that Kirito did within the world of Sword Art Online, GGO focuses more on what outside reason each character has for playing a virtual reality game. The theme of escapism is more poignant and relevant, and is less seemingly set up for romance. The main character, LLENN, is also instantly more relatable and likable in 5 episodes than Kirito in two full anime seasons and a movie. Her motives, personality, and goals are set up very well and as a character, she is continuing to flesh out and become a big favorite of mine within the isekai genre. She feels like her own character and not a bizarre power fantasy.\\n\r\nThe fight scenes, while not as flashy or expensive as the original anime series, are instantly more compelling due to the extensive (and ridiculous) tactics that are involved and feel at home in a battle royale setting.\\n\r\nGGO's supporting cast aren't as fleshed out or feel as close to the protagonist as they could be at this point in the series, but each character feels like they belong in the setting with their own motive for playing the game and escaping into it.\\n\r\nI can only hope that the pacing kicks up and that the production doesn't fall apart, I'll be reviewing this in full again once the series concludes.",

            "content": "Story: The story takes place a few years after the release of Sword Art Online. It centers around our main heroine Karen Kohiruimaki. She enters the world of Gun Gale online to get away from the issue she has being a very tall woman. She tries many different games but each one gives her a tall default character. That is until she enters Gun Gale online and becomes the Pink Devil LLENN.\r\nI actually liked the idea of why Karen wanted to play games. Because honestly thats what we do. When we are sick of dealing with situations we don't want to deal with we turnto Anime, Video games or whatever else to distract us from our problems.\\n\\n\r\nShe then meets a fun amount of people including Pito, M, the Amazons. With this the Gun Gale story builds into something stronger.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art and animation were fantastic in my opinion. Taking out blood and replacing it with red pixels was a great. you could still sense it when someone was getting shot or cut.\\n\r\nThe main thing I liked about the animation was the First Person Point of view they went to at certain times. For instance LLENN is running in episode one but they have it so that you, the viewer, is seeing what she sees. I though that was pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Voice acting was great and i thought the BGM and music throughout the anime was really well done as well. A lot of intense parts were paired with some great music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Aww man Pito and LLENN were all you really needed in this anime. I was constantly struggling deciding who my favorite is between the two of them. (After the last episode it ended up being LLENN/Karen) The supporting cast was really fun too. M was hilarious at times and Miyu was pretty funny. I wish she was in the anime more in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I am surprised how much I enjoyed this anime. I thought it was not going ot be anything special but it turned out to be really great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I honestly found this better then the original Sword Art Online. Now I did like Gun Gale better but only slightly. I just felt like this anime had everything that Sword Art didn't. An overall better cast of characters, better story, no romantic drama garbage, and a good ending.\\n\r\nIt's nothing like Sword Art and is basically a stand alone show. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun shootem up type of anime.",

            "content": "Honestly this anime is insanely enjoyable. This review is spoiler free by the way.\r\nAfter finishing this show I went to write a review immediately because of how much I loved the ending and how it wrapped up.\r\nFirst the ending. This is the most complete, wrapped up, and satisfying endings I have seen in a while. I felt so complete after watching it. The characters ALL grew and developed and it fit so perfectly that I wouldn't have ended it another way. In the trend of seasonal, 12 episode anime; this is definitely one of the most complete anime I have seen.\r\nThe story progressed very well,from the beginning to end the motivations were clear. LLENN/Karen wanted to play a video game to kind of escape here height anxiety. Probably one of the most realistic motives I have seen for a VRMMORPG series I have read or watched. A lot of people, but not all who go online and make online friend do it because of issues/insecurities in real life as LLENN does in this story. This alone really gives the watchers a lot of reason to relate to LLENN as a character even if you aren't an internet person, people go places or do things to escape the hard parts of reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all very enjoyable LLENN is fun to watch, while some people see her as annoying, I can only disagree. M is very funny to watch especially as it gets closer to the end and seeing LLENN's reaction to some of the stuff he says. The gel of characters really adds natural sort of unforced comedy that I think is hard to come by these days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall without spoiling I don't really have much to else say but, this show is VERY enjoyable and worth the watch, the real rating of the show is probably closer to an 8 but because i enjoyed every second i gave it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad in this show is just a lot of the logical stuff though, all the characters beside the main ones of course have a lot of trouble aiming because they aren't main characters. LLENN is extremely broken and can run faster then anyone, problems with the game mechanics etc. These issues are able to be over looked easily by me due to my personal investment with the characters  and story, I don't really see the game mechanics and game logic flaws as a problem because i don't see it as a focus, but I can see how some other people might find this awfully annoying and are unable to get over it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is worth your time and thank you for reading my first review.",

Gave it a 10 because it's just pure enjoyment for me that I can overlook the small things.\r\nThe pace of the anime is slow. It leaves you really excited to watch the next one but that gets tiring fast when it's a week between episodes. Would much rather binge this then watch one at a time.\r\nComparing to the manga they have stayed mostly 1-1 so both are a good investment if you like one you will probably like the other. There are onlyminor differences between the two\\n\\n\r\nCombat is very SAO not too much tactical shooter involved but they make it interesting none the less.\\n\\n\r\nLLENN is adorable and has much more expression than her irl counter part.",

            "content": "At the time of writing this the anime has barely started, but the impression of it really has struck me as something i look forward to every week.\r\nThe main reason for this is the creator, instead of the moron who pieced together the rest of the SAO franchise: Reki Kawahara. \r\nInstead SAO Alternative: Gun gale online, was created by Keiichi Sigawa, he manages to create characters that dosn't need some gimmick to have his characters act seriously when it comes to games. Its not some type of death game, where one death means the actual death of you as a player, a much bigger priceis on the line. Your pride as a gamer. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone who plays PVP games competitively know this feeling, and strive to become the best no matter what. Even if your wins outweigh your losses, one loss has 10x the impact of a win. You have failed to prove yourself as a competent player and have lost because of it. The feeling of playing against someone who is better then you, and you not even being able to stand a chance against them, it feels so bad because someone else is better then you, it feels as if you could have won, you didn't.\\n\r\nPeople take games seriously for their own reasons, and that's something Kawehara just dosn't understand.\\n\\n\r\nWhen i watched this, and my first reaction was \"How big a thing did Player Unknowns Battlegrounds become in Japan?\" Then my friend told me battle royales have been in Japan for years & linked me to a Japanese movie with the name \"Battle Royale\" from year 2000..\\n\\n\r\nBut just following the anime further, i realized something. It has none of the limits for characters like sao because it focuses on the main cast. So i thought that made it better, but that wasn't just that. Its more competent and actually follows the rules of the game, it has actual tactics and feels real. The characters have reasons for what they are doing, and there is no real risk other then losing pride.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ever reaction of \"What??? The dude who made SAO couldn't possibly have made this\", Rushing to see who the writer of the source material was, and it made me happy and excited. it wasn't the SAO guy, but some rando called Keiichi Sigsawa, having never seen anything from him prior, but seeing he actually know what he's writing about. It still doesn't feel like someone who has much experience with games, but it really feels like he knows for some reasons for people to play games.\\n\r\nSome play games for fun, for nothing to do. But some do it to escape their real life and be someone they cannot be for one reason or another, in real life.\\n\\n\r\nIt mixes someone who just wants to be her ideal cute, but that's impossible for her in the real world. She starts trying to find an avatar that is just that, to fulfill her greatest wish, when she does she decides playing the game she found it on. (This is because of the non existent character creation these games have, its a terrible game flaw for the entire system). Every time she faced the same problem in the game as her real self, her pulse rose to the point that she got booted out of the system because it thinks she's in danger. It shows how badly her anxiety really is, when she cant face her problems in a virtual setting even.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings me into one of my favorite parts of this: The gameplay.\\n\r\nGame mechanics, exploiting, using the mechanics and knowledge from guns irl to actually do better with them, its amazing. I just love how the anime shows how flawed the game system actually is, the main character has to register multiple accounts just to get an avatar she likes, and with no seeming drawbacks, making me wonder if its a common strategy, since it looks almost like it could be. (although if it was, there'd be a lot more with smaller player characters because having a small hitbox in a shooter is ideal)\\n\r\nActual strategy, making use of that, to hide in places and use unconventional cover. \\n\r\nExplaining how the system assisted aiming is good for weapons to hit further away, or hit more accurately is good for newbies with guns, but it gives the enemy an advantage because they see where the system aim is set, and if you just turn that off and use the gun properly the enemy wont see what hit em. Things like this is what i love delving more into, and i love that the anime works with the game in its broken state, and makes excuses and explains how it works in depth.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope it keeps up the way these first episodes have gone, its super fun and actually interesting, and as someone who has some of the same problems as the main girl faces, i really like it. Its not something you see too often being discussed, and this format is perfect for it.\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone who liked the concept of GGO & would like to see a more fulfilling, less cheaty anime then sao2 was.\\n\r\nSAO Alternative: GGO is definitely the best entry into SAO to date. (And how SAO is going the route of Kirito becoming the reason Accel World is going to exist, i hate the main line of SAO even more, so it looks like it'll stay the best entry until another spinoff like this comes out.)",

            "content": "SAO Alternative GGO: A fun series that served as the opening act\r\nSAO Alternative GGO had only one function: to warm up the public for the arrival of the main dish of the franchise, Alicization, which is coming in October. And the series fulfilled.\r\nThe novel written by Keiichi Sigsawa (known for novels like Allison and its sequels \"Lillia and Treize\" and \"Meg and Seron\", which resulted in the anime Allison & Lillia) and supervised by Reki Kawahara (creator of SAO) was never ambitious nor did it seek to overshadow the original story\r\nTherefore, it was foreseeable that after the announcement of the start of Alicization for nextOctober, the GGO anime will be released before; this in order to prepare the stage. Doing it later or during would not have made sense because all the attention would be focused on the work of Kawahara and this spinoff would have passed without pain or glory.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget that the 3Hz studio, with just 5 years of foundation, is still a novel studio that seeks to position itself within a highly competitive industry; for that reason, seeking to adapt something from one of the most successful franchises in the medium, and then try to compete with their Magnum Opus would have been totally absurd.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, I'm not even going to enter the debate on whether this spinoff is better or worse than the original work. It is true that the arches of the novel adapted in the first two seasons of the anime (Aincrad, Fairy Dance, Phantom Bullet, Early and Late and Mother's Rosario) have many flaws (for something Kawahara himself is rewriting all that in the SAO Progressive saga ); however, when we enter the world of Underworld, within the arc of Alicization, everything changes and the rest of the frames, spinoff included, are reduced to mere companions.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I have to talk about Alicization I will elaborate on this point, but for now let's go back to what brought us here today. SAO Alternative GGO was a series told in good form, with an easy to follow plot, loaded with good action and combat sequences that were handled in a great way. By the way, from here Spoilers come.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, if it had stayed there it would have been a series of round action. Unfortunately, Sigsawa wanted to put the element \"someone's life in the game is in danger\" and that's where the plot (and therefore the series) showed the seams.\\n\\n\r\nSince then, there were many attempts to sell us that Pitohui was in danger of death; however, the more they explained it, the more absurd it was. So much so, that it went against the much-needed \"suspension of disbelief\", which ends up taking the spectator out of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention that trying to make us believe that the only way to help this maniac was defeating her in the game was even more bizarre. And the police? Even in the Aincrad incident, the government got involved almost from the start; which also did in the case of Death Gun, so there is no reason to believe that they would turn a blind eye on this occasion.\\n\\n\r\nEven accepting that Goushi really is a good for nothing, that he is, Karen from the beginning proved to be a competent woman, so her attitude did not make sense. It would have been more reasonable for everything to be taken for a game and to simply go with the flow. However, seeing her try to defeat Pitohui with the conviction that she was saving her life; and worse, with the fear that the maniac could die was simply surreal.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, every time this was mentioned, all the magic and atmosphere of the series was lost. It was as if all of a sudden they turned on the light while they told you a horror story. Fortunately, in the end that did not have all the relevance that was tried to give and the focus was always more towards the side of the action and the combats; Otherwise, the series would have ended very badly.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, it seemed to me a good point that the whole matter of Llenn and Pitohui's encounter in the real world was handled with humor, because it marked a change of tone that was unexpected and appropriate in equal parts. Above all, considering that the series did a terrible job hiding the true identity of Pitohui.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the fact that the letter that Karen sent to Elsa was used as a main part of the outcome served very well so that point would not remain as a loose end.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical section, 3Hz studio did a competent job in character design, direction and animation. Of the three, I highlight the last because the combat sequences were very well worked; and let's not forget that they are the heart of an action anime.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the soundtrack, I'll say that Kajiura-sensei's absence is quite noticeable, but Starving Trancer made a great effort to show us themes that accompanied what happened on screen without clashing. Of course, within this section I have to highlight the opening \"Ryuusei\", played by Eir Aoi, which came as a glove to this anime. It was a nice touch to choose Eir as a gesture to connect with the main series.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a very moving series, with excellent combat sequences and a simple, but well-armored plot, which fully fulfilled its role of heating engines for the arrival of the crown jewel, Alicization. It is true, that its attempt to sell us that Pitohui was in danger of death and could only be saved by beating her in the game was a joke; But at the end of the day, SAO Alternative GGO was not a dramatic series, but an action anime, so do not give it too many laps.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nA series of well-armed action that only got messed up when it wanted to get into the drama.\\n\\n",

And also, none of that Asuna-Kirito and what not BS. This here is FANSERVICE lol.\r\nBasically, I think that the original SAO is absolutely terrible compared to this.\r\nAlso if you have an interest in guns like me you might like it even more.\r\nOkay! The story.. (no spoilers). For me personally it doesn't look likea clich\u00e9. It's basically about this girl that has a pretty standard life and doesn't feel too comfortable this way. So she heard about VR games on TV and the story picks up from there. Maybe it's just me who hasn't watched enough Anime though who knows?\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks phenomenal and I think Studio 3Hz has done a great job. I think it looks better than the \"original\" one.\\n\\n\r\nSounds are fine as well but the gun sounds are not really the best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoy this show a lot and I can never wait for the next episode.\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier the main point is not the isekai but the characters' lives (or at least for me), but I am also not saying that if you like isekai you're not going to enjoy this. Go for it.\\n\r\nI don't love this show but I like it a lot!\\n\r\nLet's hope the show takes it's turns to the best!",

            "content": "This show is a spin-off in Sword Art Online franchise and features a completely new cast in next \u201cdeath game lite\u201d scenario. Do these major changes mean improvement over the original? No. SAO:GGO tanks story and characters as spectacular as its predecessor, minus those action sequences, that made SAO at least serviceable.\r\nRATING: 3 \u2013 bad. \r\nSTORY: \tWe did not forget the obligatory caf\u00e9 info dump & rape scene.\r\nI do not research upcoming shows, or the names behind a project, often I don\u2019t even read the synopsis; the only entries I may recognize are the title and the studio. After several weeks I learned, that apparentlysome big shot was working on the script, thus GGO is already a much better anime. Nope, I do not see any improvements. You don\u2019t believe me? Let\u2019s play SAO-Bingo. \\n\r\nI am asking for an overpowered main character, do we have one overpowered protagonist somewhere? Bingo! LLENN is abnormally fast and small compared to everyone else. Plot armor, is plot armor a thing? Bingo! LLENN\u2019s first tournament or Pito\u2019s headshot are nothing but plot armor. Next is an obligatory rape scene, can we see some questionable content? Bingo! Molesting dead virtual bodies is a critical hit for me. Finally, I offer caf\u00e9 scene containing info dump! Bingo! But wait, it is not just a scene, it is an entire EPISODE. BINGO!\\n\r\nNot only does the show wander aimlessly until the obligatory caf\u00e9 info dump episode, it also manages to tell nothing of importance afterwards. This anime is just a slow tournament arc void of any narrative and filled with underdeveloped caricatures. Not to mention that GGO as a game is made even more boring and dumb.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Kirito is a better main character.\\n\r\nInitially, our main character, Karen, was looking for means of escapism, because she has a complex concerning her height. This trait is the only integral point in her characterization and together with the whole escapism theme quickly loses any relevance after first episodes. Motivations are nonexistent. I already mentioned plot armor, so moving on to the antagonist, Pito. \\n\r\nShe is a good player and nuts. That was fast. \\n\r\nThe support cast is just as amazing: we have a group of middle school girls, who want to improve their teamwork in a virtual game by fighting against militant squads doing their training in GGO. Makes sense to me. Moreover, there are friend B and friend M. All the other side characters are morons, as players and as human beings. \\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION: Pink loli in a brown desert. \\n\r\nAt least the original SAO had some above average visuals and several well-made action scenes, thus could be discarded as popcorn entertainment. SAO:GGO fails to deliver even this much. \\n\r\nSome characters models cater to moe fans, others look like failed experiments; there is no cohesive art style shared among anything. Backgrounds consist of unimpressive desert, forest or grey urban areas. Animation is present, interesting or engaging action is not. \\n\\n\r\nSOUNS: Average. \\n\r\nBackground music as well as OP or ED are average, not even one track stands out in any way, good or bad. Original voice act is anime 101. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, pretty much every anime is better than SAO:GGO, even the original SAO stands above this mess. Just go watch something else. If you value it higher than the original, because some big names were working on it, take off your bias glasses and look again.\\n",

            "content": "First things first, if you disliked original SAO you can safely test this series for yourself, it's nothing like it. Just to be clear here I did enjoy the original SAO immensly (almost all of it) even though it had quite a number glaring faults. \r\nWhat makes or breaks animes and mangas for me these days are mostly characters and their interactions, then cpmes the story and then the rest, and SAO:GGO unfortunately seems to have it all the wrong way round.\r\nThe GOOD things first:\r\n- Sound design is on point, there is not a single moment in this anime where sound would take me awayfrom the action or I would be disappointed with it, on the other hand, when it shines you do notice it (songs made for this anime are really good)\\n\r\n- The Art doesn't feel out of place, it's not soaring among the stars like masterpieces from Makoto Shinkai, but the animation is mostly smooth, texture quality is pleasantly high, nothing to really be picky about, very well done.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the BAD things:\\n\r\n- The Characters! My god... Someone truly misunderstood interesting for \"having a mental problem\". Most of the characters should see a psychologist for some guidance and two of the characters (second female main and her \"lover\") should actually seek out professional psychiatric help. The interactions between them feel extremely artificial, basically you can feel that things happen between them to drive the story forward and not the other way around. And since I already mentioned the story\\n\r\n- The Story is simply boring, at least for me, it seemed like a nice idea at first but by the end I didn't really care for it at all. For me it's not utilizing the setting at all. Why are they playing GGO and not some other game? Why even play games to go about your problems at all? It sure is explained in the anime, but it feels flimsy. Also it lacks a general direction. In the original SAO it was always clearly defined: First clear the game, then save Asuna (because Kawahara has some bondage fetish), then uncover the truth behind the Death Gun and finally the mini-stories. There is no such goal in here at first, then we get a sort of goal, but again, it feels flimsy and artificial (and looks like a job for a psychiatrist and the emergency services, not a 19-y.o. with a complex about her height).\\n\\n\r\nNow finally the golden standard of the whole SAO series: Game Design is absolutely horrible! If it felt a bit more real, if it felt a little bit more tangible, maybe, just maybe I would have enjoyed the story more. But all it did was take me out of the experience. Unlike in the original SAO where I had some characters I cared for here there was nothing stopping me from pointing out the stupidity of the game simply because I wasn't engaged enough in the struggles and problems of the characters. I'll try to mostly list them because there's just too many issues to go into details (some of them are shared with the original SAO since not much has changed in GGO):\\n\r\n- The way the guns are obtained in the game is very unfriendly and unfair to new users\\n\r\n- PVP is does not have weapon balance at all, pretty shit for a pvp-focused game\\n\r\n- Prediction lines, the rules when they appear or not are extremely inconsistent\\n\r\n- If you could shoot without them, every player would simply train to shoot without them\\n\r\n- Teams in the team-battle-royale can wildly vary in size - makes the game extremely unbalanced for professional gaming\\n\r\n- Rules for getting damaged are extremely inconsistent\\n\r\n- You can heal yourself from a headshot!\\n\r\n- Weapon damage doesn't seem to matter when the story asks for it\\n\r\n- Weapon range is inconsistent\\n\r\n- Making bodies bulletproof after death\\n\r\n- Giving a player a bulletproof object to carry!\\n\r\n- If there is no killzone that's getting smaller and smaller, there's nothing stopping you from gettin an 8-player sniper party, bringing a mix of normal and anti-tank rifles and some powerful shields, gettin on a vantage point and waiting there for days...\\n\r\n- Explosives range and damage is horribly inconsistent\\n\r\n- Dual-wielding grenade launchers (both extremely stupid and inefficient)\\n\r\n- No way to replenish ammo other than to beg the enemy for it\\n\r\n- Massive fields with nothing in it! This game is basically shouting \"Get a sniper rifle and annihilate everyone\"\\n\r\n- There is no upside to having a big player model apart from being able to carry very heavy shit, no matter how big you are a team of lolis would be able to dance around for for days on end and make you look silly\\n\\n\r\nAlso this tournament is supposed to have the best of the best teams possible from thousands of players. Why then everyone in here is retarded? People walking around without cover in the middle of the street/field, having no spacing between them whatsoever (I guess it's only because the story needs them to be killed quickly with a single grenade). Found an opposing team? Shower them with bullets instead of regrouping and flanking them. Found a guy in a cave behind a waterfall? Shower him with bullets instead of throwing a grenade in. See a target behind a heavy shield you have no means of destroying? Charge him for no reason (remember to shower him with bullets) instead of retreating and going around his back, forcing him to switch positions.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell I kinda enjoy my FPS games, and GGO is one of the shittiest FPS games ever conceived. It made watching the show incredibly difficult for me. Was the original SAO any better? GGO part was a bit less bullshit, but SAO and ALO were also fucked in the head as RPGs so no, it wasn't. The difference was that I cared for the characters there and here I couldn't bring myself to do that.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: You can give it a go, if you'll end up liking the characters the rest should be decent enough for you to have a fun time.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching SAO AGGO and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned.  \r\nThe Rise of Llenn a university student\u2019s journey to gain confidence and overcome a personal complex by fighting and facing down fierce opponents as a cute and speedy girl on the bullet-ridden battlefields of GGO Online. \r\nBased off a popular light novel of the same name Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online is a spin off of the popular Sword Art Online mediafranchise that took the world with storm back in 2009 with the release of its first novel and again in 2012 with the release of the first of its hit anime. Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online often shortened to SAO AGGO gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a university student wanting to gain the confidence that her real-world self-lacked were to discover the world of VRMMORPG\u2019s and decide to use this to gain the confidence that she needed in the real by facing countless dangerous foes and finally live the dream of having an avatar that she wanted for so long a cute and petite avatar that contrasts with her one and greatest complex that has bothered her all her life. The first episode of the series did a great job at reintroducing me to the war-torn and bullet-ridden world of GGO and introduced quite the intriguing main character and I'm glad that I decided to stay and watch the series right to the very end.  \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story follows the life Karen Kohiruimaki a university student that has recently moved to Tokyo from Hokkaido. As a result of her abnormally tall height, Karen has struggled with having to face weird glances and questions all of her life that resulted in the creation of a complex that has affected her life greatly. A chance encounter with an ad promoting the newly resurgent game genre of VRMMORPG\u2019s created within Karen an idea to make use of this game genre to create an avatar that she can be proud off and use this to overcome the complex that has been bothering her all her life and bring to her via her interaction with her avatar the one thing that she needs the most. After many failed attempts and after finally reaching the last game that she had chosen Karen finally gets what she had dreamed off and desired the most an avatar that was not abnormally tall but rather cute and petite. \\n\\n\r\nWhile fighting across the war-torn and bullet-ridden world of GGO Karen as her new avatar Llenn would fight many powerful and dangerous foes that will not only raise her fame as a GGO player but also give her real-world self the confidence that she needs to overcome the complex that so bothers her in the real. As she fights in the many battlefields that GGO offers Karen would encounter many different players that both help and hinder her in her quest to become stronger in both worlds. These include the calm and rational veteran sniper M, the energetic and unpredictable Pitohui and the confident and overly energetic Fukaziroh. But as Llenn and the others fight and match their opponents in battles of wits and firepower Llenn realises that even as they fight and kill each other in a hail of bullets each battle is also a chance to create and promote understanding between players that can create friendship both in and out of the game and even stop someone from committing a grave mistake in their life if need be.  \\n\\n\r\nKaren \\n\\n\r\nKaren Kohiruimaki voiced by new seiyuu Tomori Kusunoki is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A university student that recently moved to Tokyo from her hometown of Obihiro in Hokkaido Karen is a positive if shy person by nature that while intelligent and fast thinking is someone that prefers to be modest and not stand out. As a result of her shy nature at the beginning of the series, Karen was noted to be someone that got nervous quite easily and as a result, had few opportunities to make friends that she can count on. However, despite her quiet and shy nature, it can be seen that Karen is a kind and caring person by nature and is not someone that will bear grudges against other people even if they had faced each other on the battlefields of GGO. At the beginning of the series Karen was noted to have an unusual complex regarding her unusual height something that had bothered her since she was a teenager and as a result of this had to endure many unfortunate experiences as a result. As a result, Karen viewed this aspect of her with something approaching disdain and did not see herself as cute as some people say but rather uncute. As a result of this disdain for her height, Karen\u2019s greatest wish was to somehow become something that was the opposite of her real-world self-something that was both short and cute. A chance encounter with an ad for the VRMMORPG game genre though soon gave her the opportunity that she needed. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result of finding the world of GGO and being granted her wish of having an avatar that was short and cute Karen while happy that she had managed to find the one thing that she wanted for so long was also introduced to the world of GGO a world of varied battlefields that were filled with intense battles between players armed to the teeth with automatic firearms. In the beginning, Karen who chose the character name of Llenn was a calm person that tried her hardest to get used to a game genre that she had never been in before. While often getting scared at times especially when faced with situations that don\u2019t go her way she can often get surprisingly brave and tenacious especially when she has a strong motivation to succeed which is best shown in her SJ battles and her battles with the members of SHINC. As a result of this determination and her persistent attempts to improve her skills and fight against more and more tougher foes Llenn soon built up a solid reputation within the GGO community as an ultra-fast attacker that was quick as the wind and able to down you in a matter of seconds with her preferred weapon the powerful SMG the P90 and given the apt nickname of the Pink Devil for her small size, her records and her creative usage of small unit tactics. However, despite her impressive record and fame that she has gained Llenn displays none of the arrogance that many a player with her achievements have developed and instead remains humble and willing to learn from others that have been playing the game longer than she has showing her humble nature. As the series goes on and as Karen through her avatar Llenn fights through countless battles in GGO she gradually becomes braver and more confident of herself and begins to slowly overcome the complex that had so bothered her in the real world. While becoming more confident and determined Karen also become clear-minded and sure of her choices and actions and willing to fight even her mentor and best friend if it meant that she can save her from the obsession that has taken control of their life. This is a far cry of how Karen was at the beginning of the series and showed just how much fighting as Llenn on the battlefields of GGO have changed her. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Karen I felt was one that was both well designed and developed and showed that with determination and courage and perhaps a bit of luck by fighting to overcome your real-world deficiencies in a VR world one can maybe not just become a better person in the real but also find and make many great friends that you meet along the way. I felt that her seiyuu Tomori Kusunoki really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Karen.  \\n\\n\r\nGoushi/ M \\n\\n\r\nM voiced by veteran voice actor Kazuyuki Okitsu of Aoki Hagane no Arupejio fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Llenn\u2019s allies within the series. A calm, quiet and experienced player that Llenn meets early in the series M unlike Llenn is not an attacker but rather is a veteran sniper. A patient, cautious and methodical person by nature M while a man of few words can be quite blunt when he does speak offering both critical critiques while at the same time useful advice and tactics when pressed into combat situations. While a man of few words M is shown to be someone that respects results and while M and Llenn did not have the most friendly of first encounters, as a result of fighting together on the fields of battle both were able to get a good feel on each of their personalities and as a result form a strong friendship with each other as well as develop trust in each other. While a capable sniper and somewhat renowned as the ultimate sniper due to his special accessory M is also a capable strategist able to analyse situations and enemy movements and come up with counter tactics quite easily which is helped greatly by his keen sense of hearing that allows him to accurately determine the types of weapons that are being used and the distance they are at. Despite his calm and composed nature, it can be seen that M is someone that has an immense fear of his friend Pitohui and when put in this state it can be seen that M loses much of his trademarked calmness and instead becomes a visual coward and panics quite easily. However, despite his fear of Pitohui it can be seen that M is very loyal to Pitohui and will respect her decisions even if said decision is suicidal and unwise due to the feelings that he has for her. The character of M I felt was an interesting character and served well as both a mentor figure to Llenn and a counter to Pitohui\u2019s sudden outbursts of irrationality. \\n\\n\r\nPitohui \\n\\n\r\nPitohui voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yoko Hikasa of K-On and Campione fame is one of the main characters of the series and is both Llenn\u2019s ally and the main antagonist of the series. A veteran GGO player that Llenn meets during the early part of her career in GGO Pitohui who Llenn often shortens to Pito is a friendly, honest and kind person that matches well with her energetic nature. As can be expected from a veteran player Pito has access to a considerable armoury with many rare guns and equipment within her inventory that will make many a player of GGO sign in envy. As a result, it is perhaps unsurprising that Pitohui displays a degree of overconfidence in her attitude and sure that she can deal with any threat that comes her way. While overconfident Pitohui is also shown to be someone that\u2019s perceptive to a degree and able to deduce easily when its time to get serious and when its time to relax which is a skill that\u2019s important for any gamer of VRMMORPG\u2019s. While an eccentric person by nature Pitohui is shown to be someone that honour's the promises that she has made and will do exactly what she had promised to do no matter how unreasonable that action is. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Pitohui\u2019s character is expanded upon it can be seen that behind Pitohui\u2019s overconfident nature is a dark truth that serves as her main motivation for being a player of GGO. While most players of GGO including Llenn play in GGO to fulfil their fantasies, train with the battles ingame to improve their skills in the real or in Llenn\u2019s case to gain the confidence that she needed to overcome her real-world complexes it can be seen that Pitohui is somewhat different. From the beginning of the series, it can be seen that while Pitohui fights with all the skill that can be expected of a veteran player rather than fight in battles that she can win easily at she instead chooses battles that are not just challenging but also put her life as a player on the line. In the event that this battle does not prove to be entertaining enough for her, it can be seen that Pitohui can get unusually aggressive and lapse into an uncontrollable rage that is difficult to stop even by her allies. With this it can be seen that rather than seeing GGO as merely a game as most players would instead she sees it as a place where she can gamble with her life and experience the thrill of needing to fight to your utmost to preserve it showing not just a dangerous motivation but also an obsession that makes Pitohui not just a danger to herself and her allies but also to her many opponents as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs a character I felt that Pitohui was a well designed and developed character that while acting as a friendly and well-meaning mentor figure at first soon evolved to become a character that was the total opposite of Llenn not just in terms of personality but also in motivation as well and ensuring that the two would face each other on the field as enemies rather than as allies. While her normal self was a powerful fighter it can be said that her ultimate devil\u2019s self is when Pitohui truly shines as it is in this state when she casts off her reason and embraces her desire to fight to the death can she truly be called the devil and the state when she feels the most alive. This side of her character I felt was one that really gave me the chills as it showed just how powerful she really can be when she releases her trademarked calmness and reason and embraces her dark side and helped ensure that she becomes an effective villain for the series. I felt that her seiyuu Yoko Hikasa really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Pitohui. \\n\\n\r\nMiyu \\n\\n\r\nMiyu Shinohara voiced by veteran seiyuu Chinatsu Akasaki of Plastic Memories and Fate/Apocrypha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Llenn\u2019s allies and friends within the series. An old friend of Karen that\u2019s from her hometown Miyu, unlike Karen, is a confident, positive and intelligent person by nature that\u2019s also energetic both in real life and in the VR world. Unlike Karen\u2019s quiet and cautious nature Miyu is playful and excitable and can easily get side-tracked thinking of herself even if these thoughts are mere delusions.  This excitable personality and its tendency to cause Miyu to lose rational thought are best shown during her first foray into GGO with Karen where she selected as a main weapon one that was both expensive and difficult to use for beginners. From this, it can be seen that Miyu is someone that acts in the moment and is not one that will consider the consequences of her actions beforehand contrasting well with her partner Karen. Despite her tendency to act on the moment, Miyu is also someone that can be quite creative with her tactics being able to work out how to best use her new weapons in a short amount of time while also coming up with innovative tactics that allowed her to support Llenn better on the field.  Despite her playful nature Miyu is someone that can offer some surprisingly deep insight to Llenn at times with her ability to come up with motivational quotes whether custom or historical one\u2019s being especially impressive. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Miyu who adapts the name of Fukaziroh and subsequently shortened to Fuka I felt was an excellent character that was both well designed and developed with her positive and energetic personality and real-world chemistry combining well to not just create a strong team up between Fuka and Llenn but also helped bring a hilarity to the story via her actions. I felt that her seiyuu Chinatsu Akasaki really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Miyu. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise I felt that the series did a great job of showcasing the various types of terrain and settings that could exist within a large scale VRMMORPG that is geared towards massive firefights between players armed with automatic weaponry. The character designs for the series main and support cast I felt were also well designed and reflected well upon each character\u2019s assigned personality and struggles. The character design for Llenn in particular I felt was pretty good as the battle outfit that she wore while usable also made great use of camouflage which complemented Llenn\u2019s small size and making her not just hard to see but also hard to prepare for when fighting her something that Llenn took great advantage off. The colour pink while acting as camouflage for Llenn also had the effect of increasing Llenn\u2019s charm and matched well with her core struggle to be cute to overcome her real-world complex. The character designs for the supporting cast I felt was also pretty good with the members of SHINC, in particular, being pretty interesting considering their real-world appearances and occupations.  In terms of combat animations and battles which are of paramount importance for action animes such as this I felt that the battles that were featured in the series were strong ones that were both well designed and thought out particularly in terms of tactics and strategies with notable battles being Llenn\u2019s suitcase surprise in the first SJ, the amazons advance against M during the second SJ, Llenn\u2019s ambush of SHINC and the final battle between Llenn and Fuka and Pitohui and M in the second SJ. \\n\\n\r\n In terms of music I felt that the series opening and ending themes which was Ryusei that was sung by veteran singer Eir Aoi in her first song since her return from hiatus and To See The Future which was sung by Llenn\u2019s seiyuu Tomori Kusunoki were both strong songs that complemented the series well with the first creating a sense of anticipation and battle and the second being more peaceful and calming to reflect the sense of finishing a battle successfully. The series OST I felt was also pretty good and complemented well with the many types of emotions that the cast experience as they were confronted with new situations when fighting on the field. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the main voice cast of the series did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I felt that Tomori Kusunoki, Yoko Hikasa, Kazuyuki Okitsu and Chinatsu Akasaki who portrayed the characters of Llenn, Pitohui, M, and Miyu respectively deserve special praise as I felt that they did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online was a series that I really enjoyed with its main strong points being its unique premise, strong story, excellent characters, well designed and executed battles and excellent voice acting and not to mention a very strong villain. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise of the series I felt was one of the series main strong points and because it made use of a personal struggle and complex that was unique to the human side of the main character I thought it was pretty unique. As human beings, I would say that its normal for us to have struggles in life whether its struggles in one\u2019s professional careers or struggles in one\u2019s personal lives for example with friendships or a personality aspect that\u2019s unique to them. Depending on the types of struggles that we have the effects that it can have on one\u2019s life can vary considerably and impact us differently. In the case of Karen, the struggle that she has been battling with has been one that she has been battling with since she was a teenager and one that can be said to be serious enough to actually cause her to develop a complex for it. When one thinks of a way to overcome a complex hopping into a VRMMORPG and hoping to create an avatar that\u2019s your desired height and appearance will probably not be the first answer that most people would give you and indeed most people would suggest you get therapy of some kind. This unique method while strange is one that I felt was pretty interesting as not only did it allow Karen to enter a brand-new world where she hasn\u2019t been to before but also do so in an avatar that was the very dream one that she had worked so hard to find thus fulfilling one of Karen's true desires. While finding the cute avatar of Llenn is one-half of the struggles that Karen has been dealing with the other half of the struggle and premise is without a doubt of how to actually overcome that complex. In this I felt that the way that the series handled this by allowing Karen to fight against increasingly powerful enemies that exist within the game was a smart move as not only did it allow Karen to develop as a character by both learning, confronting and winning against opponents more experienced than she is but also allow both Karen to grow in confidence and Llenn to grow in fame and rep as well. \\n\\n\r\nWhile growing in both confidence and fame Karen\u2019s rise as a player of GGO also allowed her to meet and befriend many unique characters that affected her not just in game but also out of it as well and enabled her to not just overcome the complex that she has been bothered with for so long but also enable her to break out of the other flaw that she had which was her shyness and quiet nature and for the first time enable her to make many new friends that have subjects that they both share and enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the series I felt was also one of the series strong points and made great use of the premise. MMORPG\u2019s by their nature are games that are played with a lot of other players whether you fight against them in PVP or fight together in PVE you are always playing the game with other people. As a result of this, the forging of friendships is just as important within the game as it is in society. Becoming friends with someone means that they are someone that you can trust and rely on for advice whether it's on game-related matters or real life-related matters and more importantly they are someone that you can tell your deepest secrets and fears too without worrying about whether it will get leaked or not. The most important aspect of a friendship though that is used as one of the main themes of this series is the actions that you take to stop someone that\u2019s dear to you and how far you would go to stop someone from committing a grave mistake that will impact not just their game avatars but also their real-world selves as well. In this, I felt that the series made great use of the belief that true friends that care for each other deeply would do all they can to save people that are dear to them from committing grave mistakes by doing whatever is necessary to stop them even by facing them on the battlefield as opponents. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online was an anime that I really enjoyed watching as a result of its unique premise, strong story, characters, well designed battles and its emphasis on friendship both ingame and outside the game and as a result even as spin-off to the main series SAO AGGO I felt is a solid new addition to the franchise. As a final score, I can say for confidence that the series easily deserves a score of 10/10.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This particular SAO arc has a very fun and playful mood (so far), even though the theme is about killing other people in a VR world. If there is one thing that would make this anime even better it would be adding a real conflict or problem that Llenn actually has to fight for, besides her insecurity. But we are still only on episode 4 so i shouldn't make any real assumptions. But so far it is a solid anime with probably the cutest main outof all the sao series.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Repost 3rd Time in a row\r\nHas some spoilers in it. \r\nWTF were Studio 3Hz thinking when they come up with shit like this? the story plot was basically this was a drker version of Net Juu  where prople were finding an escape from reality and enter to a a level of excitement away from the mediocre in the virtual world. So pretty much, the plot is cliche and pretty much lack any excitement since the characters were safe behind their console. anyway the fact is this anime's story plot was as boring as Isekai wa Smartphone. The art was no concern of mine, sinceI don't give any shit in it and seeing the main character wore pink as oppose to black, grey or green was just soooooooooo pathetic. Sound, geeezzzz, no comment on that, but it was kinda odd that Seiyuu Hikasa Yoko's voice were cast differently , were in the game she's Pitohui while in the real world she is Riza's manager. So overall. this is one way of desecrating the SAO franchise, so my verdict:\\n\\n\r\nStory-Mediocre 5: Since the plot itself was just too cliche as any anime that has a cyber punk genre in it. \\n\\n\r\nArt-Pathetic 1: And that's for LLEN's combat outfit. \\n\\n\r\nSound-fair 6: I need not say why cu'z I just don't give a fuck. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Pathetic 1: We have a university girl who has some form of inferiority complex about his height and her friends were a bunch of middle school girls and another gamer whom she partnered up for the Squad Jam 2 to beat a player who has some suicidal tendency, a guy who is a lolicon/ masochist/ loser who should die in the real world, an antagonist in the game world whom for some reason is either stupid for not realizing how lucky she was for not getting into the 1st SAO or nuts who should be seeing a shrink either way she the main pathetic character here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Poor 3: This is one anime where it's ok to skim some episode since the main characters were gonna be safe anyways and they're just as pathetic both in the game and in the real world. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-Poor 3: This was just another knock-off of the ff: Net-Juu no Susume, Isekai wa Smartphone, Netoge no Yome and Gamers.....so realistically Studio 3Hz just desecrated the SAO franchise, and just watching this makes me wanna go to Japan and do what Sanzo of Sayuki does to Goku when he is pissed to the, studio exe and the original creator of this cliche thing.\\n",

            "content": "While I found the other SAO anime series and movie to be relatively fun albeit flawed romps through a fairly basic setting with some cool ideas, Alternative distancing itself from its family so strongly by dropping ALL connecting characters and most connecting events was an interesting move. Does it pay off? Well... let's see.\r\nThe story, such as it is, is tripe - without going heavy into spoilers, they tried to recycle the OMG IT'S A DEATH GAME OOOOO vibe from every other SAO so far, and like most of them, it falls flat - and unlike even Ordinal Scale or GGO the paper thin explanationfor it here is so utterly trite and idiotic that it breaks all suspension of disbelief. The tournament structure is equally meaningless; you CAN tell a decent story within the structure of a tournament sure, the original GGO did that alright, but Alternative fails to pull it off due to its characterization.\\n\\n\r\nAh yes... the characters. Do not look into this dark abyss if you have even a passing interest in character depth. Even Jesus-Kun himself, the almighty Kirito, at least has hobbies and interests and strengths and flaws, while the main girl Karen has... a height complex. And I guess she likes music. That's it. She doesn't really grow or get much more interesting from there. At least her bunny loli version has a few good moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe deuteragonist/antagonist Pito is gratingly obnoxious from start to finish, loud and frustrating and uninteresting, though a few scenes paint her as slightly more intriguing and show the intriguing depth she COULD have had, if not written by monkeys on typewriters - sorry, the monkeys don't deserve that insult. And these are supposed to be the lead friggin' characters? There sure as hell isn't any charisma or intrigue to be found there, they don't even feel like they have a damn bond!\\n\\n\r\nSide characters, ironically, fare slightly better but still fall hard. M starts off interesting and becomes a one-dimensional joke from there for the most part; similar to Pito he has a few good scenes but otherwise is a boring caricature. The high school loli squad's entire depth is \"lol we look scarier ingame\" but at least they're amusing to watch bicker. Every unnamed character and most of the foes are obviously NPCs; looking identical, all standing next to each other to die instantly, so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nThe ONE character who actually has some depth is the self-aware grenade loli, who happily abuses her small stature and femininity ingame to mess with people, who has obvious flaws but also a spark of actual charisma, and as a result actually feels like a real person. Unfortunately she never does that awesome grenade rain from the opening theme and mostly just gets stuck acting as support for Jesus Bunny-Chan.\\n\\n\r\nOh and a bunch of NPCs are randomly super perverted and really horny for lolis in completely unnecessary and creepy scenes that never go anywhere, add any real depth or heft to the anime, and just feel like random pandering - though I can't tell if they were trying to pander to lolicons or people who hate them or just thought it'd be funny to have a grown ass man try to rape a little girl in a fucking televised tournament fight.\\n\\n\r\nAh yes, the fights. We all know Kirito was overpowered, but at least the series made a token effort to justify it; the special skill from Heathcliff to end SAO in a hero vs villain battle, ported maxed stats, years of death game experience, great reflexes, crippling autism. Were they valid excuses? That's kinda in the eye of the beholder. But at least they made an effort to explain why he could do what he did, and to me that made it more tolerable. Not the first time a MC in anime has been overpowered after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe Loli Rabbit of Caerbannog? Not so much. She has blatantly superhuman speed and reflexes for no apparent reason, pulling off vastly superhuman feats such that even other Agility builds have no way to react to them, and worst of all her feats vary by scene - sometimes she can casually dodge bullets, other times she's just running at normal speeds, neither is ever explained and we are never given a clear view of what her limits are. Every fight she's in is either a casual clusterfuck of her casually ripping apart trained soldiers and pro gamers, or... her randomly struggling with nobodies who aren't even set up to be scary. More often than not she wins by deus ex machina that makes Kirito's dumbass 'breaking the rules of the MMO' at the end of the first series look fair and balanced.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, none of the fights have much meaning or heft to them, which is a pity because there actually are some cool shots and strategies scattered throughout the anime - just drowned in a tide of mediocre Mary Sue bullshit that puts Kirito and even that imp girl's garbage to shame.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've been pretty harsh so far, and I don't regret it - the anime overall is heavily mediocre. But it does have some redeeming qualities and I would be remiss in not at least mentioning them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is solid, as long as you don't ever look at any of the minor characters. Major characters generally look alright, if not memorable, and the viscerality of the fighting occasionally pleasantly surprised me; most kills are pretty generic but higher powered weaponry occasionally rips avatars in half or blows off heads and makes the fight more visually exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was... honestly I just finished watching it an hour ago and I can't remember ANY of it, it was all that underwhelming. I didn't hear any that was outright bad, but it was all utterly forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I don't regret sticking through the anime, but don't see myself ever watching it again - it's SIGNIFICANTLY worse than 'normal' SAO in almost every regard. The first GGO is a far superior anime overall if you want shooty gun stuff; Sinon is a much more interesting deuteragonist, the story is still forced at times but at least is kinda believable, and there's more meaning to the fights.",

For the same reason I'll skip the details and get to the point of this show - impressive cringe.\r\nTo get this imagine typical Adam Sandler movie, mix it with poor inconsistent second-hand writing, random \"cool'n'fun\" characters and skip any reason anywhere, thenrearrange it in sloppy way and here we are - something that physically hurts to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it has nothing to do with technical side of the show like animation or sound, it's just action-based anime with kindergarten understanding of shooters that resembles \"Hot Shots! Deux\", but not enjoyable in any way because of how everything is unnatural mess. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, just like Adam Sandler movies, it will find some fans, but will be quickly forgotten no matter how flashy it appears and will be noted as another abomination of battle royale popularity.",

Then boy do I have an anime for you. \r\nOn a serious note, you can't judge this one by its cover. The premise sucks unless you're really into lolis with guns. Yet there's something satisfying seeing a tiny pink thing make a fool out of larger more serious adults. Of note, this anime is primarily a comedy, borderlining parody of the original. The action scenes are well-executed,creative, and witty. And like I said, it's enjoyable watching LLENN outmaneuvering the other players. \r\nIn terms of themes,forget the melodramatic die irl if you die from SAO. This is about the friendship between two women who shared nothing in common except for their love of gaming. If you've ever had a friend you used to game with online, and had a blast together, this is about that. The anime does a decent job of exploring online personas vs irl self. There's little room for character development, but it's short enough that development isn't really needed. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't an anime to be taken seriously. It's lighthearted fun and as long as you keep that in mind, it's a really enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if you hated SAO, don't let that turn you away because I thought SAO was meh too and I really enjoyed this one. I wouldn't say it's one of the greats, but definitely recommend watching.",

With its over-the-top characters, action and a rather silly, predictable main intrigue, it definitely won't captivate you with its storytelling, but is visually impressive and genuinely fun to watch. \r\nIt also doesn't take itself seriously at all, although the humour is more delivered through the sheer absurdity of the situations presented and contrasting characters with their online personas, more than outright gags. It mightnot be perfect for those that simply hoped for more SAO, but will satisfy all those fed up with original's melodrama. All-in-all, a rather average, but fun series that I do not regret watching - just don't expect an emotional masterpiece.",

            "content": "- Finally my review of Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online, starting with the story that in general is very average and exaggerated in some parts and is also a very generic story and with nothing that stands out, unfortunately; but still has some interesting and epic moments in a way, in short, I classify the story as Ok.\r\n- On the technical side, without doubt is the strongest point of the series, both the visual and the animation are very good, however I would like to highlight the soundtrack that is simply epic and striking for an anime of the genre; now on thedirection, varies a lot, while there are epic and interesting moments, there are also exaggerated moments in the series, in other words, the direction as a whole is medium.\\n\\n\r\n- Now about the characters that unfortunately is the weakest point of the series, the characters, although they are few, are not exploited as they should be, and some are very poorly developed, but without doubt the biggest problem of the cast is that the direction exaggerates a lot in relation to some characters of the series; finally, the cast until it is good, pity that had a bad direction.\\n\\n\r\n- Conclusion, Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online has several problems, both script and direction, but still has some good points as a good technical part and an excellent soundtrack, as a whole is a good anime for those who are looking for something just to pass the time, with nothing too deep; Overall I would definitely recommend Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online, a good action anime !! \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude09\ud83c\udf1f !!\\n\\n\r\n- My favorite song by Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online \ud83d\udc9c : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1RMnM782u8\\n\\n\r\n- My page about animes on facebook \ud83d\udc96 : https://www.facebook.com/pg/AnimeSpaceBR.050/posts/?ref=page_internal\\n\\n\r\n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc96 !!",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains spoilers for Sword Art Online: Not Complete Shit Edition because of reasons.\r\nI was planning to avoid this because... Well... It's Sword Art Online, I've had enough shit just watching the original series, no need to waste my time with a spin-off that's probably even worse. That's what I originally thought, but then people kept talking about how it's made by a Studio 3hz, a different staff from the original SAO, has a different story with different characters, and most importantly, a different writer: Keiichi Sigsawa, the author of Kino no Tabi, no less! As someone who loves Kino no Tabi, Idecided to give this Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online thing a chance, then, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised at the lack of SAOness here since this time around we're talking about a much better writer than Reki Kawahara, I even managed to convince a friend of mine who hates SAO to watch this one with me, she accepted with the condition that if she didn't like episode 1, she would leave and I would have to watch the rest alone. Fortunately, Gun Gale Online did enough to keep us watching together and we actually had quite a bit of fun with it, so it's already better than the original SAO just for that. But okay, it's better than the original SAO. So what? I don't think that's much of an accomplishment to begin with, so I'll refrain from comparing GGO to SAO for the remainder of this review unless I feel it's necessary to make a point.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place sometime after the whole SAO incident, the NerveGear was recalled and destroyed and VR games lost their popularity because people understandably got afraid of playing a VR game and ending up in a bad romance anime again. However, with the launch of the newest VR gaming device, the AmuSphere, and the assurance that the incident won't repeat itself, the popularity of VR games saw a ressurgence as thousands of rich neckbeards got their hands on this new device. Our protagonist is Kohiruimaki Karen, a socially-awkward university student with a complex about her \"abnormal\" height, being taller than most people at her age and implied to have been bullied for that in the past, as such she has a hard time interacting with others besides her family and close friends. One day, Karen heard about these VR games that allow people to experience an alternate reality with alternate versions of themselves to boot and it caught her attention, with the help of her gamer friend Shinohara Miyu, she tried a lot of games who gave her different randomly-generated avatars, but all with the same tall height until the shooter Gun Gale Online gave Karen the short loli avatar she was looking for. Wow, I mean, you have these fucking advanced VR games that literally let you BE your own character in a virtual reality and there's no manual customization to how you'll look like? What the hell, VR game designers? Get your shit together! By the way, Karen's avatar is named LLENN... I don't know why her name is LLENN or why it's in all-caps, but alright then.\\n\\n\r\nOnce Karen becomes LLENN, she at first uses GGO just to play around as the cute little girl she always wanted to be (though I still find her real life version cuter) but eventually she decides to play GGO seriously, and after completing the tutorial and hunting some monsters, LLENN buys submachineguns, a new outfit and changes the color of both the guns and her outfit to pink in an effort to look cute and more girlish. LLENN's pink outfit actually blended well with the desert environment she chose to hunt around and she started to ambush some unaware players using that as well, which led to them calling her the Pink Demon. Eventually, LLENN comes to know another female player named Pitohui and the two become friends and LLENN buys two P-90 machineguns which she ends up nicknaming P-chan, and they play GGO together as a team and hunt some more monsters, and one day Pito tells LLENN about a GGO team tournament called Squad Jam, where a lot of teams fight against each other until the last one standing is declared the winner, and she wants LLENN to participate in the tournament along with her partner, a player called M. Back in real life, Karen isn't sure if she should participate on the Squad Jam or if she should even keep playing GGO, so she ends up asking Miyu for advice again, and Miyu came up with this idea that she was planning to get tickets for them to see a popular singer named Kanzaki Elsa in concert at the same time the SJ would be happening, and if she doesn't manage to get the tickets, Karen should participate on the SJ then. Well, considering the first episode of the show actually shows LLENN and M already shooting out against other teams in the SJ, you'll probably guess what was the outcome of that little dilemma. Also... Pitohui won't be able to participate on the SJ herself, the SJ will happen around the same time Elsa will play on her concert... Sure, that's probably just a coincidence, of course it is.\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't notice, GGO is a lot more slice of life-ish compared to SAO, which works better to me because SAO's attempt at having a plot and especially the antagonists were by far the worst parts of it, so we're off to a good start here. That being said, I really do like GGO's first half, it still tackles the theme of escapism and virtual relationships this series became known for addressing in a half-assed way, but this time the main character is well-written and relatable! I mean, I don't really relate to Karen's reason to play GGO, my height is just about the average 24 year old man's height, but as someone who has crappy social skills and tends to use video games, anime and even social media to escape real life problems for a bit and have some fun, I can totally relate to Karen's attitude of playing a game to enter a different reality where she can be whatever she wants and meet a lot of other people who may very well be on the same boat as her. Karen is a timid girl, she deliberately avoids interaction with other people in fear of standing out due to her height and possibly get ridiculed by them, which may seem a bit silly to some people, but there's a lot of real life people who develop social anxiety for that kind of stuff, like people who are fat, poor, have an unusual hair type compared to the others, etc. Hell, I've met some real life dudes who say they don't like tall girls because being tall is kind of a masculine feature, imagine a tall girl such as Karen hearing something like that from a guy she happens to like, it would definitely make her feel terrible for being tall, which is something that's not even her fault to begin with! So, I can definitely understand and sympathize with Karen, the show really emphasizes how much more comfortable she feels as LLENN in GGO, after all a little girl will always be viewed as cute by people, as opposed to a tall one, LLENN is considerably more outgoing and extroverted compared to her real life counterpart, which is actually how Karen's personality truly is when she's around other people without her complex getting in the way. The other characters also play GGO for specific reasons that are mostly related to their personal lives, but they're not explored as well as Karen is, which is kind of a shame because most of them are pretty likeable despite the show not giving them much focus, I thought M was kinda boring at first, but when it's revealed that he was roleplaying as this stoic military veteran who's all business the whole time and in actuality he's a beta loser who cries and begs not to be killed, it was unexpected and also fucking hilarious!\\n\\n\r\nI won't delve into GGO's game mechanics because it's a fictional video game that's primarily there to provide some cool action scenes, so I'm willing to suspend my disbelief to an extent, as long as the game doesn't contradict stuff it previously established when convenient to the plot like SAO did, and GGO for the most part works fine within its own rules. Since shooting is the name of the game here, the battles lean more on the tactical side, to win the SJ it's necessary to pay attention to the other teams' positions when the game shows them in the radar, use the knowledge of the terrain to your advantage and attack at the right time, although LLENN obviously have some special skills since she's the main character, being short makes her slightly harder to aim at compared to other players, and she can go full Sonic the Hedgehog and run really fast to avoid bullets and surprise other players. I'm not sure why LLENN has these skills, but since this is an online game with a stats system, I'll assume she built herself as an agility-oriented character and doesn't carry any heavy equipment, which helps her move fast. Anyway, LLENN may be somewhat broken as a player, but she's not Kirito, she's not so broken that she's capable of soloing anyone who dares to fight against her and elminating whatever tension her fights couls possibly have, GGO is still more tactics-oriented, and LLENN isn't exactly experienced in that regard at first, which is why she basically just does whatever M tells her to do in this SJ, and even then she still actually struggles in her fights, literally the only reason she even managed to win the SJ was because M helped her in the nick of time and... Some hardcore plot armor. Yeah, sometimes GGO likes to remind us that it's a SAO show and gives its main characters plot armor so thick that even Naruto characters would find it absurd. That's probably my biggest gripe with both Squad Jams in the series, they have some really good action scenes, but the final battles they lead to have LLENN winning in such a bullshit way that it kinda undermines the whole tactical combat that happened before. Stuff like LLENN being able to block bullets using P-chan and not get hit by a single one and the opponent only shooting specifically where LLENN is holding P-chan even though her whole body is still unprotected made me actually cringe while watching GGO and really stretch out how far my suspension of disbelief can go. I get it, LLENN is supposed to be lucky because she's like a rabbit and even her hat has rabbit ears, but there's a limit even to how lucky someone can be, and this goes way beyond that limit.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, after the Squad Jam and the whole time she spent playing GGO, Karen started to get more confident about herself, she even talked to a group of girls from a high school affiliated with her university, which just happen to be the last team she fought in the SJ, they're members of the school's Rhythmic Gymnastics Club and played GGO at first to improve on their teamwork, as well as their boss is a girl who wishes she was taller and less girlish. Although it's nice to see how Karen got over her complex and all, I feel she got over it way too quick, it's a complex she had for years, and yes, GGO was an unique experience for her and all, but still, I'm not to keen on her overcoming her complex so soon. However, I know why they made her overcome her complex already, it's because the second half discards the slice of life aspect of GGO and tries to have somewhat of a plot as what drives the main characters to play the game... Aaaaaand that's when the show starts to get progressively weaker, because the plot of the second half is really stupid. Basically, Asougi Goushi (M in real life) wants Karen to participate in the next Squad Jam because Pitohui is actually a maniac with a death wish who regrets missing out on SAO since that game put its players lives at a risk, and if LLENN kills her in GGO, Pito won't kill herself, but if another player kills her, she'll commit sudoku and it's bye bye for her... And Goushi is actually in love with Pito, so instead of calling the police or whoever can help Pito with this inexplicable obsession with death, he decides to bring in Karen and Miyu into this and begs them to kill Pito in the SJ... While he will be playing on Pito's team.  As I said, it's a fucking stupid plot, Pito was a decent character before, but now the show turned her into a stock edgy villain for the sake of bringing a plot and an antagonist into a show that didn't really need one, so the second half is almost entirely in the SJ. But it's not all bad, Miyu enters GGO as LLENN's partner and becomes another loli named Fukaziroh, her weapons of choice are grenade launchers and it's fun to see her blowing shit up, I also like how LLENN learned from M in the previous SJ and becomes pretty good at making up plans to engage the other teams, once again the action scenes in this SJ are pretty good, I would say even better than the previous one. This show isn't visually amazing or anything, but the animation in the fights is really good and the soundtrack also contributes a lot to them as well.\\n\\n\r\n... But just like the first Squad Jam, this one becomes horse shit near the end, at the precise moment when Pito takes a sniper rifle shot to the head, survives because of fucking course she was going to survive, and then she becomes DAMAGED personified. Seriously, she starts acting like every shallow edgy anime psycho you've watched before, she just wants to kill everyone and later she starts using a goddamn Sith lightsaber! I'm not making this up, she starts murdering people with a lightsaber, even though the other characters have guns and could shoot her, they never manage to hit her because she has an ever stronger plot armor than LLENN did in the previous SJ. It gets really ridiculous, and there's no actual reason to why Pito acts like that or has this obsession with death, she just does, after the SJ is over we discover that she's exactly who you thought she was the whole time and she's perfectly normal. Was she just roleplaying as an edgy retard this whole time? Was this supposed to be a spoof of internet edgelords who are actually tame and inoffensive in real life? I don't know, but I would prefer if GGO kept going on as a slice of life show where Karen deals with her personal issues while playing GGO to distract and have some fun, maybe explore other characters with their own lives and reasons to play the game, make Karen meet Pito sooner so the two of them can have a relationship outside of the game as well. For the love of God, anything but this asinine plot the second half had and the cringe-worthy edgefest that were its last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have some pretty mixed feelings on this show. The first half is pretty good, Karen/LLENN is a great protagonist, the other characters are likeable, the action scenes are fun to watch and the show's first half balanced slice of life with gaming similar to how a sports anime plays out, but the second half is only worth watching for LLENN and Fukaziroh's battles against the other teams before things get unbelievably dumb. Still, I managed to enjoy GGO for what it was, even though it could have been much better, I would watch a second season of it no problem, assuming it's going to be more like the first half of this one and not the second half, at least. If you didn't like SAO, there's a chance you may enjoy this spin-off, although... Depending on what exactly you hated about SAO and how much you're tolerant to it, there's also a chance that you may dislike GGO as well. I dunno, give it a try and see what happens, at least the first half I can definitely say I would recommend watching.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online : Gun Gale Online (henceforth SAO) isn\u2019t the most well-written anime this season, nor is it the most competent, but it somehow was one of my most enjoyable experiences this spring. This ain\u2019t just a 20-minute long SACRA ad for Reona\u2019s songs(this review, however, is), SAO has a certain je ne sais quoi that\u2019s not easy to put in words, but, being a reviewer, I\u2019ll try anyway, it\u2019s my job right?  [Boss begins writing a termination notice]\r\nSAO is an anime about Karen who occupies the avatar LLENN, a cute and tiny girl with a penchant for destruction. Along the way shemeets, teams up with and sometimes fights against a bevy of interesting and likable characters, and a bunch of bland randos in what is essentially proto-PUBG (The LN was written before the battle royale genre exploded into popularity). The characters are what made the show for me. While the writing is nothing special and plot contrivances are aplenty, just seeing your favorite characters receive a last-minute powerup to the tune of Reona\u2019s music [This review is sponsored by SACRA, a subsidiary of Sony Music, buy your copy of Reona\u2019s hits today!] is enough to get your fist pumping towards the air as the anime gloriously showcases a bombastic action sequence, however illogical and nonsensical, for your entertainment. And in the end, isn\u2019t that what really matters?\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s more to it than the appeal of seeing a tiny cute bunny kill things with her P90, SAO\u2019s setting is remarkably refreshing; in a wave of isekai taking place in Tolkien-inspired medieval fantasy settings, a contemporary setting based on modern military urban warfare makes for a surprisingly visually appealing treat.  The attention to detail on military and contemporary warfare tactics is on point and does make for an enjoyable show. While main character plot armor is in abundance, thankfully it is acceptable simply because it\u2019s done in a tongue-in-cheek fashion and not in a frustratingly absurd \u201csword swinging deflects bullets\u201d manner, which is something SAO would never resort to. There is enough tactical play to balance the hot-blooded action, and the action sequences are well-paced and built-up to as to avoid any fatigue or exhaustion. \\n\\n\r\nLLENN is simply a joy to follow. An otherwise meek girl with psychopathic tendencies, seeing her in action on the battlegrounds is always a treat. As is her interactions with the stoic M, her best friend Fuka, and the maniacal Pitohui. Fuka in particularly I found very well written, unlike most other best friend character archetypes in other anime, Fuka\u2019s characterization felt especially real, and her dialogue is very much what you\u2019ll have in real life with your BFF. Top points for that. And while it\u2019s true none of the characters receive any meaningful character growth, it doesn\u2019t really matter in this case. Hikasa Yoko\u2019s performance as the batshit insane Pitohui is the highlight of it all and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. The facial expressions of the mains in particular are a treat, being deliciously hammy and over-the-top. \\n\\n\r\nThe story and plot threads are seriously nothing special. You\u2019re not watching this for its story. The anime has an overreliance on explaining everything to the audience, even when it is either blatantly obvious to the viewer or it has already been explained to the viewer, almost akin to an annoying tutorial popup in a video game. [HINT: You can stop reading this review by pressing the X button]. And, as mentioned, the abundance of plot armour for the mains is present, though never to the point of frustration. Instead I found myself cheering like a lunatic anytime those scenes are present. The pacing is decent, your standard build-up, climax, resolution done to a T. It works, but is nothing special. This ain\u2019t no story about redemption, falling from grace, insanity or triumphant in the face of impossible odds, it\u2019s just an anime about some friends (and someone clinically insane) playing PUBG. And to make something so mundane so brilliantly entertaining is definitely a testament to SAO\u2019s credibility.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t normally single it out, but the ED for this is exceptionally beautiful. Minimalist with a soft piece sung by LLENN\u2019s seiyuu, it perfectly concludes each episode with its cute and calming melody. The visuals accompanying it is brilliant too, being reminiscent of a graphical UI and being overall very clean and pleasant to look at. Truly the standout ED of the season. [This review is sponsored by SACRA, a subsidiary of Sony Music, buy LLENN-chan\u2019s album today!]\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I had a great time with SAO and would miss my time with it dearly. Saturdays just aren\u2019t the same anymore without the crazy pink bunny yelling \u201cI\u2019LL KILL YOU!!!!!!\u201d at the top of her lungs. \\n\\n\r\n7/10 To see the future~\\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online blazes onto our screen that doesn't involve KIRITO! and LA might as well say it but without him or anything of the harem antics and false grandeur the original Sword Art Online had done, it's kinda nice to see Sword Art Online through not only a different lens but a different atmosphere altogether.\r\nSword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online (or GGO, LA will shorten as of this review) focuses on Karen Kohiruimaki voiced by Tomori Kusunoki being rather abnormally tall for her age she can't make many friends in the real world, however in VR or to bemore precise GGO, she's a chibi pink character who's extremely quick at that. Karen's entire development in the real world as well as VR is being accepted and her gain of friendships along the way.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of how the Sword Art Online franchise likes to take gaming trends and use it for their setting, from the first season's Sword Art Online of the MMORPG trend, to the second season of the FPS boom to Ordinal Scale movie take on AR trend and now well what has become popular by LA's time of reviewing this anime?...Battle Royale thus Karen or \"LLENN\" Karen's online handle takes in and the setting is mainly based on the Battle Royale setting and to this end, GGO capitalizes this in making some adrenaline fueled not to mention some incredibly intense battles almost every single time and LLENN has goals and promises in mind to her new GGO friends (mainly the crux of the plot Pitohui voiced by Yoko Hisaka, a mysterious women LLENN encounters and befriends her) and that is where the majority of the interest for LA to come into this spinoff and LA freakin' loved every moment of it. And sure the Battle Royale trend might die out along with this anime, but it's something of a time capsule much like the SAO franchise as a whole about gaming trends...in anime form.\\n\\n\r\nAgain the aforementioned Pitohui brings in some subtle mysteries, from many of the virtual avatars and who they are in real life (like Team SHINC, LLENN fights in the first BoB) to Pitohui herself and we see her open up to who she truly is and what her rather insane motives are and these mysteries along with the setting of VR Battle Royale allows most of the tensest moments in the anime especially when it involved Pitohui.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, many of the characters are badass throughout the anime and by god it works in this setting along with how LLENN and especially Pitohui goes insane and batshit crazy in order to win the tournament or for satisfaction makes many of these either badass or likable because of their personalities (well main cast anyways) and because of that, LA's favourite cast goes to THREE characters, LLENN for one as she's the narrative focus of the anime and how much development in both real life for her opening up through GGO and gaining friends through her notoriety but in GGO itself, she becomes the pink demon and a contender in the BoB, almost like an underdog everyone roots for. Pitohui for LA gained LA's favourite character mainly because of how batshit crazy gets in ALOT of ways and LA does love these types of characters, being an unpredictable wall of a character and finally Miyu Shinohara voiced by Chinatsu Akasaki or \"Fukaziroh\" was a bundle of energy and always the comedic relief and like the majority of the cast badass in her own right that LA liked Fukaziroh as well.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Studio 3Hz, the animation was consistent to say the least but the animation in general was great from all elements, from the exotic character designs (Mainly in GGO, though the real life characters are expected, yet still decent character designs anyways), the great atmospheric animation details and touches to the great battles that goes along with it, almost like your watching the battle royale itself and oddly enough for as much as GGO is the lighthearted version of SAO without the death and everything and as much as this is VR, the \"deaths\" in the BoB are ruthless sometimes and how much senseless violence that takes place.......and LA loved it!, seriously Studio 3Hz's great attention to detail on all fronts made the animation great all round.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, well the majority fo the cast was great but like LA's favorite characters and LA's bias, LA's favorite voice actors goes to Tomori Kusunoki as LLENN (though LA oddly thought Rina Hidaka was voicing her, but Tomori still did great as LLENN nonetheless), Chinatsu Akasaki bringing a bit more of that comedic atmosphere that was needed in the later half of the anime and Chinatsu utterly nailing Fukaziroh's nature and all round genkiness and LA's real MVP going to the crazy batshit badassness of Pitohui voiced by Yoko Hisaka...just DAMN...Yoko hammed it up in this anime and LA loved every second of it.\\n\\n\r\nOhh and Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online takes some potshots at the original SAO, which is kinda funny as Reki Kawahara is the SUPERVISOR for this anime, kinda like Reki Kawahara is self aware of the flaws of the original series, *ahem* anyways the potshots are lighthearted jabs at the original series mainly of the variety of \"This isn't SAO, you CAN'T die\" kind of jokes as well as referencing the original SAO (and it's second season) in the process from time to time as well.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online manages to take all the good points of the original concept of SAO, drops that into GGO and executed and used it's setting to it's utmost greatest potential and managed to make it interesting and tense without all the melodrama which GGO is ALL about. \\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online is a great alternative (hehe) look at a different GGO with all the crazy interesting and fun gun battles that LLENN goes through and GGO just has fun with it even it's most tense moments and LA just loved the atmosphere of GGO throughout. Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online is one of the more surprising and fun entrees to the Sword Art Online franchise and LA wouldn't mind having a second season of GGO to see where LLENN would go next and maybe see more of her real world self and how she progress there too...",

            "content": "The main draw for this anime is that it uses the fun premises and world building done by reki kawahara for SAO (Easily the best parts) and throws away everything else. This allows an actually talented storyteller to play around with the world. It feels like fanfiction, but in a good way. Kind of like the team behind this production saw the first two seasons of SAO, noticed its flaws, then told reki to hold their beer. \r\nThis series definitely improves on every aspect of SAO, at least in terms of the shows more obvious flaws. The main character has actual emotional struggle, has actualfriends outside of the game world, and has genuiune charm. The female characters (main character included) arent just there for some fanservice (though its unavoidable at times), with each of them contributing to the plot or at lest doing something other than obsessing over a man that they know very little about. Also nobody in this series is trying to have sex with their sibling and (so far) theres no rape-y scenes so thats an instant win. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said there certainly are some flaws here and there. For example, it really feels like the episodes were shown out of order. With the second episode better serving as the introduction to the character than the actual one we got (which should have been the third). As well right now theres no real stakes to the story at all. Which is realistic to the subject matter, but doesnt really get my excited to see what happens next. Which is fine, not all anime have to be hype, its just weird to not feel that way going into a show where gunbattles are kind of the whole point of the setting. \\n\\n\r\nHowever! Something else that this series does better than SAO, at least in terms of the GGO arc, is the action sequences. In the original GGO arc, the action was incredibly boring. It mostly just felt like a ripoff of the star wars prequels with kirito almost immeadiately just using his lasersword to rip through faceless goons until the final battle with the awfully named Death Gun. Whereas here, battles have a real sense of tension in them that can only come from gunplay. In addition, theres actual names and faces to the goons that our main characters face off against. With at least each group having their own personality that sets them apart from our heroes as well as other groups. This makes them seem, at the very least, like actual threats that could realistically take them out. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, at the time of my writing this review, I have only seen the first four episodes, so I feel all of these opinions should come with a big ole asterisk til then. Just because things take a turn for the rapey down the line. It certainly wouldnt fit the tone very well, but it didnt the first two times in this series either so who knows? But for now, this is an easy recommendation for me, 8/10.",

            "content": "I feel like SAO gets more flack than it should.\u00a0 Yes its subpar writing and questionable character choices leave a lot to be desired, but given its impact on the anime community by popularizing the medium during its run in 2012, it's time we let up on the abuse, right?\u00a0 No?\u00a0 Ok...\u00a0 Alright how about this, we have an alternative version to one of the more disappointing arcs in the series that's actually good.\u00a0 Sound good?\r\nStory:\r\nRather than focusing on the series's resident (insert adjective here) god of gaming, Kazuya Kirigaya, GGO alternative instead focuses on\u00a0Kohiruimaki Karen, a nineteen year old college student who has aheight complex due to being abnormally tall compared to most girls her age.\u00a0 After being told by a friend the magic of VR and how you can become anything and anyone you want, Karen finds herself playing GGO with a short and cute avatar named LLENN, and in a plot that sort of goes to the wayside in her journey towards self-confidence.\\n\\n\r\nThe big thing to note here with GGO alternative is its sense of scale.\u00a0 Written by Keiichi Sigsawa of Kino's Journey fame, Alternative dials back the death plots and substantially larger scale stories that SAO was known for.\u00a0 No more die in the game die in real life, no more people trapped in a game, no death plot with a string of murders; just a simple story about one woman trying to find self-confidence in herself and preventing a psychopath from committing suicide.\u00a0 What?\u00a0 Despite having a different author and different characters, Alternative still manages to be an entry of the SAO franchise by throwing in a massive curveball halfway through that hurts the overall product as a result.\u00a0 It's because of this that Alternative shoots itself in the foot and ends up with an easily predictable outcome that does kill the suspense of the climax the closer it gets to it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, Alternative still manages to be a massively entertaining show, bringing forth the largely unexplored world of GGO and providing gunfight scenes in a battle royale scenario that're focused more on tactics and skill rather than running in with a lightsaber and cutting down hordes of mook players.\u00a0 The gunfights for the most part feel exciting and it was way more fun seeing LLENN and her comrades fight using as many resources as they could, manipulate game mechanics, all in the name of coming out on top.\u00a0 Admittedly there are certain moments that I fail to understand the logic behind (What the actual hell happened in Ep. 11), but the fights are definitely exciting and it's nice to see the world of GGO get more depth as to how the FPSVRMMOVG works, as details like that were absent in the original.\\n\\n\r\nAlternative is a definite improvement over the original in terms of story content.\u00a0 The plot is simple and doesn't have ridiculously high stakes so things are grounded, and the fight scenes are much so the action feels tense and smarter, as tactics play a big part.\u00a0 Not only that, but the divide of \"Game\" and \"The Real World\" come up quite often, which is a plus since its parent series never seemed to put much emphasis on that divide till much, much later.\u00a0 However, its flaws with plot predictability, weird curveball in the middle, and a bunch of strange plot progression choices do leave some things to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Smaller scale makes for more personalized story\\n\r\n+ Very nicely tactical fights\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Weird plot points sometimes\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Obviously predictable at times\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nKohiruimaki Karen, or LLENN, is a character who despite being the protagonist, doesn't really get the attention I think she deserves.\u00a0 As someone who has anxiety as a result of being too tall for her age and sex, her escape to GGO builds up her confidence over the course of the series, which translates to the real world as LLENN starts to bleed into her personality.\u00a0 That being said, Karen doesn't really get the level of development that I would've preferred, as though she's the protagonist, she's thrown to the wayside in the second half in favor for development of showing off the series's antagonist, a choice that while helps develop the other side, hurts Karen by having a character arc that plateaus.\u00a0 The show does make up for this by giving Karen a lot of personality when she gets screentime, and that does actually make up a fair chunk of what she ultimately misses out on development.\\n\\n\r\nOn the opposite side is our antagonistic character, Pitohui, who is (in layman terms) FUCKING INSANE.\u00a0 And I love it.\u00a0 First seen as a more eccentric character, Pito's madness with her personality slowly feeds itself into the series, maxing out at the climax to give us a level of sadistic bliss that, while terrifying, really explodes with the amount of character she has.\u00a0 Her obsession with death is the cornerstone of her personality, and Alternative goes to great lengths in order to show this.\u00a0 This, coupled with her desire to have a no holds barred fight against Karen makes for such a nice rivalry that the show used for a brutal climax that felt more impactful than it honestly should've been.\u00a0 (Though I suppose e-sports does get pretty hype.)\\n\\n\r\nSide characters are an interesting bunch.\u00a0 Alternative's side cast includes an entire team of players that goes by the name SHINC, Pito's lackey, M, and Karen's friend, Fuka, who got her into VR.\u00a0 Rather than character development, these characters have personality, enriching the cast by their interactions with Karen and overall contribution to the story.\u00a0 Other characters matter less, as they're mostly mook teams for the battle royale, and get less attention as a result.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Fun cast\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Karen gets thrown to the wayside in the second half\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nFor once we have an entry of the SAO series was not produced by A-1 pictures, and as such, we don't have the usual shine and shimmer that came with the beautiful world of Aincrad once upon a time.\u00a0 In the hands of Studio 3Hz, known for Sora no Method and Flip Flappers, Alternative in simple terms, is a watered down version of the SAO artstyle.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the show is average, and the usually muddy world of GGO that was previously established doesn't leave much to be desired.\u00a0 This however is counteracted by the different arenas used in the battle royales, which give us different environments in one giant stage that ups the diversity we get with the show's colors and backgrounds.\u00a0 Exceptions include the detail of the guns used on closeup (and there are a lot of guns), as well as a face shot for any character who's down sniping.\u00a0 Because these still look objectively better than everything else.\\n\\n\r\nI think the real star though is the animation.\u00a0 It's not sakuga, but the action is so quick with the rapid bouts of gunfire from Karen's P-90 and the unusually massive amount of brutality with the combatants fighting up close that I thought at times it was better than most of the swordfights from SAO.\u00a0 The show is constant action from the plot consisting of two battle royales stacked back to back, and while the art is nothing to write home about, just seeing what was happening and moving on screen was really exciting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+\u00a0 AMAZING ACTION\\n\r\n+/- Average art quality\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nEir Aoi's \"Ryuusei\" is a perfect representation of the series, a moderate tempo that slowly builds up to a drop that echoes the amount of fighting and action that occurs in this series.\u00a0 It's very SAO sounding, and its high energy prepares the audience for what's to come and actually rivals in quality with any of the OPs that its parent had.\u00a0 By comparison, we have\u00a0\"To see the future\", sung by Karen's VA, which is by comparison less energy and a lot...happier.\u00a0 It's a weird counterpart to the OP that would feel out of place if it wasn't for Karen wanting to have a cute avatar to rival her stature in the real world.\u00a0 It's not a bad piece, it just feels out of place, especially when presented after a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI think SAO has been beaten enough.\u00a0 After the franchise had its first season, its raved popularity was then subjected to abuse for both the series and those who liked it because its protagonist of a blank slate with plot armor and unfulfilled world building left it to critical criticism that while deserved for its less than stellar aspects, is not nearly as bad as what so many people make it out to be.\u00a0 (There are worse things out there, people.)\u00a0 As such, when Alternative was announced, I prayed, hoped that this would be a redemption the series desperately needed and that people would let up on beating one of the most influential series of the 2010 era.\\n\\n\r\nAnd THANK GOD IT WAS.\u00a0 Alternative while still bearing a lot of traits that is commonly seen with the rest of the SAO series, was exciting to watch and had so many things about it that makes me feel happy that for once, people actually praise an entry of the SAO series.\u00a0 Its mix of personality and action gave it its own identity, and as someone who is a fan of more tactical fights than two powers duking it out with massive power spikes, I found myself invested in the loadouts and strategies the characters' used, which made the series all the more exciting to me.\u00a0 Like seriously, these people manipulated the game's mechanics.\u00a0 All Kazuto did back in GGO was run headfirst and lightsaber deflect stormtrooper aim and hack into the mainframe to basically 'cheat the system'.\\n\\n\r\nAs a recommendation, this show is definitely worth the price of admission.\u00a0 It takes SAO and (for lack of better phrasing), actually makes it objectively good.\u00a0 The irony of this is the fact that a completely different author and not the original creator is pretty much the sole reason why Alternative trumps the original, but if that makes the series better, than that's a necessary evil that has to be done.",

            "content": "As someone who dropped SAO for various reasons, watching this was a refreshing return to the SAO universe, as a sort of \"reboot\" or rather spin-off in the same universe. \r\nI won't get into the faults of the original SAO, but this stand rightly on its own as being entertaining and extremely watchable. While not really a masterpiece in any sort of standard it does an outstanding job in characters, plot and animation. \r\nI think the thing about this is that its refreshing for action series and the SAO universe. The stakes at going in are very low and remain low which allows the charactersand the watcher to have fun and enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really that has been the problem with every single almost every MMO-Game anime ( the exception being Log Horizon) is that it becomes way too serious for its subject matter, missing the point entirely of games and the sort of characters and reasoning people get into games. \\n\\n\r\nAs such this is very much enjoyable. Seeing LLEN kick ass, M being super strategic, PITOU be crazy, The determination of SHINC and their eventual alter identities is enjoyable and watchable. \\n\\n\r\nI would best compare to this to Railgun in being a side story that performs overall better than the main story, becuase it doesn't carry any of that baggage of a serious story or world changing plot. Instead, it can be fun and have fun. \\n\\n\r\nI am writing this review however to just warn this is a very front loaded show. The quality definitely drops towards the end episode but not the last episode. Its certainly annoying studios do this but overall its still a fun ride at that point to continue. \\n\\n\r\nThere are plot holes as well littered about and some pretty obvious reveals. However I think this anime is unique enough in various aspects to overlook those flaws.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online is not a \"best series\" but it caught a lot of people's attention because it's concept. An Anime that built on a \"dreamed\" game, where you can interact with the game's object with your own (virtual) body. This time it's back as a spin-offs which is written by another writer, Keiichi Sigsawa. This writer, which is famously known for his in-depth on character (as seen on few of his old works) is trying to make his own story in the dreamed game universe.\r\nIt is very clear to me, that he is really depending on the character. There is a rather shy girlwho has height-complex, a cheerful game-nerd girl, etc (avoiding spoilers hmm) basically, every main character in the anime has a reasonable backgrounds on how they behave and how is their personality (though, somtimes it's little bit..er.. cringe), which is a complete opposite from the original series. Well, I just liked how it is. Yet, i was forced to like this series even more because of the art/visual.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, there are nothing special about the art. The urban game part has it's \"urban game vibe\" The peaceful life has it's \"peaceful vibe\" and that is abseloutely normal. Now, Modern UI of the games are one of the reason why i liked SAO its adding even more interest in the dreamed game, though it didn't appear so much in this anime. That two is not the reason why i liked the art. So, why is it then? Well, it's just the character design, they really did good work making a cute lil' girl :P\\n\\n\r\nDespite how i liked the characters and it's cuteNkawaii design, the story is meh.. Honestly saying, it is indeed hard to think of an idea in a battle royale setting. If i try to think of an idea, i'd definitely stuck with this one or similiar one. (well, it's not like im good at making stories lol) The ultimate story of Character A trying to overpower Character B for B-kun sake is something that you'd see anywhere, So it is \"meh\". Though, the little bit of character complexity is pretty good additional for the generic story. The thing is, if indeed battle-royale setting stories idea are very limited then it is better try not to make one. SAO universe is very-very big, it's not like there is only 1-3 games there must be a lot more. Even if it's trying to follow up the trends, isn't it possible to make other kind of BR games? (Though it probably would get rid of the SAO aspect little bit.)\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the sound. Im not a gun nerd. So i can't comment on that, but i trusts the studio with it. But the OST... It is like they are trying to promote ReoNA (Kanzaki Elsa's singing voice) very hardly. They be like \"Epic Scene? put Elsa. Peaceful Scene? Put Elsa.\" Though, it is indeed that she is talented so it's completely understandable.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it. \\n\r\nOverall it's a pretty good works from the gun-nerd to cover up original sword art online poor character development. I want to put lower score, but cuz of my enjoyment, i'd raise it a point.\\n\r\n8/10.",

            "content": "Once upon a time there was an anime called Sword Art Online. I never watched it, except for, like, a few minutes of it and never really picking it up again. It looked kind of generic. Bland male protagonist, hot looking love interest, a bunch of other cute girls that don't really stand a chance. Didn't really stand out.\r\nBut this anime has a 6 foot tall college girl masquerading as a less than 5 foot tall loli dressed in pink fighting in a battle royale video game with a just as pink P90. Now Sword Art Online has my attention.\r\nSAO Alternative doesn't really stand outin terms of its plot. Like JoJo Season 1, it's a very straightforward plot: \"Pink Loli plays Fortnite\". A few sideplots show up, including a major one where a character is trying to replicate the \"People Die If They Are Killed\" mechanic, and a minor one where she meets a few school girls who have the opposite height complex as she does, but it often takes a side line to the main one where its just her and the friends she meets along the way playing the game. \\n\r\nIt doesn't have a complex story like Fate/Zero and Code Geass with five million plot threads and character arcs that wrap together nicely, but many anime, including its bigger cousin, try to replicate that and fail. GGO thankfully sticks to its guns (pun intended) and tells a simple, yet entertaining story.\\n\\n\r\nIt's animation doesn't stand out either, though several key scenes do look pretty good, not to the point of \"sakugasm\", but pretty damn good. The soundtrack is also pretty good, but not \"I'm gonna go listen to this on repeat ad nauseum\" good. \\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this series is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. We live in an age of anime that can't decide whether to be goofy or serious, which is one of the big gripes I have with Darling in the Franxx. Sure, SJ2 does introduce a pseudo-antagonist, but it rarely negates from its little goofy tone it has going. Even when it does take itself kind of seriously, it's in a very nonchalant way and doesn't hesitate to crack a joke when it starts getting a little grim. I mean, the anticlimax ending of SJ2 would have baffled me in some anime, but in this one, I laughed my ass off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a simple, yet effective anime that may not blow your mind, but it will leave a dumb smile on your face.\\n",

With the polish from what you expect from SAO but a story that doesn\u2019t make me want to tear my hair out with pacing issues. That said that doesn\u2019t mean the show is great, it\u2019s good enough for a SAO show. But forwhat it is, I enjoyed it. And maybe you would too!\\n\\n\r\nSo with Kirito and his harem out of the fucking way, who\u2019s going to replace him? Introducing Karen, better known as LLEN. A girl who has a complex about her height, she being 1.83m tall has always been ostracized for being an outlier and therefore has been having trouble with making friends. This doesn\u2019t work wonders for her confidence so she strives for a new body. Something cute, something smaller. After hopping VR games in the hope that the RNG gods give her her desired body she came to GGO. Where she plays as a chibi. Less than 1.50m in height donned in pink. Combine that with a pink P-90 and she is all ready for rushing B for the motherland. In GGO she meets Pitohui, a woman who has issues. She is known for her sadistic fighting style and personality. And doesn\u2019t fret to threaten to kill in real life if she doesn\u2019t get what she wants in GGO. She takes on the role of LLEN\u2019s teacher/friend before she actually learns the game, after a huge misunderstanding on her part. Deeming LLEN as a huge monster killing other players for fun. With Squad Jam on the horizon we won\u2019t know will happen, but it\u2019ll probably end with LLEN murdering everyone, cause P-90\u2019s are OP as fuck and require no skill.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing worth noting, it\u2019s serves it\u2019s purpose and that is keeping you watching. It does profit from the world building already done in SAO. So there is less time wasted letting you know the world and dropping you right into it. Which is fine by me, there is an improvement compared to the main SAO anime, the pacing is actually coherent. And everything is easy to follow, making the binge ability of this show pretty high.\\n\\n\r\nThe new cast, jokes aside is actually pretty good. The main character LLEN is adorable, and the chibi style character really suits her personality. Her uncertainty is something we all experience in life, so she is relatable to some degree. The other members of the cast is also very solid. We got all different types, from M a hunk of meat armed with a sniper rifle. Who may surprise you later down the road, Pitohui for the people who like psycho girls. (I know you guys are out there) and another chibi character by the name of Fuka. A real life friend of Karen, armed with 2 grenade launchers. What\u2019s really enjoyable in these characters is that they all have their unique charm and personalities. The side characters are also there, but they are in comparison to the main cast rather plain. The relationships between the characters is nothing special, what is special is LLEN\u2019s relationship with Pitohui. It\u2019s a friendly rivalry but at the same time not. LLEN goes so far that she promises to kill Pitohui in GGO, otherwise terrible stuff is going to happen in real life. This dynamic is certainly interesting, and it\u2019s also the driving force off the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great, I at first was rather scared to hear that Studio 3hz is going to handle the animation, cause I\u2019ve never watched their works before. But I was pleased to see that it\u2019s still the same polish I\u2019ve come to expect from SAO. The action scenes are fluid, movement is dynamic and doesn\u2019t feel floaty. Plus the use of tricks is minimal, with no cut outs, camera shaking and the likes. The art style is still the same one from the main series. Sharp and polished. The backgrounds are magnificent, capturing the desolate wasteland of GGO perfectly. Overall I\u2019m really happy with how the show looks, and props to Studio 3hz for capturing the feel of SAO magnificently!\\n\\n\r\nPEW PEW RATATATATA BOOM. That\u2019s basically the sound of GGO. The individual gun sounds are good, but mixed into the battlefield and they become a mess, reminding me off a round of Red Orchestra where my ass is getting suppressed by MGs. This is both a plus and a downside, as you won\u2019t be able to pay as much attention to the quality of the individual gun sounds, but at the same time it captures the chaos of battle perfectly. The other sounds are normal, but polished to an extend. The OST is lacking, apart from the opening performed by Eir Aoi. Which I thought was LiSa for a second. The ending is alright, but still not catchy enough to be able to be stuck in your head for the rest of the day. That\u2019s the main gripe with the OST. It simply isn\u2019t memorable, and will be forgotten very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe verdict? Go watch it, it\u2019s a great point to start if you hate the SAO franchise and have been derailed with the franchise. For the fans it\u2019s more off the same stuff, with more polish and improvements in general. And to be honest, I hope this gets a season 2. As it\u2019s better than the main show. But at this point, everything is better than the main show. \\n",

            "content": "As LENN said herself, \"this isn't Sword Art Online\", comparing the spin-off with the original SAO is just like comparing apple with orange. As a result, while we cannot let the personal enjoyment blinds our evaluation, it would be unfair to review this series with the mentality of the original stories.\r\nSAOA tells a story about Karen,  a girl who is ... Well, I don't want to spoil too much and you guys probably read the descriptions somewhere already so I will skip the summary and start with the review.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nAs I said, we just cannot compare SAOA with SAO especially about the story. Whileboth happens in a same universe, the latter focus on a story-telling based anime. Anyway, it is just part of a bigger story so what else we could expect. Whether the original version is good or bad is up to your taste. On the other hand, SAOA focus on a world where gun-enthusiasts could live. Everything is about guns, strategy, battle tactics, etc. Regarding that aspect, the anime did a great job describing every single gun showed along the story, proper tactic for their users as well as how people create synergy within the squad. That being said, the story itself is a disappointment. There are many holes in the story that you even need a mentally ill character to help it works out. Our main character is obviously inexperience with the game so she has been buffed with just a little bit of speed to the point that it is impossible to shoot her while she is running, otherwise she could have been killed from the very beginning. To be fair, the story follow the spin off so the story has already been written long before. Other than that, the story is fine enough to follow, to give a comparison, the plot is just as typical as some popular FPS like Call of Duty.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI won't discuss anything about technical part of art since I don't know anything about it. However, I would like to comment on the design of the guns, shooting scenes. The guns detail is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED songs are great. Not even a surprise from Eir Aoi. However, the sound effect during the episodes are just normal, normally they can help intensify your emotions during the scene, but in this case, I don't feel that much from them. The sounds effect during battle scene are not on par with the design of the scene themselves. At least, it doesn't make me feel unpleasant or disturbed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are well built, we can clearly see the motivation of Karen - LENN, why she did what she did. Her obsessed with height is also well established in the show. Her friend Miyu doesn't have much screen time during the first 6 episodes so I cant say much about her. Goushi - M is also fine but there is not much to say about him. The one I want to mention the most is Pitohui. As first glance, she seems to be an interesting character. She is mysterious, her motivation is unknown, she makes me feel want to know more about her. However, the plot drive her to the point of a wicked woman who despise life and always try to find a way to put her life on the line. It is a big gap between what she used to be in the first 4 episodes and what she is said to be now. At least, some details about her past could be useful to let the audience understand her obsesses. On a side note, I don't understand M thought about her as well. There could be plenty of things to do for Pitohou in the position of M but he choose to follow her to the end. Even worst, he can't himself help her but go to LENN for her help. That is enough to raise some questions about him. Should one call him a coward or is his action based on his love?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nStill, with all the high and low, as a game freak, I enjoy the series a lot. There are many potential for game based anime that could has been done like SAOA where the realistic feature of the game is aesthetically shown. While there are hole which is somewhat a pity, they are not much of a problem to ignore and focus on the main selling point of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "Although bearing the title of SAO, Gun Gale Online's spinoff does not deserve the negative representation that is synonymous with the SAO series. This series has its flaws, but the story moves in a direction that is not like the original series, and is actually comprehensible.\r\nStory: Although not completely done well, this series does handle its story in a way that you can actually follow, although at the moment it is fairly bare in story. The show's main focus is on the character battles rather than the story, which does work, but makes any attachment to characters become limited. Compared to the main series, thestory is executed much better, although it is more bare-bones than the original SAO is. That doesn't make it bad, but it also doesn't make the series stand out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art in this show usually is very good, and fight scenes are animated smoothly. However, what happens is with the background characters and whenever something doesn't need much attention, the lack of detail does become apparent. With some scenes, there are faces that are memeable due to their low quality. But besides those minor inconveniences, the art itself is not bad. Things do look brighter and much sharper than the original series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing much to say here. Voice acting is great, and things work audibly. The opening is also something that does ease you into the episode, and works very well. Hell, even the outtakes from the recap episode have some nice editing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character in this spinoff is lacking in some areas, focusing more on comedic aspects than some character quirks. LLENN/Karen is the most developed, although aside from being an understanding university student with a height complex, there isn't much else to help you piece together other stuff. Yeah, she's powerful, but why did she become powerful by killing? What was her reason? Other characters like M and Pitohui haven't been developed much as they haven't been seen outside of GGO, but after reading a bit, I did find out some things with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite this spinoff's lack of some content, it has many things I found to counterbalance the lack of info, and even that lack gives me something to enjoy. At this point, it's apparent that I like anything that I watch, and that applies to this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Besides bearing the SAO name, this doesn't share much with the main series in its content execution. I would recommend this show to others, although they should take it with a grain of salt. GGO Alternative is not a perfect anime, but looking thoroughly through the episodes, you can't find things that aren't big red flags in a poor series. In all honesty, this is better than the SAO series, especially the Phantom Bullet arc. So, with that done, go out there and have fun with this spinoff!",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]\r\nRather than writing a traditional start-to-finish review of the entire show, I\u2019m going to show you my actual notes I took as I watched this show. Usually these become the basis for a full review as I preen the paragraphs to root out fluff and hyperbole, but this time I'm pasting my raw notes divided into 3 acts. That way, you\u2019ll know exactly what it\u2019s like watching the maddening stumble from genuinely good character study revolving around player-character dissonance; to plot-hole ridden, horribly characterized, nonsensically stupid shit-show that is Sword Art Online Gun Gale Online Alternative.\r\n (there's a TL;DR at the endif you just want a summary or want to avoid spoilers)\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Sword Art Online Gun Gale Online Alternative Architecture 3.33 You Can (Not) Kirito superior to everything else in the franchise boils down to mainly 2 things:\\n\\n\r\n1. The main character is not a harem master like Kirito that always wins out in the end and is the best at everything. Kirito is the king of all Mary Sue characters because he never loses, never struggles for more than a few minutes, and has all the underage girls riding his jock. He is an unbearable main character I always rooted against. He has nothing going for him, he's a boring skinny white boy, and he seemingly has never had to work hard to accomplish anything in his spoiled little life.\\n\\n\r\nWhat sets Karen apart, however, is that she actually seems to have things she doesn't like going on in her life. Specifically, she's developed a complex due to her height. Karen is unusually tall, and just as little shithead kids do, her classmates make fun of her and treat her like a freak. It isn't much, but this goes a long way in making sure she isn't a soulless protagonist like Kirito. Her in-game avatar reflects the dissonance between who she is outside the game and who she wants to be, realized inside the game. It's unusual for Sword Art Online to attempt to tell a story deeper than \"mary sues fight the evil guys\", so this is a very refreshing change. (if only I knew what was to come\u2026)\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, I wasn't bothered as much when Karen became one of the best players in the game in what felt like a couple days. I don't care! It's about context in this case, and not having Kirito around to pander to the babies that like power fantasies made the journey far more tolerable.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in SAO seasons 1, 2, and the movie are basically your most boring Facebook friends. I found it really hard to care about any of them, as their bland personalities kind of all felt the same and none of them were really any fun to watch. Karen on the other hand is actually pretty entertaining. She's upbeat, expressive, and silly. She breathes life into what is otherwise a rather generic story. It's even better considering her online behavior is basically the opposite of who she is outside the game. In the real world, she's anxious, reclusive, and quiet. Online, she's bubbly, loud, and extremely flamboyant. It's another nice way of showing how Karen is able to express herself online in ways that she's unable to in real life.\\n\\n\r\n2. This plays off the previous point, but SAO GGO Alternate constantly toys with the concept of online-irl disconnect.\\n\\n\r\nAlso on the topic of analyzing the playstyles and in-game lifestyles of players, it also discusses the illusion of skill in online games. The conversation between Karen and skinny wetsuit boob lady about the aiming circle was interesting, partially because it implies there isn't one way to play the game. More importantly, it isn't done in a way that might lead you to believe the writing staff is a bunch of middle schoolers, like having one player use a fucking sword in a shooter. So god damn stupid. It further reminds the viewer that while it may try to convince you the drama and shooting in the game feels real, it's ultimately just a simulation that's gone through rigorous play-testing to feel as real as possible. You aren't a skilled shooter because you can shoot people accurately in game. It's a fantasy, and SAO GGO Alternative's commitment to separating the two is absolutely fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nSeasons 1 and 2 and the movie seemed to think that just making Kirito good at everything constituted good character writing but he lives a fantasy both inside and outside of the game. Nothing about him is grounded in the reality of the universe he lives in (impeccable charisma, irl harem master), or the games he plays (always wins, is always the hero). GGO Alternate's subversion of a consistent problem its predecessors had is mind-boggling, as this show nails it and it's a fucking spin-off.\\n\\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Karen is the best character in the entire franchise. she wins too easily, which appears to just be mandatory for SAO protagonists, but overall she's the only character that I feel any emotion from. You know, other than irritation, loathing, or boredom.\\n\\n\r\nEPISODE 5: IT BEGINS\\n\\n\r\nWhy can her gun talk? Why did her teammate lose his mind like that over pretty much nothing? What the fuck was that?\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to justify how a well-practiced player managed to miss Karen from point-blank range twice. Why did she try to shoot at Karen's head? That's the only thing that Karen can move! Also how did she miss at point-blank range if she's so good with guns she can catch a mag in the loading chamber THAT SOMEONE THREW AT HER?\\n\\n\r\nI guess at episode 5 it suddenly remembers its SAO and starts throwing in all the bad writing and schlock that characterized the first 3 entries in the franchise. I mean this is getting REALLY stupid, REALLY fast.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like that cover thing is kinda broken. if that dude can just wear an invincible shield, then everyone would use one. It would basically neutralize any bullets that aren't extremely high-caliber. As a result, no one would use lower-caliber bullets, and everyone would run around with high-caliber rifles. After all, why bother with a pistol when it can't pierce anyone's chest? You'd have to be a headshot master. In which, case snipers would rule. That shield thing really shouldn't have made it past playtesting. it would've fucked up balance within a couple matches. He didn't say anything about it making the user unusually slow or it being very heavy so it makes their carrying capacity lower to give it an associated trade-off, so I have to assume it\u2019s a totally broken mobile bulletproof shield.\\n\\n\r\nEPISODES 10-12: CRESCENDO OF MADNESS\\n\\n\r\nIf Shino took damage from blood loss after losing her hands, why didn't Pito take blood loss damage from getting shot in the head? What kind of fucking sense does that make? Are you telling me that if you're shot in the head and magically survive with 1 hp left, you don't take blood loss significant enough to kill you within 5 minutes? Yet Shino lost a quarter of her health within 1 to 2 minutes. And don't tell me it's because her foot and hands were shot off. You can survive longer without your hands and feet than you can if someone punches a bullet sized hole through the middle of your skull. So do you only take blood loss damage if you aren't shot in the head? Isn't the idea behind that that you would just die instantly rather than bleeding out? If your hands and feet are shot off, you'd die of blood loss but the rest of your body can still function. If you're shot in the head, uh you still bleed a lot. Also it kinda severely damages the brain, which you kinda need to send signals to the rest of your body to move your muscles, breathe, and produce blood. So how does it make sense that you don't suffer from blood loss from getting shot in the head? CAN YOU SAY PLOT ARMOR?\\n\\n\r\nWHAT IS WITH THE TALKING GUN AND WHY DOES IT ONLY HAPPEN IN 3 EPISODES? ALSO WHY DO MULTIPLE GUNS THAT ONLY KAREN USES TALK? WHAT???\\n\\n\r\nEvery other character we've seen get shot in the head died pretty much instantly. Pito surviving that is the definition of plot armor.\\n\\n\r\nI guess if you have a villain that's crazy for no reason, you can justify them destroying their own vehicle by saying \"well, they're crazy.\" That's not a valid defense! There's no logic behind anything she does! Pito is a villain that is a villain because the writers said she was a villain. Nothing she does makes her evil. She didn't actually kill anyone like the guy from SAO 1 did (he was at least responsible for every death even if he didn't kill anyone directly). She just said she would. If she was actually that crazy, she probably would have murdered several people irl by now. Why would she wait until now and hinge it on the outcome of a tournament? Because the plot says that is what happens. It doesn't make sense and nothing she does is motivated by anything because her character has zero development.\\n\\n\r\nEverything we know about her is told to us rather than shown. I haven't seen her do anything that I'd call evil. Killing her allies in a game isn't evil. It's stupid, but there's no crime being committed. Her character is a complete shitshow of bad writing, bad plot structure, bad storytelling, and hackneyed tropes that only seem to rear their head when a poorly thought out villain is in play.\\n\\n\r\nAlso at around 16:48 (I apparently forgot to note which episode, but its almost certainly episode 11 or 12), Shino is shown to have recovered nearly all her health despite losing ALL OF HER HANDS AND FEET. HOW THE FUCK DID THAT HAPPEN?\\n\\n\r\nWhy would you lose HP when you're lying in water not deep enough to even cover your ears? Is the water full of flesh-eating parasites??\\n\\n\r\nOH MY GOD HER FUCKING TALKING GUN BLEW UP IN THE ENEMY'S HANDS TO PROTECT HER. IT IS SENTIENT, CAN TALK, AND CAN BLOW ITSELF UP TO PROTECT ITS USER. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\n\\n\r\nThe main character's talking gun blows itself up in its enemy's hand so Pito can't shoot Karen with it. This is obviously retarded. It's also never explained. This show just has a sentient talking gun and doesn't think to explain it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no deeper reason for Pito being crazy. She just is that way. Usually in a show that wasn't written by a bunch of chimpanzees, there's some event from the character's past or childhood that traumatized them and made the way they are. This is not so for Pito. The writers couldn't be bothered to even do that much.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, everyone and their mom could have guessed who Pito was outside the game. It was too obvious.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nTL;DR: SAO GGO A is bad. But, the first 4 episodes are genuinely good. Watch the first 4 episodes and then bail.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 1-4: 7/10\\n\r\nEpisodes 5-9: 4/10\\n\r\nEpisodes 10-12: 1/10\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n",

            "content": "First of all, am I the only one who thinks that this anime is the reason for the huge CS:GO update we got?\r\nIt's been a while since this show aired and due to the large amount of anime that aired during the Spring of 2018, this show went under the radar for me and for a lot of people. I finally watched it and I'm writing this review because well.. more people need to know about this show.\r\nWhile I never hated the original SAO, I never liked it much either, it was alright. It had really good sound, art and animation (due to the amazingpeople at A-1) but it fell flat in story, reasoning and most of all character writing. This show is the total opposite of the original SAO. SAO Alternative aka GGO, has well written characters with clear and relatable motivations that carry the show. The story is not a deep, soul searching kind, the show isn't trying to be that though, it straight up makes fun of itself when the show tries to be serious. It's self aware, like really self aware. To the point that they even added the author of the light novel in the show and even some shots were fired to the original author of SAO. Having said that, in the department of art, sound and animation it is a bit lacking. Especially if you compare it to the original show.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe not the deepest, not the prettiest or not the best sounding anime, but man is it fun. The cast is so quirky and loveable, and I can relate to most of them. The idea of escapism through videogames is expressed well, and anyone who is into the world of gaming can probably connect to this show. Heck I really want to play GGO after watching this. I won't go into detail about the videogame aspect but lets say it follows the rules of the gaming world well, and way better than the bullshit we got in SAO.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all that, I still can't pinpoint the reason why I enjoyed this show so much. It ended up being the funnest show I have watched in a while. I don't think its for everyone but if you're looking for a simple fun ride, you should check it out, especially if you're into the world of gaming.\\n\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "\u26a0 WARNING: This review contains spoilers. I recommend reading it only AFTER watching the anime \u26a0\r\n__________________\r\nSword Art Online is a show full of missed opportunities. It is a show with an amazing premise, which only lead to an undeveloped plot, and shallow characters. And this is coming from a fan who got into it as a teenager, for the exact same reasons why it became popular: Because it presented a world away from the boring every day life, a virtual game in which you get stuck inside of, not being able to be forced back into that boring life. It's just that the writer, KawaharaReki, did not know how to build the world of SAO. Even after 2 seasons and a movie.\\n\r\nAnd as time went on, this became more and more apparent, as I grew out of the fantasy craze, and hundreds of videos criticizing SAO's every detail were made.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings us to Sword Art Online: Alternative Gun Gale Online.\\n\\n\r\n__________________\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize it as quickly as possible, Alternative Gun Gale Online is a spinoff set in the world of Gun Gale Online that was featured in SAO Season 2's Phantom Bullet arc, featuring a completely different cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nWritten by Sigsawa Keiichi, who is a far more experienced light novel author, it keeps SAO's core idea, as Mother's Basement nicely put it, \"the idea that the relationships and interactions in the virtual world are just as valuable as the ones in the real world\", but explores it through unorthodox but interesting methods.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, it uses parody, basically calling out SAO's poor development. \\n\r\nThis is done primarily through the characters, more specifically, our main character, Kohiruimaki Karen, who serves as a voice of reason, and essentially represents us, the viewers. For one, her background, while not very relatable, essentially boils down to escapism, which is definitely one of the reasons many of us play games to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nBut more importantly, Karen criticizes other characters and their actions.\\n\r\nWe have our other main character Pitohui, who is depressed and suicidal that she missed out on SAO, and wants to die in GGO to make up for it. And then you have M, her friend, who tries to prevent this.\\n\r\nIn the regular SAO series, this would have been used as a plot point for Kirito to go and prevent this obviously serious situation, teach us that people die when they are killed, and that he is awesome.\\n\r\nBut instead, Sigsawa Keiichi uses Karen to complain how insane and ludicrous both Pito and M, the classic SAO characters, are, constantly repeating two main things: \"This is just a game\", \"and this is not Sword Art Online\". Using Karen to represent us viewers complaining about SAO is honestly the most brilliant and badass part of this show.\\n\r\nKeiichi basically asked for permission to write a spinoff, wrote a better story than the original, and then starting calling out Kawahara for writing a bad story. What an absolute mad lad!\\n\\n\r\nNow, secondly, Alternative GGO makes sure NEVER to take itself too seriously, in contrast with the original, which took itself waaaay too seriously, to the point of cringe and edginess.\\n\r\nSo Alternative GGO makes sure to introduce comedic moments are the most inappropriate moments to remind us that \"this is just a game\". And all the humor is very fresh and modern, and flows nicely with the rest of the show, no matter if we're in the middle of an action scene, standoff, or a quiet, melancholic remembrance.\\n\\n\r\n__________________\\n\\n\r\nAside from using SAO's core theme, Alternative GGO's second main focus is on the game of GGO itself. Unlike SAO, which feels more like a fantasy anime akin to GATE, and the fact that they are in a video game is only used as a plot point, Alternative GGO presents the world of GGO like we would experience it today. Heck, I'd say that the game parts of the anime might as well be a livestream on Twitch in 2018. Player interactions outside of battles are hilarious and immature, much like what game lobbies and chats are like, and during the battles, there is actual strategy. It's clearly an anime more aimed at older gamers, and at the state of gaming in 2018 and does the job of presenting them with something they want real well.\\n\\n\r\nNow, plot, characters, and themes aside, I just want to touch on to the animations and sound, since this is where I've seen the show being criticized, and is where it really lacks, at least compared to previous SAO seasons. \\n\r\nThe animation itself is just fine, and fights have proper movement and choreography, instead of a bunch of people just swinging swords around quickly with wild camera angles. But it does definitely feel less smooth, like you're playing a game with frequent framerate drops. It's not something that will take you out of the experience, but it is noticeable.\\n\r\nAs for the sound, there is nothing wrong with it. And that's really the issue. SAO is known for its wide variety for sound effects. Every sword clash sounds slightly different, depending on how hard it was swung, and which sword it contacted, etc. Same with various other sound effects. Alternative GGO does reuse a lot of the sound effects multiple times, which is perfectly normal and expected, and you do get to hear the satisfying sound of the P-90, but that's just not enough compared to SAO. Not a big takeaway, but again, noticeable.\\n\\n\r\n__________________\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Alternative Gun Gale Online is a big success for Keiichi. He not only managed to realize the core idea of SAO without completely failing his story and characters, he managed to do it in an interesting manner, and simultaneously, present us with a show that is fun to watch. No serious drama, threat of death, edgy dark situations, etc, etc, just pure gun mania fun. I am absolutely impressed and personally, absolutely love it and adore it! And I hope all of you felt the same.",

            "content": "Very fun to watch. Action is great, very creative use of mechanics. Similar to original SAO, the protagonist and her companions starts off overpowered. There isn't much ways around it, the anime is too short to build abilities anyway. The mechanics and action combine well. And it certainly feels like a game.\r\nDefinitely feels like a masterpiece in terms of action. Probably the only thing keeping it back is the story. There are some loose ends that were never tied up. Like whether LLENN got over her complex. The story is about as believeable as SAO i suppose. But then again the focus of this animewas never really on story.\\n\\n\r\nA few things I want to point out in terms of details. \\n\\n\r\n- It was a dumb mechanic but I'm glad the scan terminal was treated like a bug and patched in SJ2. I watched competitive games for a bit and this was definitely exactly what it's like. Possibly game-breaking exploit discovered -> patch. Funny how they never found it prior but then again there were only 3 BoBs. \\n\\n\r\n- The name of Pitohui and M's team is PM4. P and M stand for Pitohui and M of course. In the anime, LLENN mentions the significance of the 4 and i think it might be lost in translation so here is my interpretation, in my own language: in Chinese, 4 is an unlucky number because it rhymes with the word for die. It's a thing and some people do mind enough to make changes to their house numbers to make it sound more auspicious.",

            "content": "WhenI first saw and heard of SAO Alternative, I didn't expect much. The premise I saw at face value seemed entertaining to say the least, but something that I'd only find minimal enjoyment out of. A pink loli running around in a game like Gun Gale Online seemed like it was just going to be heavy handed comedy on the main character's cuteness that juxtaposed to the serious vibe of the game. I got something entirely different though.\r\nI'll be quick about what I like and dislike about the anime\r\nPROS:\r\n-BETTER THAN SAO. For those of you who've seen it, yes that's a very (very very very)low bar, but it's better nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\n-You don't need to know about or watch the cannon SAO. This anime, despite being seen as a spinoff, has almost nothing to do with SAO besides being based in the same world and having a few one off references to the old protagonists. \\n\\n\r\n-The characters are relatable. In this spinoff we follow a college student named Karen who has a height complex and plays as a cute small character in GGO to help alleviate it. As somewhat boring it may sound at face value, it's very down to earth as to why people play video games in the first place. This theme follows through with every other character in one way or another. They're in this game to express themselves in ways they just couldn't do in the real world one way or another.\\n\\n\r\n-The action. I was genuinely surprised how flawless some actions scenes were played out. I even had those moments where I'd rewatch them right after they just happened to get another look at it. Unlike cannon SAO, most fights in this series have some sort of methodical, analytic approach to them. There's usually a plan, and when there's no plan there's still a sense of choreography that makes the fights interesting.\\n\\n\r\n-The art. I can't say too much for the environment. It's good but not anything extremely stunning. The terrain and how it's used is the interesting, but the characters themselves just look great.\\n\\n\r\n-The Game. In cannon SAO the world of Gun Gale Online was visited but didn't feel like its own game to me. In Alternative, you actually feel like this is a game that can or could exist and you end up wanting to play it. Certain small mechanical aspects are added or expanded upon (while others that were stupid or made no sense were done away with) and it makes you actually interested in the game as a whole.\\n\\n\r\n-Funny. It's no comedy but I got a good amount of laughs from this anime. What else to expect from a cute, gun toting, pink bunny loli running around killing people. \\n\\n\r\n-No OP characters. This may be a bit bias towards my dislike for SAO's Kirito, but everyone in this anime seems beatable, even the antagonists who are shown to be super strong. All it takes is the right approach.\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\\n\r\n-Game mechanics. I mentioned this game feels like an actual game but there are certain things that happen in it that seem kind of dumb and unexplained in the anime like a scene where Karen's character LLEN is in shallow water thats like 2 inches yet loses health due to drowning damage. It doesn't tank your overall enjoyment but it's something that'll no doubt irk you if you pay attention to them.\\n\\n\r\n-The same arc is repeated twice. Again not a game changer but some might find it annoying that the anime does the same thing two times but in different ways. This game that was meant to be fun suddenly gets a life or death plot aspect to it and now the characters must accomplish something in the game to save a friend's life, instead it's just another friend the second time with even bigger stakes with no potential cop out if the protagonist fails. They don't feel that much the same but the mere presence of such a similarity might throw off some people.\\n\\n\r\n-The conclusion. Some might find the ending to be underwhelming, but keep in mind this is as much a slice of life anime than it is a shone anime. It's a story about friends helping friends and people developing new relationships that in the end help them become better people. I personally felt by the end of the anime everything was wrapped up smoothly and doesn't leave you wanting more, but in a good way wherein it leaves you satisfied at how everything played out for the characters involved in the end.\\n\\n\r\n-Karen, the main character, is by no means a gamer. She never played VR games until GGO and yet still managed to be a very skilled player. This is probably the only genuine problem I had with the anime that wasn't a nitpick. Yes she had an extremely smart companion by her side half the anime but I mean. Come on. We've all played games we're good at with less experienced/skilled friends. When was the last time anyone's been able to put their friend up to par with actual pros at such a game by just teaching them for such a short amount of time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime \"spinoff\" is a drastic improvement of cannon SAO and even holds it's own as a standalone anime. I'd only not recommend it to someone who's into romance since it's pretty much nonexistent in this anime. If not, you'll fine enjoyment out of it\\n\\n",

There were some moments of kinda bad animation, but it's balanced out by some not really good but at least above average character designs (at least for the important characters, the background characters couldn't be more generic). Everything else was just average.\r\nAnd to be honest the same goes for pretty much every other aspect of the series. The story is average, the music is average, the characters are average... Thereare only two exceptions to this:\\n\r\n-The opening is better than what we see on the show in every way: Directing, music and animation.\\n\r\n-The main character's best friend (who sadly only starts being important later in the series) is hilarious and easily the best character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAlso there's the fact the main character says SAO is a terrible game, that really was a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nBut for some reason I still enjoyed it. In the middle of all the mediocrity there were several genuinely fun and/or funny moments that made it an experience worth of my time.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I recommend watching this show, but only if you have nothing better to watch.

While in the past this franchise was about being a VR MMO police this anime goes into preventing a suicide. There is a character who was going to enter Sword Art Online but missed the release and couldn't get into the ultimate death came and decides if that person ever loses He/She decides to die. This is the idea of the whole serirs, it was rather short and was basically a single story arc instead of breaking it into 2 or 3. Anyone who enjoyed thefirst arc in the second season should watch this since it goes into Gun Gale Online. This is basically the same thing as Sword Art Online except there is no Kirito, large sense of danger, or romance. Anyone can start this show whether they have seen Sword Art Online yet or not.",

            "content": "*SPOILERS*\r\nA spin-off from SAO, SAOA:GGO is... amazing! It's not 10/10 perfect, but compared to SAO it's much better in terms of cast and story. For the first time Kirito is not the MC and thank God he isn't! There's a better MC for GGO, Llenn-chan, who's twice as savage as Kirito can ever be! I love SAOA:GGO because it's different to the usual SAO or SAO 2. Much better story and way less episodes which is good because i always find SAO a bit draggy. \r\nStory: SAOA:GGO revolves around Karen, who's critical of her tall height and is basically a shut-out from the world(she doesgo out but doesn't interact with people much except friends and family). She strives to be shorter and cuter so she decides to try out a few games but.... to no success, UNTIL GGO where she becomes the cute,short but SAVAGE Llenn! There she meets Pito(Elsa Kanzaki), M(Goushi) and a group of cute high school lolis and participate in both SJ and SJ2, winning SJ 1 but losing the 2nd one. It's a more interesting story, not the usual just all fights. There's at least some SoL moments and the fact that Llenn has to kill Pito in order to prevent her from killing herself(or something like that) makes the story very intense, especially the last 2-3 episodes where Pito and Llenn fight. Fortunately Llenn wins in the end and gets to meet the real Pito(Elsa Kanzaki). The story is very well executed and despite the anime only having 12 episodes, you don't feel that the story is rushed. It's just the right, consistent pace, which is not really seen in other action animes. And you'll always look forward to the next episode because the story gives off a cliff-hanger feeling for some episodes. \\n\r\nRating: 9.1/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I really like how they animate the whole anime, including the GGO game itself. It's not CGI(at least I hope cos it doesn't look like CGI) unlike a certain Toji anime(not that I mind it a lot), the monsters are very well animated and the scenery also. \\n\r\nRating: 8.7/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Oof the opening is lit! I mean of course it'll be lit it's sung by Eir Aoi! And the ending as well, sung by none other than Llenn. I always love anime songs that are sung by the cast. Bullet, explosion sounds are on point too!\\n\r\nRating: 8.9/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I love all the characters in general. Alright fine they still carry the OP feeling as SAO(yes Llenn, I'm looking at you), but they're not unkillable like Kirito is(yea screw Kirito). Llenn the pink loli irl is kinda aloof(until she meets the loli students) but in game she's more open to making friends like Pito and M. She's also SAVAGE in game too! Pito is.... just... SAVAGE and is a sadistic loli(her irl) who just loves to kill for fun and is not afraid to kill her own teammates too(rip M). Heng ah Llenn killed her otherwise.... idk what will happen. Maybe Pito will kill herself(COMMIT SEPPUKU jk). M is.... a masochist that's all I can say. Fuka... tbh i dont really know a lot about her. And this is where the criticism comes in. Despite the story being well-paced, there aint much character development is there? This anime is more about the story than the characters. Oh and before I forget, my fav character(most important thing) is the SAVAGE Llenn cuz she's a loli and I'm a lolicon :v.\\n\r\nRating: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, SAOA:GGO is 10x better than SAO. And I don't feel sian watching this anime unlike SAO where after like 6-7 episodes I'll be like when is the next arc it's freaking boring. I doubt they'll make a 2nd season of this cos it's a very concrete ending. I really love SAOA:GGO. \\n\\n\r\nFinal rating: 8.7/10",

Honestly, I think it would be a much more solid 8 if not for one factor: it's part of a franchise.\r\nWhile this is an enjoyable and fun standalone story, it assumes that the viewer has already watched all of SAO and is familiar with its universe. This is BY FAR the best thing that's been done within the framework of that universe, but I would say it's not really worth going back and watching both seasons of SAO just to have the context for it. I certainly wouldn't have done it if I hadn'talready.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, this was fun and well-made. If you've already seen SAO for context, I would highly recommend it (which is something I was fairly sure I would never say about an SAO spinoff). Don't expect anything too cerebral, but it's a good time.",

            "content": "You know, I was ready to dig deep into this anime and give a really in-depth review, but I actually don\u2019t have much to say about GGO as I thought I would. In terms of story, not too much happened, but it was still good. In terms of characters, there weren\u2019t too many that stood out, but the ones that did were great and there weren\u2019t any truly unlikable ones. Pitohui and LLENN carry the cast. Both of them are endlessly enjoyable to see on screen and interact with their environments and other characters. It wasn\u2019t as in-depth or character driven as either of theSAO seasons (If you can even call them in-depth and character driven) but it was still ultimately better than both. The animation was good, the soundtrack was good, the fight scenes ranged from good to great. Considering we are in a time where battle royal games are all the rage, this came out at a very appropriate time. It delivered fast paced, high action BR matches with some great gun fights that were very entertaining to watch. However, considering all the matches are just video game fun for the most part, it\u2019s not really high stakes. It\u2019s hard to get genuinely excited over the battles at times knowing it\u2019s just a game with no real stakes to it. Even when they do manage to introduce something to make the Battle Royal important, it\u2019s not very compelling. While the anime was still fun to watch, there\u2019s not a whole lot of substance to it. The final battle was awesome, but the conclusion to the last Battle Royal was very quick and underwhelming in comparison. Overall, it was still fun to watch play out. I trusted the studio to do a good job and they delivered on that. Surprisingly, Yuri undertones weren\u2019t as present as I was expecting from Studio 3Hz anime. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d deduct points for, but still something that stood out to me. \\n\r\nThe main take away from SAO Alternative though is that a spin-off managed to be better than BOTH seasons of the main series. That\u2019s both funny and sad to think about.",

The main character is obsessed about her height, but is still a total knockout, and somehow ends up in ggo because she likes that her character is short. Weirdest thing about this so far is that she is super fast just because she is small, as if compacting her size made her keep the same power and made her faster... which isnt how that works lol. Anyhow. The 3 characters wehave been introduced so far are kinda annoying. One is the main character, who i wanna throw into a vat of black so i can stop seeing all the pink, a guy who is definitely a bodyguard of some sort for the other character, a rich female pker who seems to have some agenda going on. I will probably keep watching, but whether i watch the whole season or not is up for grabs in the next episode.",

            "content": "I'm one of those anime fans that never really care about the fan favourites such as Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sword Art Online etc. And to be honest it's partly because of shows like this one that seem to keep going without a clear goal of where they want to take the story. \r\n*Spoiler Alerts are possible you've been warned*\r\nThe story is essential about a girl/woman called Karen (I hope I spelled it right) she's concious about her height in real life wanting to be a short, cute loli girl to put it simply. So she tries out many games to create the avatar shewants in another world eventually sticking with GGO (Gun Gale Online) rounds getting into two Squad Jam tournies (Squad Battle Royale) the last one tries to save a friend from committing suicide essentially. Now the story is all well and good but, there's no reason to care about what's going on partly due character development which I'll touch upon later. However, the biggest issue is pacing the show throws so many anecdotes at you in a short amount of time about the main cast that you don't really care because before you know it they're back to trying to kill each other in a tournement on Gun Gale Online. I personally feel the show needed at least 14 maybe 15 episodes to flesh out many characters backstories properly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is still the same as previous Sword Art Online shows, however, I noticed that sometimes when the characters get shot blood trickles or splatters from their body and then next second the typical red and white pixel hit marker is visible. As far as I remember Sword Art Online II didn't have this issue but, then again I haven't watched that show in years so I may be wrong. Overall though the art design for characters and scenes are solid and what you expect from a show of this standard.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNot really much I can say for the sound design as it's pretty solid stuff the syncing of gunfire and explosions were spot on down to the background sound and voice acting of the characters like before it's at the standard you expect from a show like this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters of this show is my biggest problem they're not bad but they're not good either they're just average. Some of them have back stories to flesh them out such Karen, Pitohui and M to give them a bit more character. Then arrives Fuko (I don't know how to spell her name but the main characters friend), the school girls and other characters are just meh you don' care about them as to be honest they're only there for filler. The biggest issue unless you haven't played Sword Art Online: FATAL BULLET you'll either 1) learn next to nothing about the characters except for some personal issues of some of the characters 2) learn next to nothing extra about them because you learn more about them from the game at least the main cast you do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI may have given this show a lot of flak for little things but like I said at the start it's because of these reasons that I find little to no interest in popular fan favourites on this site. As I've already seen before posting this review viewers do like this show and I don't fault there's definitely fun to be had here if you like your Sword Art Online as I did quite enjoyed it places. But it's also a show you can easily miss as in my opinion adds nothing new to the already established anime shows.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is a solid experience, however, don't expect anything new or amazing if you're a passer by viewer that dawdled like myself in the previous shows due to it's popularity. If you're a hardcore fan of the material I'm sure you'll find plenty to enjoy here.\\n",

I've currently seen all of season 1, the first part of season 2, and Alternative. I have not seen the movie or thenew series thats out but i've heard its gotta at least a tad bit better.\\n\\n\r\nAs for where i stand on the series as a whole note that i don't detest sword art online as a show in its entirety, honestly when it first came out i enjoyed the concept of it. But as i rewatched it i could see the obvious flaws in the shows and get this, i still didn't hate the show, (i know shocking isn't?). I would say i compare SAO to a show thats not similar to it in concept but in quilty, Absolute Duo. I enjoyed absolute Duo for what it was and like SAO i saw its flaws as well. But to SAO lovers dismay i'm no fanboy of the show even if i was ok with it, no quite the contrary, i disapprove of SAO's existence but for a completely differing reason. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, SAO and AOT are 2 shows that got many newcomers into anime because thats when a sort of renaissance of anime happened, but for me and others from the times of anime past it was a renaissance that would breed much mediocrity into the anime fandom. The reason i disapprove of SAO is because it is currently STILL one of the shows at the forefront of anime despite its overwhelming writing issues, its flawed design, and its continuation despite these issues. I would say it does warrant popularity because it brought forth the Isekai genre (and if anyone wants to say its not a genre i'm going to call you out as blatantly copying a current anime youtube who said as such because whether you consider it a genre or not is subjective), of which i'm a fan of when its done correctly, but that doesn't give it a pass simply for that reason. The issues of SAO being praised are basically similar to saying anything made by Illumination is a masterpiece of which for anyone with any semblance of insight knows is bullshit. \\n\\n\r\nSAOs success may have lead to the creation of more Isekais, it it also brought  with it a swarm of shows that were extremely mediocre that turned enough profit to say to the industry \"hey, we'll accept anything regardless of its quilty you throw at us\". To this day we have may issues in anime that are a result of us accepting mediocrity, not just in bad shows but also in good shows where the animators either want to \"save money\" rush the production to get it out on time, or just get lazy with writing, animation, 3D animations (i think many can see that in stuff like Berserk, Overlord, and Golden Kumey to be name a few) and other issues because they are now mass producing anime which mean quantity over quality. That's not to say that all shows suffer from this but eventually THEY COULD. THAT is why i disapprove of SAO, not because its a bad show but because by its success, we courage companies to get lazier and lazier and THEY WILL if we just allow it and keep believing the industry is working for us; the industry couldn't care less what you think of them, all they really are out for this the money and if you think people in japan give a damn about what anyone else in the world thinks of their shows you best go do some research and think again. Now if anyone still thinks for some reason that i shouldn't disapprove of SAO then go do you bo, i'm gonna get back on track now so if anyone wasn't reading the whole thing  or just doesn't care then continue to where this review says \"Story:\" and i'll get started.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe review begins here if you wish to skip my thoughts on SAO as a series as i'm sure some will want too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: I'm gonna give the story an 8/10 BECAUSE in comparison to the other parts of SAO the person who wrote this, Keiichi Sigsawa; did an excellent job with the flawed world and series he was given to work with. Unlike the other SAO arcs this one seemed a lot more relatable and realistic to be regardless of a bit of cheesiness here and there. There's no hugely grand stakes, the combat throughout the show seemed why less bullshit then SAO and its conclusion was sort of hinted at early on but was in no way one of the worst ones i've seen in a while, in fact one of the better ones i'd say, (i kinda want a sequel to see what happens and to improve this franchises image). Also the MCs backstory was a huge improvement but we'll get to that in the Characters section.\\n\\n\r\nArt: If there's one thing thats a constant for SAO, it's that the art and battle scenes almost always look great, I'd say an issue i had was the not hugely diverse array of character designs but it could be  call back to SAOs second season or something so i can't really hate on it to much (though in a real MMO their would be tons of female models regardless if they were played by a guy or a girl, but in the second season of SAO they made it seem rare so again it could be a call back. I feel sorry for the writer having to work around that if thats the case). I enjoyed the aesthetic of GGO in the SAO second season and i enjoy how they can make a cute character look good in it so i can't complain to much, and the character movements looked amazing, 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I wouldn't say i was much of a fan of the opening or ending songs but a part of the sound qualifies as also the sounds of combat in the show and for that i'd say it deserves a good 8/10, plus the background music wasn't terrible or annoying so an 8/10 is appropriate in my book.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This category i'll go into some depth of why i enjoy Karen vs Kirito and how i like most of the characters, but this is also where i'd like to deduct points, the issue is that MAL doesn't have .5s in the rating system even though they use then to tally up peoples scores to see what has the highest rating... For this category at least here i'm giving it a 7.5/10 because i can't fessibly do it on MAL. Lets start with why i don't think a 8/10 is appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nI think most of the main and supporting characters are decent for the stories progression, HOWEVER its the other characters that annoyed me. You see, besides the \"creeps\" as they call them in the show, no other players acted in a way that didn't seem kinda dumb or in a way that annoyed me (not EXACTLY including some of the more noteworthy teams in the game but sort of including them too.) For example, the machine gun brothers were EXTREMELY stereotyped where as for almost every other no name team at least seemed semi realistic to a game setting, these guys were acting like Hebros which in most games you rarely see unless they are just dicking around and in no way organized. But as for the \"other\" non named npcs, after the elite teams combat scenes we just see 2 different teams doing the EXACT SAME FORMATION in the middle of an open terrain, in a game with snipers... REALLY!? You couldn't have them do SOMETHING ELSE?! Like make just walk around the map unaware, or literally anything else... \"facepalm\". There was also the girl with green hair later on whos extremely minimal backstory made no sense in retrospect because , i'm sorry if this is in some way spoilers but WHO BRINGS A GIRL WHO DOESN\"T WANT TO SHOT ANYONE IN A VIDEO GAME TO A PVP TOURNAMENT WHEN THERE WAS NO PARTY MINIMUM AND YOU HAD ENOUGH PLAYERS!? DA FUCK!? At least Sion in SAO DID kill people in the game but only sometimes hesitated due to a traumatic event, this girl had no actual excuse for even trying to participate in a pvp event when she doesn't do what's required of her in the event lol, and if your gonna try and say cause she could spot for them, her team were ALL gun trained and any one of them could do the same thing and participate in the pvp match so thats no excuse! \\n\\n\r\nAs for OTHER characters in the game, most all the men in the game who watched the match were dumb as bricks and not realistic whatsoever. On top of that (at least in the english dub version) some of the guys either in the game or watching it went out of their way to patronize women just to make the girls look good when they kicked their asses or when they showed them they could do much more than what they expected in a extremely not subtle way of preaching feminism where we didn't need it to be there... It annoys me when shows get political but note this could be fixed by just stopping that shit and not watching from a distance like some people do and saying that the people who localize these shows should be brought down because they think they could handle it themselves even though they just will expect some else to do it in the long run, NO. It can be fixed by letting the companies that take the time to localize it know we disapprove of it and if it gets worse partition them to stop putting political shit in the shows, not just wanted for them to go down because unlike those people who think everything will sort itself out if localization companies are gone, i KNOW that will bring anime to a terrible grinding halt, not make it \"better\", end of rant.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow as for the good characters in the show let's all say goodbye to the self insert kirito and welcome Karen Kohiruimaki who doesn't have a self insert personality and has real life issues besides \"which girl should i bring in the harem today and do i have to save them in a literal or metaphorical way?\"\\n\\n\r\nKaren plays a cute character in GGO but the reason is she doesn' like the fact thats shes tall in real life and feels self conscious about it, thus she decides to indulge in some escapism which after multiple game issues with ultimately not having player height adjustment options she finally finds that GGO allows her to be the small and adorable girl she always wished she could be and quickly learns that desserts in the game apparently have pink sandstorms... (it makes more sense when you see it). but basically Karen is a character with development which is an amazing leap from Mr. Kirito (which should be replaced with Something witty entertainments version) and thats all that matter.\\n\\n\r\nKarens friend, Miyu Shinohara, isn't a cookie cutter characters but besides some small bits of info about her in the beginning there's not a lot to say about her except she was a good supportive friend that seems kinda fake but real enough to not be SAO quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe player M gets more interesting as more info is known about him but let me say that i'm glad a bit of info about him revealed a lot later wasn't censored for being a bit out of the ballpark and ultimately he is an interesting character throughout the show so there's also that.\\n\\n\r\nThe highschool girls were kinda just there but if it gets a sequel they could get some development which would be cool. \\n\\n\r\nThe semi Antagonist Pitohui plays an interesting part that reminded me a bit of SAOs GGO but overall her best parts are when shes in combat and her at the end in my opinion which the rest you'll have to see for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10, no .5  for this one. I think i enjoyed it so much hughley because it make SAO look far better then its looked in quite a long time. But also because i was interesting to see what happened next. Not to say the show didn't get a bit cheesy here and there but the end of the second tournament was very game like and wasn't a live to win type deal like in Girls Und Panzer which i appreciated. The way this show was written made me want to see more of Karen and her adventures in GGO even if perhaps the show got slice of life like every now and again, and if it get a sequel i hope Keiichi Sigsawa comes back to write it and not the person who wrote SAO.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I was debating if i wanted to say the show got a 8/10 or an 9/10 but because i liked it so much in comparison to its predecessors i think i'll give it the 8/10. If i watch SAO, THIS is what i want to see. Just like with the new star wars movies in how i want to see more rouge one and not more of the last jedi thats the type of thing i want to see from this series and this version showed me it could be done. 9/10, i hope to see more of this again.    \\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online, is honestly a pretty niche anime. It started off strong but kinda died down halfway, but managed to finish decently.\r\nNow take note this is coming from someone who has so far watched every season of SAO, and actually played all the games (except hollow fragment that sucked) because I genuinely enjoyed the anime. I sorta think it's pretty trashy, but there are very likeable things about it and I will say that I am a fan.\r\nNo major spoilers ahead until the very end. I'll put a tag before that so don't read that part if you don't wantspoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe story here is just not good. It just really isn't. The premise and everything else here is perfectly enjoyable: it's just a girl spending her time playing GGO and competing in tournaments. And quite frankly, if they'd just stuck with that all the way through and just made things that way, I would have rated it higher.  It's an action anime for christ's sake, it doesn't have to be the god of all anime storylines. But because they decided to go the cray cray route, the whole thing just dropped to a 5 for me. It really wasn't good. They should have kept things simple, but they didn't. Boo for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. The characters designs were cute and likeable and was overall great for me. My favourite character has to be Fukaziroh.\\n\\n\r\nSound was good, enhanced the scenes and interactions but was nothing to write home about. Did it's job and didn't ever interfere with the anime. Good job sound team, you and the art/animation team seem to be the only ones doing their jobs here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were bleh. Fukaziroh was fun, LLENN was likeable although the whole \"I'm too tall! I hate myself!\" is such a stupid trope that maybe only peeves me personally, so I withheld judgement on that. On the other hand, the other characters were sort of bland and boring, LLENN was also kinda not well developed and needed a tremendous amount of pushing that just made her a stereotypical anime mc. I hate Pitohui, like completely. I absolutely despise her, and no matter how it ended or who she is I still despise her.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 6. Was enjoyable for a span and managed to come back a little at the end, so if you just want something to pass the time then hey, why not? If you want to watch a really really good anime, this is not it.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this, I shan't blabber anymore unless you want spoilers. Have fun watching if you choose to do so.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS HERE\\n\\n\r\nThe end fight was nice to see, LLENN was brutal as f*** in that fight I went like \"holy crap!\" in my seat, which was a real nice change of pace for me. Erm, the whole P-chan talking was just sorta weird and cringy. Not everything she did was cute, so she was kinda meh for me.\\n\\n\r\nPito was made overpowered in no legitimately tangible way. Unlike LLENN, who managed kills by using camouflage and other tactics, Pito was completely unbelievable in that she ran into a group of guys unarmed and killed like 20 of them. That was plain bull. I get that they're lackeys, and you need to make Pito seem like an insurmountable odd for that final fight, but this is the wrong way to hype up a villain. It made me feel nothing, no threat nor exhilaration when watching her fight, it just made me sick and disgusted. At least M proved he had some real skill. This bitch just pulled a darth vader/matrix/wannabe John Wick and expected that to make me care about her. At least John Wick was some real-ass shit, not this blowhole that Pito is supposed to be. No matter how you look at it, she was just a bad \"villain\" if you can even classify her as that, and this is what I meant by not keeping the story simple and moving into cray cray territory.\\n\\n\r\nThat part, where Pito was tormenting that guy who was being a REAL F****** MAN and saving his comrade was just sick and disgusting. One more reason to hate Pito's guts. M is a total bitch. They're both sick in the head and need to get some real help. I'm studying psychology, and I'll make sure they get the help they need. With a gun. To the face.\\n\\n\r\nI saw the ending coming, though I can't blame them for taking that route. T-S won and I can't say anything to that. It made sense. Though that lesbian kiss at the end was just messed up and unnecessary. Usually I'm not the slightest bit adverse to a little G on G in my life, but this was just sickening. Pito is just plain sickening, and her character should have just been someone like a mentor to LLENN that she was supposed to beat. If Pito had proved to be both brains and brawn who uses real equipment and real tactics to kill other teams to demarcate her as a threat, then this would have been great. Instead, they went the cray cray overpowered route. Bad choice, dropped what could have been a possibly 8/10 action anime to a 6 at best, and I'm already being generous.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this far, I shan't blabber anymore. Have fun watching if you chose to do so.",

            "content": "Honestly, the show is very enjoyable if you like action in general. The show mainly focuses on the action rather than the story, where the story is not hard to comprehend at all. To me, that's a good thing, where it doesn't try to overcomplicate things. I would definitely take this over the original Sword Art Online storyline any day. \r\nThe sound is great, where it really complements the action scenes. The music is also enjoyable, where the EP is easily one of my favorites. \r\nCharacters are whatever, I only really liked the MC (Karen) and her friend (Miyu). \r\nThe art was good, for themost part, it was consistent. My only complaint was like one episode that had bad CG, that particular scene did take away from my emersion in the action. Even with that complaint, it wasn't enough for me to not enjoy the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I had a lot more fun watching this show than I thought I would have. The show had great action, a great soundtrack, and even a likable MC. I would recommend this to anyone, especially those who did not like the original Sword Art Online story since this is a totally separate story from that.",

            "content": "STORY: 5\r\nThere's nothing inherently special about the story of this one, but it's entertaining if nothing else. Still, it's Sword Art Online, so they had to somehow fit in the \"you die in the game, you die in real life\" element. The way they did it was kind of convoluted, and I couldn't tell you offhand how it worked in this one, but by golly, they did it.\r\nART: 7\r\nAlthough it's produced by a different studio than the rest of Sword Art Online, the art still looks practically the same as the rest, which is to say it look very good.\r\nSOUND: 7\r\nThe music wasn't terribly noticeable,but still pretty good whenever light was shed on it. The gun/bullet sounds were really good, too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Karen, is nice and all, and they dive a little bit into what drives her, but she's just okay in terms of character. Now when it comes to the characters Pitohui and M, that's when we eventually get into something really messed up in terms of their relationship when it comes to light. They kind of glorified their abusive relationship, which is messed up on the account of the writer/director. I really liked Karen's motor-mouth friend, though; she was funny.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\\n\r\nAside from the generous amount of bumps, I enjoyed it. They handled the battle royale action very well. It was kind of different from your typical SAO series, which was much needed.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6\\n\\n\r\nIts greatest strength was the action, which is to be expected from Sword Art Online. It's over the top, and I really enjoyed that. It's lacking in terms of deeper (and especially in relatable) characters, but that's also to be expected from Sword Art Online. Maybe one day, they'll surprise us.",

People probably wouldn't have paid nearly as much attention to it that way, but it wouldn't have been hamstrung by the poor worldbuilding of GGO and we could've had a more polished story. Speaking of which, the story is quite personal and has rather low stakes, and I liked that. The premise took some getting used to, but in general I noticed more thematic coherence than in the actual SAO. The characters were enjoyable, quite well written and had nice designs. \r\nThe pacing kinda blundered by having the first episode be chronologically third and spending a bittoo much time on the first major event. The second event then proceeded to drag on a little longer, but the conclusion was alright in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe action wasn't really like a video game, with some characters having unfair advantages and others passing obvious exploits off as new competitive strategies. I feel that the previously established rules of GGO led to this problem and the show would've been better off by making up a whole new game. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was fine, but not really exciting. The sound however, I found rather pleasing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the show was fun, but I felt that I could've spent my time watching something better.",

I thought I was going to get a BoB without the weird deathgame SAO fans are extremely into for some reason. But as the anime goes on it started bugging me.

I also feel like the anime doesn't understand the basics of anything fps related. People will generally shoot at visible targets that aren't moving. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are unbelievable, unrelatable and if you remember what they say in GGO arc, their luck with rng avatars is absolutely over the top. We used to have 1 kirito, here it's more like giving EX luck level to all the \"important\" cast for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tries to be funny at times but fails. It's really bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeemable quality is the OP and ED and maybe P-chan. Yes I am really saying the only redeemable thing in this whole anime is a pink p90. It is that bad.",

            "content": "As far as I'm concerned SAO was by far the best game genre anime I've ever watched and, well, I believe this spin-off does not deserve to have the SAO title.\r\nFirst of all, this spin-off (not sequel!) is hardly related to the main SAO story - There are no characters from SAO making any appearances here (not even cameo) and other than the general universe, the GGO environment and a single (insignificant) mention of an event from SAO-II, the story is completely unrelated. Basically if you've never watched SAO at all, reading the synopsis of SAO and SAO-II here on MAL gives you all thebackground you need to understand the plot of this show.\\n\r\nYou'll probably say \"hey, but this does not inherently mean that the story is bad\". Well, even if it's not because of that - the story is pretty boring. Actually there's hardly any story at all - 90% of this show is basically people shooting each other, so it may be enjoyable for people who are more into the action genre and don't really need a deep plot. There are no real plot twists and by the end of the 6th episode I'd already guessed exactly what happens in the last episode - correctly.\\n\r\nGraphics and sound are obviously great, as expected, same as SAO, so no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line - Hardly related to SAO, hardly has any plot, mostly just people shooting each other, but that could be a positive if you're into action anime. Definitely does not deserve the SAO title.",

LLENN was too plain. WOW at first she wanted to play GGO because of her.......short height. If you see in the anime she was going through a lot of games but they didn't show any interest to her. Well that hit a laugh but is there nothing more about her. She may be different in real life but that shock me to hear a anime about a pink loving loli. I was quite excited sinceI heard a lot of this upcoming anime. Most annoying episode was the last episode sadly, I was fascinated with pito and stuff but to find out that it just ends there it just makes me feel wasted. After LLENN wins against pito everyone just acts like nothing happened like BAM happy ending. Well praying that Sword Art Online: Alicization in the fall 2018 goes good since i heard it is interesting!",

            "content": "When i knew that a SAO spin-off was coming, i was very exciting. I didn't need to wait until Alicization to see that world again, one of my hyped animes of te season, but...\r\nThe half of the series prove me wrong. GGO is awful.\r\nLet's start with some conveniences, like Pito is Elza... WTF??? the \"idol\" of hers happens to be the main villian (what are the odds to this really happening)... For what??? To make a clich\u00e9 plot twist that was hinted since the beginning??? Also the littles kids that she always is jealous of (another bs that i talk later) are for some convenientplot development/weak plot twist her first foes in the tournament... That is what i call poor writing, everything was very explicit and forced to make the \"epic\" reveal that evryone already guessed.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, everyone is poor developed. Even Llenn, with her \"anykind of complex that the main character have clich\u00e9\", really that girl is very empty by the fact that she doesn't accept herself beacuse of others' opinion (if she was a high schooler i would understand, but COME ON shes's a INDEPENDENT ADULT). Also this complex is bs, sure that are a lot of ppl that bully or isolate others because of height, but she isn't in school anymore, she is cute and pretty, are you telling me that no one tried to get close, also as i said there are ppl that care, but there are those who don't dive a s*** about it, see her best friend, there aren't any other like her???? Also what about her family??? No one can confort her or teach that looks doens't matters at all??\\n\\n\r\nShe also have the \"no friends complex\" and later her supportive best friend appears, COME ON!!! It's pathetic seeing this in animes, characters complaining that have no friends and seconds later their longtime buddies appears...\\n\\n\r\nIt's ridiculous that the fact that her avatar being small makes her OP, she's a noob that became one of the best in less than 1 year, pretty ridiculous, and the fact that no other competitive player is like her, i mean, not even one tried to make a avatar like that, not even other tiny avatar appeared until her friend, too convinient.\\n\\n\r\nPito, as i said, is the psycophatic loli singer that Karen loves... awe...\\n\r\nLittle girls with the reverse of main protagonist's complex clich\u00e9...\\n\r\nM for masochist... Also fat guy that loses weight because of some futile girl clich\u00e9...\\n\r\nHyperactive clich\u00e9 best friend...\\n\\n\r\nOk, let's see the plot... first episodes just explanatory story of how llenn won jam... later is a SAO rip-off of real life ppl being harmed by what happens in the game... this makes me believe that the producers wanted to make a spin-off with Kirito, but as it is a spin-off, decided to put much more fan service...\\n\\n\r\nAbout fan service... this show gives everything that pervs likes, lolis, hotties and yuri... If i wanted to see these kind of things i'd rather being watching other genre of anime, not fiction/action...\\n\r\nNot to mention the forced and non-sense easter eggs to makes blind fans never forget that the show is in SAO universe.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are good thing too. The action was what made me going so far in this series, it's clever and exciting, one point to the animators. The opening is pretty good, Eir Aoi made a catchy song that fits pretty well the theme, the OST is not outstanding, but it's decent. The voice acting is very good, nothing to say about.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the show was bad, plot not entertening, charathers with no appeal, only the action safes itself. Also not well developed, there's a Recap episode, who watched Shirobako knows what that means. To me they only comproved that GGO is just a Jackpot for the diehard SAO fans that only cares if there are Sword Art Online logo in the title. If this anime was a completely new universe, never would get so much spotlight. Also the fact that isn't the original author's story and not SAO 1 and 2 director makes this show much less SAOish.",

But as the show goes, the show just realize me  that this show has many flaw. \r\nIt got a good backstory.\r\n\"You do not satisfy with you real life condition.

            "content": "I'm going to start this review with the bad points and try to turn it around with some good points so don't get salty if I bag it out a little, I am going to bounce back with some compliments.\r\nAlrighty, so we have another Sword Art Online show in the sequence that is in the \"gaming\" anime genre. But as you probably noticed the \"gaming\" is in quotations for a reason. There seems to be a stigma on this genre that, if you are going to write some media content for it, you won't bother learning anything about it nor anything in regards to anythingactually, just write on a whim with your 300IQ brain for solid deus ex machina actions shots. \\n\\n\r\nSAO Alternative: GGO is no exception to this stigma. Throughout the entire show I consistently felt myself pausing mid episode just to take in the level of \"On what planet did you write these people from?\". \\n\r\nIt seemed like every player in GGO which is labeled as a \"hardcore PVP tactical battle royal\" style game, had a  hard time grasping any sort of game mechanic, for example;\\n\\n\r\n - Using cover to evade bullets or hide from your enemy, this seems very straight forward, but not once but multiple, MULTIPLE times there are teams displayed in a tournament draft standing at a crossroad or any sorta open area with no cover, pointing in every direction saying \"yea man this direction is clear\", like what? what? You had to have someone pointing in every direction to establish that? You had to put 4-8 members of your squad out in the open to determine if someone was on the road? That was just the tip of the ice berg.\\n\r\n - We have a character say his \"favored terrain is Urban\" combat, such as a city, while he is in a full green camo attire, if that's the terrain you wanna fight on WHY ARE YOU NOT DRESSED FOR IT! (this wouldn't be as such a peeve if the character wasn't THAT character)\\n\r\n - Endlessly firing on your enemies position will eventually kill them?\\n\r\n - Endless ammunition, except for plot purposes. (Claiming you have 700 rounds in reserve, then killing 2 people and saying you're down to 300 after 2 bursts)\\n\r\n - Duel wielding grenade launchers with ease one scene, having to brace one with both of your legs the next?\\n\r\n -  Not wearing helmets? Dying from something because the player chose to not have something that is \"cosmetically\" unappealing? GJ2 I'm looking at you.\\n\r\n - Teams being placed more than a 10 minutes trip apart, meaning the map is large enough to accommodate that, even with 25 teams, that's a LOT of downtime and comp games that have a large portion of downtime, aren't really fun to watch.\\n\r\n - A whole lot of \"Leader\", \"Captain\", \"Friend\", \"Partner\", \"Comrade\" call outs, I want to know the dudes name, I want to know who side characters are and what they're about, when someone is just refereed to as \"Leader\" by everyone in his squad it gives off a HUGE red flag.\\n\r\n - From previously watching the GGO ark in SAO its told that there is a point buy system in the game, but they're never actually told what they do, giving the impression that Karen's character is just \"unnaturally\" fast and not a point buy? 10/10 balancing, someone should call Ghost Crawler and tell him hes in an anime.\\n\r\n - People resigning because they didn't want to be shot? What? You're in a shooting simulation game, YOU'RE GOING TO GET SHOT MATE!\\n\r\n - Being within 200m of 2 teams shooting at each other, in a leveled field with no cover, and not having vision of them?\\n\\n\r\n---------------- End of \"gaming\" related peeves\\n\\n\r\n(Shallow Characters) - \\n\r\nBesides maybe a handful, most of the lead roles just had nothing really to them, the characters wern't really fleshed out further than 1-2 lines in a bio page about someone. Not to mention non-lead roles were literally the same people just named differently all wearing the same skivies.\\n\\n\r\n(Scene focus and direction) -\\n\r\nA lot of weird scenic shots, like yea we get it, its another world, but it just looks like mountains from a hiking adventure with some rundown houses and so many still shots, like usually still shots are thrown off by a panning camera, or like something else, but when its a long shot, and you can barely see someone, and the only thing moving on the screen is the 6 pixels that make up their mouth its like, please do something different.\\n\\n\r\n(Deus Ex Machina) (Did i mention deus ex machina? DEUS EX MACHINA) -\\n\r\nSoooo much deus ex machina, and oh man I can not stand that shit.\\n\\n\r\n(Pacing) -\\n\r\nIts kinda weird and over the place, the action scenes are decent, fast paced and usually enjoyable, but they then get followed up by 10 mins of standing still \"explaining\" how something worked. Now this would be ok, if it didn't come off like, opening a fridge (obviously with explosions and me screaming and what not), then me saying \"see, it keeps my beverages and food cold, allowing it to have prolonged life and eat it at a later date at which i see fit and that's how I'm able to give you this product here and now rather than buying it anew\" and then you going \"Whoa, that's crazy planned thinking\". Its just explaining shit that's either obvious or so basic that \"she shot at them while they stood still, impeccable\" is dumb and boring.\\n\\n\r\n------------------- End of Peeves (Yay?)\\n\\n\r\n(Story) -\\n\r\nThe story isn't really anything to write home about, but in this anime day and age we all know about the fabled, \"Lets make an anime about this LN or Manga that has a built up to be lengthy story, and only bring out 1 season that barley covers the first 10 chapters so that people purchase the original media\" and that kinda shit is annoying. \\n\r\nThere are far too many shows that deserve squeals and endings that will never be, this not being one of them. In the instance that, its more written as a one-shot, there's no real BIG story, but its straight forward what the course of the show will be, and it all gets wrapped up at the end so you're not like, \"DAMMIT WHY\"D THEY CLIFF HANGER THIS SHIT AGAIN!\"\\n\\n\r\n(Audio/Art) -\\n\r\nI did mention this in peeves, but there are a lot of nicely drawn section that aren't the action scenes, though they did throw a decent amount into that explosion budget. \\n\r\nVA was pretty good, would have been superb if it had on point characters to match.\\n\\n\r\n(Action and enjoyment) -\\n\r\nNow I'm not gunna lie, I do really like the action scenes in the whole SAO series, and if i was to put aside my game peeves, this is no different, its easy on the eyes, fast paced and silly OP characters mulching others, as silly as a bunch of it looks, you can't say that a lotta the scenes are pretty darn cool and really chill to watch after you get home from work and don't want to actually think about shit. \\n\\n\r\n------------------- End of Compliments\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nDo watch if -\\n\r\nYou like your regular SAO quick paced OP action scenes and a quick rounded story ark.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch if - \\n\r\nYou get triggered by the way the anime game genre is, where the authors are more writing fantasy, in the sense that they want to write what ever they want to write, but use the gaming genre because its the \"in thing\" then don't actually look into the product itself or do any research about it, just throw some random ideas and shit together and go Michael Bay.\\n\\n",

            "content": "A fun show as long as you don't look to much into it. Had fun.\r\nIt has more plot holes and inconsistencies than I can count, but you should still be able to enjoy it, as long as you're not to picky about it.\r\nTo be honest, I slammed my head against the wall a couple of times while watching this show.  If you've ever played FPS games, some situations will leave you baffled as to how stupid and unrealistic they are, given the skill level some of the characters our protagonists face should have.\r\nI personally ain't the kind of guy to let that kind ofstuff ruin my fun on a show I watch for pure entertainment (the story doesn't rely on a highly believable setting and there is no way in hell I am taking a SAO show seriously, unlike most people who insist on doing it), but if you're the kind of person who is unable to do such a thing, I won't recomend this to you. I personally just moved on from those moments.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the story, which I'll refrain from spoiling as much as I possibly can, I did not like how rushed the ending felt. The Pitohui situation felt like it should have taken more to solve. Apart form that, the writng was nice. Not great, but nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was disapointing. If there was one thing I have high expectations from any show with SAO in it's name is great art and music. Some of the scenes felt half assed to be honest. It was good in comparison with the average anime, specially those bulllet shots, but most of the other scenes dropped the quality quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing I'd like to write about is the characters. I'd have liked to see more development of our MC, though 12 ep anime is a 12 ep anime. Can't do everything with just one season, but I feel time was wasted on pointlessly prolonging shots and scenes that should have taken was less time to do. Apart form that, you can't really go that wrong with cute girls, because everyone will like them anyways, unless you majorly fuck up, which didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nAs I think enjoyement is the only score that should ever matter, I give this anime an 7/10.",

Explosions, injuries, abilities, etc looks great like any other SAO.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) is nice and work good with the differents weapons (a little off the real sounds).

            "content": "I'm not going to say that the original Sword Art Online is bad - that'll just trigger fans. But something we can all agree on is that it is very controversial. When I heard about Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online, I didn't pay much mind to it since, well, it's SAO. I only got around to watching it after watching a few Youtube vids saying it's nice, so I just went ahead and watched it. I wouldn't say that it was the worst decision I've ever made, but I was... disappointed.\r\nI had high expectations for the story. Karen is a taller-your-average-female-japanese character thathas insecurities about her height. She decided to play VRMMORPG games because of these insecurities, wishing to become a cute and short person. I liked this aspect, since the main character has actual motivations why she's playing GGO. Don't get me wrong, I like stories that are written around characters who are all about gaming and nothing else, but I just like how it adds a bit of depth to the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, I've only been saying good stuff about the story. So why the 6? (Spoilers ahead) What pissed me off is when after the first Squad Jam, she lost her insecurities about her height without any further explanation. All she said was she had to fight for her life (in the game) and realized that it doesn't really matter (her height, that is). However, there was no real reference or connection between Squad Jam (the tournament) and her insecurities! I know it's unfair to compare another anime to another one, but this move in SAOA:GGO is akin to Kayaba Akihiko saying 'lol I don't remember anymore' when asked by Kirito why he created Sword Art Online!\\n\\n\r\nAnd Pitohui. SAOA:GGO started light and fun, but suddenly when the first Squad Jam ended and the story focused on Pitohui, the anime took a nosedive to darker territories that don't suit its previous vibe. I just don't feel that it fits. And Pitohui's motivation for her actions is... bland and lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also characters that were introduced in the story and the anime made it look like they would be important in the story, but surprise surprise they're going to be killed with just a few shots. Pew pew.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to talk about much technical stuff, such as the art and the sound. But overall I liked both of them. They're not 'holy sh*t this is good' kind but they're definitely nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I at least enjoyed the anime. While there were certain points in the anime that made me feel bored I had to skips some parts, at the very least the anime didn't make me think about dropping it and moving on to another show.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am one of the fans of the original SAO series. I didn't think it was a masterpiece or anything but I did enjoy watching it. It could probably because it was one of the first few anime I watched. I don't know. \r\nTalking about this spin-off series. I honestly think this spin-off series was better than the original series. Don't get me wrong though, I still wouldn't call this one amazing or anything close to it. This also had its flaws.\r\nI think SAO Alternative: GGO had better fights / battles. Not from an animation perspective, but from a viewpoint of entertainment and logic. Ofcourse there is a lot of plot-armor involved but it wasn't unbearable - at least in the beginning. I quite enjoyed the earlier battles. But, the ultimate showdown between Pito and Lenn was far from enjoyable. To be honest, the final showdown from the first squad jam was also not very satisfying. LENN/Karen is too lucky and the writers went with stupidest ideas in these two showdowns. \\n\\n\r\nI don't have any issues with the art. We have some cute characters and I am happy with that. But I do feel like there are lot of lolis - like too many. But otherwise, the art was quite good. \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, i loved the ending theme. The opening was alright, but I skipped it for the second half of the season. \\n\\n\r\nNow the characters are tricky. I like only couple of the characters. I haven't seen many anime with a female lead, so I cannot compare. But, I think Karen was quite likeable as a lead character. I liked Pito for the most part of the series, but the ending screwed up her character. She changed too quickly. As for the supporting characters, I don't think I particularly liked or hated any of them. \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the series even though it had its flaws. Honestly the series was a 8/10 for the most part but then I had to drop it to 7 for the ending. It was a really screwed up ending right from the fight between Pito and Lenn upto the conclusion. There was one particular scene at the end that no man can hate, but I would like not to spoil stuff here.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I give this series a 7 on 10. For those having second thoughts about watching this series - I cannot say that you might like this series but I definitely think this series is worth a try.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online is an interesting series. It tries to improve upon the formula established by the original series by introducing a more traditional plot structure (ostensibly for those that never managed to figure out that SAO was a thinly veiled slice of life show), but in doing so it fails to capture any of the originality that made SAO a hit with its actual fans. \r\nInstead what we get was an above average show that the talking heads of the western anime community can now bring up whenever they decide to repeat their common misunderstandings of the original series forquick cash.\\n\\n\r\nI don't mean to suggest that SAOA: GGO was bad. It captures the popular trends and presents the type of story that people want to see. However, it has lost that one element that made the original so unique. \\n\\n\r\nThe original series presented an insanely complex and intricate world through the eyes of a few characters, without trying to highlight every detail, and give out every answer on a platter. It was an absolute masterpiece for those that enjoy thinking about the media they consume. By contrast, this is just an adventure story, very much like a dozen other stories every season. It's predictably hits the right story beats at the right time, it has a good mix of action and drama, and it plays out exactly as any other story of this type would.\\n\\n\r\nThis can't escape comparisons with the original at the technical level either. Neither the sound nor the art can stand up to the quality that was on display in the original series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a fun anime, you won't go wrong with this. It's the type of show that will leave you feeling decently satisfied. However, if you're looking for something unique, this falls quite short regardless on what side of the SAO debate you fall on.\\n\\n\r\n- Story -\\n\\n\r\nThe story is well planned, following the traditional narrative arc almost to a tee. It pulls from the common anime tropes of \"Friendship is great,\" and \"Fight for what you believe in,\" but it throws just enough curveballs in the form of mental disorders and psychological stresses that were so prevalent in the previous series. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few very clearly delineated arcs that help establish the flow of the story, each lasting a few episodes, and each revolving around a large battle. It's a popular pattern that has worked for many battle series, though it doesn't translate quite as well into such a short series. Due to the accelerated rate at which the story had to progress, there's was very little screen time given to anything that didn't directly serve the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe did series manage to make very good use of the world established by the previous series (and created the hilarious situation where those that didn't like the original are now falling over themselves to convince each other that the game world is purely an accomplishment of this series). It understood quite well the source material that the original GGO referenced and managed to reproduce at least some of the common mindset of players of such games.\\n\\n\r\nAnother nice factor was the thought put into the tactics employed by the characters during the events in the show. Clearly some thought was put into creating a believable set of circumstances and establishing at least some level of reasoning for the way the various groups behaved.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, for all those the story didn't manage to stick with me nearly as well as the original, save perhaps the final arc of the first season. Simply put, there wasn't enough substance in the actual story worth holding on to. It feels like it was made to be idle entertainment, all too quickly forgotten. There were some attempts at themes regarding having a healthy body image, and caring for the mental well being of others, but those didn't really come through very well at the pace that the story was presented.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, a decent story that can be enjoyed quickly, and forgotten likewise. I give it a solid 7 / 10.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters -\\n\\n\r\nI had trouble forming an opinion on the characters in the series. In all honesty, there are 3 or at most 4 actual characters to go around. Everyone else is treated as white noise necessary to pad out the VA list, and offer the feeling of a living world. The side cast was never used to communicate or accomplish anything. There were a few calm slice-of-life moments where the side characters worked reasonably well, but even those few moments were wasted to communicate the fact that the lead character had candy and cookies.\\n\\n\r\nOf the actual main characters, only the two leads had enough personality to be more than caricatures. The lead character, Karen, was one of these two. This was by far the most entertaining character in the series, with some of the best lines, and a wide range of emotional responses. Through her we get to explore one of the few side themes of accepting yourself for who you are.\\n\\n\r\nWhat more, she's the only character that actually acts in response to the situation. She thinks on her feet and overcomes her own personal demons to accomplish her goals.\\n\\n\r\nThe other female lead, Pitohui, is more interesting at first glance. When she is introduced, it seems like she has some major issues. Then it turns out that yes, she does in fact have major issues. Unfortunately, her development sort of stalls out there. \\n\\n\r\nI applaud the attempt to highlight mental illness in such a way, but I would have found it more interesting to see her change, either in the positive, or even the negative side as the story moved along. Instead, we see the exact same behavior all the way through to the end, when suddenly everything is fine. The only saving grace is that the actual insanity is presented well, both directly and in an implied manner. \\n\\n\r\nOf the other recurring characters, the one male character is rather bland. He seems to have a set of skills that is never justified, and his personality can be summed up in a few words. \"Quiet. Obsessed. Masochist.\" The main character's best friend is in a similar boat. \"Flirty. Gamer.\" Finally, the blob of amazons / rhythmic gymnastics girls is just that, a single blob not even worth considering as multiple characters. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, why did the gun need to talk? That was the most obvious attempt to create merchandizing opportunities I've seen in a while.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, despite a few extremely well executed personalities, I can't be very amazed at the roster for this show. I'll give it a 7 / 10, but just barely.\\n\\n\r\n- Art -\\n\\n\r\nThe art took a negative turn from the first two series, with a slight drop in the character art, and a major drop in backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are bland looking, though I can forgive that due to the setting. There's not much you can do to make camo look appealing, even if you color it pink. I do feel like they could have added more fine details to some of the costumes, but that wouldn't have made that much of a difference. Fortunately, they put a lot of work into the range of expressions that all the major characters exhibit, and that work comes through very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are also intense, with a good variety of maneuvers and movements that you wouldn't normally see. There's very real sense of dynamic movement during combat. Though the intensity is quite muted.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the worst was the drop in the quality of the backgrounds; constantly repeating patterns and textures, a limited color pallet, poor blending with the characters, little detail, and very simple composition. \\n\\n\r\nThe props and buildings all have the expected shape, with no actual personality, and even the vistas feel grimy and limited. Gone are grand sights of fantasy worlds, replaced with a quickly done forest landscape with some hills in the background, or some common buildings such as a school or a bar.\\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the work put into the characters, I would come down very hard on the series. However, the it's clear that the effort put into the show was focused in one area at the expense of another, which is an unfortunate reality of this medium. Because of that I will give it a 7 / 10.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound -\\n\\n\r\nIf the art took a negative turn, the sound took a nose dive. The music continues the trend from the original series but doesn't have the epic world backing it to maintain such a level of grandeur. It sticks out in a very negative way, like playing a funeral march for a kid's birthday party.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are not very impressive either. For the combat it sounds like they bought a bunch of stock shooting sound packs used for game development, and half of those fail to have the impact that you would expect. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice performances were likewise quite bland. With a few stand-out insane laughs and emotional moments it felt like they just went with the first take of every line. There's little emotional depth here, just saying things in sort of the right mood. As for the songs, I stopped trying to listen to them after the first two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWith all these shortcomings, I think I'm being quite fair by giving it a 6 / 10 in this category.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment & Overall \u2013\\n\\n\r\nDespite the amount of criticism I have for the series, I can't pretend that I didn't enjoy it. SAOA: GGO was a fun romp through a loosely game-based world, with a few entertaining characters. Nothing gets resolved, no lessons are taught, but when you come down to it, the experience is still fun.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like the original SAO for the depth of its world and presentation, then this series will merely tickle the itch for more. It's missing most of the elements that made the original great, lost in favor of presenting a series that is easier to consume. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like the original SAO because all the characters were \"so cool,\" then this show will be like that, only less pretty.\\n\\n\r\nIf you hated the original SAO because you felt the story was \"too simple\" then this show can offer you a brief glimpse into what keeps SAO genuinely popular, despite the wall of community hate.\\n\\n\r\nIf you hated the original SAO because someone on YouTube told you it was bad\u2026 Well, now most of those talking heads are singing the praises of this one, so good for you I guess.\\n\\n\r\nAs for me, I found this to be a fun show, an entertaining show, but not a show I'll remember or come back to, and not a show that I'll spend much time analyzing. In other words, this was a pretty good anime. A 7 / 10, with little question about whether it deserves the score.\\n",

            "content": "Story: 6\r\nNothing new or unique, main character decides to play virtual reality games to escape their real life, virtual reality games are intense and help them overcome some of their real life problems, some stakes added with a plot twist.  This story has been done many times, and has arguably been executed much better in other anime, although the pacing was not particularly bad even though the conclusion was rushed.\r\nThe anime was largely faithful to the source material and did not change all that much, although they couldn\u2019t flesh out the world completely it covered the original work well enough. They also connected itto the main series Sword Art Online with name drops and references some obvious some hidden.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth as expected from studio 3HZ, and the character design is very cute, reminds me of their other works such as flip flappers. The background art for the battlegrounds were really well done, it looked like a map for an actual video game, nothing was out of place and well detailed. The highlights as far as the art went was how well they animated the battle scenes, everything was very intense and the choreography was some of the best for this season.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and the background music for the battles were very good and exciting, however most of the music outside of those does not stand out. I barely noticed any of the sound track besides the main theme and op, Sword Art Online definitely had a far superior sound track.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nKaren, or LLENN her online name, is the main character of this series. As far as main characters go she was an absolute delight, from her cute mannerisms to her hard gaming mindset there was not much about her to dislike. Her journey to becoming ok with her body image and improve her social circle was interesting and I enjoyed her character growth, definitely one of the best girls of the season. \\n\\n\r\nNow you may be wondering why my rating is only a 7, the issue with the show is that Karen is the only really developed character, I genuinely did not care about any of the other characters besides the rocket launcher girl fukaziroh and she was a relatively straight forward character who did not change throughout the show. In a show with so many different characters, having only one character be remotely developed in a significant way leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nIts not that I did not find the show entertaining, however as far as enjoyment goes this show could have been a lot better executed. There were many opportunities for them to do better especially regarding the pacing in the last 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n",

That's a big MIGHT though because it also carries a lot of baggage.\r\nThe writing of dialogue is decent but the overarching story is shit.

The only one I can really call out as being a shit character is the antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are on par.

They even had a short skit at the end of one of the episodes where they replaced the sound design for a scene with the female cast saying things like \"ptew\" and \"baaaang\" to really showcase the importance of sound design of the guns which was really likable and I suggest searching for on youtube even if you decide to skip the series.",

            "content": "After finishing the first arc and entering the second one, I can already see what SAOA:GGO is all about.\r\nJumping into the Battle Royale trend while it's hot (with PUBG and Fortnite going strong), there's not much to tell you about the story.\r\nThe premise is a battleroyale and that's about it. So what's the problem with it?\r\nDo you know that in team games you are always told to stick with your team? Well of course in SAOA:GGO there are these teams. They are all friends who make a premade team, work as a team, and even they know each other's strengths and weaknesses.\r\nFights between these teamswould be pretty interesting. But then we got LLENN.\\n\r\nLoli? Check\\n\r\nWearing pink while everybody wear camouflage? Check\\n\r\nCalls her P90 \"P-chan\"? Check\\n\r\nP-Chan can speak? Check\\n\r\nSuper OP even more than Kirito? CHECK\\n\\n\r\nI'm a shounen anime fan, I can somehow be fine with weird powerups but here it's just so stupid. LLENN is pretty much a solo player (besides teaming up with M) so of course she'll go 1vs5.\\n\\n\r\nThere are no special tactics, just go in there and swat 5 enemies like flies. Classic.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what if I told you that there is a couple of characters who are psychopaths just for the sake of it? And they don't really seek medical help.\\n\\n\r\nOh and also, if we're going already for lolis, why not introduce MORE lolis? Don't forget to have one of them have a really damn annoying voice (The blonde girl) like Flora from Asterisk War or something.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and music- OST is fine, not something memorable and OP/ED are nice which give a SAO-ish feel.\\n\r\nThe art is mediocre, many times you could see missing details or just weird teleports of characters like frames were skipped.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all there is to it. Basically no story, very OP MC, psychopathic side characters + many loli side characters, but all in all, it's not that bad. I've always been a fan of Isekai/Video games anime, so at the end of the day it depends what you seek. 6/10",

            "content": "trully an online game anime. SAO for being too extreme with it's harem-incest-romance is what makes me dissapointed with the series. SAOA : GGO is doing great as a story about playing an online game.\r\nthe story is kinda slice-of-life , it feels really relateable and not over drama. might be a letdown for some who carve drama (the popular \"I can't logout drama\"), but IMO it the plot fits the story about \"someone who plays online game\"  and so far less drama\r\nCharacter is somewhat 2-dimensional so far , but there are fun and interesting interactions between the cast. no big twist but enjoyable\r\nin-short ,if you wanted to watch online game anime with less drama (and no Kirito and his harem route) , I suggest you watch SAOA : GGO for a refresh and enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The original Gun Gale Online season had actual things going on. It made you want to know more about what was going on and who was behind it all and at the end, although a little weak and anticlimactic, it delivered some satisfaction and closure.\r\nThis one on the other hand is just the story of this super tall girl who's playing the game as a tiny girl and happens to be really good because of plot reasons. That's it. There's nothing else to it.\r\nAt the end they try and add some sort of story with a villain but it just doesn't work because of thenext point; the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this one are bland at best. Most of them feel really artificial. The plot wants you to believe that they're charismatic and awesome but they're just not, they just don't have that organic factor that makes a character likable.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst one by far is the so called \"villain\" of the show. Another one of those \"ultra strong because the plot says so\" aka \"we pulled this character out of our arse\" characters. It felt to me like they couldn't decide what they wanted this character to be. It starts as a good character and then turns out to be the bad kid in the block and by the end of the whole thing you're not even sure if the character is suppossed to be good or bad or insane or what the hell is going on anymore. The whole mini arc involving the villain is just annoying and the \"finale\" is lame and kind of weird.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, looks good, sounds good, plot is nonexistant, characters are average at the very best.",

            "content": "I enjoyed the first SAO and the second, it was the first show I watched as episodes were released and it added a neat charm to it, it may have been the first 'trapped in a game' show I watched. The characters were interesting, there was plenty of real-life overlap and meaning and some real conflict and weight. \r\nBut this.......this is trash. There is literally no weight to anything. The only people I could imagine enjoying this would be those who live for Twitch streams or who treat video games as something more meaningful than life. ITS SO BORING. I really tried to give thisone a chance but there is no plot, no weight, nothing really matters, the reactions and dialogue are all out of place, the characters are basically mentally insane and its still not enough to generate even the smallest speck of a plot or story. \\n\\n\r\nA bunch of anime tropes get together and play a bland shooter with all the enthusiasm of drama students studying histrionics. Its also constantly giving shout outs to the first two SAO seasons which don't really add anything. \\n\\n\r\nThis show could have been interesting if it had been a way to do a summary or alternate look at SAO while being its own thing, but its absolutely pointless. The characters are as 1D as they can possibly get, no development, no plot, no reason to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound is find, animation is alright, ending song is great, but its absolutely a waste of time. I really don't know who this is for. Socialist, Twitch addicts who will go to any length and suffer any drab situation to avoid facing any part of reality? I don't know. Its like the very last thing at the bottom of the very last barrel but its the only thing left between you and whatever you are trying to avoid so you enjoy a piece of trash with everything you have. I feel like this is the show that sits in that position, you have to be desperate to enjoy it because there is next to nothing to enjoy.",
