Besides checking if someone is buried under concrete there was no purpose of it because she can't save them herself and she can't go through people or their attacks plus her fighting skills are pretty weak (that is why she trains) so it normally ends with her and her face in the floor.\\n\\n\r\nThe Osts i thought were out of place.\\n\r\nThe opening Ost was cheerful and happy and was like 'Hey lets run in a field of sunflowers'.\\n\r\nWhile the ending Ost is the opposite it's heavy metal and really dark, a bit too dark for this Anime. But this Ost for me was probably the best thing about this Anime. Just waiting for the episode to finish just to hear it again.    \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, thats all i can say about Tokyo ESP not really a great Anime to watch and has quite a bit of flaws. Ga-Rei fans will be disappointed.",

            "content": "Tokyo ESP. A show about people with a variety of superpowers duking it out against each other. How can you go wrong with that?\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nFrankly, the story of ESP is a jumbled mess. The first episode sets the stage well. It introduces the world and the conflict between factions, and leaves the story open to development. Super powered beings called Espers have rebelled and taken Tokyo hostage. People are panicking. Everything is going wrong. And then the protagonist appears to save the day. The first episode left me keen for more. I was exited to see where the plot would go.\r\nAnd then, it pulled aGungrave and threw the plot back into the past.\\n\\n\r\nStarting a story in the present and then jumping back to the past is a horrible decision. If you see a character in the present episode, you know they at least survive until that point. Therefore, any fights that are supposed to be highly impact full and tense really don't amount to anything. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire past arc felt like I was watching a drawn out montage.\\n\\n\r\nAfter trudging through ESP's past sequence, eagerly awaiting the part of the story I was interested in, I was greeted with one of the most lackluster finales I've ever watched. All the plot's events basically amount to nothing, the villains motivations make absolutely no sense, and the conclusion is left open ended for a second season. On its own, Tokyo ESP just doesn't stack up, and I doubt a second season will change that.\\n\\n\r\nESP also tries its hand at making a love triangle between characters, but it feels forced and falls flat. There's also an attempt to touch on themes of racism and unfair judgement, but again, this doesn't strike a nerve at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt wise, ESP doesn't stand out, nor does it suffer from poor animation quality. Its just average.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, nothing that memorable here either. Whilst background sounds and the VO are passable, Tokyo ESP's OST is lacking, so it falls below average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing special about Tokyo ESP's characters at all. They're mostly shallow and one dimensional, and a lot of their actions don't make any sense. There are some moments where they can be likeable, but these are few and far between. ESP also contains the contender for worst villain (I've never witnessed a character this poorly constructed). \\n\\n\r\nLike the other categories, the characters just fell flat.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tokyo ESP just felt like a waste. The premise is wasted, the story is jumbled, the characters are dull. All that stands out are its flaws, and there are many.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 3/10",

            "content": "In a world full of crime, there is an anime that has potential to became awesome using superpowers, however, it turned out to be a mess. That anime is Tokyo ESP. Tokyo ESP is produced by Xebec.\r\nSTORY (4):\r\nThe story follows Rinka Urushiba, a normal high school student who is a bit poor and her father is the only one who raise her. Rinka has to work as a waitress after school to raise money for rent and food. One day, she sees a penguin and some glowing fish swimming through the sky. Rinka came into contact with the fish and she develops ESP powers. ESPPowers are basically supernatural powers.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was inspired by X-Men powers and so they produced an anime that deals with supernatural powers. It wasn't known in the US because people might think that this anime copied X-Men powers.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this anime is that they never address where does the glowing fish came from. Not only that the plot is a complete mess. Events just happen randomly without any meaning at all. The second episode is basically the first episode where Rinka was lying naked in the room. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending gives no closure to all the characters. \\n\\n\r\nART (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation at some parts are bland and wooded, while other parts are decent. The first episode fight was good while the rest not so much.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are ok.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (3):\\n\\n\r\nBlack Fist is my favourite character of the show. She is intimidating and badass.\\n\\n\r\nRinka is also a badass however, her personality wasn't interesting to me.\\n\\n\r\nAzuma is a generic character who is always there for Rinka.\\n\\n\r\nI guess there is not much to say for the rest of the characters. They are too generic even the main villain as well. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (3):\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tokyo ESP could have been entertaining but with it's lacklustre story, uninteresting characters and anti-climactic ending, it just comes off as forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nSo I give this anime a 3 out of 10.\\n",

            "content": "Tokyo ESP is just about exactly what it sounds like. Tokyo is the location of the setting while ESP stands for extra-sensory perception. Add two more letters to that and you get \u2018esper\u2019, the term used to designate individuals who possesses powers beyond human capability. The premise is essentially about a girl named Rinka Urushiba who develops special abilities of her own after one faithful day that changes her life forever. It\u2019s nothing new to see really as generic would be the first word that comes to mind if I was to describe this setup. To enjoy Tokyo ESP, you\u2019ll have to see the showfrom another perspective for some painless fun.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the same author that bought to you Ga-Rei, don\u2019t be surprised if you see some similarities. Hajime Segawa\u2019s writing combines an essence of supernatural in a modern setting with some depth of dark edginess. Director Shigehito Takayanagi\u2019s involvement is also somewhat noticeable with his return. Nonetheless, the first episode essentially drops down a lot of concept. The main focus is that espers are perceived as monsters due to their potentials. Treated perhaps as malevolent entities of the world, the introduction shows espers showing off their powers while the world appalled by their actions. It quickly goes with a path of action in full throttle mode with even a bike crash gimmick to add to the mix. However, that\u2019s only the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe show actually breaks down the barriers of the story in little molecules. That\u2019s because the following episodes begins to follow the life of a regular high school girl. Meet Rinka, a girl who has developed the ability to phase through objects. When using the power, her hair turns white. Hence, the medium dubs her the \u201cWhite Girl\u201d. Get it? Sounds cheesy but it makes sense to portray what she is. What we also learn about Rinka is that she has a strong sense of justice developed by the influence of her father. Justice comes at a price though as we learn how dangerous some of Rinka\u2019s opponents can be. The show introduces other espers some who uses their power for good such as Kyotaro Azuma while others uses them for evil. The generic \u2018good vs evil\u2019 clich\u00e9 takes onto high gear as each episode begins to unravel itself. What we also learn is the hidden motive of an organization seeking to bind the world under their power. In honesty, this whole superpower enterprise is so straightforward, one can\u2019t help but thinking the concept is overdue. Perhaps X-Men would ring a bell with this show\u2019s gimmicks. I don\u2019t label Tokyo ESP as an X-Men clone though but rather as an example with their similarities. Taken for granted, Tokyo ESP also likes to play around a bit with its premise with a balance of lighthearted comedy.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the parallelism with X-Men, Tokyo ESP is somewhat clever with its concepts. The series both tell and shows how esper develop their powers through contact with a mysterious fish. Did you hear that right? As bizarre as it sounds, the premise adapts these tones and gets stranger when you see a penguin flying in the air. By the time Tokyo ESP ends though, you shouldn\u2019t be too surprised with the methods this show use to introduce characters and concepts. You\u2019ll feast eyes on flying psychic fishes, talking panda, flying penguins, and over-sized tankers in mid-air during broad daylight. This show might as well rename itself Tokyo War when it comes to the way espers are treated. From propaganda and accusation, espers are labeled as evil. The amount of prejudice is almost surprising as the show sets it up so that almost anyone can gain esper powers thus changing momentum. However, cleverness also has its limits. The classic \u2018evil organization tries to rule the world\u2019 takes no time to make itself well known. The organization led by a man named \u201cThe Professor\u201d plays the role antagonists with his sub-coordinates. Of course, it\u2019s easy to guess what Rinka has to say about that. But with all this, it leads to inadequate balance of the story especially with pacing. In essence, it\u2019s bad storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Rinka, the show likes to surround itself with others that gets involved with the story. Characters such as Kobushi and Peggy steps into the shoes of supporting roles with little development. There is some relationship dynamics though. The most prominent would be Rinka and her father as we see their closeness. Azuma and Minami also shares an oddball bond although it sharply contrasts with the family values of Rinka\u2019s connection. Unfortunately, characterization is almost non-existent for many of the characters as the show goes full turbo with its story. Actually, that could be wrong as the pacing of the show\u2019s story also feels slow at times. Training exercises and peculiar humor substitutes with story development while high school girl crushes recreates an attempt at romance development between the main characters. It loses focus when it comes to the heartfelt moments. Although there are some back stories (mostly vague and leaves viewers in the dark), it doesn\u2019t ultimate achieve its intended purpose. The heartfelt moments doesn\u2019t really touch the heart at all as it\u2019s easy to lose interest in the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the story couldn\u2019t be any more generic as The Professor declares the world (in his own view) as \u2018beyond saving\u2019. In truth, the show uses these generic attributes to flesh out the potentials of the heroes. Rinka in particular challenges against The Professor\u2019s ideology with both her words and actions. Besides that, the show also likes to challenge itself with how much prejudice can go. In one particular case, a woman almost gets herself and her son killed as the world realizes how dangerous espers can truly be when provoked. It teaches a lesson to humans as to what justifies as morally right or wrong. The problem is how Tokyo ESP presents this lesson as it\u2019s too straightforward\u2026especially with the resulting consequences. However, the series is able to rebound a bit itself when it comes to creativity with espers. There are a variety of powers that let the viewers see the testament of esper powers. Whether it\u2019s telekinesis, teleportation, or phasing, the show stays honest with its technical aspects. These powers also result in some spectacular fighting sequences with decent adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Xebecs had their hands full on this adaptation. They played around with it a bit and the result is a moderate portrait of its framework. Character designs are tolerant with faithfulness to the manga. However, there\u2019s nothing particularly special about it either. Fan service is minimal although there are some suggestive camera shots that raises eyebrows. Background artwork is also fairly simple and underdeveloped. The most prominent aspect of the visuals might be the special effects. Some optimism will pay off as the fighting between espers can be attractive to watch. Overall though, the artwork isn\u2019t anything special but not terribly wrong either.\\n\\n\r\nMusic reminds me of the time when I used to watch X-Men. The OST has this vibrant beat that suggests every action should be shounen-like while adapting superpower themes. It shouldn\u2019t be a mistake to underestimate this show\u2019s diehard edginess with the soundtrack either. Most climatic scenes are capped off with dynamic entrances and exits. Now, I do give credit to some of the character voices in particular when they are in situations that evoke emotions. The OP and ED songs also have a sense of creativity with the artistic montage and symbolism.\\n\\n\r\n12 episodes. This might raise the question such as \u201cis that all?\u201d The show could probably work better for a full 2 cour series especially considering the manga actually has two parts. Nonetheless, Tokyo ESP seems like one of those shows that grows progressively incoherent. It\u2019s good for some combative action and sets up its premise right with developing interest. However, the way characters are crafted falls into a hole of non-sensational worth. The minimal character development, lack of relationship building, and dive between goofy/serious moments struggles to earn the show any praise. In the end, Tokyo ESP is a show with somewhat acceptable fashioned action and fun. However, it\u2019s far from attaining superior satisfaction on screen. \\n",

            "content": "When I watch this thing, there are a couple of things that remind me of:\r\n1. Batman\r\n2. X Men\r\n3. From Paris with love (the 2010 action movie)\r\n4. 300\r\n5. Big Boss\r\n6. Taking of Pelham 123 (2009 action movie)\r\n7. Dan Inosanto ( the Kali guy whom Bruce Lee fought in \"Game of Death\")\r\n8. Jumper (A 2009 Sci-fi movie)\r\n9 DC Comics heroes\r\n10. Samurai Flamenco \r\nSo, I just gonna go direct to the point by stating my ratings for this anime.\r\nStory, art and characters: Poor 3.\r\nIt maybe a spin off of \"Gai Ren Zero,\" it may have a plot and it may have a story, but it ain't original, theconcept was a complete  plagiarize of plot from the things that I've mention from above in a bits and pieces way, from the Espers running amack in the streets of Tokyo to the occupation of the diet, I mean-c'mon, what's more to explain, when it was pretty obvious  from the very start up to the finish, also, one can't deny as to how inconsistent as the first episode conflicts the last episode and that's something you have to watch since putting a spoiler would result them mods getting in my nerve (dang).\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters and art, it was pretty obvious that the way they were illustrated by writer Hajime Segawa and anime director  Shigehito Takayanagi where somewhat  plagiarize as well except that they modify it a bit to in a parody way so that it won't look like it was plagiarize, but still their characteristics where also plagiarize as well, now let go to them characters one by one:\\n\\n\r\nRinka Urushiba: Frankly, she is a parody of Storm from the X-man, except that she has the powers of Shadow cat, frankly she is Storm who has the attitude of Wonderwoman, her Kali skill was a copy from Dan Inosanto's scene from the Game of Death.\\n\\n\r\nKy\u014dtar\u014d Azuma: He is like Masayoshi Hazama from \"Samumenco\" in fact he is a complete plagiarize of the character from the said anime, except that he has feelings for Rinka, his powers was the same as \"Night Crawler\" from the X men and he also has the same traits of Hazama from 'Samumenco\". \\n\\n\r\nRind\u014d Urushiba: the main heroine's dad who for obvious reason looks like Wolverine, who has the powers of Magneto, and has the attitude of Batman.\\n\\n\r\nKobushi Kuroi: One look at her you would know that she is Jean Grey, who has the powers of Sue Storm from the \"Fantastic 4,\" however she has the attitude of Wolverine from the 'X Men.\"\\n\\n\r\n Murasaki Edoyama: One look at her , she is a female Bruce Lee who has the powers of \"Psych-lock\" or is that another telepath from the \"X-men?\" Well, I not sure since I'm not familiar with all the characters from \"X-men.\" \\n\\n\\n\r\nAyumu Oozora: he is like Dan Inosanto whose powers of Precognition whom I don't know where to refer it to, didn't fare up as far as I'm concern.\\n\\n\r\nPandaemon Youdani, Peggi and Parrot the Pelican:..........I just have no way of describing them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Professor/Hokusai Azuma: Ok, for obvious reasons, he is more like a parody of \"Two face\" who is one of Batman's nemesis and happens to have the powers of Professor X.\\n\\n\r\nMinami Azuma: as I describe her, she is like Mystique who has the powers of Nigh Crawler as well.\\n\\n\r\nOf course let's not forget the other support characters like:\\n\\n\r\nMurasaki's dad who is a parody of King Leonidas from the 300.\\n\\n\r\nThe Police Chief who looks like Jules Winnfield from 'Pulp Fiction.\"\\n\\n\r\nand the baldie guy of the anti esper task force, who looks like Charlie Wax from \"Paris with love.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo why would I give the story, art and Characters a poor score? Co'z there really is nothing original about them and I think I've mentioned that already.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Enjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nLet's see, I like the opening theme and I like the seiyuus who did the character's voices, PERIOD! The enjoyable part was seeing the antagonist getting beaten by the good guys and that's as good as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nDespite of all the plagiarisms that has been modified into a parody and despite of hoe good the sound and how enjoyable it is...unfortunately, I can only give it a 4, since I can't deny about this anime's lack of originality, but it was still good enough to be enjoyed and that's how the cookie crumbles in this anime.    \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "...And all of a sudden errryone had superpowers. Tokyo ESP is an anime in which many people get superpowers because they are on drugs. I say this because a select few persons can see fishes swimming around in air (obviously they are under influence of drugs). The first thing I would think if I saw a flying penguin or fluorescent fishes in the air is ask myself if I am sane. Not these characters, they just believe and inmediately accept what they see. Anyway, jokes aside, these fishes seem to give people superpowers by going in a person. All you have to do is wishfor it (that's the impression I got, at least) and you get it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no real explanation as to how the superpowers work; in the first episode I even thought the superpowers were due to the accesories the villains were wearing. However, this disappears later on, so it might be the authors thought the same thing and wanted to make clear that the superpowers were the real deal. There also seems to be a very limited amount of superpowers. I think it does not make any sense for people to have the same skill, but this is, again, not explained. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is the powerups. It looks like less than a week of training makes you a pro fighter; if you are a genius, you can certainly make faster progress, but not this fast. Besides, all the people are not so bright, most people have mental disorders and some people just know everything; no explanation as to why they know. Are they psychics or something? This obviously makes no sense. \\n\\n\r\nAll right, I will just say it: this story does not make any sense. As the story progresses, events seem to have less connection to each other, which results in a bland story. One example is that the connection with the first episode is not well made, since statements that were done in the 1st episode are overwritten and forgotten. Finally, the last episode is an incredible ass-pull: everything \"ends\" in one single chapter, making everything that happened in this episode plain dumb.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo ESP has a cast of characters made in such a way that they made me laugh when I first saw them. We have Wolverine as \"Muscle Dad\", Aristotle as \"That yakuza guy\", the male main character (whom I liked most) as \"The youngster that has seen too much JoJo\" and the female MC as \"She who became super strong all of a sudden but is useless anyway\". Of course there are other characters; one of them is a villain who all of a sudden decided to become friends with the MC just to help fight against \"true\" evil. There is that girl with glasses that appears in EVERY anime who is quite useless and a boy with glasses who looks like an idiot. I will also write a line about mascots. There were three exotic mascots in this anime. One. every. 4. episodes. Personally, I don't think mascots make something more popular (I found them annoying), but it looks like the authors thought it was the key to success.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have vague pasts at best (even for the male MC), and the reason why they do what they do is not clear either. I guess the authors did not want to think too much about it, since all explanations have holes in them. I think that in the end the villains were the righteous ones. Personally, I won't trust a government that hires Jason (you know, that madman with the mask & bat) as policeman. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite good, but I have the impression that battle music is used in the wrong moments. And there is a serious issue with the first episode; the music is so ridiculously loud you can't hear the characters talking, which I found quite annoying. Or maybe I just downloaded the episode from the wrong place.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is allright, not really special. Almost all the side characters are incredibly ugly, which is quite funny. I guess all attention has to go to the main and secondary characters. But the mouths... my god. The shading on them is just weird, it feels like the characters are continually using \"smug face\".\\n\\n\r\nSo, Tokyo ESP is not something really good, but if you have some time to fill you might want to give it a shot. Just don't expect much of it. My rating is a 5.\\n\\n\r\nOh right, this is my first review, so please tell me what you thought about it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Do you love heroes? Do you believe in miracles? Well I hope you do because you're going to be hearing a lot of that if you're planning to watch this series. \r\n[STORY: 7/10]\r\nThe storyline is actually a very simple and traditional template of \"Good v.s. Evil\" and that's pretty much it. I'm giving extra credit for the fact that they have a pretty decent back-story to back up all the latter's actions. A good back-story never fails to hit a soft spot in me. So apart from that, there are moments of fighting (somewhat... at least they tried) which may or may not intrigue you.For me, the fighting scenes didn't really work out that well, it looked more like they did it for the sake of doing it, and it wasn't well produced at all. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 9/10]\\n\r\nOh, now this is BRILLIANT. Barring the OP and ED which can actually sound quite catchy after listening 12 times (or more), the background music was fantastic to say the least. Suitable music were played at suitable moments, and the tracks themselves were very good. This was especially the case in the last episode where every track I've heard throughout the past 11 episodes were actually played in somewhat quick succession. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 8/10]\\n\r\nDon't know 'bout the others, but this series actually features decent character development, especially for the lead female (obviously). A typical story about how a character overcomes her weaknesses and gains strengths from various sources to beat down the enemy. Oh, but the romance side of this series was irritating to me, if I need to criticize on an area. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL: 7/10]\\n\r\nSo taking into consideration other factors as well, I feel that this series deserves a 7 in my books. It's not too bad, but it ain't that great as well. But I'd think that it was worth a shot and worth the time. So check it out, guys!",

            "content": "So, small disclaimer before I start my review. For this anime, you most likely will have to shut of any kind of logic you might reconsider, you wont find any of it here. If you decided to give it a shot, then listen closely to its story as it will likely kick you of to the reaction of ,,Wait,What?'' when you miss a small detail. Now to to the real review..\r\nTokyo ESP had also been one of the newest Animes of the last season. It is the Story of a Highschool Girl called Rinka Urushiba. Now the first thing you'll see is that the atmospherereminds of old and brings you nostalgia from animes like ,,Detective Conan'' or ,,Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne''.\\n\r\nNow Rinka does seem to be the everyday Highschool-Girl until she meets a dear Friend to her. And from here on the story takes the crazy route.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of them meet and are able to see flying golden fishes, a living phenomenon that if it flies through you , you are going to get ESP-Powers. Rinka in this way did get the ability to go through objects and let objects pass through her. \\n\r\nThe Story then takes quick and fast turns, which is incredibly confusing if you are not very focusing. So if you just casually watch anime , without trying to invest yourself into a particular anime, this will not be a good choice for you.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes a few episodes to realise that what I already said, it takes good examples from old animes and unfortunately fails to recreate their glory and has some incredibly corny lines now and then. What never had gotten into me is the first approach of the villains-it is not menacing it is just a girl and a huge-hulk-like guy that dress up as samurai and are able to ,,guide'' those fishes. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound is a bit lost and query, you dont feel emotion with it as you normally should. Like an epic battle theme or to show the struggle. It is rather mediocre, so if you are an audible person like me, you wont like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, as I already said - are a bit corny and more stereotypical, there could have been much more done with the old man in the panda costume for example. It leaves much questions open like , why did the professor change to a hatred with such big extent. Why does his daughter keep following him, despite her wanting to change, is ESP lost with death ?\\n\\n\r\nOverall I didnt enjoy it that much, the only point where the emotion really hits you is when the doctors wife , after they were badly wounded, uses her esp and her last bit of power before she dies in his arms.\\n\\n\r\nAn overall point of 5-6. It didnt really go where I thought it would have been\\n\\n\r\nIf you decide to immerse yourself in this anime, do one thing, which is keeping an open view and do not try to find the red line to connect everything, it will be much more enjoyable then.",

The story at first seemed cool on how they stole a building and what not to create a new city from the rubles. But when they go to the past to explain everything then it just turns to crap.\r\nCharacters:\r\nFirst of all you hardly feel attached to any of them. The characters are just motivated by a crap love story that goes no where. How did asuma and white girl chick get love ties anyway? Itfelt so forced and out of place. The panda thats suppose to be a sensei is useless. I thought he was going to kickass but he never gets too. All the characters just arnt interesting.\\n\\n\r\nStory: What started off as a cool premise fell way short. The whole taking over tokyo thing could of gone way better. The ending made no sense what so ever. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Good but what the fucks wrong with some characters eyes. All black or white, shits ugly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: eww nothing memorable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat started off as a good series ended in a train crash.

            "content": "Tokyo Esp from the first episode was set up to be nothing more than a mediocre take on X-Men.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe plot is extremely clich\u00e9 and straight-forward: there are a group of humans with special abilities who take advantage of their power to take over the world, and there is the protagonists, who also happen to have special abilities who are going to use their abilities who take down the bad guys.\r\nThe first episode shows the peak of the show to try and grasp the viewers to see what's to come, but with this it meant that the show became very predictable to the viewer, andmade it a lucklustre experience.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 5\\n\r\nThe art was average at best. The character designs were very straight forward but i didn't feel like anything particularly stood out.  The animation was fluid and i didn't notice any hiccups in it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe only thing which i think stood out on the OST, was the ending theme 'Kyuusei Argyros' as it was fact paced, and so it fit in well with the show. The opening theme however i thought was very out of place as it was too happy go lucky, which really wasn't the vibe of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 1\\n\r\nThis has to be the biggest thing wrong with this show and the reason why i began to resent it.\\n\r\nRinka and Azuma are meant to be the protagonists , and to see them suffer so much and remain so helpless in unbearable. I mean they are unable to fend for themselves for the majority of the show and constantly get the crap beaten out of them.\\n\r\nAll of the other characters seem very flat and one dimensional.  The Professor was the only antagonist who explained their motives, and seemed justified.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI feel like i wasted several hours i'll never get back after watching this show. Everything was a mess and all over the place and i never grew to care for any of the characters at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nI feel like i'm being too nice giving this a 3 as it was a train-wreck from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're thinking of watching this show, please don't bother.

It fell short in all aspects of suspense, action, romance, etc. There were many plot holes and inconsistencies through T ESP that made in nearly unbearable. Much was left unexplained and you justfelt unsatisfied with the play off many scenes\r\nArt: 5\r\nFor the most part the art was ok, references, clean, good lighting, but as the anime progressed this seemed to become stale. The fight sceneswere always something that didn't work, and this became more apparent as the anime prolonged. The art for the characters also felt a bit like a copy and paste job, as many of the main characters had very similar faces.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was probably what saved this anime, it worked well and the team behind this deserve all the credit. It had that sense of action and the hype building that this anime deserved. Voice and sound-effects were also fine, par i would say. The sound did seem slightly too subtle and quiet in some scenes however, rather than an epic moment in a scene they set the scene rather than become a part of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:6\\n\\n\r\nAs before mentioned this anime contains references so a host of lovable characters were portrayed. The main character was relate-able and worked fine, but it was some of the supporting characters that fell flat. While Master Roushi and Peggy were fan favourites, others such as Kyotaro and the Professor were poor. Some characters were either completely useless, while offers goals and aims were absurd and illogical, making it hard to warm up to take them seriously. Others were introduced but with no stroy or introduction, they were just there, appeared.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:4\\n\\n\r\nInitially i enjoyed it but by episode 5 the plot was drab and the many flaws became apparent, it started to become so flawed that much of the anime left you confused or questioning the aims of the story and the characters\\n\\n\r\nOverall:5\\n\\n\r\nOverall i give it a 5, if you committed to more than 6 episodes it was watch-able, but if not its no must see.

            "content": "Well to begin with I don't dislike this anime like most of the reviews, on the contrary I find that it can be quite fun to watch. It is not perfect for a lot of reasons as : rushed story, characters that don't have a really good depth into them, between other things. Below I will list the grades I gave to each topic...\r\n-Story (8):\r\nThe story could have been really interesting, but it was rushed and had some plot holes that weren't explained, nothing that a second season couldn't have dealt with. The plot is about a girl named Rinka that all the sudden findsout that she acquired some kind of powers, witch are called ESP in the anime. At the same time a treat appears, a guy that calls himself professor is threatening all Tokyo and the human kind. She then decides to start fighting for the humans alongside her friends. As it is only a 12 episode anime there are a lot of explanation missing, but it is still a fun plot that could turn out to be really good.\\n\\n\r\n-Art (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not horrible but it is not great. It is like any other average action/supernatural anime.\\n\r\n-Sound (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening has a good music, nothing special but i enjoyed it. The anime it self has a good soundtrack that again, is nothing that would give it a 10 but it still works.\\n\\n\r\n-Character (6)\\n\\n\r\nI guess that an 26 episode anime would have fit this anime well. Characters are not developed enough, even though there are some flashbacks that makes you understand some of their purposes and histories. I felt like there are still some things missing. They are just average, nothing great.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment (8):\\n\\n\r\nI Enjoyed it. Even though it has its drawbacks it is still an enjoyable anime if you can look past its mistakes and just enjoy the show itself. It probably won't be between your favorites but still deserves a shot, my final score is a good (7)",

I've read all the 53 manga chapters available as of now , and let me tell from what I saw on the first episode there seemed to several new characters that never showed up on manga. Also based on what I read on others's reviews I'm even more disapointed, Azuma and the main villan were called generic as well other characters. wow that's so no true, in the manga they're all very interestin,g each has their backstory and dept they grow as the story procedes. You should definetely read the manga and skip the anime you won't regretit, it's really worth your time, plus the art is much more interesting than this generic new anime style.",

            "content": "\"Tokyo ESP\" is an anime that downgrades espers, turning them into whiny teenagers who feel the need to gripe about their unfortunate past.\r\nThis anime first captured my heart at the word 'ESP.' Unfortunately, I was to have many not-so-heart-capturing moments throughout watching the series.\r\n\"Tokyo ESP\" is a sci-fi staring Rinka, an extremely poor high school girl who lives with just her father in modern Tokyo. One day, on the way home from school, she chases a \"flying penguin\" to the top of New Tokyo Tower\u2014only to have \"fish swimming in the air\" suddenly appear before her. One of the fish goes through Rinka and givesher an extraordinary power beyond those of normal humans; the ability to slip through solid objects. She then meets Azuma, a boy wanting her to become a hero?\\n\\n\r\nRinka, a girl who's personality is constantly developing and yet getting no real development at all, is voiced by Ibuki Kido (Yume [Pupa]). Kido captures her stubborn, and annoying personality, do a wonderful job with an insecure girl who'd like to play the part of 'hero.' Azuma, the rowdy and determined boy, is voiced by Keisuke Koumoto (Raul Chaser [Yuushibu]). He has a deep voice, and make it sound like he really does want to become a hero to save the planet from evil foes. \\n\r\nI will flat out say I did not like this series. As soon as the first episode finished, I was left with many questions. Who are espers? Where did these bad guys come from? White Girl? What's that? And as soon as the second episode came out, my questions were dismissed, and thrown in the trash. It turns out the series started, jumping ahead to the climax, and later on went to introduce the characters. I have to say, I hate when series do this. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Other than that, the music was average, as well as the voice acting. The characters were bland as well as the storyline, and it basically turned into a kid's flick about 'justice.'\\n\\n\r\nIf you like simple story formats, despite being confusing through all twelve episodes, then this is the anime for you! However, if you are of a discerning mind and wouldn't want to bother yourself with a anime that is just going to make you regret your life decisions, turn back now! I repeat. Turn back now! That is all.\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5\\n\r\nThe story and overall message of the anime was fine, but it would have been nice to get a little more detail in there, a better plot line, better antagonists -- can the storyline just change all together?\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThe art was good. The animators certainly put more details out towards the end, but it was a fresh art style.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 7\\n\r\nThe music was alright, but there was nothing that really stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\r\nThe characters had average personalities with average development. I could hardly differentiate the teenagers from the adults. They all acted like immature teenagers to me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nMy hype for this anime was high, but after the first episode, everything just went downhill from there. On some days, I even tried to avoid watching it, even putting it off till the last minute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.8\\n\r\nThe anime would have been good if it had developed more, and gotten its priorities straight. I just felt that the pacing was off the entire time, and couldn't really get attached to the characters.",

            "content": "To be honest, I don't know how I should explain this series. Tokyo ESP is one of action series which I took because of the action genre only. As the series first made, my expectation is it would become a little good because of the promising almost-ending scene in the first episode. But, as the series went, my expectation came down and almost drowned into the deep of the sea with the ending.\r\nTokyo ESP is a series which told us a normal high school girl and got a special ability. The girls then become a hero who tried to save the town from another specialpeople. It's cliche premise, but I was hoping the plot would be different. It turned out I'm wrong.\\n\\n\r\nI hate the story most than another part. Many mystery at first, but a half-baked finishing for the mysteries. Not only the premise is cliche, the plot is really cliche too. The plot is a mess up, you might find it's so boring because of the repetition of same reaction of the characters. The ending is really bothering, because in my opinion, you won't need all of the 11 episodes just to reach the final plan of the antagonists. \\n\\n\r\nAnother boring part of the story is how the action came. The action is really messing up with you because of the unresolute main antagonists. The main antagonists would make you dejected. I don't know how many time I were punching my desk just to watch the another unresolute desicion of the main antagonists. I hate how the antagonists made. The reaction of another side character such as one of the main character's mom is really made the series worse. It's okay if the mom's reaction like that, but I didn't get how the development of this character can made her changed. It really turn off the series, she should have never made into one.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how bad the story and how the character not made well, I quite like the art. The art is one of the reason why I was choosing this series. The art is solid and use a good coloring. The background is made well. The art is good overall, but not the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED is quite good. The ED give you a little sense of gore of the series, a quite true if there were no sensor there. I don't think bad about the BGM, I think it's fine as it is.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the story and the characters, I don't really enjoy this series. Several times I wanted the story ended quickly, I was tired to see the character.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo ESP is a good example for a series with bad plot and the bad character. It can't be helped even with the art or another good part in this series. For you who want to watch a mediocre action series, this series is for you.",

            "content": "Tokyo ESP is focused on the struggles of high school student Rinka Urushiba and several others who are granted esper abilities from mysterious fish that enter their bodies. While making sense of their unique predicaments, Rinka and her comrades have to deal with an enemy organization trying to organize an esper resistance against humanity by using the mysterious fish to force people into becoming espers.\r\nMy thoughts on this series as a whole are a bit mixed. The series starts out like Berserk and Ga-Rei: Zero where you are tossed immediately into the main conflict of the series without any buildup before the second episode takesevents before said conflict starts off to show how it got to that point. I've started to get irked when titles pull this type of plot structure off because it risks turning off first-time viewers of the series who have no clue what they are in for. But setting that gripe aside for now, the second episode and onward do a great job for the most part at establishing its characters and building up its plot to show the characters reacting in varying ways to gaining their esper powers. Established characters have their motivations explored for how they utilize their newly acquired esper powers and why they protect or oppose humanity utilizing them. The series also explores the origins of the mysterious fish that grant espers their power and how this knowledge is being abused by the enemy esper organization. In addition, the animation for the series is quite impressive with highly-detailed scenic shots and character designs, as well as fluid and smoothly animated action sequences that are a treat to see in fights that break out between espers and/or military and police forces.\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside praises, the series does come with its fair share of issues. Being based on a shounen manga series, the idealist bent that many titles of the demographic have in presenting their characters has a bad habit of coming up quite often throughout the series. This is quite notable with our series lead, Rinka, who seems single-mindedly interested in upholding justice and being a hero, which makes her character seem two-dimensional and hard to connect with as a result. The series also gets in the bad habit of seeming to get a bit too preachy and heavy-handed with the whole \"being a hero\" belief in opposing the enemy esper organization at large. Not helping matters is also the inconclusive ending as another enemy appears to enter the conflict with little established about them and still being at large, a typical issue with many anime given the title's manga source material was still ongoing at the time Tokyo ESP began airing in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tokyo ESP decent plot structure and buildup in focusing on how its major characters respond to gaining esper powers and what side they will take against an enemy esper organization, that gets somewhat marred by the typical idealist bent that many shounen titles fall into and its inconclusive ending. Still, it is a decent sci-fi action/ drama title that is worth tracking down if such titles catch your interest.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Pay attention to the start of episode 1 and you'll catch a cameo appearance from Ga-Rei Zero's Kagura and Yomi. For those not in the know, both Tokyo ESP and Ga-Rei Zero are made by the same mangaka, Hajime Segawa.",

Tokyo ESP is about a teenage girl who become an esper and later on become stronger in order to protect people and becoming a hero. When I heard the manga will be animated, I am so freaking happy since I\u2019m a fan of its manga. But, the anime adaption seems fast pace adaptation, and doesn\u2019t follow up its original story although the chronology of time is same, so you would want to read the manga (absolutely, do it!!) fromthe start because the story has a potential to become much more awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe synopsis follows up Rinka, a teenage girl who lives a normal life until she has a power to become an esper. After that, she meets a boy named Azuma and together fights the evil that come disturbing Tokyo. The story seem plain with good versus evil, but as story progress which is focus about Rinka having train to become stronger in each fight she has lost and Azuma with its background story. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation seems ok in my opinion, although there is some fight scene which looks like awkward. But, other than that, it was good with the background building, power display animation, and the teleportation scene was awesome to me.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal soundtrack in this anime was okay, like when they change the music to make the fight scene more impact or when the sad scenes more immerse. Other than that, it was average.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion, it was good but I do not recommend for those who have read the manga first, because the anime will crush the hype from the manga. For those who don\u2019t read the manga, I do recommend to watch since it will give you a little bit insight about the story, and I still want to recommend reading the manga after watching the anime. For that, I give 8/10, although it was not good enough to satisfy me, it was still good anime adaption. \\n",

Besides checking if someone is buried under concrete there was no purpose of it because she can't save them herself and she can't go through people or their attacks plus her fighting skills are pretty weak (that is why she trains) so it normally ends with her and her face in the floor.\\n\\n\r\nThe Osts i thought were out of place.\\n\r\nThe opening Ost was cheerful and happy and was like 'Hey lets run in a field of sunflowers'.\\n\r\nWhile the ending Ost is the opposite it's heavy metal and really dark, a bit too dark for this Anime. But this Ost for me was probably the best thing about this Anime. Just waiting for the episode to finish just to hear it again.    \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, thats all i can say about Tokyo ESP not really a great Anime to watch and has quite a bit of flaws. Ga-Rei fans will be disappointed.",

            "content": "Tokyo ESP. A show about people with a variety of superpowers duking it out against each other. How can you go wrong with that?\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nFrankly, the story of ESP is a jumbled mess. The first episode sets the stage well. It introduces the world and the conflict between factions, and leaves the story open to development. Super powered beings called Espers have rebelled and taken Tokyo hostage. People are panicking. Everything is going wrong. And then the protagonist appears to save the day. The first episode left me keen for more. I was exited to see where the plot would go.\r\nAnd then, it pulled aGungrave and threw the plot back into the past.\\n\\n\r\nStarting a story in the present and then jumping back to the past is a horrible decision. If you see a character in the present episode, you know they at least survive until that point. Therefore, any fights that are supposed to be highly impact full and tense really don't amount to anything. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire past arc felt like I was watching a drawn out montage.\\n\\n\r\nAfter trudging through ESP's past sequence, eagerly awaiting the part of the story I was interested in, I was greeted with one of the most lackluster finales I've ever watched. All the plot's events basically amount to nothing, the villains motivations make absolutely no sense, and the conclusion is left open ended for a second season. On its own, Tokyo ESP just doesn't stack up, and I doubt a second season will change that.\\n\\n\r\nESP also tries its hand at making a love triangle between characters, but it feels forced and falls flat. There's also an attempt to touch on themes of racism and unfair judgement, but again, this doesn't strike a nerve at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt wise, ESP doesn't stand out, nor does it suffer from poor animation quality. Its just average.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, nothing that memorable here either. Whilst background sounds and the VO are passable, Tokyo ESP's OST is lacking, so it falls below average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing special about Tokyo ESP's characters at all. They're mostly shallow and one dimensional, and a lot of their actions don't make any sense. There are some moments where they can be likeable, but these are few and far between. ESP also contains the contender for worst villain (I've never witnessed a character this poorly constructed). \\n\\n\r\nLike the other categories, the characters just fell flat.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tokyo ESP just felt like a waste. The premise is wasted, the story is jumbled, the characters are dull. All that stands out are its flaws, and there are many.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 3/10",

            "content": "In a world full of crime, there is an anime that has potential to became awesome using superpowers, however, it turned out to be a mess. That anime is Tokyo ESP. Tokyo ESP is produced by Xebec.\r\nSTORY (4):\r\nThe story follows Rinka Urushiba, a normal high school student who is a bit poor and her father is the only one who raise her. Rinka has to work as a waitress after school to raise money for rent and food. One day, she sees a penguin and some glowing fish swimming through the sky. Rinka came into contact with the fish and she develops ESP powers. ESPPowers are basically supernatural powers.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was inspired by X-Men powers and so they produced an anime that deals with supernatural powers. It wasn't known in the US because people might think that this anime copied X-Men powers.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this anime is that they never address where does the glowing fish came from. Not only that the plot is a complete mess. Events just happen randomly without any meaning at all. The second episode is basically the first episode where Rinka was lying naked in the room. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending gives no closure to all the characters. \\n\\n\r\nART (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation at some parts are bland and wooded, while other parts are decent. The first episode fight was good while the rest not so much.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are ok.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (3):\\n\\n\r\nBlack Fist is my favourite character of the show. She is intimidating and badass.\\n\\n\r\nRinka is also a badass however, her personality wasn't interesting to me.\\n\\n\r\nAzuma is a generic character who is always there for Rinka.\\n\\n\r\nI guess there is not much to say for the rest of the characters. They are too generic even the main villain as well. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (3):\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tokyo ESP could have been entertaining but with it's lacklustre story, uninteresting characters and anti-climactic ending, it just comes off as forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nSo I give this anime a 3 out of 10.\\n",

            "content": "Tokyo ESP is just about exactly what it sounds like. Tokyo is the location of the setting while ESP stands for extra-sensory perception. Add two more letters to that and you get \u2018esper\u2019, the term used to designate individuals who possesses powers beyond human capability. The premise is essentially about a girl named Rinka Urushiba who develops special abilities of her own after one faithful day that changes her life forever. It\u2019s nothing new to see really as generic would be the first word that comes to mind if I was to describe this setup. To enjoy Tokyo ESP, you\u2019ll have to see the showfrom another perspective for some painless fun.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the same author that bought to you Ga-Rei, don\u2019t be surprised if you see some similarities. Hajime Segawa\u2019s writing combines an essence of supernatural in a modern setting with some depth of dark edginess. Director Shigehito Takayanagi\u2019s involvement is also somewhat noticeable with his return. Nonetheless, the first episode essentially drops down a lot of concept. The main focus is that espers are perceived as monsters due to their potentials. Treated perhaps as malevolent entities of the world, the introduction shows espers showing off their powers while the world appalled by their actions. It quickly goes with a path of action in full throttle mode with even a bike crash gimmick to add to the mix. However, that\u2019s only the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe show actually breaks down the barriers of the story in little molecules. That\u2019s because the following episodes begins to follow the life of a regular high school girl. Meet Rinka, a girl who has developed the ability to phase through objects. When using the power, her hair turns white. Hence, the medium dubs her the \u201cWhite Girl\u201d. Get it? Sounds cheesy but it makes sense to portray what she is. What we also learn about Rinka is that she has a strong sense of justice developed by the influence of her father. Justice comes at a price though as we learn how dangerous some of Rinka\u2019s opponents can be. The show introduces other espers some who uses their power for good such as Kyotaro Azuma while others uses them for evil. The generic \u2018good vs evil\u2019 clich\u00e9 takes onto high gear as each episode begins to unravel itself. What we also learn is the hidden motive of an organization seeking to bind the world under their power. In honesty, this whole superpower enterprise is so straightforward, one can\u2019t help but thinking the concept is overdue. Perhaps X-Men would ring a bell with this show\u2019s gimmicks. I don\u2019t label Tokyo ESP as an X-Men clone though but rather as an example with their similarities. Taken for granted, Tokyo ESP also likes to play around a bit with its premise with a balance of lighthearted comedy.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the parallelism with X-Men, Tokyo ESP is somewhat clever with its concepts. The series both tell and shows how esper develop their powers through contact with a mysterious fish. Did you hear that right? As bizarre as it sounds, the premise adapts these tones and gets stranger when you see a penguin flying in the air. By the time Tokyo ESP ends though, you shouldn\u2019t be too surprised with the methods this show use to introduce characters and concepts. You\u2019ll feast eyes on flying psychic fishes, talking panda, flying penguins, and over-sized tankers in mid-air during broad daylight. This show might as well rename itself Tokyo War when it comes to the way espers are treated. From propaganda and accusation, espers are labeled as evil. The amount of prejudice is almost surprising as the show sets it up so that almost anyone can gain esper powers thus changing momentum. However, cleverness also has its limits. The classic \u2018evil organization tries to rule the world\u2019 takes no time to make itself well known. The organization led by a man named \u201cThe Professor\u201d plays the role antagonists with his sub-coordinates. Of course, it\u2019s easy to guess what Rinka has to say about that. But with all this, it leads to inadequate balance of the story especially with pacing. In essence, it\u2019s bad storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Rinka, the show likes to surround itself with others that gets involved with the story. Characters such as Kobushi and Peggy steps into the shoes of supporting roles with little development. There is some relationship dynamics though. The most prominent would be Rinka and her father as we see their closeness. Azuma and Minami also shares an oddball bond although it sharply contrasts with the family values of Rinka\u2019s connection. Unfortunately, characterization is almost non-existent for many of the characters as the show goes full turbo with its story. Actually, that could be wrong as the pacing of the show\u2019s story also feels slow at times. Training exercises and peculiar humor substitutes with story development while high school girl crushes recreates an attempt at romance development between the main characters. It loses focus when it comes to the heartfelt moments. Although there are some back stories (mostly vague and leaves viewers in the dark), it doesn\u2019t ultimate achieve its intended purpose. The heartfelt moments doesn\u2019t really touch the heart at all as it\u2019s easy to lose interest in the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the story couldn\u2019t be any more generic as The Professor declares the world (in his own view) as \u2018beyond saving\u2019. In truth, the show uses these generic attributes to flesh out the potentials of the heroes. Rinka in particular challenges against The Professor\u2019s ideology with both her words and actions. Besides that, the show also likes to challenge itself with how much prejudice can go. In one particular case, a woman almost gets herself and her son killed as the world realizes how dangerous espers can truly be when provoked. It teaches a lesson to humans as to what justifies as morally right or wrong. The problem is how Tokyo ESP presents this lesson as it\u2019s too straightforward\u2026especially with the resulting consequences. However, the series is able to rebound a bit itself when it comes to creativity with espers. There are a variety of powers that let the viewers see the testament of esper powers. Whether it\u2019s telekinesis, teleportation, or phasing, the show stays honest with its technical aspects. These powers also result in some spectacular fighting sequences with decent adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Xebecs had their hands full on this adaptation. They played around with it a bit and the result is a moderate portrait of its framework. Character designs are tolerant with faithfulness to the manga. However, there\u2019s nothing particularly special about it either. Fan service is minimal although there are some suggestive camera shots that raises eyebrows. Background artwork is also fairly simple and underdeveloped. The most prominent aspect of the visuals might be the special effects. Some optimism will pay off as the fighting between espers can be attractive to watch. Overall though, the artwork isn\u2019t anything special but not terribly wrong either.\\n\\n\r\nMusic reminds me of the time when I used to watch X-Men. The OST has this vibrant beat that suggests every action should be shounen-like while adapting superpower themes. It shouldn\u2019t be a mistake to underestimate this show\u2019s diehard edginess with the soundtrack either. Most climatic scenes are capped off with dynamic entrances and exits. Now, I do give credit to some of the character voices in particular when they are in situations that evoke emotions. The OP and ED songs also have a sense of creativity with the artistic montage and symbolism.\\n\\n\r\n12 episodes. This might raise the question such as \u201cis that all?\u201d The show could probably work better for a full 2 cour series especially considering the manga actually has two parts. Nonetheless, Tokyo ESP seems like one of those shows that grows progressively incoherent. It\u2019s good for some combative action and sets up its premise right with developing interest. However, the way characters are crafted falls into a hole of non-sensational worth. The minimal character development, lack of relationship building, and dive between goofy/serious moments struggles to earn the show any praise. In the end, Tokyo ESP is a show with somewhat acceptable fashioned action and fun. However, it\u2019s far from attaining superior satisfaction on screen. \\n",

Big Boss\r\n6. Taking of Pelham 123 (2009 action movie)\r\n7. Dan Inosanto ( the Kali guy whom Bruce Lee fought in \"Game of Death\")\r\n8. Jumper (A 2009 Sci-fi movie)\r\n9 DC Comics heroes\r\n10. Samurai Flamenco \r\nSo, I just gonna go direct to the point by stating my ratings for this anime.\r\nStory, art and characters: Poor 3.\r\nIt maybe a spin off of \"Gai Ren Zero,\" it may have a plot and it may have a story, but it ain't original, theconcept was a complete  plagiarize of plot from the things that I've mention from above in a bits and pieces way, from the Espers running amack in the streets of Tokyo to the occupation of the diet, I mean-c'mon, what's more to explain, when it was pretty obvious  from the very start up to the finish, also, one can't deny as to how inconsistent as the first episode conflicts the last episode and that's something you have to watch since putting a spoiler would result them mods getting in my nerve (dang).\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters and art, it was pretty obvious that the way they were illustrated by writer Hajime Segawa and anime director  Shigehito Takayanagi where somewhat  plagiarize as well except that they modify it a bit to in a parody way so that it won't look like it was plagiarize, but still their characteristics where also plagiarize as well, now let go to them characters one by one:\\n\\n\r\nRinka Urushiba: Frankly, she is a parody of Storm from the X-man, except that she has the powers of Shadow cat, frankly she is Storm who has the attitude of Wonderwoman, her Kali skill was a copy from Dan Inosanto's scene from the Game of Death.\\n\\n\r\nKy\u014dtar\u014d Azuma: He is like Masayoshi Hazama from \"Samumenco\" in fact he is a complete plagiarize of the character from the said anime, except that he has feelings for Rinka, his powers was the same as \"Night Crawler\" from the X men and he also has the same traits of Hazama from 'Samumenco\". \\n\\n\r\nRind\u014d Urushiba: the main heroine's dad who for obvious reason looks like Wolverine, who has the powers of Magneto, and has the attitude of Batman.\\n\\n\r\nKobushi Kuroi: One look at her you would know that she is Jean Grey, who has the powers of Sue Storm from the \"Fantastic 4,\" however she has the attitude of Wolverine from the 'X Men.\"\\n\\n\r\n Murasaki Edoyama: One look at her , she is a female Bruce Lee who has the powers of \"Psych-lock\" or is that another telepath from the \"X-men?\" Well, I not sure since I'm not familiar with all the characters from \"X-men.\" \\n\\n\\n\r\nAyumu Oozora: he is like Dan Inosanto whose powers of Precognition whom I don't know where to refer it to, didn't fare up as far as I'm concern.\\n\\n\r\nPandaemon Youdani, Peggi and Parrot the Pelican:..........I just have no way of describing them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Professor/Hokusai Azuma: Ok, for obvious reasons, he is more like a parody of \"Two face\" who is one of Batman's nemesis and happens to have the powers of Professor X.\\n\\n\r\nMinami Azuma: as I describe her, she is like Mystique who has the powers of Nigh Crawler as well.\\n\\n\r\nOf course let's not forget the other support characters like:\\n\\n\r\nMurasaki's dad who is a parody of King Leonidas from the 300.\\n\\n\r\nThe Police Chief who looks like Jules Winnfield from 'Pulp Fiction.\"\\n\\n\r\nand the baldie guy of the anti esper task force, who looks like Charlie Wax from \"Paris with love.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo why would I give the story, art and Characters a poor score? Co'z there really is nothing original about them and I think I've mentioned that already.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Enjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nLet's see, I like the opening theme and I like the seiyuus who did the character's voices, PERIOD! The enjoyable part was seeing the antagonist getting beaten by the good guys and that's as good as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nDespite of all the plagiarisms that has been modified into a parody and despite of hoe good the sound and how enjoyable it is...unfortunately, I can only give it a 4, since I can't deny about this anime's lack of originality, but it was still good enough to be enjoyed and that's how the cookie crumbles in this anime.    \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The first thing I would think if I saw a flying penguin or fluorescent fishes in the air is ask myself if I am sane. Not these characters, they just believe and inmediately accept what they see. Anyway, jokes aside, these fishes seem to give people superpowers by going in a person. All you have to do is wishfor it (that's the impression I got, at least) and you get it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no real explanation as to how the superpowers work; in the first episode I even thought the superpowers were due to the accesories the villains were wearing. However, this disappears later on, so it might be the authors thought the same thing and wanted to make clear that the superpowers were the real deal. There also seems to be a very limited amount of superpowers. I think it does not make any sense for people to have the same skill, but this is, again, not explained. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is the powerups. It looks like less than a week of training makes you a pro fighter; if you are a genius, you can certainly make faster progress, but not this fast. Besides, all the people are not so bright, most people have mental disorders and some people just know everything; no explanation as to why they know. Are they psychics or something? This obviously makes no sense. \\n\\n\r\nAll right, I will just say it: this story does not make any sense. As the story progresses, events seem to have less connection to each other, which results in a bland story. One example is that the connection with the first episode is not well made, since statements that were done in the 1st episode are overwritten and forgotten. Finally, the last episode is an incredible ass-pull: everything \"ends\" in one single chapter, making everything that happened in this episode plain dumb.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo ESP has a cast of characters made in such a way that they made me laugh when I first saw them. We have Wolverine as \"Muscle Dad\", Aristotle as \"That yakuza guy\", the male main character (whom I liked most) as \"The youngster that has seen too much JoJo\" and the female MC as \"She who became super strong all of a sudden but is useless anyway\". Of course there are other characters; one of them is a villain who all of a sudden decided to become friends with the MC just to help fight against \"true\" evil. There is that girl with glasses that appears in EVERY anime who is quite useless and a boy with glasses who looks like an idiot. I will also write a line about mascots. There were three exotic mascots in this anime. One. every. 4. episodes. Personally, I don't think mascots make something more popular (I found them annoying), but it looks like the authors thought it was the key to success.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have vague pasts at best (even for the male MC), and the reason why they do what they do is not clear either. I guess the authors did not want to think too much about it, since all explanations have holes in them. I think that in the end the villains were the righteous ones. Personally, I won't trust a government that hires Jason (you know, that madman with the mask & bat) as policeman. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite good, but I have the impression that battle music is used in the wrong moments. And there is a serious issue with the first episode; the music is so ridiculously loud you can't hear the characters talking, which I found quite annoying. Or maybe I just downloaded the episode from the wrong place.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is allright, not really special. Almost all the side characters are incredibly ugly, which is quite funny. I guess all attention has to go to the main and secondary characters. But the mouths... my god. The shading on them is just weird, it feels like the characters are continually using \"smug face\".\\n\\n\r\nSo, Tokyo ESP is not something really good, but if you have some time to fill you might want to give it a shot. Just don't expect much of it. My rating is a 5.\\n\\n\r\nOh right, this is my first review, so please tell me what you thought about it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Do you love heroes? Do you believe in miracles? Well I hope you do because you're going to be hearing a lot of that if you're planning to watch this series. \r\n[STORY: 7/10]\r\nThe storyline is actually a very simple and traditional template of \"Good v.s. Evil\" and that's pretty much it. I'm giving extra credit for the fact that they have a pretty decent back-story to back up all the latter's actions. A good back-story never fails to hit a soft spot in me. So apart from that, there are moments of fighting (somewhat... at least they tried) which may or may not intrigue you.For me, the fighting scenes didn't really work out that well, it looked more like they did it for the sake of doing it, and it wasn't well produced at all. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 9/10]\\n\r\nOh, now this is BRILLIANT. Barring the OP and ED which can actually sound quite catchy after listening 12 times (or more), the background music was fantastic to say the least. Suitable music were played at suitable moments, and the tracks themselves were very good. This was especially the case in the last episode where every track I've heard throughout the past 11 episodes were actually played in somewhat quick succession. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 8/10]\\n\r\nDon't know 'bout the others, but this series actually features decent character development, especially for the lead female (obviously). A typical story about how a character overcomes her weaknesses and gains strengths from various sources to beat down the enemy. Oh, but the romance side of this series was irritating to me, if I need to criticize on an area. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL: 7/10]\\n\r\nSo taking into consideration other factors as well, I feel that this series deserves a 7 in my books. It's not too bad, but it ain't that great as well. But I'd think that it was worth a shot and worth the time. So check it out, guys!",

            "content": "So, small disclaimer before I start my review. For this anime, you most likely will have to shut of any kind of logic you might reconsider, you wont find any of it here. If you decided to give it a shot, then listen closely to its story as it will likely kick you of to the reaction of ,,Wait,What?'' when you miss a small detail. Now to to the real review..\r\nTokyo ESP had also been one of the newest Animes of the last season. It is the Story of a Highschool Girl called Rinka Urushiba. Now the first thing you'll see is that the atmospherereminds of old and brings you nostalgia from animes like ,,Detective Conan'' or ,,Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne''.\\n\r\nNow Rinka does seem to be the everyday Highschool-Girl until she meets a dear Friend to her. And from here on the story takes the crazy route.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of them meet and are able to see flying golden fishes, a living phenomenon that if it flies through you , you are going to get ESP-Powers. Rinka in this way did get the ability to go through objects and let objects pass through her. \\n\r\nThe Story then takes quick and fast turns, which is incredibly confusing if you are not very focusing. So if you just casually watch anime , without trying to invest yourself into a particular anime, this will not be a good choice for you.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes a few episodes to realise that what I already said, it takes good examples from old animes and unfortunately fails to recreate their glory and has some incredibly corny lines now and then. What never had gotten into me is the first approach of the villains-it is not menacing it is just a girl and a huge-hulk-like guy that dress up as samurai and are able to ,,guide'' those fishes. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound is a bit lost and query, you dont feel emotion with it as you normally should. Like an epic battle theme or to show the struggle. It is rather mediocre, so if you are an audible person like me, you wont like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, as I already said - are a bit corny and more stereotypical, there could have been much more done with the old man in the panda costume for example. It leaves much questions open like , why did the professor change to a hatred with such big extent. Why does his daughter keep following him, despite her wanting to change, is ESP lost with death ?\\n\\n\r\nOverall I didnt enjoy it that much, the only point where the emotion really hits you is when the doctors wife , after they were badly wounded, uses her esp and her last bit of power before she dies in his arms.\\n\\n\r\nAn overall point of 5-6. It didnt really go where I thought it would have been\\n\\n\r\nIf you decide to immerse yourself in this anime, do one thing, which is keeping an open view and do not try to find the red line to connect everything, it will be much more enjoyable then.",

The story at first seemed cool on how they stole a building and what not to create a new city from the rubles. But when they go to the past to explain everything then it just turns to crap.\r\nCharacters:\r\nFirst of all you hardly feel attached to any of them. The characters are just motivated by a crap love story that goes no where. How did asuma and white girl chick get love ties anyway? Itfelt so forced and out of place. The panda thats suppose to be a sensei is useless. I thought he was going to kickass but he never gets too. All the characters just arnt interesting.\\n\\n\r\nStory: What started off as a cool premise fell way short. The whole taking over tokyo thing could of gone way better. The ending made no sense what so ever. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Good but what the fucks wrong with some characters eyes. All black or white, shits ugly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: eww nothing memorable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat started off as a good series ended in a train crash.

            "content": "Tokyo Esp from the first episode was set up to be nothing more than a mediocre take on X-Men.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe plot is extremely clich\u00e9 and straight-forward: there are a group of humans with special abilities who take advantage of their power to take over the world, and there is the protagonists, who also happen to have special abilities who are going to use their abilities who take down the bad guys.\r\nThe first episode shows the peak of the show to try and grasp the viewers to see what's to come, but with this it meant that the show became very predictable to the viewer, andmade it a lucklustre experience.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 5\\n\r\nThe art was average at best. The character designs were very straight forward but i didn't feel like anything particularly stood out.  The animation was fluid and i didn't notice any hiccups in it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe only thing which i think stood out on the OST, was the ending theme 'Kyuusei Argyros' as it was fact paced, and so it fit in well with the show. The opening theme however i thought was very out of place as it was too happy go lucky, which really wasn't the vibe of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 1\\n\r\nThis has to be the biggest thing wrong with this show and the reason why i began to resent it.\\n\r\nRinka and Azuma are meant to be the protagonists , and to see them suffer so much and remain so helpless in unbearable. I mean they are unable to fend for themselves for the majority of the show and constantly get the crap beaten out of them.\\n\r\nAll of the other characters seem very flat and one dimensional.  The Professor was the only antagonist who explained their motives, and seemed justified.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI feel like i wasted several hours i'll never get back after watching this show. Everything was a mess and all over the place and i never grew to care for any of the characters at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nI feel like i'm being too nice giving this a 3 as it was a train-wreck from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're thinking of watching this show, please don't bother.

It fell short in all aspects of suspense, action, romance, etc. There were many plot holes and inconsistencies through T ESP that made in nearly unbearable. Much was left unexplained and you justfelt unsatisfied with the play off many scenes\r\nArt: 5\r\nFor the most part the art was ok, references, clean, good lighting, but as the anime progressed this seemed to become stale. The fight sceneswere always something that didn't work, and this became more apparent as the anime prolonged. The art for the characters also felt a bit like a copy and paste job, as many of the main characters had very similar faces.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was probably what saved this anime, it worked well and the team behind this deserve all the credit. It had that sense of action and the hype building that this anime deserved. Voice and sound-effects were also fine, par i would say. The sound did seem slightly too subtle and quiet in some scenes however, rather than an epic moment in a scene they set the scene rather than become a part of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:6\\n\\n\r\nAs before mentioned this anime contains references so a host of lovable characters were portrayed. The main character was relate-able and worked fine, but it was some of the supporting characters that fell flat. While Master Roushi and Peggy were fan favourites, others such as Kyotaro and the Professor were poor. Some characters were either completely useless, while offers goals and aims were absurd and illogical, making it hard to warm up to take them seriously. Others were introduced but with no stroy or introduction, they were just there, appeared.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:4\\n\\n\r\nInitially i enjoyed it but by episode 5 the plot was drab and the many flaws became apparent, it started to become so flawed that much of the anime left you confused or questioning the aims of the story and the characters\\n\\n\r\nOverall:5\\n\\n\r\nOverall i give it a 5, if you committed to more than 6 episodes it was watch-able, but if not its no must see. The plots many flaws are quickly identifiable and your left dissatisfied with the overall result. Tokyo ESP has its charms, but overall, its forgettable",

It is not perfect for a lot of reasons as : rushed story, characters that don't have a really good depth into them, between other things. Below I will list the grades I gave to each topic...\r\n-Story (8):\r\nThe story could have been really interesting, but it was rushed and had some plot holes that weren't explained, nothing that a second season couldn't have dealt with. The plot is about a girl named Rinka that all the sudden findsout that she acquired some kind of powers, witch are called ESP in the anime. At the same time a treat appears, a guy that calls himself professor is threatening all Tokyo and the human kind. She then decides to start fighting for the humans alongside her friends. As it is only a 12 episode anime there are a lot of explanation missing, but it is still a fun plot that could turn out to be really good.\\n\\n\r\n-Art (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not horrible but it is not great. It is like any other average action/supernatural anime.\\n\r\n-Sound (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening has a good music, nothing special but i enjoyed it. The anime it self has a good soundtrack that again, is nothing that would give it a 10 but it still works.\\n\\n\r\n-Character (6)\\n\\n\r\nI guess that an 26 episode anime would have fit this anime well. Characters are not developed enough, even though there are some flashbacks that makes you understand some of their purposes and histories. I felt like there are still some things missing. They are just average, nothing great.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment (8):\\n\\n\r\nI Enjoyed it. Even though it has its drawbacks it is still an enjoyable anime if you can look past its mistakes and just enjoy the show itself. It probably won't be between your favorites but still deserves a shot, my final score is a good (7)",

I've read all the 53 manga chapters available as of now , and let me tell from what I saw on the first episode there seemed to several new characters that never showed up on manga. Also based on what I read on others's reviews I'm even more disapointed, Azuma and the main villan were called generic as well other characters. wow that's so no true, in the manga they're all very interestin,g each has their backstory and dept they grow as the story procedes. You should definetely read the manga and skip the anime you won't regretit, it's really worth your time, plus the art is much more interesting than this generic new anime style.",

            "content": "\"Tokyo ESP\" is an anime that downgrades espers, turning them into whiny teenagers who feel the need to gripe about their unfortunate past.\r\nThis anime first captured my heart at the word 'ESP.' Unfortunately, I was to have many not-so-heart-capturing moments throughout watching the series.\r\n\"Tokyo ESP\" is a sci-fi staring Rinka, an extremely poor high school girl who lives with just her father in modern Tokyo. One day, on the way home from school, she chases a \"flying penguin\" to the top of New Tokyo Tower\u2014only to have \"fish swimming in the air\" suddenly appear before her. One of the fish goes through Rinka and givesher an extraordinary power beyond those of normal humans; the ability to slip through solid objects. She then meets Azuma, a boy wanting her to become a hero?\\n\\n\r\nRinka, a girl who's personality is constantly developing and yet getting no real development at all, is voiced by Ibuki Kido (Yume [Pupa]). Kido captures her stubborn, and annoying personality, do a wonderful job with an insecure girl who'd like to play the part of 'hero.' Azuma, the rowdy and determined boy, is voiced by Keisuke Koumoto (Raul Chaser [Yuushibu]). He has a deep voice, and make it sound like he really does want to become a hero to save the planet from evil foes. \\n\r\nI will flat out say I did not like this series. As soon as the first episode finished, I was left with many questions. Who are espers? Where did these bad guys come from? White Girl? What's that? And as soon as the second episode came out, my questions were dismissed, and thrown in the trash. It turns out the series started, jumping ahead to the climax, and later on went to introduce the characters. I have to say, I hate when series do this. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Other than that, the music was average, as well as the voice acting. The characters were bland as well as the storyline, and it basically turned into a kid's flick about 'justice.'\\n\\n\r\nIf you like simple story formats, despite being confusing through all twelve episodes, then this is the anime for you! However, if you are of a discerning mind and wouldn't want to bother yourself with a anime that is just going to make you regret your life decisions, turn back now! I repeat. Turn back now! That is all.\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5\\n\r\nThe story and overall message of the anime was fine, but it would have been nice to get a little more detail in there, a better plot line, better antagonists -- can the storyline just change all together?\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThe art was good. The animators certainly put more details out towards the end, but it was a fresh art style.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 7\\n\r\nThe music was alright, but there was nothing that really stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\r\nThe characters had average personalities with average development. I could hardly differentiate the teenagers from the adults. They all acted like immature teenagers to me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nMy hype for this anime was high, but after the first episode, everything just went downhill from there. On some days, I even tried to avoid watching it, even putting it off till the last minute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.8\\n\r\nThe anime would have been good if it had developed more, and gotten its priorities straight. I just felt that the pacing was off the entire time, and couldn't really get attached to the characters.",

            "content": "To be honest, I don't know how I should explain this series. Tokyo ESP is one of action series which I took because of the action genre only. As the series first made, my expectation is it would become a little good because of the promising almost-ending scene in the first episode. But, as the series went, my expectation came down and almost drowned into the deep of the sea with the ending.\r\nTokyo ESP is a series which told us a normal high school girl and got a special ability. The girls then become a hero who tried to save the town from another specialpeople. It's cliche premise, but I was hoping the plot would be different. It turned out I'm wrong.\\n\\n\r\nI hate the story most than another part. Many mystery at first, but a half-baked finishing for the mysteries. Not only the premise is cliche, the plot is really cliche too. The plot is a mess up, you might find it's so boring because of the repetition of same reaction of the characters. The ending is really bothering, because in my opinion, you won't need all of the 11 episodes just to reach the final plan of the antagonists. \\n\\n\r\nAnother boring part of the story is how the action came. The action is really messing up with you because of the unresolute main antagonists. The main antagonists would make you dejected. I don't know how many time I were punching my desk just to watch the another unresolute desicion of the main antagonists. I hate how the antagonists made. The reaction of another side character such as one of the main character's mom is really made the series worse. It's okay if the mom's reaction like that, but I didn't get how the development of this character can made her changed. It really turn off the series, she should have never made into one.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how bad the story and how the character not made well, I quite like the art. The art is one of the reason why I was choosing this series. The art is solid and use a good coloring. The background is made well. The art is good overall, but not the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED is quite good. The ED give you a little sense of gore of the series, a quite true if there were no sensor there. I don't think bad about the BGM, I think it's fine as it is.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the story and the characters, I don't really enjoy this series. Several times I wanted the story ended quickly, I was tired to see the character.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo ESP is a good example for a series with bad plot and the bad character. It can't be helped even with the art or another good part in this series. For you who want to watch a mediocre action series, this series is for you.",

            "content": "Tokyo ESP is focused on the struggles of high school student Rinka Urushiba and several others who are granted esper abilities from mysterious fish that enter their bodies. While making sense of their unique predicaments, Rinka and her comrades have to deal with an enemy organization trying to organize an esper resistance against humanity by using the mysterious fish to force people into becoming espers.\r\nMy thoughts on this series as a whole are a bit mixed. The series starts out like Berserk and Ga-Rei: Zero where you are tossed immediately into the main conflict of the series without any buildup before the second episode takesevents before said conflict starts off to show how it got to that point. I've started to get irked when titles pull this type of plot structure off because it risks turning off first-time viewers of the series who have no clue what they are in for. But setting that gripe aside for now, the second episode and onward do a great job for the most part at establishing its characters and building up its plot to show the characters reacting in varying ways to gaining their esper powers. Established characters have their motivations explored for how they utilize their newly acquired esper powers and why they protect or oppose humanity utilizing them. The series also explores the origins of the mysterious fish that grant espers their power and how this knowledge is being abused by the enemy esper organization. In addition, the animation for the series is quite impressive with highly-detailed scenic shots and character designs, as well as fluid and smoothly animated action sequences that are a treat to see in fights that break out between espers and/or military and police forces.\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside praises, the series does come with its fair share of issues. Being based on a shounen manga series, the idealist bent that many titles of the demographic have in presenting their characters has a bad habit of coming up quite often throughout the series. This is quite notable with our series lead, Rinka, who seems single-mindedly interested in upholding justice and being a hero, which makes her character seem two-dimensional and hard to connect with as a result. The series also gets in the bad habit of seeming to get a bit too preachy and heavy-handed with the whole \"being a hero\" belief in opposing the enemy esper organization at large. Not helping matters is also the inconclusive ending as another enemy appears to enter the conflict with little established about them and still being at large, a typical issue with many anime given the title's manga source material was still ongoing at the time Tokyo ESP began airing in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tokyo ESP decent plot structure and buildup in focusing on how its major characters respond to gaining esper powers and what side they will take against an enemy esper organization, that gets somewhat marred by the typical idealist bent that many shounen titles fall into and its inconclusive ending. Still, it is a decent sci-fi action/ drama title that is worth tracking down if such titles catch your interest.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Pay attention to the start of episode 1 and you'll catch a cameo appearance from Ga-Rei Zero's Kagura and Yomi. For those not in the know, both Tokyo ESP and Ga-Rei Zero are made by the same mangaka, Hajime Segawa.",

Tokyo ESP is about a teenage girl who become an esper and later on become stronger in order to protect people and becoming a hero. When I heard the manga will be animated, I am so freaking happy since I\u2019m a fan of its manga. But, the anime adaption seems fast pace adaptation, and doesn\u2019t follow up its original story although the chronology of time is same, so you would want to read the manga (absolutely, do it!!) fromthe start because the story has a potential to become much more awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe synopsis follows up Rinka, a teenage girl who lives a normal life until she has a power to become an esper. After that, she meets a boy named Azuma and together fights the evil that come disturbing Tokyo. The story seem plain with good versus evil, but as story progress which is focus about Rinka having train to become stronger in each fight she has lost and Azuma with its background story. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation seems ok in my opinion, although there is some fight scene which looks like awkward. But, other than that, it was good with the background building, power display animation, and the teleportation scene was awesome to me.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal soundtrack in this anime was okay, like when they change the music to make the fight scene more impact or when the sad scenes more immerse. Other than that, it was average.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion, it was good but I do not recommend for those who have read the manga first, because the anime will crush the hype from the manga. For those who don\u2019t read the manga, I do recommend to watch since it will give you a little bit insight about the story, and I still want to recommend reading the manga after watching the anime. For that, I give 8/10, although it was not good enough to satisfy me, it was still good anime adaption. \\n",

The anime, therefore, garnered an \"8\" overall from me, but to be truthful, it's a 7.5. Seeing how there are so many copyright violations that didn't allow for broadcast in NA, I didn't have high hopes. The story is to similar to X-Men and Star Wars and more, but it manages to create a decent enough atmosphere and setting. Rinka, the main character, is a mixed bag, but manages to hold the story at a decent level, andkeep some reality (such as when she gets pulverized in her early battles). The show is simply what it is, average at best. The second arc, in the manga, is much more fleshed out and more intense, and extremely enjoyable, making these 12 episodes look as only a prologue for the real thing, and making me crave for an anime continuation for a much better second season, that isn't just silly and brain-mush. And if the show didn't have the amazing first episode intro, it would have done much more to keep people like myself engrossed and slowly drawn into the story.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\n-Average, but good brain-mush\\n\r\n-Copyright issues, but meh\\n\r\n-Story, setting, atmosphere=meh, characters=believable, if not silly\\n\r\n-Watch if Strike The Blood, another brain-mush anime, was enjoyable.",

From the get-go, the series attempts to depict the story as with other stories; having an event that occurs in the future end it getting shown in the first episode.\r\nNow, this is a tool often used in stories which I am fine with if it is done properly. This anime did it in an appalling manner to where I was nearly turned-off from the firstepisode. The purpose of telling a story in such a way is to bring up question and intrigue the audience. This anime made the mistake of throwing in too many names and pieces of information that normally we would know later in the series. It felt like series that you jumped into the 100th episode and are completely baffled (not in a good way). \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was what kept me going with the slight hint of some sort of hope. Unfortunately, the pacing continued to where it felt like scenes were missing and dialogue felt off. A major contention I had with the series was the lack of proper transitions within the scenes which leads to losing all interest. I had hoped it might turn into something alright but I just could not bear waiting any longer.",

If so it's just like Plot drift.\r\nSecond Assumptions is the story having Reverse chronology andof course timeskip, coz the story is already near the second arc, where story is about Tokyo as well as the fate of the other ESP users after ESP law passed, and then Rinka Urushiba and Ky\u014dtar\u014d Azuma take part on Human Trafficking and International Crimes and of course it isn't ordinary human but ESP users.\\n\r\nI can conclude that this is just doesn't good because the story will not much episode, whereas the quality of story is great because there are element such as International and Political Issue, Nevertheless there are people who argue it is just like X-Men, of yeah cause the story is just fighting and ESP users (having weird power) and I worried if it make a great distinction than its story in manga which already great, but i hope Minami can be together with Ky\u014dtar\u014d to defeated other enemy as well as to save Minami father.",

            "content": "I don't know what to say. This anime is one of few to reach a new low. I usually reserve 2 and 1's for shows that scream, \"No effort,\" or are plain offensive. This anime... I don't know where to begin. I can tell there was actual effort put in, and I never felt that it offended me in anyway. But it's still is so bad I can't believe it even now.\r\nAt least, with Skelter Heaven and Mars of Destruction, they were only one episode length long. Tokyo ESP is twelve episodes. And nowhere in those twelve episodes are any shred of dignity. I wasembarrassed to have finished this. Everyone I knew told me how they dropped it after two or three episodes because of its atrocities. Maybe I was foolishly hoping it would get better as I force-fed myself.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is an origin story of the \"White Girl\" and her band of crime fighters. Although, it starts off near the end of the story because seventy-five percent of this anime is a flashback. And also flashbacks within a flashback just to add some depth, I guess. It really is hard to remember specific details of the plot due to how unimportant most of it was. Overall, it was forgettable and uninteresting. What was memorable was the \"Deus Ex Machina\" at the end! Boy, was that memorable!\\n\\n\r\nWhen boiled down, this is a show about superheroes fighting villains. What is probably the single most important thing for any type of media or literature with superheroes in them? Character development! Batman wouldn't be very interesting if he didn't grow as a character from his past to his present. In Tokyo ESP, this is practically nonexistent! Literally, no one ever changes. There might be that occasional flashback within a flashback that tells the history of a character but that is it. Character development isn't why or how a character is, it is why or how he or she grows from how he or she normally was.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is an animation, I'll talk about the art style and quality. I feel bad to have to kick a dog while it's down. The art style is rather bland and uninspired. The art quality is the icing on the cake, though. It is utter garbage. Characters look stiff, scenes show signs of laziness, animation is inconsistent, and the CGI is as dreadful as Skelter Heaven's. It's just not good.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the best part of the anime! The music was fun to hear... for the first two times. Yes, the music is catchy and pumps up the audience, but it can only be played so much. There are many shows that use the same music for the \"big finishing move\" in multiple scenes, but the \"big finishing move\" music in Tokyo ESP is on a ten second loop. It will play the same tune over and over every ten seconds five minutes at a time at almost every fight scene.\\n\\n\r\nSo, that's pretty much all there is to it. Tokyo ESP is a downright terrible anime, and it makes me feel icky inside to have had the experience of watching it.",

            "content": "How can you take a bad-ass setting like the X-Men and make something this crappy?!\r\nIf the series had one problem (you'd wish...) that would be its predictability. If it had 2 problems the second would be being too tryhard. If the series had 3 problems... You can see how this will go.\r\nWarning: The first episode actually starts hardcore badassery with people getting blown to bits by terrorist mut... Espers, the goverment falling and complete chaos everywhere. DON'T GET TRICKED. It all goes downhill from there.\r\nThe scenario is predictable and cliche'd as hell. Obviously it's hard to be 100% original but good god man, at leasttry. A miserable 10% would actually make this watchable! The anime's main story is that mut... ESPers, people with special powers, want to rule humanity and impose their rule. So throughout the series all they will be doing is mindlessly (and I do mean mindlessly) attacking people for no apparent reason, successfully turning raging crowds against them. To save the humans 2 ESPers arrive. Our protagonist... Our protagonist... Unbelievable... I watched this 2 hours ago and I've already forgotten her name. Anyway our protagonist, the white haired girl, and her... (Friend? Mendor? Complete stranger with no affiliation to her whatsoever? Yeah, that's more like it.) friend Azuma. The 2 seem madly in love with one-another, always thinking about what the other would do...\\n\\n\r\nAnd here comes the second, perhaps worse, major flow of the anime. The tryhard part. Instead of actually showing them develop a relationship the mangaka just makes them keep thinking of each other constantly to rub in our face that they are both just/righteous/care for each other. The problems with this are:  1) It's lazy as hell. 2)The \"overly faithful\" thing works only when it's going one-direction. Either the white-hair or Azuma needs to think for himself for once. 3) After the first 30 times IT'S ANNOYING AS F$%^. The show is also tryharding on establishing rivarly between the white-hair and the antagonist, the immouto character (she's no sister to anyone and is the same age as the main leads but you will keep considering her the \"little sister\" character. By the way she is the only somewhat likeable member of the cast). In addition to her, the show will also tryhard to show the wiseness of old people, how \"evil and deranged\" the villain is (by the way the villain is a weak middle-aged guy with psychic powers that calls himself \"The Professor\"... Blow me.), how strong the bonds between family are and so on, all by non-stop rubbing them in our face.\\n\\n\r\nThe graphics are really awkard (and not in a good way) and the music is forgettable at best. The only character you will actually want to see on-screen will be the immouto but what little screentime she gets is usually spent saying \"Damn the white-hair, she ruined our plans again!\" (what \"plans\" by the way? Randomly killing people off the streets isn't considered a \"plan\".)\\n\\n\\n\r\nWATCH X-MEN INSTEAD, NOT WORTH ANYONE'S TIME.",

There's great pacing, great action and the story plot excites you. However after the first episode we plummet downwards to a long stretched flashback. After episode 4 I became disinterested. The anime starts to drag and the quality of the art seems to drop somewhat. For that reason I'll rate it a 3/10 and if the ending is good i may push it up to a 4. Either way I'd avoid watching this anime.",

I heavily recommended reading all of the reviews beforehand (IF you even decide to tackle this beast afterwards). I can't even begin to fathom how frustrated I would have been, if I HADN'T known it was going to be so lackluster. I'll spare youthe nitty-gritty- others before me have captured most, if not all, of the inherent failures of this show. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, if you need something on in the background to help pass the time (I enjoyed folding my clothes to this show, because it lacked so much depth that I could easily devote half of my attention), then look no further~ Then, you can come back and enjoy the spectacle created by previous critques' comments- it's a good time, really.",

            "content": "Story: If you have seen X-Men, then there are quite a lot of similarities. I personally liked that the story had a badass heroine, good amount of action, and slight romance. However, the pacing is HUGE ISSUE. I all for fast-paced, get-to-the-point animes, but the whole concept in the anime needs more time to actually perfect the story. Also, all the fights seem short (because every episode is 24 minutes) so it seems like it doesn't add much action to the story.\r\nArt: Awful. It's literally okay at some points, downright TERRIBLE at others. \r\nSound:-\r\nCharacter: Not bad at all. I can tell you that all animeswill have similar character personalities, but I personally thought the heroine wasn't over-the-top annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime is harshly criticized (and at points I can see why), but overall it's enjoyable. The story is cool, and if you overlook the bad pacing and art you might enjoy it. I feel that this anime is more for binging, for those who don't have anything else to watch, or those who want a badass female as the lead. Wish it had season 2 though:)",

            "content": "Tokyo, Japan, is currently under a gang attack consisted of peculiar espers who wants to rule the nation based on their hatred and egoistical evil desires. These humans use their super power dedicatedly to eliminate those who oppose 'em, brute force everywhere to government and innocent citizens, while the government itself hasn't reach a good conclusion and categorize all esper to be overpowered. Thus appear a silver-haired girl that stand on normal humans side as an esper, well-known as \"Shiroi Shoujo\", after few of her actions helped citizens recognized by many. This Shiroi Shoujo itself has its own problems regarding this esper thingy.It tries to bring mysterious atmosphere but none of it works. The standout evident is about glowing fish phenomenon. The concept of glowing fishes which gives human super power ability is not superb too, It doesn't make any sense since the show appeared so plain even if the scenes shown dark colouring and horrible things occurred. The explanation of it wasn't satisfying enough as the slow emergence of boring fact\u2014glowing fish phenomenon.\\n\r\n    Well, on the other hand, aside from such harsh battles of supranatural powers, it does have romantic essence as the complement, which is no need to ask, also unsuccessful and unnecessary aspect to add. The way the show tried to bring romantic side made the point of this story fade. In the middle of the show, I began to conclude that these vicious fights really got guts to mingle with childish story. The spirit of being the hero of justice, the simple logic way of characters thinking to be the saviors, and the doki-doki / romantic thingy to lure more and somewhat pitying the characters\u2014looking at too many sad moments as the drawer. The mission of rescuing the captives marked the ending of problematic fight, after it's revealed the man who adopts major character\u2014like a swirling around in a dot only\u2014started his plan as the mastermind of all the fuss.\\n\\n\r\n    From the explanation above, do not imagine that the fight would be damn good, because the graphic is so basic. I couldn't find any clue that the visualization here is the core of enjoyment, the graphic is not detailed even if the characters are on battle field.\\n\\n\r\n    Sadly, the characterization part is the supporting aspect of worsen the story. Sometimes we can accept humanly if minor characters are a mess or pain in the ass, but if it's the main characters do, then it's a doom.\\n\\n\r\n    Straight to the point, the OP is sung by Faylan \"Tokyo Zero Hearts (\u6771\u4eac\u30bc\u30ed\u30cf\u30fc\u30c4)\", and the ED theme is sooo gore errr metal (?) by Yousei Teikoku, \"Kyuusei Argyros (\u6551\u4e16\u0386\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u00f3\u03db)\". I would say these two theme songs are less than average. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI managed to watch the show til the very end, and wonder why. My rate itself is 5. It's somehow has meaning to strengthen friendship or relationship as the bond that ties our motivation to support each other. But this meaning itself vaguely seen as the main characters are too weak emotionally and often collapsed or mind destroyed by the unavoidable stressors.\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nStory is jumbled, sometimes so slow, sometimes so damn fast, with uncertain direction 'til it's almost at the end. Also too many unnecessary dramatic parts\\n\r\nI found no single clue about the development of characterization\\n\r\nBelow average theme songs",

The whole anime was a mixture of other animes, even the characters. I couldn't find any originality.  Story (2/10)\r\nIt has decent graphics overall, but it also has giant mistakes in it. The characters look like dead people, when i watched them, they made me feel they are dead, or puppets. No emotions on their faces, fake smiles...etc. The buildings and colours were okay. Art (4/10)\r\nThe characters, as I wrote before,are a clump of cliches. Even the hairstyles are stolen from other series, not just the personalities, and the main characteristics. The main characters are empty, bot even one is original. Character (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I like the main idea, but I hate what the makers made out of it. They just made a BORING ,mainstream, pointless, template anime. There are two reasons why i won't give it pathetic score. First, because it has potential. Second, if I could watch it until the end, it worth at least \"2\". Overall !(2/10)!\\n\\n\r\nIf you wanna watch it, watch it. If you like it, like it. It's only  my personal opinion, you don't have to agree. :)\\n\\n\\n",
